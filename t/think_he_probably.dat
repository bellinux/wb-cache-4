5000|$|Dillon's long-time {{collaborator}} Garth Ennis {{paid tribute}} to Dillon thus: [...] "The last time I saw Steve was late last Saturday night in New York, walking down fifth avenue to his hotel after saying goodnight outside Foley's. It {{could have been the}} end of any one of a thousand nights. It’s not a bad last memory to have. Steve was best man at my wedding and my good and dear friend. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> taught me more about what that word means than anyone else." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mystery writer Erle Stanley Gardner, among others, {{wondered}} why Harvey {{did not kill}} Terry Jo. Gardner speculated that Harvey may have wanted to be caught and punished. Survival psychologist Richard Logan theorised that Harvey had intended to kill her, but when she accidentally dropped the rope connected to his dinghy, {{he was forced to}} dive overboard in order to prevent its floating away without him, and thus left her alive on the sinking ship. [...] Many years later, she stated in a television interview with Matt Lauer, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> thought I would go down with the ship." ...|$|E

In the audition, characters dressed as skinheads swear repetitively {{at each other}} and a folding table is kicked over. Afterwards, Dexter's agent Mary (Anna Massey) muses, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> mad ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "I don't {{know what}} he'll <b>think</b> NOW. <b>He</b> DID <b>think</b> you were frightened; but {{you told him}} you were not. However, it isn't {{important}} what <b>he</b> <b>thinks.</b> <b>Probably</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> I'm your long-lost brother. It {{had a kind of}} family look." ...|$|R
50|$|Biographers {{disagree}} whether Schiemer {{first made}} contact with Anabaptists in Nürnberg. Schiemer may have made arrangements to travel to Nikolsburg in Moravia, where Balthasar Hubmaier was an important Anabaptist leader. Here he witnessed the May 1527 disputation between the Stäbler (shepherd's staff) und Schwertler (sword) Anabaptist groups. While the Stäbler {{under the leadership of}} Hans Hut held a position of absolute nonviolence, Hubmeier and the Schwertler professed that Christians were permitted defend themselves and others with the sword. It is unknown which of these positions Schiemer adopted. Some biographers <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> adopted Hubmeier’s view, because later in Vienna he was reluctant to accept Hans Hut.|$|E
5000|$|According to Ament, {{the lyrics}} for [...] "State of Love and Trust" [...] {{are based on}} what Vedder took from {{watching}} the film, and added, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> took a heavier angle on what the movie was about {{than a lot of}} people will, but that's Eddie, which is a beautiful thing." [...] According to Cameron Crowe, director of Singles, the song is [...] "about battling with your instincts in love." [...] Before a performance of the song at Pearl Jam's September 8, 1998 show in East Rutherford, New Jersey at Continental Airlines Arena, Vedder introduced it as [...] "a song about being faithful." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alvarez {{recalled}} that [...] "From my end of it, I guess I perceived {{him to be}} losing motivation. There's things I regret about that situation, {{but at the end}} of the day I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably,</b> one way or the other, would have moved on, and I probably forced his hand a little, maybe." [...] "At the end I just wanted so badly to go do something else", said Reynolds in 2013. [...] "Every decision I've made since I left the band has been the wrong decision. On the one hand, I wanted my independence. On the other hand, ironically, that's why I'm a barback now." [...] Chad Price replaced Reynolds as the band's lead singer.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{young guy}} we've been talking with for a long time, and who has been to games {{and we have a}} {{relationship}} with because his uncle works for the Rosemont Police Department...I think it's a prospect who has grown up around DePaul basketball. I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> a fan and someone who has been a fan for some time, since we have played in Rosemont for the last 30 years.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{recording}} the album, Abrams had mentioned {{an interest in}} working with Ellen DeGeneres, who judged American Idol the year before he competed. Iain Pirie and Martin Terefe also served as executive producers on the album. Commenting on Terefe, who produced many of Jason Mraz's albums, Abrams said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>probably</b> the nicest, but weirdest guy I've ever met...If something’s not working, he’ll let you down very easily and if something’s good, he’ll be your biggest cheerleader".|$|R
2500|$|Maddux {{was also}} known for {{intensely}} studying hitters in preparation for his starts. He would often watch hitters take their warmup swings or read their body language to gauge their mentality. Teammate Tom Glavine said, [...] "I think the hitters <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{can go back and}} recall every pitch he has ever thrown. That's not the case, but I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> better at remembering things than most people are. He's definitely better {{in the course of the}} game at making adjustments on a hitter based on what he's seen, whether it's one swing or a guy's last at-bat." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marvin Hamlisch said of Kander and Ebb, [...] "All I can {{remember}} is that working with Fred Ebb {{was a lot of}} fun. You know, John Kander and Fred Ebb wrote as a team. So, most of the songs that were written when we usually worked with Liza were written by them. However, when it came to doing arrangements and working on the act and putting things together, I loved working with Fred Ebb. We had the best time. He and I were really good friends. It was just delightful. He was a very, very smart man. And he was very funny. And he was very caustic. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> wrote for her better than anyone in the world could have written for her. He just understood her so well." ...|$|E
5000|$|Physically, Parker is {{described}} in the opening paragraphs of The Hunter as [...] "big and shaggy, with flat square shoulders... His hands, swinging curve-fingered at his sides, {{looked like they were}} molded of brown clay by a sculptor who thought big and liked veins. His hair was brown and dry and dead, blowing around his head like a poor toupee about to fly loose. His face was a chipped chunk of concrete, with eyes of flawed onyx. His mouth was a quick stroke, bloodless." [...] When asked about who he would cast as Parker, Westlake stated: [...] "Usually I don’t put an actor’s face to the character, though with Parker, in the early days, I did <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> looked something like Jack Palance. That may be partly because you knew Palance wasn’t faking it, and Parker wasn’t faking it either. Never once have I caught him winking at the reader." [...] In the The Man With the Getaway Face, Parker has plastic surgery in an attempt to evade The Outfit's retribution, so he's no longer recognizable to most who knew him before, though his general appearance (and the impression it makes on others) seems to be largely unchanged.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{attacked}} by Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley for his close relationship with Republican Governor Bob Ehrlich, who noted, [...] "He works very hard to give the Ehrlich administration cover. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> prides himself at {{the degree to which}} he helps cover up the poor performance of the governor." [...] Schaefer added to his troubles when he announced, [...] "I don't want to adjust to another language. This is the United States. I think to the United States should adjust to us," [...] {{at a meeting of the}} Maryland Board of Public Works, prompted by an experience he recently had at a McDonald's restaurant. He noted later that his remarks would cause him to [...] "likely lose all the Latin votes and all the other votes." [...] Another controversy arose in February 2006 when Schaefer made inappropriate remarks to an aide at another meeting of the Board of Public Works. As the aide brought him a cup of tea, he watched her walk away before requesting that she [...] "walk again." [...] Not long after the incident, Schaefer apologized to the aide, but opponent Peter Franchot remarked, [...] "He's apologizing for the negative publicity rather than his inappropriate behavior." ...|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{bluegrass}} {{singer and}} mandolin player Ricky Skaggs {{was influenced by}} Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band {{at the high school}} in Martha, KY. He stated, [...] "I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong. He was so influential: I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> the only musician that had a whole style of music named after his band." ...|$|R
50|$|On September 4, a Massachusetts physician, Rick Sacra, was airlifted from Liberia to {{be treated}} in Omaha, Nebraska at the Nebraska Medical Center. Working for Serving In Mission (SIM), he was the third U.S. missionary to {{contract}} Ebola. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> contracted Ebola while performing a caesarean section on a patient {{who had not been}} diagnosed with the disease. While in hospital, Sacra received a blood transfusion from Brantly, who had recently recovered from the disease. On September 25, Sacra was declared Ebola-free and released from the hospital.|$|R
50|$|Later, Charlie Brown with Linus dials on the phone, {{attempting}} {{to call the}} Girl. However, {{on the other side}} of the line, Marcie picks up. Charlie Brown realizes he dialed the wrong number. He tells that to Marcie, and Marcie says she understands, and she <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> meant to call Peppermint Patty. She tells him lucky for him, that Patty is here. She gives the phone to Patty. Peppermint Patty asks Charlie Brown if he called to invite her to his school's Valentine's dance, but before Charlie Brown can answer her, she accepts the offer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heaven knows! It isn't his affair, really. If {{there were}} any charge against me--well, you see, there'd {{have to be an}} {{extradition}} order. I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will <b>probably</b> lay the facts before Scotland Yard and let them do what they choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shouldn't think so. For {{one thing}} I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{recognized}} me. <b>Probably</b> doesn't know me by sight, {{and he was}} fast asleep, too. No, I fancy I'm all right.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Fellow Magpie Len Thompson {{described}} Greening in 2006, [...] "Now {{we can say}} he was of {{the style}} we see today - with that great running skill... I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> like a Robert Harvey ... he had magnificent balance, he used both sides of his body and he had this big ticker to run and cover ground." ...|$|R
50|$|Metapontum {{must have}} been one of the cities he {{captured}} from the Messapians, for otherwise an alliance with the city would not have been possible. Michael P. Fronda argues the mention of an alliance with Metapontum is curious and implies conquest rather than liberation from the Messapians. Tarentum probably would have welcomed the seizure of Metapontum and Heraclea initially because it gave them an opportunity to extend their dominion over those two cities. Later on the relations between Tarentum and Alexander clearly became strained however. Strabo writes that Alexander tried to transfer a panhellenic festival from Heraclea to Thurii out of enmity with Tarentum. Furthermore, he claims the defeat of Alexander at Pandosia was blamed on Tarentum. Ian Spence <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> no longer received support from Tarentum when he was at Pandosia.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the BBC in September 2010, Ben Myers said that he never expected the Manics to like the book, adding that [...] "All I could have hoped for is that they could accept or appreciate what it is I'm trying to do. I have to accept anything the Manic Street Preachers say about it, but I think the comments that I've heard have been fair enough. Given some of the things Nicky Wire has said in the past about some people I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> been quite charitable. It could have been far, far worse." [...] Myers also said that he had written to the Edwards family, explaining why he wrote the book and [...] "a little bit about myself and about the influence their son had on me and people like me," [...] and sent a similar letter to the Manics.|$|R
500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{stated that}} he wanted an [...] "epic" [...] quality to the Christmas special. The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his {{previous}} companions; Moffat said that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> reached the {{point in his life}} where he's saying, 'Friendship for me is just postponed bereavement— I want to be on my own for a while'." [...] Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen {{at the onset of the}} episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) in 1963 and the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) in 2005. He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s, but rejected by the production team at the time. Continuing the theme introduced with the series' first five episodes, [...] "The Snowmen" [...] was promoted like a movie. A movie poster was released in the Radio Times, showing the Doctor and Clara ascending the ladder to the TARDIS.|$|R
2500|$|In 1938 Stewart had a brief, tumultuous {{romance with}} Hollywood queen Norma Shearer, whose husband, Irving Thalberg, head of {{production}} at MGM, had {{died two years}} earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director Frank Capra in 1938, when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to star in You Can't Take It With You. Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in Navy Blue and Gold (1937). The director had recently completed several well received films, including It Happened One Night (1934), and {{was looking for the}} right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as Clark Gable, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for, but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>probably</b> the best actor who's ever hit the screen." ...|$|R

500|$|Jagger's knighthood {{also caused}} some {{friction}} with bandmate Keith Richards, who was irritated when Jagger accepted the [...] "paltry honour". Richards {{said that he}} did not want to take the stage with someone wearing a [...] "coronet and sporting the old ermine. It's not what the Stones is about, is it?" [...] Jagger retorted: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would <b>probably</b> like to get the same honour himself. It's like being given an ice creamone gets one and they all want one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He said so, squire, at {{the time}} he was smarting with the pain of a severe bite; and I <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> meant no more than a man who, under the same circumstances, would say, 'Confound the dog!' or even a {{stronger}} oath." ...|$|R
60|$|NICHOLLS (seeing Carmody's uneasiness, with revengeful satisfaction). Oh, he'll {{do what he}} says, don't worry! You'll make {{a mistake}} if you <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> bluffing. It'd <b>probably</b> get in all the papers about you refusing. Every one would be down on you. (As a last jab--spitefully.) You might even lose your job over it, people would be so sore.|$|R
6000|$|... "It will {{certainly}} do him no harm. Now, {{you had better}} tell the chief that you are to have the money. I should <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> will <b>probably</b> send a trooper with you as your orderly. Certainly, he {{has no reason to}} have a higher opinion of the Portuguese than you have." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was never}} on {{intimate}} terms with John F. Kennedy," [...] Folliard {{said in a}} 1967 interview, [...] "but knew him reasonably well." [...] After Kennedy was elected president, Folliard [...] "wrote a story saying that the talk about Kennedy buying his victory was nonsense." [...] Folliard himself said, [...] "My admiration of Kennedy is just without limit. I just <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> the most brilliant President of our time." [...] Folliard accepted Pierre Salinger's claim that Kennedy had written [...] "the whole of his Inaugural Address," [...] which Folliard called [...] "the best Inaugural speech I ever heard." ...|$|R
60|$|My brother's farm {{is but a}} wretched lease, but I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will <b>probably</b> weather out the {{remaining}} seven years of it; and after the assistance which I have given, and will give him, to keep the family together, I think, by my guess, I shall have rather better than two hundred pounds, and instead of seeking, what is almost impossible at present to find, a farm that I can certainly live by, with so small a stock, I shall lodge this sum in a banking-house, a sacred deposit, excepting only the calls of uncommon distress or necessitous old age.|$|R
6000|$|... "Altogether! I <b>think</b> that <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> did pawn his commission. That is bad, but it isn't so very bad. As for {{the other}} charge against him, I doubt it." [...] So said Lord Burton, and Sir Harry {{determined}} that the accusation should go for nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{was this}} way--I <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> was <b>probably</b> sick, and didn't {{feel a little bit}} like sorting mail when I asked for it. He sure was aggravatin', and I cussed him good and plenty. I reckon I had a clove on my tongue that day, and was irritable, and when he lit onto me, I was hot as a hornet, and went away {{swearing}} to get square." [...] He braced himself for the plunge. [...] "That was my gang of cowboys that came hell-roaring around the night I met you. They were under my orders to scare your uncle out of his hole, and I was going to rope him." ...|$|R
50|$|Among {{his contemporaries}} {{in the college}} were Joseph Addison and Henry Sacheverell, men who were in those times friends, and who both adopted Yalden to their intimacy. Yalden {{continued}} throughout his life to <b>think</b> as <b>probably</b> <b>he</b> thought at first, yet did not lose the friendship of Addison.|$|R
5000|$|... 3 time World's Strongest Man {{winner and}} 2 time IPF world {{champion}} Bill Kazmaier once stated, [...] "The first time I {{went to a}} powerlifting meet and saw Larry, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was <b>probably</b> six or seven on his World Championships and he was pretty much-how would you say?-a god in powerlifting. He could go to any class that he wanted to. He could pretty much lift whatever weight {{on the day he}} wanted to." [...] 4 time IPF powerlifting champion and 1979 World's Strongest Man winner Don Reinhoudt said of Larry, [...] "I look at Larry, an idol to all of us here-nine time champion and Larry will always be the legend of all time to us." ...|$|R
