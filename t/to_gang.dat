5|$|An {{example of}} {{territory}} was the Bridgeport community area, an ethnic Irish neighborhood {{just west of}} the Black Belt. The Irish had long patrolled their neighborhood boundaries against all other ethnic groups, especially African Americans. One group known as the Hamburg Athletic Club, whose members included a 17-year-old Richard J. Daley, future mayor of Chicago, contributed <b>to</b> <b>gang</b> violence in the area.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gang Toi was {{the first}} set-piece action between Australian and Viet Cong forces in the Vietnam War. Australian {{casualties}} included two missing (presumed killed) and six wounded, and {{despite the efforts of}} their comrades, the bodies of the Australian dead were unable to be recovered. Against these losses the Viet Cong had suffered at least six killed, one wounded and five captured. Confronted by an equal sized force, dug-in in well-prepared defences, the Australians had performed creditably enough even if they had been forced to withdraw, leaving the battlefield to the Viet Cong. Despite inflicting heavier casualties on the communists than they had suffered themselves, many of the Australians were depressed at having left two soldiers behind, and they longed for the opportunity to return <b>to</b> <b>Gang</b> Toi. In 2007, more than 40 years after the fighting, an Australian Vietnam veteran—Jim Bourke, MG—and a team of volunteers successfully located the remains of both Parker and Gillson. They had been hastily buried together in a weapon pit the day after the battle by Viet Cong soldiers, and {{with the assistance of the}} Australian and Vietnamese governments they were subsequently returned to Australia for burial.|$|E
5|$|Young {{was born}} in Compton, California, the first child of Theodore and Verna Young. His middle name, Romelle, is derived from his father's amateur R singing group, The Romells. His parents married in 1964, {{separated}} in 1968, and divorced in 1972. His mother later remarried and had three children: sons Jerome and Tyree (both deceased) and daughter Shameka. In 1976, Young began attending Vanguard Junior High School in Compton, but due <b>to</b> <b>gang</b> violence, he transferred to the safer suburban Roosevelt Junior High School. He lived a few years in Carson during his middle school years. Young has told that he was mostly raised by his grandmother in New Wilmington Arms housing project in Compton. His mother later married Warren Griffin, whom she met at her new job in Long Beach, which added three stepsisters and one stepbrother to the family; the stepbrother would eventually become rapper Warren G.|$|E

25|$|After the American Civil War, {{there was}} an influx of people who moved to New York city. The tenements that were built became overcrowded quickly. Many who lived in this congested, poverty-stricken area turned <b>to</b> <b>gang</b> life. Following Prohibition, {{implemented}} in 1919, the district's many warehouses were ideal locations for bootleg distilleries for the rumrunners who controlled illicit liquor. At {{the start of the}} 20th century, the neighborhood was controlled by gangs, including the violent Gopher Gang led by One Lung Curran and later by Owney Madden.|$|E

5000|$|Honduran police {{officers}} can arrest and subsequently place in prison anyone at all related <b>to</b> <b>gangs</b> through indicators such as tattoos, baggy clothing, or even typical gang positions on street corners. To avoid being detected by {{police officers}}, members of gangs {{have been forced}} to change their territorial strategies. Since tattoos are such an easy way <b>to</b> identify a <b>gang</b> member, gangs {{have been forced to}} wear clothes covering their tattoos and to adopt a more casual appearance. [...] Tattoos are significant <b>to</b> <b>gangs</b> because they mark each member as property, just as graffiti marks a group's territory in the context of cities. Each tattoo tells a gang member's story and each has its own meaning, but the appearance given off serves to indicate dominance, which explains partly why these men can be so influential.|$|R

Compared to the other districts in Belize, Belize District (containing Belize City) had the most murders by far compared to all the other districts. In 2015, 55% of the murders occurred in the Belize District. The violence in Belize City (especially {{the southern part of the}} city) is largely due <b>to</b> <b>gang</b> warfare.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing the {{expansion}} of gang-related activity {{in the eastern part}} of Pennsylvania, Meehan sought a $2.5 million dollar Department of Justice grant to fight and prevent gang violence for the region. The unique “Route 222 Corridor Anti-Gang Initiative” brought together elected officials and law enforcement personnel with community groups to fight gangs in a rural area unfamiliar with big-city gang violence. The money was divided among enforcement, prevention and rehabilitation. The program aimed not only to increase arrests, but also to fund school programs and community centers to educate youth about alternatives <b>to</b> <b>gang</b> life.|$|E

25|$|The {{first set}} of posted routes in New York were {{assigned}} in 1924. One route assigned at this time was NY4, a highway extending from the Pennsylvania state line in Lindley to downtown Rochester. NY4 roughly followed the modern alignment of US15 from Pennsylvania to Presho, Indian Hill Road from Presho to Erwin, NY417 from Erwin <b>to</b> <b>Gang</b> Mills, and Hamilton Street from Gang Mills to Painted Post. From Painted Post northward, NY4 was routed along modern NY415 to Wayland, from where it continued to Rochester on what is now NY15. At the state line, NY4 connected to Pennsylvania Route4 (PA4). In 1927, US4 was first signed in New York. As a result, NY4 was renumbered to NY2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new U.S. Highway.|$|E
25|$|George Ramos of the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that many Cypress Park residents were {{angered by the}} negative portrayal of their community in the media; the perceived lack of attention <b>to</b> <b>gang</b> issues from the municipal government and their council member, Mike Hernandez; and the Los Angeles Times for posting large images of Stephanie Kuhen and her brother {{on the front page}} of the newspaper, stating that the media does not do this with ethnic minority children. Ramos said that the editor of the newspaper had asked for the images of the children to be posted before learning that they were white. Ramos also stated that many Cypress Park residents believed that if one is not from Cypress Park, one should be concerned with crime in his or her own neighborhood rather than in Cypress Park.|$|E
25|$|US 15 enters New York {{adjacent}} to the state line borough of Lawrenceville, Pennsylvania, {{at which point the}} northern segment of I-99 begins. A four-lane freeway through the Steuben County town of Lindley, US15 crosses through a rock cut, making a large bend to the north and bypassing the hamlet of Presho. I-99/US15 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with CR5 (Smith Road). After CR5, US15 bent northeast through the town of Erwin, running {{to the west of the}} Indian Hills Golf Club. Making a gradual bend further to the northeast, the freeway crosses the Canisteo River and enters the hamlet of Erwin, where it enters a diamond interchange with NY417 (Addison Road). After NY417, US15 makes a bend alongside Norfolk Southern Railroad's Southern Tier Line (former Erie Railroad main line). Now paralleling the tracks and NY417, US15 crossed through Erwin, entering exit3, which connects to NY417 once again, next <b>to</b> <b>Gang</b> Mills Yard, the site of the former Painted Post station.|$|E

50|$|In {{the course}} of the meeting, David Thai had forced all of the gang members who wished <b>to</b> join the <b>gang</b> <b>to</b> sign a paper {{contract}} that was passed from table to table throughout the meeting.

Secretariat's loss was later attributed to a large abscess in his mouth, which made him sensitive to the bit. Before and after the race, there was some ill feeling between Laurin and the trainer of Sham, Pancho Martin, fanned by comments in the press. The dispute centered around the use of coupled entries as Martin had entered two horses in addition to Sham, all with the same owner. There was fear that an entry could be used tactically <b>to</b> <b>gang</b> up on another horse. Stung by such insinuations, Martin wound up scratching the two horses that he had originally entered with Sham, and asked Lauren to do the same, but Laurin could not follow suit as Secretariat and Angle Light had different owners.|$|E
