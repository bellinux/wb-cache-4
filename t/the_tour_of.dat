5|$|Cancellara's {{first victory}} of the 2009 season came in the prologue of <b>the</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>of</b> California. This was his second victory {{in a row in}} the prologue at <b>the</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>of</b> California. Cancellara then {{returned}} to the Tirreno–Adriatico, but an injury prevented his efforts to repeat as winner of the event. Cancellara did not finish the sixth stage of the race; he left the event without winning a single stage. Poor performance marred the early portion of the season for Cancellara as he achieved no success in the early season classics; he did not finish <b>the</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>of</b> Flanders after suffering problem with his bike chain early in the race, on the Koppenberg, and he finished 49th overall in the Paris–Roubaix.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008 {{calendar}} he {{won gold}} at the Summer Olympics {{in the individual}} time trial event and the Milan–San Remo. The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. In 2010, he won the Paris–Roubaix and <b>the</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>of</b> Flanders. Cancellara's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories, while the latter was hampered by injuries throughout. After a lackluster two-year period, Cancellara again won <b>the</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>of</b> Flanders and Paris–Roubaix double in 2013. In 2014, Cancellara repeated as winner of <b>the</b> <b>Tour</b> <b>of</b> Flanders.|$|E
