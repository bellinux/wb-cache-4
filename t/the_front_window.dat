25|$|Following the bombing, {{more than}} $300,000 in {{unsolicited}} gifts were {{received by the}} church and repairs were begun immediately. The church reopened on June 7, 1964. A stained glass window depicting a black Jesus, designed by John Petts, was donated by citizens of Wales and installed in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window,</b> facing south.|$|E
25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a quarter light window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E

25|$|Class B trains {{were built}} between 1981 and 1994 {{to provide more}} stock to service the growing network in the 1980s. As with the class A trains, six prototypes were ordered. However, it took six years until the series {{production}} started and the prototypes had to be modified to match the series-production units. B units have {{the same size as}} A units but differ in the design (especially of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window)</b> and use three-phase current instead of direct current motors. The other difference is the door opening mechanism. On B units, the passengers only need to pull just one handle to open both doors rather than both handles as on A units. Of a total of 63 units, 57 are still in service (including one prototype), and six have been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|Thirty new train units (named DT3) {{were ordered}} {{and have been}} {{delivered}} for U3 operations. Those trains are designed to operate without a driver, controlled by an ATC system from Siemens, and will provide the passengers with an unobstructed view from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> into the tunnel. A normally locked drivers panel exists at every front window which enables service employees to drive DT3 units by hand if required. As with all Nuremberg subway trains, these units consist of two carriages and are half the platform length. They can be run as a single unit (short train) or coupled as double unit (long train), depending on passenger numbers. For {{the first time in}} a Nuremberg subway train, the two carriages of a unit are built with an accessible gangway. This is intended to improve passenger distribution in the train as many stations in the system have their exits at the very ends of the platform and therefore often the first and the last carriages of a 4 carriage (long) train are rather full, while the two middle carriages are relatively empty.|$|E
500|$|The U Street {{corridor}} {{was devastated}} by the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. During the riots, black activist Stokely Carmichael, leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, asked Ben to keep his restaurant open and the Alis obtained permission to stay open past curfew. The restaurant fed both the police officers and firemen working to impose order on the neighborhood, {{as well as the}} black activists. The violence and arson reached such an extent that Ben wrote [...] "Soul Brother" [...] in soap on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> in the hopes that it would stop the angry mobs.|$|E

500|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, the {{leadership}} of Beth Israel spoke out against the Ku Klux Klan's attacks on black churches. In response, Thomas Tarrants of Mobile, Alabama, who had helped bomb the synagogue building of Beth Israel Congregation and its rabbi's house there bombed Beth Israel's education building on May 28, 1968. The blast was caused by about 15 sticks of dynamite planted by Tarrants and his accomplice, Danny Joe Hawkins, a top hitman in the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The force of the blast knocked down several walls of the education building and caved in part of the roof while also destroying a door {{at the opposite end}} of the synagogue building. A hole approximately [...] in diameter was left in the concrete floor, and damages were estimated to be around $50,000 (equivalent to $ today). A reward of $10,000 was offered by the Meridian City Council, and $15,000 extra was promised by the Jewish community of the city. According to Sammy Feltenstein, past president of Congregation Beth Israel, pieces of stained glass that survived the bombing were salvaged and adorn <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> of the synagogue today.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 December 1964, Lamb smashed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> of Lakeview Marine and Equipment, a {{sporting}} goods store in Tecumseh, and stole three revolvers and a double-barrelled shotgun. Using one of the revolvers, he fired twice on a police constable and the shop's co-owner, missing both times. The officer returned several shots, leading Lamb {{to come forward with}} his hands raised. [...] "Don't shoot. I give up," [...] he said. He then showed the constable where he had hidden the other two handguns and the shotgun. Lamb, who turned 17 during the trial, was tried and convicted as an adult for [...] "breaking, entering and theft ... possession of a [...]22 calibre revolver, dangerous to public peace". Motivated by a presentence investigation report characterising Lamb as exceptionally violent, Magistrate J. Arthur Hanrahan sentenced him to two years at Kingston Penitentiary, a maximum security prison. According to Nosanchuk's account, the severity of the sentence was unusual for a first-time adult offender who had not caused anybody physical harm. Hanrahan, Nosanchuk writes, must have deemed Lamb beyond rehabilitation. The boy arrived at the penitentiary in April 1965.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of Rabaul, Lerew took command of a composite squadron in Port Moresby which later became No.32 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron. On 11February 1942, he led a flight of three Hudsons in a raid on Gasmata harbour, making what the official history of the RAAF in World WarII described as [...] "the first mast-height attack on enemy shipping in the New Guinea campaign". Having set two ships on fire, the Hudsons were attacked by enemy fighters and two were shot down, including Lerew's. With his aircraft in flames, he ordered his crew to bail out of the rear hatch while he parachuted from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window.</b> Lerew landed in the jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making {{his way to a}} Coastwatcher post and returning to Port Moresby in a schooner, nine days after having been posted missing; his crew members had died. On 7April, Lerew was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for [...] "outstanding courage, determination, skill and tenacity in the course of bombing raids on enemy positions in New Britain". The success of the Gasmata operation prompted the Chief of the Air Staff to commend Lerew's squadron for the [...] "effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to our small numbers and general condition".|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast {{did not look at}} each other while saying their lines and he tried to encourage them to look at one another, so they would laugh. Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had really done a show dealing with that situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E
2500|$|Two and a {{half hours}} after the {{shooting}} on Danzig Street, there was a shooting at another TCHC complex on Whiteleas Avenue, [...] away. Two bullets were fired through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> of the house where Mesquito lived with his mother, Nadine. No one was injured.|$|E
2500|$|The {{body was}} {{aerodynamic}} {{in a style}} similar to the Volkswagen Beetle. [...] Only a two-door sedan was made, making it unsuitable for the taxi market. [...] The doors were hinged at the rear (often called suicide doors). [...] <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> was a single pane of flat glass with a single wiper mounted above the driver.

2500|$|A patron's first {{experience}} of the theatre would have been his breathtaking view of the building's façade. [...] With its French [...] "Second Empire" [...] architectural design, the building was adorned with a -tall, slate-covered cupola with a flag staff mounted with a golden eagle statue. [...] The tip of the dome itself towered [...] above the pavement below. [...] At {{the base of the}} cupola, one could behold an elegant bronze bust of Shakespeare, and below this still, inscribed in an arch above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> was [...] "Tibbits Opera-House, 1882", in gold leaf. [...] The face itself consisted of iron work, red and black brick, and cut stone [...] "united in excellent taste." [...] Three large windows allowed the glow of the sun to fill the theatre lobby, and below the middle window was an iron balcony furnished with glass globe lanterns.|$|E
2500|$|In 1829, Rankin {{moved his}} wife and nine {{children}} (of an eventual total of thirteen) to a house {{at the top of}} a 540-foot-high hill that provided a wide view of the village, the River and the Kentucky shoreline, as well as farmland and fruit groves that could provide sources of income. Folklore associated with the Rankin home suggested that a lantern or candle was placed in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>window</b> to guide runaway slaves from across the Ohio River in Mason County, Kentucky. However, ex-slave narrative recall a pole with a light. This is a more plausible means of being seen based on the proximity of the house to the river. From there the family could raise a lantern on a flagpole to signal fleeing slaves in Kentucky when it was safe for them to cross the Ohio River. [...] Rankin also constructed a staircase leading up the hill to the house for slaves to climb up to safety on their way further north. For over forty years leading up to the Civil War, many of the slaves who escaped to freedom through Ripley stayed at the family's home. It became known as the Rankin House and is now a U.S. National historic landmark (see photos).|$|E
