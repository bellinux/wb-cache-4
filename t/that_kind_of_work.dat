Leyendecker, he drew for the school newspaper (The Clintonian), the literary magazine (The Magpie) and the yearbook, and did stage design, leading him to consider doing <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> for theater. Upon graduation, he studied under Canadian artist George Brandt Bridgman (1864–1943) for {{a year at the}} Art Students League of New York. Contacts made there led to a position as an advertising writer-cartoonist for the New York American newspaper. Eisner also drew $10-a-page illustrations for pulp magazines, including Western Sheriffs and Outlaws.|$|E

[...] Herriman drew sports cartoons {{in an office}} alongside Frederick Burr Opper, James Swinnerton, and Tad Dorgan, who was popularly known as [...] "Tad" [...] and was considered a star at another Hearst paper, the New York Evening Journal. [...] Tad and Herriman were often assigned to cover the same sporting events and became close friends. In 1924, Tad called Herriman [...] "one of the best sporting artists in the world" [...] and regretted that Herriman no longer did <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> [...] Herriman continued with Hearst until June 1905 {{when he left the}} paper, possibly because of the new sports editor's unsympathetic attitude to cartoonists. [...] He returned to Los Angeles {{in the latter half of}} 1905.|$|E

500|$|After graduating, Hedlund {{signed with}} the Trenton Titans of the East Coast Hockey League for the final games of the 2001–02 season. He played in two games as a rookie and did not record a stat during the regular season, but in six playoff games he spent six minutes in the penalty box. In the 2002–03 season, he played in 13 games for Trenton {{recording}} a goal and two assists before he was called up to the American Hockey League's Binghamton Senators. In Binghamton, he played in 59 games scoring one goal and adding seven assists. On January 16, 2004, against the Albany River Rats, Hedlund broke a 17-game streak {{in which he had}} gone scoreless after he recorded his first career overtime goal and his second career game-winner. His previous goal was a game-winning shot against Syracuse. He ended the 2003–04 season with four goals and 19 assists in 80 games. Before the 2004–05 season, Hedlund spent time in training camp with the Ottawa Senators before he was reassigned to Binghamton. The NHL season would eventually be locked out which saw players such as goaltender Dominik Hašek join the AHL. When Hasek began working out with Binghamton, Hedlund commented, [...] "He's just one of the guys when he's here, he just wants to put in his time and get some good work in, and make sure he's ready to go, so you just got to appreciate a guy like that being here and doing <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> so its pretty fun." [...] A season preview produced by the website Hockey's Future commented about Hedlund saying that, [...] "A fan-favorite, Hedlund gives it everything he has despite limited talent." [...] Against the Manitoba Moose on October 31, Hedlund scored a goal from the blue line that tied the game, however the Senators ended up losing 5–3. Following the season, he and Philadelphia Phantoms player Ben Stafford were named the AHL's Men of the Year. During the season he played in 75 games, scoring two goals with 13 assists. In the playoffs, he played in six games recording two assists.|$|E
2500|$|In 1871, Milton Hershey {{left school}} {{for good and}} was apprenticed to a local printer, Sam Ernst, who {{published}} a German-English newspaper. He did not like <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and {{he thought it was}} very boring. One day at work there, he accidentally dropped his hat in one of the machines. Because his boss was hot-tempered, he was fired shortly after. He was worried to see how his parents would react. His father asked Ernst to take him back, and he did decide to give him a second chance, but Mattie Snavely, his aunt, and his mother had a different idea. They wanted him to learn the trade of candy making instead. [...] So, his mother arranged for the 14-year-old Hershey to be apprenticed to a confectioner named Joseph Royer in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Over the next four years, Hershey learned the craft of creating confections. In 1876, he moved to Philadelphia to start his first confectionery business.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{community}} or collective authorship that Fitzpatrick explores {{is related to}} remix culture.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we explore an activity-centered {{computing}} paradigm that is aimed at supporting work processes that are radically different from the ones known from office work. Our main inspiration is healthcare work that is characterized by an extreme degree of mobility, many interruptions, ad-hoc collaboration based on shared material, and organized in terms <b>of</b> well-defined, recurring, <b>work</b> activities. We propose <b>that</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> can be supported by a pervasive computing infrastructure together with domain-specific services, both designed from a perspective where work activities are first class objects. We also present an exploratory prototype design and first implementation and present some initial results from evaluations in a healthcare environment. ...|$|R

In this paper, we will demonstrate <b>that</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> can be extended more generally: all related constructions can work for any k th residues if k only contains small prime factors, instead of (2 α) th-power residues only.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{takes a look}} at two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> {{new media}} used within English and sister subjects: digital video and {{computer}} games. It argues <b>that</b> the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> text made by young people with these media require us to attend more urgently to the range of signifying modes they combine, where language {{may or may not be}} the dominant mode. It also argues <b>that</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> often also involves a dramatic dimension, in which the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> representing the world and the preoccupations of these young authors is conducted through various <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> physical performance, which integrate with the digital media they use. Finally, it proposes that, while such work requires a more generous view of the business of English, it also requires traditional models of media education to expand their views of representation, media and cultural engagement...|$|R
