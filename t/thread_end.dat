40|$|Coats plc. ’s {{research}} efforts during the 1970 ’s {{led to a}} breakthrough in colour difference predictions. The result was a new colour difference formula ‘JPC 79 ’, which was tested in a commercial environment providing fewer wrong decisions {{when compared with the}} best colour matcher from a group at Coats plc. The formula was designed from a large number of thread winding card samples from which colour difference pairs were formed. The formula was later modified and became a standard in the textile industry known as the CMC(l:c) colour difference formula. However, visual colour differences for two thread winding card samples, judged in a viewing cabinet side-by-side, may not reflect on a real world scenario, for instance, when a thread is to be matched while stitched upon or within another kind of material, such as a fabric or leather sample. It was therefore of interest to assess such a scenario by using <b>thread</b> <b>end</b> products. Preparing those sample pairs can be time consuming and expensive. Therefore, it was also of interest to assess substitutes on a digital screen with the aim to find a suitable correlation between two methods. The CMC formula is the preferred equation for calculating colour differences for matching textile samples. The question here was whether the equation can also be used for predicting visual colour differences that were obtained from assessments of end products without compromising its prediction performances. The primary findings for this project and experimental setups are; (1) that the variation in sample type and presentation can alter the perception of colour differences in human observers, significantly; (2) it is generally possible to use digital substitutes for psychophysical experiments as such following the same trends as they occur from physical samples that are assessed in a viewing cabinet, (3) advanced colour difference formulae can predict those visual colour differences obtained from assessments for end-products once they are optimised (parametric functions), and an overall size parametric factor is applied for various ‘thread sewn into fabric samples’...|$|E
40|$|Podczas omawiania procesu sterowania nicią przez podciągacz zaakcentowano szczególną rolę mechanizmu podciągacza nici w maszynach ściegu czółenkowego. Wyróżniając charakterystyczne fazy działania podciągacza, tj. zasilanie nicią oraz wybieranie nici kończące się tzw. zaciąganiem ściegu, zwrócono uwagę na warunki lokowania przeplotu w materiale i możliwość ich poprawiania poprzez budowę podciągacza. Temu celowi służyło modelowanie procesu zaciągania ściegu. Zaprojektowany i zbudowany podciągacz nici pozwolił ponad dwukrotnie obniżyć szczytowe wartości siły zaciągania ściegu, co jest znaczącym osiągnięciem techniczno-technologicznym. Ponadto spowodował spadek strat wytrzymałości nici na zrywanie. Analysis of {{literature}} {{described in the}} dissertation showed the complexity of phenomena of machine stitch creation processes. The reference to the lockstitch proves particularly difficult working conditions of needle thread. Tools forming the stitch (needle, bobbin, needle thread take-up, thread tensioner, transporter of the textile package) cause the weakening of thread inserted into the seam structure, what can lead to thread breakage. Hence, a great {{attention is paid to}} the action on thread of stitch forming mechanisms in the sewing machines. A particular role of thread take-up mechanism was stressed during discussing the process of thread control conditions by the take-up in the lockstitch machines. Characteristic working phases of the take-up were distinguished i. e., supplying by the thread and drawing of <b>thread</b> <b>end</b> during the stitch tightening. One has paid the attention to the conditions of interlacement location in the material and the possibility of correcting them by the improving the structure of the thread take-up mechanism. Changing the stitch tightening modelling process was to achieve this aim. So, a physical model, and next a mathematical model of the zone of stitch creation were elaborated. Due to the possibility of configuration of multibarrier take-ups creation a model of the stitch tightening considering the take-up disc was built. The presented results of model research required the experimental verification. The dynamic tensions in threads and the thread strength decrease after the sewing through process as well as a reaction of the take-up to changes thread length in the link of the stitch were studied. Carrying out the experimental analysis required the building the take-up disc installed on the chosen machine. Thus, {{there is a need for}} elaboration of the methodology of the take-ups disc designing using genetic algorithms as well as a classical programming in Fortan and C++ languages. The determination of requirement take-up disc configuration was preceded by a definition of the curve of the thread controlled by the take-up disc. Next, one made an estimation of defined curve of the thread controlled by take-up disc with a software called "Take-up disc 2. 0 " elaborated on the basis of genetic algorithm. The designed and built thread take-up disc allow decreasing peaks of strength of the stitch tightening over twice of the basic value, which is the significant achievement from a technical-technological point of view. Moreover, it causes the decrease of thread breaking strength losses. In the case of the take-up disc, holding the position of the interlacement in the stitch link on the set level requires the extending the part of machine working cycle corresponding to the stitch tightening in comparison to the generally used take-ups...|$|E

The anchoring assembly includes a hollow outer sleeve {{in the form}} of a plurality of symmetrically arranged, longitudinal segmented wall portions with exterior gripping teeth and an inner expander sleeve {{in the form of}} a corresponding plurality of longitudinal wall portions symmetrically arranged about a central axis to define an inner threaded cylindrical section.

As the <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> portion of the elongated bolt is inserted into the inner threaded cylindrical section of the inner sleeve from the trailing end to the leading end thereof, the inner sleeve expands over and clamps around the <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> portion of the elongated bolt. Thereafter, partial withdrawal of the elongated bolt from the borehole causes the inner sleeve to axially move relative to the outer sleeve from the leading end toward the trailing end of the outer sleeve in a wedging action to cause the outer sleeve to radially expand and force engagement of the gripping teeth against the sidewall of the borehole to thereby secure the expandable anchor assembly and therewith the <b>threaded</b> <b>end</b> portion of the elongated bolt within the borehole...|$|R
