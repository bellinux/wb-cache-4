25|$|Alpha Phi Omega {{was founded}} on December 16, 1925 at Lafayette College, on the 2nd floor of Brainerd Hall, located in Easton, Pennsylvania. APO was founded by Frank Reed Horton and 13 other {{students}} who were former Boy Scouts and scouters, {{as a way to}} continue participating in the ideals of Scouting at the college level. These founding brothers were Frank Reed Horton, Everett William Probst, Ephraim Moyer Detwiler Jr., Thane Sanford Cooley, William Taylor Wood, Lewis Burnett Blair, Gordon Minnier Looney, Donald LeRoy Terwilliger, William Weber Highberger, Robert Jefferson Green, Donald H. Fritts, Ellsworth Stewart Dobson, George Axel Olsen, and Herbert Heinrich. Six advisors were also inducted: Lafayette President John H. MacCracken, Dean Donald B. Prentice, Professors D. Arthur Hatch and Harry T. Spengler; one local Scouting official, Herbert G. Horton, and one national Scouting official, the national director of relationships for the Boy Scouts of America, Ray O. Wyland. The founders insisted that all those gaining membership must pledge to uphold the fraternity's three cardinal principles of Leadership, Friendship, and Service. Of these important founding members, a few made extremely notable and important contributions to APO <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> recognize today. Everett Probst designed the pin and coat of arms, Thane S. Cooley suggested the hand clasp during the toast song, and Elsworth Dobson & Gordon M. Looney helped write the constitution and bylaws.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E

[...] One of those questions is the origin of the shared agricultural vocabulary, and the earliest dates for agriculturalism in areas settled by the Indo-Europeans. Those dates seem to be too late too account for the shared vocabulary, and raise the question what their origin is. In 2016, publications are expected on DNA-analysis of Harappans, which may answer the question to which non-Indian populations they were related.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Metallica recording, the band's songs were written mainly by {{frontman}} James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, with Hetfield being the lyricist. The duo frequently composed together at Ulrich's house in Berkeley, California. Several song ideas and concepts were conceived by {{other members of the}} band, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Jason Newsted. For instance, Newsted wrote the main riff of [...] "My Friend of Misery", which was originally intended to be an instrumental, one of which had been included on every previous Metallica album. The songs were written in two months in mid-1990; the ideas for some of them were originated during the Damaged Justice Tour. Metallica was impressed with Bob Rock's production work on Mötley Crüe's Dr. Feelgood (1989) and decided to hire him to work on their album. Initially, the band members were not interested in having Rock producing the album as well, but changed their minds. Ulrich said, [...] "We felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> had our best record in us and Bob Rock could help us make it".|$|E

2500|$|The {{first time}} {{songs from the}} new album were played live was on 17 August 2003 at Newport, the first gig of three {{alongside}} a Birmingham date and a Manchester date, {{in preparation for the}} Reading and Leeds festival at the end of August. For these gigs We Still Kill The Old Way became the regular opener, whilst sets closed with Burn Burn, with tracks from their previous album interspersed in between. Kerrang noted in a live review from Manchester <b>that</b> <b>We</b> <b>Still</b> Kill The Old Way and To Hell We Ride were [...] "well received" [...] but that [...] "the surfeit of new material leads to a comparatively muted response". At the end of July though it was announced that the band had cancelled their appearance at Reading and Leeds, whilst still promising to play the three warm-up shows, citing that they wanted the recording of Start Something to take precedence. Ian Watkins said [...] "Unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and we felt it was more important not to short change anyone." [...] The band did however support Linkin Park at Wembley Arena in London on 22 November 2003 playing eight tracks, including five from the soon to be released new album. Therefore, the band played four dates altogether in 2003.|$|E

They created a rich culture <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> have — people who are rich are rich {{in a way that was}} established in America in the 1880s, ’90s, 1900s. It was different from Europe. Something like Newport would never have happened in any other country, where you have huge palaces, and then about 20 yards away, another huge palace, and 20 yards beyond that another huge palace. In England right up to the 1930s, when people made good money, they would buy an estate of 5,000 acres and they’d have to look after Nanny. The Americans of the 1880s and ’90s didn’t want too much of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Barger, the HSCA's {{acoustics}} expert, {{when asked}} about this discovery and the NAS analysis, replied,Barber discovered a very weak spoken phrase on the DPD Dictabelt recording that is heard at {{about the time of}} the sound impulses we concluded were probably caused by the fourth shot. The NAS Committee has shown to our satisfaction that this phrase has the same origin as the same phrase heard also on the Audograph recording. The Audograph recording was originally made from the channel 2 radio. The common phrase is heard on channel 2 about a minute after the assassination would appear, from the context, to have taken place. Therefore, it would seem [...] [...] [...] that the sounds that we connected with gunfire were made about a minute after the assassination shots were fired. Upon reading the NAS report, we did a brief analysis of the Audograph dub that was made by the NAS Committee and loaned to us by them. We found some enigmatic features of this recording that occur at about the time that individuals react to the assassination. Therefore, we have doubt about the time synchronization of events on that recording, and so we doubt that the Barber hypothesis is proven. The NAS Committee did not examine the several items of evidence that corroborated our original findings, so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> agree with the House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion that our findings were corroborated ...|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Makdisi has {{asserted}} that the European university borrowed many of its features from the Islamic madrasa, including the concepts of a degree and doctorate. Makdisi and Hugh Goddard have also highlighted other terms and concepts now used in modern universities which most likely have Islamic origins, including [...] "the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> talk of professors holding the 'chairman' of their subject" [...] being based on the [...] "traditional Islamic pattern of teaching where the professor sits on a chair and the students sit around him", the term 'academic circles' being derived from {{the way in which}} Islamic students [...] "sat in a circle around their professor", and terms such as [...] "having 'fellows', 'reading' a subject, and obtaining 'degrees', can all be traced back" [...] to the Islamic concepts of [...] ('companions, as of Muhammad'), [...] ('reading aloud the Qur'an') and [...] ('licence ') respectively.
