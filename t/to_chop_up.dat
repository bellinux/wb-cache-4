5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> <b>up</b> {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a}} way back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
25|$|Frank Geyer, a Philadelphia detective {{tracking}} Holmes, {{found the}} decomposed {{bodies of the}} two Pitezel girls in the Toronto cellar. After removing the bodies from their shallow graves, Geyer noticed that Nellie's feet had been removed. After discovering that Nellie had club foot, he theorized that Holmes had cut off her feet to prevent a distinctive identification of the body. He then followed Holmes to Indianapolis, where Holmes had rented a cottage. Holmes {{was reported to have}} visited a local pharmacy to purchase the drugs which he used to kill Howard Pitezel, and a repair shop to sharpen the knives he used <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> <b>up</b> the body before he burned it. The boy's teeth and bits of bone were discovered in the home's chimney. Holmes' murder spree finally ended when he was arrested in Boston on November 17, 1894, after being tracked there from Philadelphia by the Pinkertons. He was held on an outstanding warrant for horse theft in Texas, as the authorities had become more suspicious at this point and Holmes appeared poised to flee the country in the company of his unsuspecting third wife.|$|E
2500|$|Chimpanzees in the Nimba Mountains of Guinea, Africa, {{use both}} stone and wooden cleavers, {{as well as}} stone anvils, <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> <b>up</b> and reduce Treculia fruits into smaller {{bite-sized}} portions. These fruits, which can be {{the size of a}} [...] volleyball and weigh up to 8.5kg, are hard and fibrous. But, despite lacking a hard outer shell, they are too large for a chimpanzee to get its jaws around and bite into. Instead, the chimpanzees use a range of tools to chop them into smaller pieces. This is the first account of chimpanzees using a pounding tool technology to break down large food items into bite-sized chunks rather than just extracting it from other unobtainable sources such as baobab nuts. It is also the first time wild chimpanzees have been found to use two distinct types of percussive technology, i.e. movable cleavers against a non-movable anvil, to achieve the same goal. Neighbouring chimpanzees in the nearby region of Seringbara do not process their food in this way, indicating how tool use among apes is culturally learnt.|$|E

2500|$|Following Jessie's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Rude Awakening" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked true or false {{questions}} about fan-submitted messages they had heard the previous night; an incorrect answer resulted in elimination, and the last HouseGuest remaining was the winner. Michelle was the winner. Following these events, an argument between all of the HouseGuests (except for Dan) erupted, with HouseGuests April, Jerry, and Michelle attacking Dan's religious beliefs. Though April and Michelle ended the conflict, Jerry went on to continuously insult Dan's religious and personal beliefs weeks afterwards. On Day 32, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "In the News" [...] food competition. For this competition, previously evicted HouseGuest Brian returned to host the competition, while one representative from each previous season returned to participate. The current HouseGuests would select one of the returning HouseGuests to give them news from the outside world, and had {{to determine if they}} were being truthful or not; a correct answer earned the house food for a specific day of the week, while an incorrect answer placed them on the slop diet for that day. Later that day, Michelle chose to nominate Keesha and Libra for eviction, with Libra being her main target. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, April, Jerry, and Memphis selected to compete; Ollie was selected to host. On Day 33, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Cry Me a Veto" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> <b>up</b> onions with the option of three different techniques, and were then required to place their chopped onions into a box; they could place them into either their Veto box or their prize box. The HouseGuest with the heaviest Veto box {{at the end of the}} competition would be the winner of the Power of Veto, while the two HouseGuests with the most weight in their prize box would win prizes. Jerry was the winner of the Power of Veto. Despite Jerry's attempts at convincing Michelle to nominate Dan should he use the Power of Veto, she was reluctant about doing so as she wanted Libra evicted that week. On Day 35, Jerry chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. During his speech, Jerry infamously referred to Dan as [...] "Judas" [...] due to his vote the previous week. That night, Dan and Memphis made a deal to get to the end together, thus forming The Renegades alliance. On Day 38, Libra became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of six to zero. She became the first member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

40|$|How did Chinese food get to {{look like}} this? With more than 41, 000 Chinese {{restaurants}} in America - 3 {{times the number of}} McDonald’s restaurants - Chinese food {{is one of the most}} accepted and misunderstood cuisines in the United States. From large cities to small towns, locals can always count on an order of orange chicken in a takeout box, with a few fortune cookies thrown in the bag. But what Americans view as Chinese food is far from a traditional Chinese meal, which is usually a colorful display of sea creatures such as shrimp or crab or a bowl of seaweed or tofu soup. The story of Chinese food in America is a tale of how one ethnic cuisine cultivated and adapted its flavors for Americans, evolving from wholesome seafood meals <b>to</b> <b>chopped</b> <b>up</b> sweet and sour fried bits.

60|$|I FACED these people, facing my fate in them, single-handed now,--literally single-handed, for I had {{a broken}} arm. In my pocket was a {{revolver}} with two empty chambers. Among the chips {{scattered about the}} beach lay the two axes {{that had been used}} <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> <b>up</b> the boats. The tide was creeping in behind me. There was nothing for it but courage. I looked squarely into the faces of the advancing monsters. They avoided my eyes, and their quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay beyond me on the beach. I took half-a-dozen steps, picked up the blood-stained whip that lay beneath the body of the Wolf-man, and cracked it. They stopped and stared at me.|$|E
60|$|Gavin let the doctor's {{warnings}} {{fall in the}} grass. In his joy over Nanny's deliverance {{he jumped}} the garden gate, whose hinges were of yarn, and cleverly caught his hat as it was leaving his head in protest. He then re-entered the mud house staidly. Pleasant was the change. Nanny's home was as a clock that had been run out, and is set going again. Already the old woman was unpacking her box, to increase the distance between herself and the poorhouse. But Gavin only saw her in the background, for the Egyptian, singing at her work, had become {{the heart of the}} house. She had flung her shawl over Nanny's shoulders, and was at the fireplace breaking peats with the leg of a stool. She turned merrily to the minister to ask him <b>to</b> <b>chop</b> <b>up</b> his staff for firewood, and he would have answered wittily but could not. Then, as often, the beauty of the Egyptian surprised him into silence. I could never get used to her face myself in the after-days. It has always held me wondering, like my own Glen Quharity on a summer day, when the sun is lingering and the clouds are on the march, and the glen is never the same for two minutes, but always so beautiful as to make me sad. Never will I attempt to picture the Egyptian as she seemed to Gavin while she bent over Nanny's fire, never will I describe my glen. Yet a hundred times have I hankered after trying to picture both.|$|E

William Murray died at the house in 1911, his wife Ellen died there in 1921, their daughter Ida died in 1946, and a son died in 1950, all in McRaven. From this point on, William's daughters Annie and Ella Murray, both unmarried, lived {{alone in the house}} with no modern conveniences aside from a telephone, and no {{contact with the outside world}} except their doctor, Walter Johnston. In 1960, Ella Murray died at the age of 81, and her sister Annie sold the house after moving to a nursing home. At this point, the house was in such disrepair that neighbors and nearby residents had no idea it existed. The upper story was completely overgrown with vines and the sisters had resorted <b>to</b> <b>chopping</b> <b>up</b> the antique furniture for firewood.|$|R
