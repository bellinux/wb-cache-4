5|$|After the war, <b>the</b> <b>Amber</b> Room {{was never}} seen in public again, though reports have {{occasionally}} surfaced stating that pieces of <b>the</b> <b>Amber</b> Room survived the war.

5|$|In 1997, an Italian stone mosaic {{that was}} part of a set of four stones which had {{decorated}} <b>the</b> <b>Amber</b> Room was found in Germany, in the possession of the family of a soldier who claimed to have helped pack up <b>the</b> <b>amber</b> chamber.

30|$|We {{believe that}} this work {{demonstrates}} that gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) and derivatisation in situ with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) are particularly suited for <b>the</b> characterization of <b>ambers.</b> This approach enabled us to identify the geographical origin of <b>the</b> archaeological <b>ambers.</b> <b>The</b> archaeological samples from the Italian sites were found to consist of Succinite, thus ruling out any possible Italian origin of <b>the</b> <b>ambers</b> (such as Simetite from Sicily or <b>ambers</b> from <b>the</b> Dolomites or Apennines) which {{have been shown to}} contain small or non-detectable quantities of succinic acid [30].|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Amber</b> Road was a European trade route {{associated}} with the trade and transport of amber. Amber satisfied the criteria for long distance trade as it was light in weight and was in high demand for ornamental purposes around the Mediterranean.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Amber</b> Room was looted during World War II by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany, {{and brought}} to Königsberg for {{reconstruction}} and display.

In 2003, after decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, the reconstructed Amber Room was inaugurated at the Catherine Palace near Saint Petersburg.|$|E
5|$|Then in 1968, despite {{academic}} protests worldwide, Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev {{ordered the}} destruction of Königsberg Castle, thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of <b>the</b> <b>Amber</b> Room all but impossible.

5000|$|The type species B. mandibularis {{along with}} B. mirabilis were {{identified}} from adults preserved as inclusion in Taimyr <b>amber.</b> <b>The</b> fossils of both species {{were collected on}} an expedition to the Taimyr peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>ambers</b> of <b>the</b> peninsula occur in the upper levels of the Kheta Formation, which is exposed {{in a number of}} locations in the Taimyr region. Age estimates of the Kheta Formation are between the Coniacian and Santonian, and <b>the</b> <b>ambers</b> are found consistently in the upper most units, giving a Santonian age range for the inclusions. [...] Based on the flora and fauna of the Ledyanaya and Mutino Formations which surround the Kheta formation, the paleoforest likely has a humid and warm temperate climate with the tees growing along river banks. While the resin producing trees have not been identified, the resins were likely dropped into the river systems and buried quickly in deltaic sediments.|$|R

5|$|Operations of {{the ancient}} Amber Road - a trans-European, north-south amber trade route, {{continued}} and intensified during the Roman Empire times. From the 1st century BC <b>the</b> <b>Amber</b> Road connected the Baltic Sea shores and Aquileia, an important amber processing center. This route was controlled first by the Celts, and later by the Romans south of the Danube, by Germanic tribes north of that river, and was used for transporting a variety of traded merchandise (and slaves) besides amber. As told in Naturalis Historia by Pliny the Elder, {{during the reign of}} Nero an equestrian of unknown name led an expedition to the Baltic shorelines, from where he brought a huge quantity of amber, which was subsequently used for propaganda purposes during public games - gladiator fights. The infrastructure of <b>the</b> <b>Amber</b> Road was destroyed by Germanic and Sarmatian attacks {{in the second half of}} the 3rd century AD; to a lesser degree it was still used intermittently until the mid-6th century. The Przeworsk culture sites provide a rich assortment of Amber Road traded objects.|$|E
