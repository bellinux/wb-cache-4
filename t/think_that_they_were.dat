5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{ordered that}} the excess baggage {{be taken to}} Burlington where it could be sent to Pennsylvania. The ground had frozen, making it {{possible}} to move the artillery without it sinking into the ground. By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires burning, and to work with picks and shovels to make the British <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> digging in. Before dawn, these men were to join up with the main army.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{circumstances}} as {{to which}} side fired the first shot are disputed by both sides.

25|$|Takahē were {{assumed to}} be extinct but were rediscovered by Geoffrey Orbell near Lake Te Anau in the Murchison Mountains, South Island, New Zealand on 20 November 1948. Takahē were at one time present {{throughout}} this island country, but for several reasons ceased to be found, which made many <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wiped out. Many reasons were cited {{for the failure of}} this flightless bird. There are two significant periods when takahē numbers declined: pre-European and post-European arrival.|$|E

25|$|Then, {{people began}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> too busy to heed every crime and abuse that {{happened}} in their society. They grieved on the rising of evil amongst their people. But {{most of their time}} had already been invested in tending their fief. So, they appointed someone to rectify what is right and what is wrong, give warnings to those who need it, give punishment to those who deserve it, and in return, they will give him a share of their rice.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} fierce fights were {{underway}} at Bucharest Otopeni International Airport between troops sent {{against each other}} under claims {{that they were going}} to confront terrorists. Early in the morning troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon. These troops were from the UM 0865 Campina military base, and were summoned there by Gen. Ion Rus, the commander of the Romanian Air Force. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers as well as eight civilians. The military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport's perimeter, passing several checkpoints. However, after passing the last checkpoint, being on their way to the airport, they were fired upon from different directions. A civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight. After the firefight the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport, who seemed to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> loyal to Ceausescu's regime.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the typological {{similarity}} {{of the structures}} and the relatively short distance between them (ideal for visual communication), has led some to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{on opposite sides of}} the frontier line between the Kingdoms of León and Castile (in Salamanca there is a town names Zorita de la Frontera ("Zorita on the Border") in memory of those times). These fortresses were reinforced in the 12th and 13th centuries due to conflicts between the two kingdoms; but it appears that they are more plentiful on the Castilian side (near the Trabancos) than on the Leonese side (near the River Guareña). This has been seen as indicative of a certain independence on the part of the militia of the Community of Medina del Campo and surrounding areas, which was thereby forced to defend itself without outside help, while the Leonese side would have been able to rely on the help of Royal troops, and the Knights Hospitaller of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, billeted in Castronuño and Torrecilla de la Orden.|$|E

500|$|In 1965, {{headlining}} the Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed {{his first}} electric set {{since high school}} with a pickup group featuring Mike Bloomfield on [...] guitar and Al Kooper on organ. Dylan had appeared at Newport in 1963 and 1964, but in 1965 met with cheering and booing and left the stage after three songs. One version {{has it that the}} boos were from folk fans whom Dylan had alienated by appearing, unexpectedly, with an electric guitar. Murray Lerner, who filmed the performance, said: [...] "I absolutely <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> booing Dylan going electric." [...] An alternative account claims audience members were upset by poor sound and a short set. This account is supported by Kooper and one of the directors of the festival, who reports his recording proves the only boos were in reaction to the MC's announcement that there was only enough time for a short set.|$|E
500|$|Engineering of {{the song}} was done by Emily Wright and Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. While Kesha was {{in the studio with}} Dr. Luke and Blanco, she took three takes to get the song correct as she jokingly [...] "white-girl rapped" [...] over the beat. At one point in the song's production, she had wanted to re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I thought it was just another song, I thought it was just like all the other ones I'd written. I didn't even know if it was very good. I wanted to rewrite the verses, I didn't think it was funny or clever. I thought it kind of sucked. But {{everyone}} else liked it."
