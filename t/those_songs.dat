This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's one of <b>those</b> <b>songs,</b> one of those tracks and one of those videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|E

5|$|Today <b>those</b> <b>songs</b> are {{classics}} but, at that time, {{they were}} considered cutting edge. Eventually I realized {{that most of them}} are threaded by the songwriting tradition of our country. They are Argentine songs. The real avant-garde revolutionizes what it inherits. Almendra was heir to the best Argentine music, and combined its elements without prejudice.|$|E

40|$|Music {{is a work}} of art which expresses emotion {{from the}} {{composer}} and could affect the listeners’ emotion. The aesthetic lyric will be more interesting to be listened and read as the means of ideas’ and experiences’ distribution from the writer to listener or reader. A song lyric has the similarity with the poem in intrinsic aspects such as, diction, figurative language and imagery. The composer often uses poetic language for the song lyric. Natasha Bedingfield as the composer and the woman singer is a multi talented artist. She could give the spirit in most of her songs. Usually she writes and sings about freedom and woman empowerment. This thesis is aimed to analyze both of the song lyrics in relation with the liberal feminism theory and intrinsic aspects. The method used in this thesis is library research. The structural approach is used to analyze all intrinsic aspects such as theme, dictions, figurative language and imagery, while liberal feminism approach is used to analyze extrinsic aspect. After “Unwritten” and “Wild Horses” are analyzed, it is found out that there is something beyond the content of <b>those</b> <b>song</b> lyrics. Bedingfield compares the different condition in “I” character, as the woman who lives in this period and wants freedom of live, through the dictions, figurative language, and imagery in <b>those</b> <b>song</b> lyrics. Even though the condition between “I” in “Unwritten” and “I” in “Wild Horses” is different, they have the same idea. <b>Those</b> <b>song</b> lyrics talk about woman empowerment, woman courage to face the problems, the fears and everything in life, so that they could live as human being freely and completely. This is in line with the liberal feminism theory...|$|R

During the period of shooting, she wrote and recorded new songs in Switzerland with local session musicians {{and the production of}} Gasser, who used three of <b>those</b> <b>songs</b> for the soundtrack of the movie. More songs were recorded in Germany in the spare time between tours with her band and usual collaborators, and released in 2006 in the album Warrior Soul. The screenplay for a second movie with the same cast was written in the following years and Gasser finally found the funding to start production in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{selecting}} the on-disc songs, FreeStyleGames recognized that engaging guitar tracks are not strictly limited to rock music, and included other genres into the mix. According to designer Jim Norris, their selection process began with identifying songs {{that would be}} expected by players {{to be on a}} Guitar Hero title, and then determining which of <b>those</b> <b>songs</b> which they could license. Once they had obtained the license, FreeStyleGames would mark up the song for the note highways and determined how much fun these songs would be to play. Finally, they balanced the song selection in the game to give players a combination of songs they know and those they may not recognize but would be enjoyable.|$|E

5|$|Square Enix is a Japanese {{video game}} {{developer}} and publisher formed from the merger on April 1, 2003 of video game developer Square and publisher Enix. The company {{is best known}} for its role-playing video game franchises, which include the Final Fantasy series, the Dragon Quest series, and the action-RPG Kingdom Hearts series. For many of its games, Square Enix has produced albums of music containing songs from those games or arrangements of <b>those</b> <b>songs.</b> In addition to those albums, it has produced several compilation albums containing music from multiple games or series made by the company. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles, such as orchestral, piano, vocal, and techno. This list includes albums produced by Square, Enix, or Square Enix which contain music from multiple games in the companies' catalog which are not a part of a single series. The first of these was Personal Computer Music by Enix in 1987. Dozens of albums have been published since, primarily through Square Enix's own record label.|$|E
5|$|Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul {{modified}} with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge {{pickup in}} Slayer's early days {{and through the}} Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits era. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 headstock, chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the pickups were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with {{a second set of}} B.C. Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG 81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of <b>those</b> <b>songs</b> were played in E-flat since about 1984.|$|E

25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era.

He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into.
