The friction and wear properties of graphite fluoride were tested with MMW- 1 vertical universal friction and wear testing machine. The phase of graphite fluoride was analyzed with infrared spectrometer. The morphology of friction surface was analyzed with the scanning electron microscope. The results show that graphite fluoride has an excellent antifriction wear-resisting property, to compare with molybdenum sulfide, the anti-friction property increased by 35 %, wear resistance increased by 49 %.

The fretting wear rate was lower than the sliding wear rate, which was partly due to <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> effect of the wear debris and strain hardening of the worn surfaces.

Some authors have synthesized TiBN/Ti(B)CN/WBN coatings with high hardness (≥ 30  GPa) for the reason of forming the main alloy phase of h-TiB 2 or c-BN phase [15 – 18]. Because of its stable performance under high-temperature conditions and the good lubrication properties like graphite, h-BN has great potential in solid lubrication material development [19, 20].

Microstructures, phase compositions and tribological properties of the sintered hBN were tested, and the results show that CaB(2) O(4) can effectively promote crystal growth of hBN at 2000 degrees C for 5 h in N(2) ambience. The friction coefficients of the sintered hBN under atmosphere ambience increase as the temperature increasing from room temperature to 400 degrees C, and then decrease with further increasing of temperature up to 800 degrees C. Under water vapor ambience, friction coefficients of the sintered hBN are much lower than those under atmosphere ambience, which are attributed to a lamella-slip of hBN and <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> effect of H(3) BO(3).

40|$|A {{composite}} material containing silver and molybdenum metals was fabricated by powder metallurgy method with a Ag/Mo molar ratio of 2 : 1 and the sintering temperature is 700 degrees C. Tribological properties, especially <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> behaviours during oxidation of the composite in air, were considered from room temperature to 600 degrees C.

The friction coefficients of the composite are similar to 0. 7 below 400 degrees C but decrease sharply to similar to 0. 18 above 500 degrees C. Characterisations of this composite indicate that several silver molybdates (Ag 2 MoO 4, Ag 2 Mo 2 O 7 and Ag 2 Mo 4 O 13) formed from oxidation of Ag-Mo composite at high temperatures benefit lubrication effects and lead to the decrease of friction coefficients. Formation mechanism of these silver molybdates during oxidation and wear was therefore studied, and a model based on solid reaction processes in the Ag-Mo-O- 2 system was promoted.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the formation and self-lubrication mechanisms of boric acid films on boric oxide coatings prepared by vacuum evaporation. Measured friction coefficients of a steel ball sliding on a boric-oxide-coated steel disk and a sapphire ball sliding on a boric-oxide-coated alumina disk were 0. 025 - 0. 05 at steady state, depending on load and substrate material. This low friction was correlated with the formation of a lubricious boric acid film on boric oxide coatings exposed to open air. For the mechanism of self-lubrication, the layered triclinic crystal structure of boric acid was proposed. The atoms constituting each boric acid molecule are arrayed in closely packed and strongly bonded layers that are 0. 318 nm apart and held together by weak forces, such as van der Waal’s. It is hypothesized that, during sliding, these layers can align themselves parallel to the direction of relative motion and, once so aligned, can slide over one another with relative ease to provide low friction.

40|$|In this study, nickel matrix {{composites}} {{reinforced by}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are compared to unreinforced CNT-coated (by drop-casting) bulk nickel samples {{in terms of}} their friction and wear behavior, thus gaining significant knowledge regarding the tribological influence of CNTs and the underlying tribo-mechanism. It has been shown that the frictional behavior is mainly influenced by the CNTs present in the contact zone, as just minor differences in the coefficient of friction between the examined samples can be observed during run-in. Consequently, the known effect of a refined microstructure, thus leading to an increased hardness of the CNT reinforced samples, seems to play a minor role in friction reduction compared to <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> effect induced by the CNTs. Additionally, a continuous supply of CNTs to the tribo-contact can be considered isolated for the reinforced composites, which provides a long-term friction reduction compared to the CNT-coated sample.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} (or available friction) in the wheel–rail {{contact is}} the most important parameter for the braking and traction operation of rail vehicles. Since the beginning of railway transportation, sanding from the locomotive has been a common practice to enhance the wheel–rail adhesion. In recent years, sanding from electrical multiple units (EMUs) and sand-based friction modifiers (FMs) have been adopted in some railway networks to overcome low adhesion incidents caused by leaf contamination in autumn. Although sanding has been proven to improve the adhesion under most of the typical contamination conditions, laboratory and field investigations have shown that sand may act as a solid lubricant in dry wheel–rail contacts. Nevertheless, the influence of the current sanding parameters on <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> effect has not been entirely investigated. Depending on the resulting adhesion coefficient, the traction and braking operations of rail vehicles could be affected. Furthermore, the influence of those parameters on the electrical insulation is also of special importance because it may affect the train detection. This article presents a laboratory investigation of the influence of three sanding parameters (i. e., feed rate, particle size, and slip) on the adhesion and electrical insulation in dry wheel–rail contacts. The tests have been carried out with a twin-disk roller rig in rollingsliding motion under closely controlled conditions. Three different slips representative of the actual traction and braking operations have been considered. Sands of four different sizes and up to five feed rates have been used. The results show that using smaller particle sizes and higher feed rates promotes the lubrication and causes more electrical insulation in the wheel–rail contact. Furthermore, the increase in slip is found to reduce the lubrication, leading to a higher adhesion coefficient. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Vapor {{deposited}} thin coatings {{have served}} well as mechanically hard coatings in different practical applications e. g., cutting and forming tool industries, decorative industries, biomedical industries etc. Some of these coatings (i. e., TiN) {{have a high}} coefficient of friction and can cause abrasion and rapid wear of the opposing surface. In a closed-system, a hard coating constitutes a source of abrasive particles upon spallation within the mechanism, {{which can lead to}} a worse result than the uncoated surface. Increasing number of reports in literature has suggested the use of a hard solid lubricant based coating to avoid this problem. A sputtering rig was made operative as a closed-field magnetron sputtering system by reestablishing different systems (magnetron, water cooling, vacuum, electrical etc.). A heavy-duty impact-abrasion wear tester was modified for applying lower load on the coated sample during abrasion by a spring-loaded mechanism. A single-axis and double-axis rotary substrate table system was designed, manufactured and successfully installed in the existing sputtering system. This substrate table facilitated the rig for the deposition of multicomponent and multilayer composite coating by using different target materials and reactive gases. A rotational control mechanism has been developed to rotate the substrate table at slower speed in front of activated targets and faster speed in front of inactivated targets within a single rotation instead of rotating at constant speed. This system increased the deposition rate thus saving time and materials. A three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) study has been carried out using FLOTRAN-CFD code of the ANSYS analysis package to predict the velocity, pressure and concentration distribution of the process gas species (argon and nitrogen) across the sputtering chamber, inlets and outlet. The numerical predictions provided useful understanding of the multiple species process gas distribution and their mixing behaviour at various gas flow rates to some extent. Modelling of thermal stress developed during cooling of a typical coating-substrate system (TiNstainless steel) from deposition to room temperature was performed using the finite element code ANSYS. A parametric study was performed to analyse the effects of coating and substrate thickness, Young’s modulus, deposition temperature etc. on the thermal stress. Radial, tangential, axial and shear stress distribution through the thickness of the coating and substrate were examined. The interface of the coating and substrate was recognised as the critical location from the failure point of view. Ti interlayer between TiN coating and substrate has significant influence on the reduction of thermal stress at the interface. The deposition of composite hard and solid lubricant coatings (TiN+MoSx) has been performed on a rotating substrate by closed-field magnetron sputtering using separate Ti and MoS 2 targets in a nitrogen gas environment. The composition of the coating was varied by controlling target current, gas pressure, and target to substrate distance. Compositional and structural analysis indicated the presence coating species (Ti, N, Mo and S) and incorporation of Mo and S atoms in the TiN matrix. The change of process parameters during deposition was also reflected in the measurements. For instance with the increase of MoS 2 target current, higher peak shifting and peak widening were observed in XRD study. The TiN+MoSx coating showed slightly lower hardness than pure TiN coating but higher hardness than MoSx coating. The hardness could not be directly correlated with the tribological properties. The adhesion test for all TiN+MoSx coatings showed a better adhesion compared to pure TiN and MoSx coatings. The TiN+MoSx coating also showed lower coefficients of friction than TiN in Pin-on-disk wear tests possibly due to <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> effect from MoS 2 formed during sliding. This fact was also speculated {{based on the results of}} the optical investigation of the wear track...|$|E

40|$|Grinding and {{polishing}} of engineered components are critical {{aspects of the}} precision manufacturing of high performance, quality assured products. Elevated process temperatures, however, are a common {{and for the most}} part undesirable feature of the grinding process. High process temperatures increase the likelihood of microstructural change within the immediate subsurface layer and are detrimental to the strength and performance of the manufactured products. Increasing processing costs and tighter environmental legislation are encouraging industry to seek innovative fluid application techniques as significant savings in production can be achieved. In this context, and with sponsorship from three industrial partners, namely; Fives Cinetic, Fuchs Lubricants plc and Southside Thermal Sciences Ltd, and also from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC), this research aimed to develop an understanding of Minimum Quantity <b>Solid</b> <b>Lubrication</b> (MQSL) as a method for abrasive machining, with particular reference to the control of surface temperatures. Improving the lubricity of Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) fluids reduces the frictional source of process heat and controls the finish surface temperature. The application of effective solid lubricants is known as Minimum Quantity <b>Solid</b> <b>Lubrication</b> (MQSL). Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS 2), Calcium Fluoride (CaF 2), and hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) were compared against a semi-synthetic water soluble machining fluid (Fuchs EcoCool). A series of Taguchi factorial experimental trials assessed their performances through ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) statistical method. The hBN produced the lowest grinding temperatures of <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> lubricants tested, although they still remained higher than those achieved using the EcoCool control. The reduction of the machining fluid enabled a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) sensor to be fitted into the grinding machine. The recorded movement in the emitted spectrum from the grinding chips was compared to experimental and modelled process temperatures. This showed that the wavelengths of the chip light correlated to the temperature of the finish grinding surface.

40|$|Since {{the term}} 'lubricious oxides' was {{introduced}} to tribology in order to describe expected low coefficients of friction (COF) and high wear resistances in unlubricated (dry) sliding conditions numerous studies {{have been carried out}} on bulk materials and thermal spray coatings of the Ti-O system. Recently, studies were performed on the binary TiO 2 -Cr 2 O 3 system, as well as with (Ti,Mo) (C,N) -NiMo cermets or TiC-based thermally sprayed hardmetal coatings, which might form beneficial titanium suboxides as a result of tribo-oxidative and/or high-temperature reactions. in this paper, we shortly summarize the characteristics and dry sliding wear resistance of thermally sprayed oxide coatings of the Ti-O and TiO 2 -Cr 2 O 3 lsystems, as well as of (Ti,Mo) (C,N) -Ni(Co) hardmetat coatings. <b>The</b> prediction of <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> properties of titanium suboxides was inspired from the planar oxygen defects present in the Magneli-phases of titania, e. g., so-called crystallographic shear planes. While such structures with some limitations can be realised in coatings, the significant disadvantage is that TiOx tends to re-oxidize in air above similar to 380 degrees C. The iso-structural phases in the TiO 2 -Cr 2 O 3 phase diagram can be prepared in air and have stable oxygen content.

These tests were conducted {{in a variety of}} gaseous environments {{in order to determine the}} effects of simulated engine exhaust gas on the carbonaceous gas decomposition lubrication scheme. In rolling tests with steel races and exhaust gas the wear track depth was roughly half that of tests run in nitrogen gas alone. The deposition of lubricous microcrystalline graphitic carbon on the rolling surfaces, generated from the carbon monoxide within the exhaust gas mixture, was verified by microfocused Raman spectroscopy. Ten-fold reductions in rolling wear could be achieved by the exhaust gas atmosphere in cases where water vapor was removed or not present. The exhaust gas mixture alone was not found to provide any lubricating effect on silicon nitride sliding contacts, where the rate of wear greatly exceeds the rate of carbon deposition. Directed admixture of acetylene (as low as 5 % of the exhaust gas flow rates), has provided reductions in both wear volume and coefficient of friction by factors of 60 X and 20 X respectively for sliding contacts during the initial 80 m of sliding distance. Exhaust gas atmosphere with the acetylene admixture provided 65 OX reductions in steady state wear rate compared to that measured for sliding contacts in dry N 2. Such acetylene admixture also augments the ability of the exhaust gas atmosphere to lubricate high-temperature rolling contacts, with up to 25 -fold reductions in wear track depth compared to those measured in the presence of N 2 alone. In addition to providing some lubricating benefit itself, an important potential role of the exhaust gas from rich mixtures would be to shield bearings from 02.

Vehicles to {{be designed}} for exploration of planets and moons {{of the solar system}} will require reliable mechanical drives to operate efficiently. Long-term operation of these drives will be challenging because of extreme operating conditions. These extreme conditions include: very high and/or very cold temperatures, wide temperature ranges, dust, vacuum or low-pressure atmospheres, and corrosive environments. Most drives used on Earth involve oil-lubricated gears. However, due to the extreme conditions on planetary surfaces, it may not be advisable or even possible to use oil <b>lubrication.</b> Unfortunately, <b>solid</b> lubricants do not work well when applied to gears because of the high contact stress conditions and large sliding motion between the teeth, which cause wear and limit life. We believe traction drives will provide an attractive alternative to gear drives. Traction drives are composed of rollers that provide geometry more conducive to <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Minimal slip occurs in this contact geometry and thus there is very low wear to <b>the</b> <b>solid</b> lubricant. <b>The</b> challenge for these solid-lubricated drives is finding materials or coatings that provide the required long-life while also providing high traction. We seek materials that provide low wear with high friction...|$|R
40|$|Weight loss, adherence, {{friction}} and wear of polyimide films and polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride films applied to stainless steel disks and to {{304 stainless steel}} thin foils were studied. The films were exposed at temperatures of 315 D, 345 D, 370 D, or 400 C for 100 hours or more and then evaluated at temperatures of 25 D, 315 D, or 345 C in atmospheres of dry or moist air. Polyimide films {{were found to be}} brittle after thermal exposure; but polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride possessed good adherence and gave low {{friction and}} wear results. Polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride films appear to be good candidates for <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> applications where long thermal soaks are prevalent...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{three studies}} on the surface design, surface engineering, and tribology of chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) diamond films and coatings toward wear-resistant, self-lubricating diamond films and coatings. Friction mechanisms and <b>solid</b> <b>lubrication</b> mechanisms of CVD diamond are stated. Effects of an amorphous hydrogenated carbon on CVD diamond, an amorphous, nondiamond carbon surface layer formed on CVD diamond by carbon and nitrogen ion implantation, and a materials combination of cubic boron nitride and CVD diamond on the adhesion, friction, and wear behaviors of CVD diamond in ultrahigh vacuum are described. How surface modification and the selected materials couple improved the tribological functionality of coatings, giving low coefficient of friction and good wear resistance, is explained...|$|R
