25|$|Research {{into various}} {{prognostic}} factors for ovarian cancer {{is also going}} on. Recent research shows that <b>thrombocytosis</b> predicts lower survival and higher stage cancer. Ongoing research is also investigating the benefits of surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Low {{platelet}} {{concentration is}} thrombocytopenia and {{is due to}} either decreased production or increased destruction. Elevated platelet concentration is <b>thrombocytosis</b> and is either congenital, reactive (to cytokines), or due to unregulated production: one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms or certain other myeloid neoplasms. A disorder of platelet function is a thrombocytopathy.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} modifiable {{risk factors for}} stroke are {{high blood pressure and}} atrial fibrillation although the size of the effect is small with 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking (active and passive), drinking lots of alcohol and drug use, lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption and unhealthy diet. Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, and intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound <b>thrombocytosis</b> and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Erythromelalgia, {{formerly}} known as Mitchell's disease (after Silas Weir Mitchell), is a rare vascular peripheral pain disorder in which blood vessels, usually in the lower extremities or hands, are episodically blocked (frequently on and off daily), then become hyperemic and inflamed. There is severe burning pain (in the small fiber sensory nerves) and skin redness. The attacks are periodic and are commonly triggered by heat, pressure, mild activity, exertion, insomnia or stress. Erythromelalgia may occur either as a primary or secondary disorder (i.e. a disorder {{in and of itself}} or a symptom of another condition). Secondary erythromelalgia can result from small fiber peripheral neuropathy of any cause, polycythemia vera, essential <b>thrombocytosis,</b> hypercholesterolemia, mushroom or mercury poisoning, and some autoimmune disorders. Primary erythromelalgia is caused by mutation of the voltage-gated sodium channel Î±-subunit gene SCN9A.|$|E
500|$|Hematologic {{conditions}} {{associated with}} sluggish blood flow can increase risk for thrombosis. For example, sickle-cell disease (caused by mutations of hemoglobin) {{is regarded as}} a mild prothrombotic state induced by impaired flow. [...] Similarly, myeloproliferative disorders, in which the bone marrow produces too many blood cells, predispose to thrombosis, particularly in polycythemia vera (excess red blood cells) and essential <b>thrombocytosis</b> (excess platelets). Again, these conditions usually warrant specific treatment when identified.|$|E

2500|$|Continued iron {{deficiency}} may progress to anaemia and worsening fatigue. [...] <b>Thrombocytosis,</b> or an elevated platelet count, can also result. [...] A lack of sufficient iron {{levels in the}} blood is a reason that some people cannot donate blood.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{clinically}} important variants are the p190, p210, and p230 isoforms. [...] p190 {{is generally}} associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), while p210 is generally associated with chronic myeloid leukemia {{but can also}} be associated with ALL. [...] p230 is usually associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia associated with neutrophilia and <b>thrombocytosis.</b> [...] Additionally, the p190 isoform can also be expressed as a splice variant of p210.|$|E
2500|$|RCC is also {{associated}} {{with a number of}} paraneoplastic syndromes (PNS) which are conditions caused by either the hormones produced by the tumour or by the body's attack on the tumour and are present in about 20% of those with RCC. These syndromes most commonly affect tissues which have not been invaded by the cancer. The most common PNSs seen in people with RCC are: [...] high blood calcium levels, polycythaemia (the opposite of anemia, due to an overproduction of erythropoietin), <b>thrombocytosis</b> (too many platelets in the blood, leading to an increased tendency for blood clotting and bleeds) and secondary amyloidosis.|$|E
50|$|Scientific {{literature}} sometimes excludes <b>thrombocytosis</b> {{from the}} scope of thrombophilia by definition, but practically, by the definition of thrombophilia as an increased predisposition to thrombosis, <b>thrombocytosis</b> (especially primary <b>thrombocytosis)</b> is a potential cause of thrombophilia. Conversely, secondary <b>thrombocytosis</b> very rarely causes thrombotic complications.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of causes of <b>thrombocytosis</b> are acquired disorders, but in a few cases, they may be congenital, such as <b>thrombocytosis</b> due to congenital asplenia.|$|E

50|$|Often, no {{treatment}} is required or necessary for reactive <b>thrombocytosis.</b> In cases of reactive <b>thrombocytosis</b> {{of more than}} 1,000x109/L, it may be considered to administer daily low dose aspirin (such as 65 mg) {{to minimize the risk}} of stroke or thrombosis.|$|E

50|$|However, {{in primary}} <b>thrombocytosis,</b> if {{platelet}} counts are over 750,000 or 1,000,000, and {{especially if there}} are other risk factors for thrombosis, treatment may be needed. Selective use of aspirin at low doses {{is thought to be}} protective. Extremely high platelet counts in primary <b>thrombocytosis</b> can be treated with hydroxyurea (a cytoreducing agent) or anagrelide (Agrylin).|$|E

50|$|Essential <b>thrombocytosis</b> (ET; {{also known}} as {{essential}} thrombocythemia, essential thrombocythaemia, primary <b>thrombocytosis)</b> is a rare chronic blood disorder characterised by the overproduction of platelets by megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. It may, albeit rarely, develop into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis. It {{is one of four}} myeloproliferative disorders (disorders characterised by increased production of a particular line of blood cell).|$|E
50|$|<b>Thrombocytosis</b> (or thrombocythemia) is the {{presence}} of high platelet counts in the blood, and can be either primary (also termed essential and caused by a myeloproliferative disease) or reactive (also termed secondary). Although often symptomless (particularly when it is a secondary reaction), it can predispose to thrombosis in some patients. <b>Thrombocytosis</b> can be contrasted with thrombocytopenia, a loss of platelets in the blood.|$|E
