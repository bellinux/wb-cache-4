40|$|Cutaneous <b>transilluminators</b> are {{light-emitting}} devices used {{to localize}} blood vessels for various medical procedures. They {{are often used}} in populations that may be {{at increased risk for}} skin burns, such as neonates and the elderly. While there is a known potential for skin burns, {{little is known about the}} ophthalmic risk from the use of these devices. This paper will report on the laboratory evaluation of the potential ocular hazards from <b>transilluminators</b> (TIs). Our results indicate that <b>transilluminators</b> which incorporate white-light LEDs have emissions that have the potential for producing injury to the retina, especially in patients who may have a reduced aversion response...|$|R

50|$|DNA {{as well as}} RNA are {{normally}} visualized by staining with ethidium bromide, which intercalates into the major grooves of the DNA and fluoresces under UV light. The ethidium bromide may {{be added to the}} agarose solution before it gels, or the DNA gel may be stained later after electrophoresis. Destaining of the gel is not necessary but may produce better images. Other methods of staining are available; examples are SYBR Green, GelRed, methylene blue, brilliant cresyl blue, Nile blue sulphate, and crystal violet. SYBR Green, GelRed and other similar commercial products are sold as safer alternatives to ethidium bromide as it {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic in Ames test, although the carcinogenicity of ethidium bromide has not actually been established. SYBR Green requires the use of a blue-light <b>transilluminator.</b> DNA stained with crystal violet can be viewed under natural light without the use of a UV <b>transilluminator</b> which is an advantage, however it may not produce a strong band.|$|E
50|$|Sypro Ruby {{and other}} {{fluorescent}} dyes {{have a broad}} linear range and higher sensitivity than anionic dyes. They are permanent photostable stains that can be visualized with a standard UV or blue-light <b>transilluminator</b> or a laser scan. Membranes can then be documented either on film or digitally using a CCD camera. Sypro Ruby blot staining is time-intensive and tends to saturate above 50 μg of protein per lane.|$|E
5000|$|Damaged DNA - Over-exposure to UV {{radiation}} during {{preparation of}} DNA for ligation {{can damage the}} DNA and significantly reduce transformation efficiency. A higher-wavelength UV radiation (365 nm) which cause less damage to DNA should be used if it is necessary work for work on the DNA on a UV <b>transilluminator</b> {{for an extended period}} of time. Addition of cytidine or guanosine to the electrophoresis buffer at 1 mM concentration however may protect the DNA from damage.|$|E
50|$|A gel doc, {{also known}} as a gel {{documentation}} system, gel image system or gel imager, is equipment widely used in molecular biology laboratories for the imaging and documentation of nucleic acid and protein suspended within polyacrylamide or agarose gels. These gels are typically stained with ethidium bromide or other fluorophores such as SYBR Green. Generally, a gel doc includes an ultraviolet (UV) light <b>transilluminator,</b> a hood or a darkroom to shield external light sources and protect the user from UV exposure, and a CCD or CMOS camera for image capturing.|$|E
5000|$|When {{stained with}} ethidium bromide, the gel is viewed with an {{ultraviolet}} (UV) <b>transilluminator.</b> Standard transilluminators use wavelengths of 302/312-nm (UV-B), however exposure of DNA to UV radiation {{for as little}} as 45 seconds can produce damage to DNA and affect subsequent procedures, for example reducing the efficiency of transformation, in vitro transcription, and PCR. [...] Exposure of the DNA to UV radiation therefore should be limited. Using a higher wavelength of 365 nm (UV-A range) causes less damage to the DNA but also produces much weaker fluorescence with ethidium bromide. Where multiple wavelengths can be selected in the transillumintor, the shorter wavelength would be used to capture images, while the longer wavelength should be used if it is necessary to work on the gel for any extended period of time.|$|E
5000|$|Damage to DNA - Exposure of DNA to UV {{radiation}} {{in standard}} preparative {{agarose gel electrophoresis}} procedure {{for as little as}} 45 seconds can damage the DNA, and this can significantly reduce the transformation efficiency. [...] Adding cytidine or guanosine to the electrophoresis buffer at 1 mM concentration however may protect the DNA from damage. A higher-wavelength UV radiation (365 nm) which cause less damage to DNA should be used if it is necessary work for work on the DNA on a UV <b>transilluminator</b> {{for an extended period of}} time. This longer wavelength UV produces weaker fluorescence with the ethidium bromide intercalated into the DNA, therefore if it is necessary to capture images of the DNA bands, a shorter wavelength (302 or 312 nm) UV radiations may be used. Such exposure however should be limited to a very short time if the DNA is to be recovered later for ligation and transformation.|$|E

40|$|Escherichia coli ribosomes were {{irradiated}} with a KrF {{excimer laser}} (248 nm, 22 ns pulse) with incident pulse energies {{in the range}} of 10 – 40 mJ for a 1 cm 2 area, corresponding to fluences of 4. 5 to 18 × 109 W m– 2, to determine strand breakage yields and the frequency and pattern of RNA–RNA cross- linking in the 16 S rRNA. Samples were irradiated in a cuvette with one laser pulse or in a flow cell with an average of 4. 6 pulses per sample. The yield of strand breaks per photon was intensity dependent, with values of 0. 7 to 1. 3 × 10 – 3 over the incident intensity range studied. The yield for RNA–RNA cross-linking was 3 × 10 – 4 cross-links/photon at the intensity of 4. 5 × 109 W m– 2, an ∼ 4 -fold higher yield per photon than obtained with a <b>transilluminator.</b> The cross-link yield/photon decreased at higher light intensities, probably due to intensity-dependent photoreversal. The pattern of cross-linking was similar to that observed with low intensity irradiation but with four additional long-range cross-links not previously seen in E. coli ribosomes. Cross- linking frequencies obtained with one laser pulse are more correlated to internucleotide distances than are frequencies obtained with <b>transilluminator</b> irradiation...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{study the}} utility of meibography for the {{morphology}} of meibomian glands in normal eyelids and in various eyelid diseases. DesignA cross-sectional study. MethodsA newly designed <b>transilluminator,</b> fitting both the upper along with lower eyelids, and an infrared camera were used to obtain video clips of the meibomian glands for 60 asymptomatic subjects with normal eyelid margin. Parameters studied included, ocular surface, Schirmer test, and tear breakup time (TBUT). The meibomian glands of patients with meibomian glands’ abnormality secondary to infectious, inflammatory, malignant, congenital, or post-radiation therapy disease related etiologies were compared with normal patients. Still pictures were extracted from the video clips to evaluate the meibomian glands for gland dropout and gross morphological changes. ResultsIn normal subjects, meibomian glands appeared to be thinner and longer in the upper eye lids than in the lower eye lids. Gland dropout occured with increased age, more in the lower eye lid and in females. Excessive gland drop out (> 75 %) was seen in patients with history of trachoma, Stevens Johnson syndrome, severe blepharitis, and post-radiation for orbital tumors. Variable gland drop out was noticed in patients with floppy eyelid syndrome, and blepharitis. In patients with congenital distichiasis, partial or complete gland drop out at {{the part of the}} eyelid margins affected by distichiasis was noticed. ConclusionsThe newly designed <b>transilluminator</b> permitted the examination of both upper and lower eye lid meibomian glands with minimal discomfort. Evaluating the anatomical changes involving meibomian glands with meibography may help increase our understanding of the meibomian gland-related diseases, monitor the effects of treatment, and provide helpful information for patient education...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the luminescent center for each material, the photoluminescence spectra were measured. This was accomplished by exciting the samples with a UV <b>transilluminator</b> manufactured by UVP, Inc. (Upland, CA, USA) The photoluminescence was recorded using an Avantes AvaSpec 2048 USB 2 spectrometer (Apeldoorn, The Netherlands), which has a wavelength range of 445 to 680 [*]nm and a resolution of 0.13 [*]nm. The integration time was controlled using the AvaSoft software program (Avantes). The integration time was increased by the software until the photoluminescent emission spectrum reached its maximum that was just below the saturation limit of the spectrometer or until the background could no longer be subtracted due to a large integration time. Once this was determined, 100 spectra were recorded and averaged.|$|E
