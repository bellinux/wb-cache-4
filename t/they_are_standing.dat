500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Walter again goes {{alone to}} visit the graveyard; he tearfully observes a gravestone marked [...] "Peter Bishop 1978-1985", {{suggesting}} that Walter's legitimate son died. Nina Sharp later calls Olivia and implies to her that she can meet William Bell in Manhattan. On the way to the hotel she almost gets into a car crash, at which point she is transported to the parallel universe. After no one shows up at the hotel restaurant. Olivia leaves, as she assumes that she got stood up. However, when in an elevator to leave the building, Olivia is teleported to another location [...] and is directed to an office. After reading a newspaper headline indicating that President Obama was preparing to move into the [...] "new" [...] White House, she is greeted by William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) and inquires where she is. The final shot pans out the window revealing that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> inside the South Tower of the World Trade Center.|$|E
500|$|A large grasshopper, {{such as a}} locust, {{can jump}} about a metre (twenty body lengths) without using its wings; the {{acceleration}} peaks at about 20g. Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate (the ground, a twig, a blade of grass or whatever else <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> on); the reaction force propels them into the air. They jump for several reasons; to escape from a predator, to launch themselves into flight, or simply to move from place to place. For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take-off velocity, since this determines the range. This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement. [...] However, a fundamental property of muscle is that it cannot contract with both high force and high velocity at the same time. Grasshoppers overcome this apparent contradiction by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their muscles.|$|E

2500|$|Louise {{returns to}} the camp as it is being evacuated, and tells Ian that the alien {{language}} is the [...] "weapon"; those who master it are able to perceive the future and past. She has a premonition of a United Nations event, in which Shang thanks her for having convinced him to call off the attack by calling his private number and reciting his wife's dying words. In the present, Louise steals a satellite phone, calls the number, and recites the words. The Chinese announce <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> down and release their twelfth of the message. The other countries follow suit, and the craft disappear.|$|E
2500|$|Breeding {{maturity}} {{is thought}} to be reached at 3-4 years of age. All mating and egg-laying is largely restricted to April and early May. A red-crowned crane pair [...] duets in various situations, helping to establish formation and maintenance of the pair bond, as well as territorial advertisement and agonistic signaling. The pair moves rhythmically until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> close, throwing their heads back and letting out a fluting call in unison, often triggering other pairs to start duetting, as well. As it is occurs year around, the social implications of dancing are complex in meaning. However, dancing behavior is generally thought to show excitement in the species. To strengthen the bond, red-crowned cranes engage in dual honking rituals before performing a dance.|$|E
2500|$|To sum up, the map in Pont's 'Cuninghame' of 1604 - 8 shows two buildings, [...] "Reuincraige" [...] and [...] "Corshill", at {{approximately}} NS 417 467 and NS 422 465 respectively, and Dobie comments {{that the two}} have often been confused, but that [...] "Reuincraig" [...] stood {{on the west side}} of the Corsehill Burn [...] and [...] "Corsehill Mansion" [...] on its east. [...] "Reuincraig", he says, was [...] ".. so modernised about 1840 that it was difficult to realise that it had been ruined in 1608", while the ruins of 'Corsehill House' were removed about the beginning of the 19th century and only foundations could be traced when he wrote. He also thought that [...] "Reuincraig" [...] (i.e. Ruin Craig) was not an original name. If Dobie is correct, the ruins published as [...] "Corsehill Castle" [...] on the OS 6", must be those of [...] "Reuincraig", both because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> remains, and because they are on the west bank of the burn.|$|E

2500|$|Roman {{writing as}} a whole {{demonstrates}} a deep ambivalence towards the gladiatoria munera. Even the most complex and sophisticated munera of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral dii manes of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of sacrificium. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative. Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: [...] "Even when [...] have been felled, let alone when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>standing</b> and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has {{been brought to the}} ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" [...] His own death would later emulate this example. Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius, publicly and scathingly, as a bustuariusâ€“ literally, a [...] "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. Such finer distinctions aside, [...] "gladiator" [...] could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and [...] "Samnite" [...] doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type. Silius Italicus wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: [...] "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [...] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua." [...] Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.|$|E

6000|$|Half an {{hour later}} she thought it time to join the young people, urged largely by the frantic {{interest}} of her daughter. But she returned from the half-open door without entering.

6000|$|Then I saw in my dream, {{that the}} Shining Men bid them {{call at the}} gate; the which, when they did, some looked from above over the gate, to wit, Enoch, Moses, and Elijah, &c., to whom it was said, These pilgrims are come from the City of Destruction, for the love that they bear to the King of this place; and then the pilgrims gave in unto them each man his certificate,[327] which they had {{received}} in the beginning; those, therefore, were carried into the King, who, when He had read them, said, Where are the men?
