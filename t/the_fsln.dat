25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> {{also won}} 38 {{seats in the}} congressional elections, {{becoming}} the party with the largest representation in parliament. The split in the Constitutionalist Liberal Party helped to allow <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> to become the largest party in Congress, however the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> and MRS, and the liberal party combined {{is larger than the}} Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen raised accusations about <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> presumably attempting to buy votes in order to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984. In 2011, Ortega was re-elected as President.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> {{remains one}} of Nicaragua's two leading parties. <b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> often polls in {{opposition}} to the Constitutionalist Liberal Party, or PLC. In the 2006 Nicaraguan general election, former FSLN President Daniel Ortega was re-elected President of Nicaragua with 38.7% of the vote compared to 29% for his leading rival, bringing in the country's second Sandinista government after 16 years of the opposition winning elections. Ortega and <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> were re-elected again in the presidential elections of November 2011 and of November 2016.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> {{evolved from}} one of many {{opposition}} groups to {{a leadership role in}} the overthrow of the Somoza regime. By mid-April 1979, five guerrilla fronts opened under the joint command of <b>the</b> <b>FSLN,</b> including an internal front in the capital city Managua. Young guerrilla cadres and the National Guardsmen were clashing almost daily in cities throughout the country. The strategic goal of the Final Offensive was the division of the enemy's forces. Urban insurrection was the crucial element because <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> could never hope to achieve simple superiority in men and firepower over the National Guard.|$|E

25|$|The most contested {{debate at}} the {{congress}} {{was on the}} Nicaraguan revolution. Two views developed inside the United Secretariat, but both supported <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> and argued for {{the building of a}} section of the International inside <b>the</b> <b>FSLN.</b> This approach was disputed by the tendency of Nahuel Moreno, which split to merge briefly with the tendency led by Pierre Lambert.|$|E
25|$|In recent times, {{there has}} been a dispute between <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> and the {{dissident}} Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) about the use of the red and black flag in public activities. Although the MRS has its own flag (orange with a silhouette of Sandino's hat in black), they also use the red-and-black flag in honor of Sandino's legacy. They state that the red-and-black flag is a symbol of Sandinismo as a whole, not only of <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> party.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Ortega {{was once}} again re-elected as leader of <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> in March 2002 and re-elected as {{president}} of Nicaragua in November 2006.|$|E
25|$|Pro-Ortega {{legislators are}} running for reelection {{together}} with cadres from the party structures and a few political figures from {{what is left of}} <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> Convergence alliance, such as Social Christian Agustín Jarquín, Conservative Miriam Argüello and Liberal Julia Mena, all former opponents of Ortega.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1979, at {{the peak}} of the Sandinista's Revolutionary War, one of <b>the</b> five <b>FSLN's</b> Regional Commands in control of 24 cities altogether, was named after him. Unluckily, <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> [...] "Rigoberto Lopez Perez" [...] Western Command was {{captured}} in full in a safe house in the suburbs of Leon and killed in captivity by dictator Somoza's forces. The cold-blooded massacre of this Command, made up of Oscar Perez Cassar, Roger Deshon, Araceli Perez Darias, Idania Fernandez, Carlos Manuel Jarquin and Edgard Lang Sacasa, enraged the Sandinistas and accelerated the fall of the Somoza regime.|$|R
50|$|The Sandinista {{revolution}} {{that started in}} the mid-1970s and the Contra war that followed brought the first large waves of Nicaraguan refugees into the U.S. As {{a result of the}} de-privatization reforms under <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> rule (from 1979 to 1990), the first wave of approximately 120,000 Nicaraguans left Nicaragua and entered the United States.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> {{lost power}} in the presidential {{election}} of 1990 when Daniel Ortega was defeated in an election for the Presidency of Nicaragua by Violetta Chamorro.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> {{originated}} in the milieu of various oppositional organizations, youth and student groups in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The University of Léon, and the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN) in Managua {{were two of the}} principal centers of activity. Inspired by the Revolution and the FLN in Algeria, <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> itself was founded in 1961 by Carlos Fonseca, , Tomás Borge and others as The National Liberation Front (FLN). Only Tomás Borge lived long enough to see the Sandinista victory in 1979.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> overthrew Anastasio Somoza Debayle in 1979, {{ending the}} Somoza dynasty, and {{established}} a revolutionary government in its place. Following their seizure of power, the Sandinistas ruled Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990, first {{as part of a}} Junta of National Reconstruction. Following the resignation of centrist members from this Junta, <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> took exclusive power in March 1981. They instituted a policy of mass literacy, devoted significant resources to health care, and promoted gender equality, but came under international criticism for human rights abuses, mass execution and oppression of indigenous peoples. A militia, known as the Contras, was formed in 1981 to overthrow the Sandinista government and was funded and trained by the US Central Intelligence Agency. In 1984 elections were held but were boycotted by some opposition parties. <b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> won the majority of the votes, and those who opposed the Sandinistas won approximately a third of the seats. The civil war between the Contras and the government continued until 1989. After revising the constitution in 1987, and after years of fighting the Contras, <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> lost what many consider the first truly democratic election in 1990 to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro but retained a plurality of seats in the legislature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shift in}} popular outlook {{may have been}} made {{possible}} by the division of powers among the Sandinista commanders after their electoral defeat. Bayardo Arce Castaño became head of <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> newspapers, radio stations, and television programs and was planning to establish a Sandinista television station. Significantly, the first disagreement aired in Barricada was between Arce and Daniel Ortega.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of the repressive campaign of the National Guard, in 1975 a group within <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> urban mobilization arm began to question the viability of the GPP. In the view of the young orthodox Marxist intellectuals, such as Jaime Wheelock, economic development had turned Nicaragua into a nation of factory workers and wage-earning farm laborers. Wheelock's faction was known as the [...] "Proletarian Tendency".|$|R
5000|$|The {{election}} date, November 4 {{was selected}} so that Nicaragua {{would have a}} legitimate, elected government in place before the anticipated reelection of Ronald Reagan in the United States on November 6. [...] "The Sandinistas hoped that a competitive election with heavy turnout would deter a U.S. military intervention and reassure <b>the</b> <b>FSLN’s</b> defenders. So <b>the</b> Sandinistas’ decision to hold elections in 1984 was largely of foreign inspiration”.|$|R
25|$|The {{electoral reforms}} {{introduced}} in January 2000, {{as a result}} of the pact between the PLC and <b>the</b> <b>FSLN,</b> established new rules for the contending parties in the elections.|$|E
25|$|This two-party system, {{with two}} {{dominant}} political parties, has survived until our {{days with the}} difference that the two rival forces today are <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> and the self-appointed Democratic Forces (anti-Sandinistas).|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{estimated}} {{material damage}} from the revolutionary war to be US$480million. <b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> took over a nation plagued by malnutrition, disease, and pesticide contaminations. Lake Managua was considered dead because of decades of pesticide runoff, toxic chemical pollution from lakeside factories, and untreated sewage. Soil erosion and dust storms were also a problem in Nicaragua at the time due to deforestation. To tackle these crises, <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> created the Nicaraguan Institute of Natural Resources and the Environment. It was created 10 years after the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1977, a {{group of}} {{prominent}} Nicaraguan professionals, business leaders, and clergymen allied with the Terceristas to form [...] "El Grupo de los Doce" [...] (The Group of Twelve) in Costa Rica. The group's main idea was to organize a provisional government in Costa Rica. The new strategy of the Terceristas also included unarmed strikes and rioting by labor and student groups coordinated by <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> [...] "United People's Movement" [...] (Movimiento Pueblo Unido – MPU).|$|R
2500|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> {{defeat at}} <b>the</b> battle of Pancasán in 1967, the {{organization}} adopted the [...] "Prolonged Popular War" [...] (Guerra Popular Prolongada, GPP) theory as its strategic doctrine. The GPP {{was based on}} the [...] "accumulation of forces in silence": while the urban organization recruited on the university campuses and robbed money from banks, the main cadres were to permanently settle in the north central mountain zone. There they would build a grassroots peasant support base in preparation for renewed rural guerrilla warfare.|$|R
50|$|Pastora was put {{in command}} of <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> Southern Front, {{advancing}} on the town of Rivas from bases in Costa Rica. In reaction to Pastora's widely held reputation, Somoza sent his best troops against him {{and as a consequence}} the Southern Front made little headway while suffering heavy casualties. However, the Southern Front contributed to the Sandinista victory by tying down over 2,000 heavily equipped Nicaraguan National Guard forces, as Somoza remained fixated on stopping Pastora, even as major cities fell to the rebels.|$|R
25|$|Humberto Ortega, {{leader of}} <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> Insurrectional Tendency (Tercerista) in the 1970s, chief {{strategist}} of the anti-Somoza urban insurrection; Minister of Defense in the 1980s during the Contra war. Brother of Daniel Ortega.|$|E
25|$|In May 1979, another {{general strike}} was called, and <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> {{launched}} a major push {{to take control}} of the country. By mid July they had Somoza and the National Guard isolated in Managua.|$|E
25|$|In November 2000, Nicaragua held {{municipal}} elections. Alemán's PLC won {{a majority}} of the overall mayoral races. <b>The</b> <b>FSLN</b> fared considerably better in larger urban areas, winning a significant number of departmental capitals including - Managua.|$|E
5000|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> {{defeat at}} <b>the</b> battle of Pancasán in 1967, the {{organization}} adopted the [...] "Prolonged Popular War" [...] (Guerra Popular Prolongada, GPP) theory as its strategic doctrine.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FSLN's</b> {{literacy}} campaign sent teachers {{into the countryside}} and within six months, {{half a million people}} had been taught rudimentary reading, bringing the national illiteracy rate down from over 50% to just under 12%. Over 100,000 Nicaraguans participated as literacy teachers. One of the stated aims of the {{literacy campaign}} was to create a literate electorate which would be able to make informed choices at the promised elections. The successes of the literacy campaign was recognized by UNESCO with the award of a Nadezhda Krupskaya International Prize.|$|R
2500|$|Daniel Ortega {{agreed to}} [...] "unofficial meetings" [...] with KGB officers. He gave Nikolai Leonov a secret {{program of the}} Sandinista movement, which stated <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> intent to lead class {{struggle}} in Central America, in alliance with Cuba and the Soviet bloc. However Leonov stated that he became friends with many Latin Americans including some leaders, and that he and other Soviets supported the struggles of left wing groups. But he clarifies {{that he did not}} let people know that he was a KGB agent and that his relationships with them did not involve Intelligence.|$|R
25|$|In 1975, Somoza {{imposed a}} state of siege, {{censoring}} the press, and threatening all opponents with internment and torture. Somoza's National Guard also increased its violence against individuals and communities suspected of collaborating with the Sandinistas. Many of <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> guerrillas were killed, including its leader and founder Carlos Fonseca in 1976. Fonseca had returned to Nicaragua in 1975 from his exile in Cuba to try to reunite fractures that existed in <b>the</b> <b>FSLN.</b> He and his group were betrayed by a peasant who informed the National Guard {{that they were in}} the area. The guerrilla group was ambushed, and Fonseca was wounded in the process. The next morning Fonseca was executed by the National Guard.|$|E
25|$|PLC {{leaders also}} invited all {{dissident}} Liberals outside the PLC {{to participate in}} these primaries, voting for the candidate they consider best able to defeat <b>the</b> <b>FSLN,</b> then rejoining the fold come what may. José Rizo won the PLC primary elections.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Ortega was re-elected {{as leader}} of <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> in 1998. Municipal {{elections}} in November 2000 saw a strong Sandinista vote, especially in urban areas, and former Tourism Minister Herty Lewites was elected mayor of Managua. This result led to expectations of a close race in the presidential elections scheduled for November 2001. Daniel Ortega and Enrique Bolaños of the Constitutional Liberal Party (PLC) ran neck-and-neck in the polls {{for much of the}} campaign, but in the end the PLC won a clear victory. The results of these elections were that <b>the</b> <b>FSLN</b> won 42.6% of the vote for parliament (versus 52.6% for the PLC), giving them 41 out of the 92 seats in the National Assembly (versus 48 for the PLC). In the presidential race, Ortega lost to Bolaños 46.3% to 53.6%.|$|E

5000|$|An armed {{conflict}} soon arose, {{adding to the}} destabilization of the region which had been unfolding through the Central American civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. The Contras, heavily backed by the CIA, secretly opened a [...] "second front" [...] on Nicaragua's Atlantic coast and Costa Rican border. [...] With the civil war opening up cracks in the national revolutionary project, <b>the</b> <b>FSLN's</b> military budget grew to {{more than half of}} the annual budget. [...] The Servicio Militar Patriótico (Patriotic Military Service), a compulsory draft, was also established.|$|R
