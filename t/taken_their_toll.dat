The following day, the Supreme Court's New York Times Co. v. United States decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in The Times and others resumed. In July 1971, Bantam Books published an inexpensive paperback edition of the papers containing the material The Times had published.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the German night fighter intruders began {{achieving}} substantial successes. British ground defences, {{which had}} <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on the German units in 1940, were now side-stepped by {{a decision to}} shift the area of operations to the North Sea, by the English coast. In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 over the sea. In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types destroyed and a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes. German losses amounted to 27 destroyed and 31 damaged to all causes.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} {{reticulate}} whipray as Vulnerable. Its large size, inshore habitat preferences, and slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing. Although specific data is lacking, significant declines in overall ray catches {{have been documented}} within its range, including in the Gulf of Thailand, the Arafura Sea, and off Pakistan. Habitat degradation also threatens this species: over 30% of the mangroves in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared since 1980, while pollution and destructive fishing practices may have also <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll.</b> Australian waters offer the reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure, as there it is not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) have reduced bycatch mortality. However, there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} is vulnerable {{on the issue}} of infrastructure. Although water infrastructure has taken centre stage in the campaign; interruptions to the electricity supply, poor service levels on ferries and trains, and controversies surrounding major road projects have <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on the government's image.|$|E
25|$|Moore's {{earlier years}} of heavy drinking, {{sleeping}} dysfunctional hours, continual travelling and often eating takeaway foods {{resulted in a}} decline in health and several operations.

25|$|Unfortunately, {{months without}} {{maintenance}} during the strike had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on many coal mines. Denton Colliery had flooded {{to the extent}} that it was no longer workable and the Denton Colliery Co. went into voluntary liquidation in 1929. The headstock was demolished in 1932 and the shaft was finally filled and capped in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Yankalilla lies inland on the Fleurieu Peninsula, a small {{protruding}} {{stretch of}} land {{south of the}} Adelaide Plains. It is situated in the valley carved by the Bungala River, which meets the sea at the coast {{not far from the}} town, at nearby Normanville. The natural vegetation is dominated by Eucalypts and other southern natives, although grasses and weeds have <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on many species.|$|E
25|$|During the Roman period, {{this part}} of the Cumbrian {{coastline}} was fortified, as coastal defences were constructed beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall to protect against incursions across the Solway Firth. Milefortlets 14, 15, 16, and 17 are all located nearby, with milefortlet 16 being the closest. However, centuries of coastal erosion have <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll,</b> and today, only the rear eastern rampart of milefortlet 16 survives.|$|E

25|$|Around {{fifty years}} {{after the fall of}} the city to the Ottomans, Atık Ali Paşa, the Grand Vizier of Sultan Bayezid II, ordered the Chora Church to be {{converted}} into a mosque — Kariye Camii. Due to the prohibition against iconic images in Islam, the mosaics and frescoes were covered behind a layer of plaster. This and frequent earthquakes in the region have <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on the artwork.|$|E
25|$|The siege {{continued}} {{throughout the}} summer of 117, but the years of constant campaigning in the baking eastern heat had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on Trajan, who suffered a heatstroke. He decided to begin the long journey back to Rome in order to recover. Sailing from Seleucia, the emperor's health deteriorated rapidly. He was taken ashore at Selinus in Cilicia, where he died, and his successor, Hadrian, assumed the reins of government in 118.|$|E
25|$|German {{production}} was only just {{keeping pace with}} night-fighter losses. Some 2,375 aircraft were lost and only 2,613 were built in factories or re-entered the frontlines from repair workshops. The overall numbers fell from 76% of establishment to 63% in 1943. Serviceability fell from 72% to 66%. The battles had also <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on the RAF. The Ruhr battle had cost the RAF 923 bombers, another 813 were lost over Hamburg.|$|E

25|$|In April 1764 Trial was recommissioned under Commander James Wallace. She sailed for the Bahamas {{two months}} later. Her years of active service had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll,</b> however, {{and she was}} {{decommissioned}} again in September. An extensive refit was required, but no progress was made for three years, despite a fresh naval survey in October 1766. Repairs finally commenced in December 1767, lasting eleven months and costing £5,442, significantly more than the original construction cost of the ship.|$|E
25|$|On 16 March 2005, McClelland {{left the}} band, with Lightbody stating 'a {{whole new set}} of new and {{unexpected}} pressures... have unfortunately <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on working relationships within the band, and it was felt the band could not move forward with Mark as a member.' At the end of March 2005, former Terra Diablo member Paul Wilson was announced as the official replacement for McClelland and Snow Patrol also declared longtime touring keyboardist Tom Simpson an official member of the band.|$|E
25|$|Once {{he joined}} the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his {{trademark}} goggles (he briefly ditched them in the 1979–80 season). Years of battling under NBA backboards, and being hit and scratched in the face in the process, had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on his eyes and he developed corneal erosion syndrome, where the eyes begin to dry out easily and cease to produce moisture. He missed one game in the 1986–87 season due to his eyes drying out and swelling as a result.|$|E

25|$|Theodore's {{years of}} exile, regular fasting, and {{exceptional}} exertions had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll,</b> and in 826 he became quite ill. In this year, he dictated his Testament, {{a form of}} spiritual guidance for the future abbots of the Stoudios monastery, to his disciple Naukratios. He died on the 11 of November of that same year, while celebrating mass, apparently in the monastery of Hagios Tryphon on Cape Akritas in Bithynia. Eighteen years later, his remains, {{along with those of}} his brother Joseph, were brought back to the Stoudios Monastery, where they were interred beside the grave of their uncle Platon.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in its history, the church would finally take a stable form. No major work beyond routine repair was done until after World War II, when various storms damaged the roof. However, in 1950 a {{hurricane}} blew the roof completely off. While the church was able to repair it and in fact make further improvements such as adding telephone service and a public address system, the years had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> and in 1964 the congregation had acquired land in the Town of Newburgh on which to build a new edifice. Three years later, they deconsecrated Davis's building and moved out.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{military}} threat of Angmar had been destroyed, the North-kingdom was ended. The long wars {{and a series}} of natural disasters had <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> <b>toll</b> on the population of Eriador, and the Dúnedain especially were few in number and unable to maintain a kingdom. In T.A. 1976, Aranarth, Arvedui's oldest son, took the title of Chieftain of the Dúnedain. He and his descendants led the Rangers of the North; Aragorn II was the sixteenth Chieftain until he restored the Kingdom of Arnor in T.A. 3019. The Kingdom of Arthedain had included the Shire (founded in T.A. 1601); in T.A. 1979, the Hobbits there chose a Thain to represent the royal authority.|$|E
