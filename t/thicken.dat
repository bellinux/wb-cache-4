30|$|A {{total of}} 29 CBCT scans met the {{inclusion}} criteria for evaluation, and 93.1 % {{of them had}} maxillary sinus mucosal/tissue <b>thickening.</b> Specifically, 6.9 % of cases exhibited no <b>thickening,</b> 6.9 % had minimal <b>thickening</b> (1 – 2  mm), 20.7 % of cases had moderate <b>thickening</b> (2 – 5  mm), and 65.5 % had severe <b>thickening</b> (> 5  mm).

However, patients {{with a history of}} periodontal diseases demonstrated a significant association with mucosal <b>thickening</b> (p[*]=[*] 0.0043).

30|$|<b>Thickening</b> of the bowel wall is {{considered}} focal when it extends less than 5  cm [3, 11]. Focal <b>thickening</b> {{may be caused}} by tumours or by inflammatory conditions, and distinguishing between the two conditions should be attempted. In addition to the clinical presentation, analysis of the wall symmetry, degree of <b>thickening</b> and perienteric abnormalities provides additional information for the correct diagnosis. In the setting of focal wall <b>thickening</b> three main scenarios may occur: (1) asymmetric focal <b>thickening,</b> (2) symmetric focal <b>thickening</b> and (3) perienteric abnormalities (fat stranding) disproportionately greater than the degree of wall <b>thickening.</b>|$|R
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they <b>thicken</b> cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm to pass along the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also <b>thicken</b> cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E

The turret featured an increase to 20mm at 18 degrees sloping. This time it was designated T-26-1 (known as the T-26 mod. 1939 in modern sources).

Therefore, we researched to get viscosity value in same concentration (2 % in water) to use 24 <b>thickening</b> agents. There are 3 times different viscosity value between highest and lowest <b>thickening</b> agents. If we make criteria which value over 350 mPa・s is high power <b>thickening</b> agent, 8 <b>thickening</b> agents are adapted. The Japanese Society of Dysphagia Rebilitation make criteria which show three different viscosity value.

We researched how concentration indicate these viscosity values to use 12 <b>thickening</b> agents. The lowest <b>thickening</b> agent in milder thick is 0. 4 - 0. 8 g/ 100 ml water, and the highest <b>thickening</b> agent is 0. 8 - 1. 6 g/ 100 ml ater.

This study focuses on the design and development of a novel magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-based linear damper. First, micron-sized carbonyl iron particles, at a 20 % and 80 % weight fraction, were immersed among the shear <b>thickening</b> fluid base and thoroughly mixed under a high shear condition to produce the magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid. Then, a monotube damper with a bypass was designed and fabricated. The testing results using an MTS machine show that the influence of incorporating shear <b>thickening</b> fluid allows the 20 % magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-filled damper to work in different dynamic loading velocities with the stiffness and damping changed, while, simultaneously, {{the dynamics of the}} damper depend on the variations in the magnetic field. The measured responses of the 20 % magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-filled damper prove that the dampers have both the MR effect and shear <b>thickening</b> effect. In contrast, the 80 % magnetorheological shear <b>thickening</b> fluid-filled damper behaves more like a conventional magnetorheological fluid-filled damper because its shear <b>thickening</b> effect is restrained and the MR effect becomes more obvious with higher iron volume...|$|R
5|$|The {{pectoral}} girdle is well known. Both {{the left and}} right scapulae and coracoids are known, though incomplete. The scapulae are large, and robust, and <b>thicken</b> as they near the glenoids. The scapular blades are flat, although they are both convex along the anterior edge. Where the scapulae and coracoids articulate, the coracoids are thickest, and they become gradually thinner as they gain distance from the scapulae. The younger specimen of Patagosaurus possesses a slightly different morphology of the {{pectoral girdle}}, with slightly differing proportions, such as a slightly smaller scapular blade. The coracoids resemble Barapasaurus in shape, and differ from Camarasaurus, although they cannot be directly compared with those of Cetiosaurus.|$|E
5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have to <b>thicken</b> with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to <b>thicken</b> and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
40|$|The role of {{interactions}} between close {{particles in the}} shear <b>thickening</b> of concentrated colloids is examined by using a Stokesian dynamics simulation of model systems. The interactions are repulsive thermodynamic forces and lubrication forces. Three different models are contrasted in their <b>thickening</b> behavior: Brownian spheres, polymer coated spheres, and Hookian spheres. Respectively, they show: a "mild" continuous <b>thickening,</b> a "strong" continuous <b>thickening,</b> and a strain <b>thickening</b> with loss of steady state. The relationship of order-disorder transitions and <b>thickening</b> is examined. Depending on the volume fraction and range of repulsive forces, <b>thickening</b> can be observed with or without an order-disorder transition at its onset. The different <b>thickening</b> responses arise from the dependence of the relaxation time of close particle contacts on interparticle gap. A time-scale based criterion for strong <b>thickening</b> is proposed {{and supported by the}} simulations. A simple theoretical model based the motion of a pair of particles leads to this criterion, but also predicts the mild <b>thickening</b> of Brownian spheres. It gives a simple fitting of flow curves which includes the details of the interparticle interactions. (C) 2004 The Society of Rheology. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective In {{this article}} we present a {{simplified}} algorithm-based approach to the <b>thickening</b> of the small and large bowel wall detected on routine computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen. Background <b>Thickening</b> of the small or large bowel wall {{may be caused by}} neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, or ischae-mic conditions. First, distinction should be made between focal and segmental or diffuse wall <b>thickening.</b> In cases of focal <b>thickening</b> further analysis of the wall symmetry and perienteric anomalies allows distinguishing between neo-plasms and inflammatory conditions. In cases of segmental or diffuse <b>thickening,</b> the pattern of attenuation in light of clinical findings helps narrowing the differential diagnosis. Conclusion Focal bowel wall <b>thickening</b> may be caused by tumours or inflammatory conditions. Bowel tumours may ap-pear as either regular and symmetric or irregular or asymmetric <b>thickening.</b> When fat stranding is disproportionatelymore severe than the degree of wall <b>thickening,</b> inflammatory conditions are more likely. With the exception of lymphoma, segmental or diffuse wall <b>thickening</b> is usually caused by benign conditions, such as ischaemic, infectious and inflammatory diseases. Key points • <b>Thickening</b> of the bowel wall may be focal ( 40 cm) in extension. • Focal, irregular and asymmetrical <b>thickening</b> of the bowel wall suggests a malignancy. • Perienteric fat stranding disproportionally more severe than the degree of wall <b>thickening</b> suggests an inflammatory condition. • Regular, symmetric and homogeneous wall <b>thickening</b> is more frequently due to benign conditions, but can also be caused by neoplasms such as well-differentiated adenocar-cinoma and lymphoma. • Segmental or diffuse bowel wall <b>thickening</b> is usually caused by ischaemic, inflammatory or infectious conditions and the attenuation pattern is helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes.

5|$|Clam dip is {{typically}} prepared using chopped or minced clams, sour cream or cream cheese, and various seasonings, and usually served chilled. It {{is used as}} a dip for potato chips, bread, crackers, and crudités. It has a creamy texture and mouthfeel. Canned, cooked, and frozen or fresh clams may be used, the latter of which can be cooked by steaming or pan cooking. Canned clams can be drained, or the liquid can be retained and used as an ingredient. After refrigeration, the dip may <b>thicken,</b> and the liquid from canned clams can be used to thin the dip. Milk or cream is also sometimes used to thin clam dip. When refrigerated overnight, the flavors of the ingredients intermingle more greatly, resulting in a more flavorful dip. Smoked clams are sometimes used, which imbues a distinct smoky flavor to the dip. The clams can be smoked in the shell and then minced afterward.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla has -shaped spores with {{dimensions}} of 10–146–8µm. In 1927, George Willard Martin examined the microscopic features of {{various members of}} the Nidulariaceae family, including Cyathus olla. He noted that in this species, the basidia—spore-bearing cells—are club-shaped or cylindrical and have long stems, and they sometimes have a clamp connection at the basal end of the structure. Basidia typically hold between two and four sessile spores that are directly attached to the basidium, rather than via a sterigma. Revealed only after the spore is separated, a temporary apiculus marks the point of attachment. The spores are generally separated from the basidia when the latter collapse and gelatinize; this basidial breakdown typically occurs simultaneously with a gelatinization of cells lining the inside wall of the peridiole. After separating from the basidia the outer wall of the spores may <b>thicken,</b> although they generally do not increase in size.|$|E

30|$|Bowel wall <b>thickening</b> may be focal and {{segmental}} or diffuse.

Disproportionate fat stranding compared to the degree of wall <b>thickening</b> suggests inflammatory conditions. Segmental or diffuse bowel thickenings are usually caused by benign conditions, with the exception of lymphoma. Common causes include ischaemia, inflammatory and infectious conditions.

5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then <b>thicken</b> and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
5|$|The soft, thin flesh {{ranges from}} white to {{yellowish}} to golden-orange. It has an odour and taste described variously as indistinct, or unpleasant and earthy. The spore print is white to cream. The oval spores are 5.5–7 by 4–4.5micrometres (µm), with walls {{that tend to}} <b>thicken</b> in age. The spores are cyanophilous, meaning that they will readily stain dark blue in methyl blue solution. Staining with Melzer's reagent often produces a dextrinoid (reddish-brown) colour reaction. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 25–40 by 5–8µm, and can be two-, three-, or four-spored. Cystidia (large sterile cells on the hymenium) are absent.

5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a glassy breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and <b>thicken</b> as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E
