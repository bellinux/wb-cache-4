5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the stop lines and the {{anti-tank}} islands that followed was <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> enemy, slowing progress and restricting the route of an attack. The need to prevent tanks from breaking through was of key importance. Consequently, the defences generally ran along pre-existing barriers to tanks such as rivers and canals; railway embankments and cuttings; thick woods; and other natural obstacles. Where possible, usually well-drained land was allowed to flood, making the ground too soft to support even tracked vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was known}} for his {{composure}} and ability to score several goals for his team as a forward, Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker, where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward, due to his ball skills and creative ability, which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link-up play. A quick, elegant, intelligent, and technically gifted player, his excellent first touch, quick feet, dribbling ability, and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations, while his attacking movement, physique, balance, and close control allowed him <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball and create space for teammates; his vision and passing range with both feet, despite being naturally right-footed, subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on-running strikers. Bergkamp often stated he preferred playing in this deeper role, as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals, rather than scoring them himself.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher {{began to}} pull clear {{from the rest of}} the field and set {{consecutive}} fastest laps. Barrichello began <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> McLaren drivers to allow his teammate to extend his lead. Further down the field, Trulli passed Ralf Schumacher to take seventh position on lap two. Heidfeld was overtaken by Alesi for 14th on the same lap. On the following lap, Ralf Schumacher retook seventh position from Trulli. Heidfeld lost a further position to Fisichella on lap four. Ralf Schumacher started to challenge Frentzen for sixth position on the fifth lap. At the front of the pack, Michael Schumacher was in control, extending his lead over Barrichello to five seconds by lap ten. Button took tenth position from Irvine on lap twelve, while Heidfeld collided with Alesi, sending his teammate into a spin who rejoined in 18th. Button moved into ninth place when he passed Salo on lap 13. Zonta, who was running 17th, suffered brake problems on lap 17 and collided with the tyre barriers which caused him to retire from the Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|The {{station has}} beige wall tiles with intertwining blue and orange stripes, {{representing}} the two {{colors of the}} New York City flag, and {{the colors of the}} IND Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines which serve the station. There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at the east end of the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 turnstiles and two high-exit-only turnstiles. The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance turnstiles (HEETs), and two high exit turnstiles. The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set of plywood cutout figures appearing <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ceiling of the mezzanine. The station also features a control tower. The station is ADA-accessible via an elevator installed at 179th Place {{on the north side of}} Hillside Avenue.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all have certain basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Nakajima {{once again}} {{participated in the}} Junior League in June 2007, {{finishing}} in third place for his block with four points, behind Hijikata and Kondo. The league was won by American wrestler Chris Sabin, setting up a title match between Sabin and Nakajima on August 26, 2007, in which Nakajima was victorious. On September 1, 2007, Nakajima challenged Pro Wrestling Noah's Takeshi Morishima for his ROH World Championship in the main event of a Kensuke Office show, putting up a good fight but losing in the end. On September 19, 2007, Nakajima was pinned in a tag team match by visiting luchador Silver King, who then challenged Nakajima to a future junior heavyweight title match. The match was made official for October 18, 2007 at All Japan's 35th anniversary show; on October 8, 2007, Nakajima suffered a fractured navicular bone in his right hand, forcing him off of several shows on the tour, though he defended the title as scheduled. When the match came, Nakajima and Silver King fought to a no contest, forcing PWF commissioner Hiroshi Hase <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> title belt, although Nakajima remained the official champion. Katsuhiko then took time off to nurse his injured hand.|$|E

5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese {{were able}} to land a force around Banten Bay and Marek, on the western tip of Java, and {{subsequently}} began advancing east towards Batavia and Buitenzorg, forcing Blackforce to reorientate itself east of the Tjianten River, to make a stand south of Buitenzorg. On 3 March, the battalion went into action around Leuwiliang {{for the first time}} as Dutch troops began to withdraw. Occupying positions in support of the 2/2nd Pioneers who held the bridge over the Tjianten River, they were alerted to the advancing Japanese by the presence of fifth columnists, who were seen to be laying out marking panels. A short time later, a force of five Japanese light tanks attempted to cross the river, but were rebuffed by anti-tank rifles and small arms. The plan had been for the Dutch troops to make a stand at Djasinga, but faulty intelligence resulted in a rout and the Dutch began to withdraw back to Bandung, flooding through Blackforce's lines. In the ensuing chaos, Dutch engineers blew up the bridge at the Tjianten River. For the next couple of days, the battalion fought several skirmishes with 'C' Company bearing the brunt of the Japanese attacks, suffering seven killed and 28 wounded, while inflicting about 200 casualties on the Japanese. As the Allied defence of the island began to collapse, the machine gunners were ordered <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Japanese around Leuwiliang for a day. After this, Blackforce began moving towards Soekaboemi on 5 March, as part of efforts to reach Tjilatjap on the southern coast of the island to secure passage back to Australia. Ultimately, this never eventuated and Blackforce was ordered to surrender on 9 March 1942 following the Dutch capitulation the day before. They would subsequently endure three-and-a-half years in captivity as Japanese prisoners of war, being sent to camps across south-east Asia, including the infamous Thai–Burma Railway. Forced to endure brutal conditions, over worked in labour camps, and inadequately provided for, casualties amongst these men were high.|$|E

25|$|Retreat mining is {{a method}} in which the pillars or coal ribs used <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mine roof are extracted; {{allowing}} the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance.

25|$|The kondō, located {{side-by-side}} to the Pagoda in Sai-in, {{is another}} one of the oldest wood buildings extant in the world. The hall measures 18.5 meters by 15.2 meters. The hall is two storied, with roofs curved in the corners but only the first story has a double roof (裳階 mokoshi). This was added later in the Nara period with extra posts <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> original first roof because it extended more than four meters past the building.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the extreme}} dangers {{inherent}} with no man's land, specialized tools and methods were implemented to make the process quieter and more effective. Pickets, or metal posts, were originally used <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wire and were hammered in by a muffled mallet. However, this still produced noise, rendering the sappers targets. Therefore, screw pickets or 'cork-screws' were produced. These looped steel posts had a drill-like end, allowing it to be twisted into the ground noiselessly and the wire then wrapped around it.|$|E

25|$|Most of Tula {{was set up}} in a grid plan. The {{buildings}} were made of stone with an adobe finish. The Atlanteans of Tula are several statues representing Mixcoatl, father of Quetzalcoatl. When they were first built they were painted and decorated with gold and jewels. Some of them were used as columns <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> roof of the great room in the temple of Tlahuizcalpantecutli. This use of Statues as columns is thought to have been common in Toltec architecture. Outside of Chichen Itza the toltecs had little influence on the architecture in Yucatan.|$|E

25|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Second World War in 1939, Collishaw was promoted to Air Commodore and took over as Air Officer Commanding, No. 204 Group ("Egypt Group") in North Africa. He concentrated on strategy and tactics to neutralize the Italian air force and to gain aerial superiority in North Africa. This was a tough challenge considering that his men were flying outdated Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and Vickers Wellesley bombers. Soon after the war started Collishaw's men were off the mark quickly, striking at an Italian airbase destroying 18 aircraft within two days of {{the commencement}} of hostilities with only three aircraft losses. He then turned their efforts to bombing harbours, ships and troops <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> reinforcement of North Africa.

25|$|Philip Johnson's {{design is}} a cenotaph, or empty tomb, that symbolizes {{the freedom of}} Kennedy’s spirit. The {{memorial}} is a square, roofless room, 30 feet (9m) high and 50 (15m) by 50 feet (15m) wide with two narrow openings facing north and south. The walls consist of 72 white precast concrete columns, most of which seem to float with no visible support two feet above the earth. Eight columns extend to the ground, acting as legs that seem <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> monument. Each column ends in a light fixture. At night, the lights create the illusion that the structure {{is supported by the}} light itself. The corners and “doors” of this roofless room are decorated with rows of concrete circles, or medallions, each identical and perfectly aligned. These decorations introduce the circular shape into the square architecture of the Kennedy Memorial.|$|E

The hotel's owner Gurey Abdi Hassan partly blamed Hodan district officials and state forces for the attack. He indicated that the local Hodan district commissioner had ignored his request {{to set up a}} security checkpoint in the hotel's rear, while simultaneously providing lax security despite the premises having been attacked three times before. Al-Shabaab concurrently claimed responsibility for the raid, with the group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mahamud Rage emailing that some militants had survived the attack and escaped the scene. Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman Abdiasis Abu Musab also indicated that the insurgents were targeting government officials only and had left civilians unharmed. Government forces displayed the bodies of the slain militants at a press gathering, deeming the counter-terrorist operation a success.|$|E
