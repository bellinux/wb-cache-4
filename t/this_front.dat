5|$|Following their defeat, the British delayed at the Modder River {{for another}} two months while {{reinforcements}} were brought forward. General Lord Roberts was appointed Commander in Chief of the British forces in South Africa and moved to take personal command of <b>this</b> <b>front.</b> He subsequently lifted the Siege of Kimberley and forced Cronje to surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg.|$|E
5|$|On 29 June Army Norway {{launched}} {{its effort to}} capture Murmansk in a pincer attack. The northern pincer, conducted by Mountain Corps Norway, approached Murmansk directly by crossing the border at Petsamo. However, in mid-July after securing {{the neck of the}} Rybachy Peninsula and advancing to the Litsa River the German advance was stopped by heavy resistance from the Soviet 14th Army. Renewed attacks led to nothing, and <b>this</b> <b>front</b> became a stalemate for the remainder of Barbarossa.|$|E
5|$|During Playford's rule, {{hospitals}} were overcrowded and the Royal Adelaide Hospital's beds were crammed {{together with a}} density twice higher than developed world standards. After a media exposé and criticism from health sector professionals, two more {{hospitals were}} built in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide respectively. Playford's attitude to social welfare was also criticised. He said that it was up to charity, not the government, to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community so that they could enjoy a better standard of living. Spending on social welfare lagged behind that in other states, and legislative reforms on <b>this</b> <b>front</b> were non-existent.|$|E
50|$|In many dialects of English, the vowel /oʊ/ has {{undergone}} fronting. The exact phonetic value varies. Dialects with the fronted /oʊ/ include Received Pronunciation; Southern, Midland, and Mid-Atlantic American English; and Australian English. <b>This</b> <b>fronting</b> does not generally occur before /l/, a relatively retracted consonant.|$|R

5|$|In {{the history}} department, Syme was succeeded by Peter Brunt. In the sciences, Dr John Baltrop was {{sometime}} Bursar; Bryan Birch, Professor of Arithmetic {{and co-author of}} the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture; and Nicholas Kurti, Vice-President of the Royal Society. Overall, although the immediate post-War staff remained traditional– if not overly conservative in nature– with a third drawn from Brasenose itself, the late sixties signalled a change on <b>this</b> <b>front.</b> Then, a wave of new face emerged: among them, Laszlo Solymar (later Professor of Applied Electromagnetism), Vernon Bogdanor (Professor of Government), Robert Evans (Regius Professor of Modern History) and Graham Richards, Oxford's Chairman of Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Of Stratton's many contributions, {{his studies}} on {{perception}} and visual illusions {{would continue to}} influence the field of psychology well after his death. Of the nine books he wrote, {{the first was a}} scholarly look at the methodology and scope of experimental psychology. The remaining, including one unfinished at his death, were on sociology, international relations and the issues of war and how findings from psychology could be used to eradicate conflict between nations. Stratton considered these issues more salient to the application of psychology in the real world, though his ideas on <b>this</b> <b>front</b> did not produce a lasting impact in the field because of their subjective and non-experimental nature.|$|E
5|$|Operation Winter '94 {{pushed back}} {{the front line}} of the VRS by about , {{capturing}} much of the Livanjsko field. The attack failed to achieve its primary objective but it brought the Croatian forces within striking distance of the Drvar–Knin road. Operation Winter '94 was followed by Operation Leap1 (Operacija Skok1) on 7 April 1995, which improved HV positions on Mount Dinara on the southern rim of the field, dominating the area around the RSK capital. The Croatian forces renewed their advance with Operation Leap2 between 4 and 10 June, allowing them to directly threaten Bosansko Grahovo on the Drvar–Knin road, and to secure the remainder of the valley. The improved Croatian dispositions around Livanjsko field provided a springboard for further offensive action on <b>this</b> <b>front</b> during Operation Summer'95.|$|E

5|$|The reverberations of the Black Week defeats {{led to the}} hasty {{approval}} of large reinforcements being sent to South Africa, from both Britain and the Dominions. Although Cronje temporarily defeated the British and held up their advance, General Lord Roberts was appointed as overall Commander in Chief in South Africa; he took personal command on <b>this</b> <b>front,</b> and {{at the head of}} an army reinforced to 25,000 men, he relieved Kimberley on 15 February 1900. Cronje's retreating army was surrounded and forced to surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg on 27 February 1900.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey west range {{contains}} the main entrance, which enters the courtyard via an arched passage. Above the outside gate are spaces where armorial panels were once displayed. The windows on <b>this</b> <b>front,</b> {{larger than the}} original ones in the tower house, had iron grilles, and small gun holes beneath them. Beside the entrance was a kitchen, and above, a larger hall and drawing room. Only {{the western part of}} the three-storey north range was completed, although the Lindsays planned to complete the courtyard. This range had another kitchen, as well as private chambers within the round tower at the north-west corner. It was entered via a stair turret in the courtyard, fragments of which remain, including parts of an intricately carved door surround. Only the foundations of the east and south buildings remain, which probably contained a bakehouse and stables.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were then}} made to {{establish}} batteries {{to the west}} and north of the city, but these efforts were hampered by heavy rain, delaying the construction of defensive earthworks which allowed the garrison to maintain a constant fire on the work parties, which suffered consequent casualties. Fire was especially heavy against the siege lines {{to the north of the}} city, which were easily targeted by the French gunners on 12 August. Operations to establish batteries on <b>this</b> <b>front</b> continued for several days even as losses mounted; on 15 August, Lieutenant Colonel George Maule, Braithwaite's chief engineer, was killed by cannon fire while returning from a night inspection of the trenches. On the night of 21 August the main battery, known as the Royal Battery, came under heavy shellfire and was damaged, but repairs were successful and on the morning of 22 August its 24-pounder long guns opened return fire on the city.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1570s, King John III of Sweden faced a Russian {{offensive}} on his positions in Estonia. Reval withstood a Russian siege in 1570 and 1571, but several smaller towns {{were taken by}} Russian forces. On 23 January a Swedish army of 700 infantry and 600 cavalry under command of Clas Åkesson Tott (the Elder) clashed with a Russian and Tartar army of 16,000 men {{under the command of}} Khan Sain-Bulat at the Battle of Lode by the village of Koluvere. The Russian advance concluded with the sacking of Weissenstein (Paide) in 1573, where, after its capture, the occupying forces roasted some {{of the leaders of the}} Swedish garrison alive, including the commander. This triggered a retaliatory campaign by John centred on Wesenberg, to which the army departed in November 1573 with Klas Åkesson Tott in overall command and Pontus de la Gardie as field commander. There were also Russian raids into Finland, including one as far as Helsingfors (Helsinki) in 1572. A two-year truce on <b>this</b> <b>front</b> was signed in 1575.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{hoped to}} be posted to Britain {{at the end of}} his training, and was {{initially}} told that this was going to happen, but he was instead sent to the Middle East. He was despatched to Idku, a small RAF base near Cairo, in late 1942, from where he was posted to an operational training unit based at Baalbek in Lebanon. He spent six weeks there, flying over much of the Levant in a Hawker Hurricane fighter, before being posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron to begin active service, again piloting Hurricanes. The squadron was stationed near the Iranian capital of Tehran when Smith joined it, but it almost immediately transferred to Kirkuk in Iraq, to help guard the oil wells and pipelines there. In March 1943, it was again committed to the Western Desert Campaign in North Africa, having previously served there during 1941–1942, and Smith served on <b>this</b> <b>front</b> as a Hurricane pilot. He was promoted to flying officer on 25 March 1943.|$|E
5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed {{a large portion of}} the armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By the end of the month, {{a large portion of the}} Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North quickly realized that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for <b>this</b> <b>front.</b> Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E

This is an interesting example of the Lincolnshire Artisan Mannerism style of house building of the mid-17th century.

5000|$|In {{phonetics}} and phonology, relative articulation is {{description of}} the manner and place of articulation of a speech sound relative to some reference point. Typically, the comparison is made with a default, unmarked articulation of the same phoneme in a neutral sound environment. For example, the English velar consonant [...] is fronted before the vowel [...] (as in keep) compared to articulation of [...] before other vowels (as in cool). <b>This</b> <b>fronting</b> is called palatalization.|$|R
