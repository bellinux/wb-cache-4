25|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is a third branch of machine learning, distinct from supervised and unsupervised learning, which also admits quantum enhancements. In quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning, a quantum agent interacts with a classical environment and occasionally receives rewards for its actions, which allows the agent to adapt its behaviour—in other words, to learn {{what to do in}} order to gain more rewards. In some situations, either because of the quantum processing capability of the agent, or due to the possibility to probe the environment in superpositions, a quantum speedup may be achieved. Implementations of these kinds of protocols in superconducting circuits and in systems of <b>trapped</b> <b>ions</b> have been proposed.|$|E

When moving the tapped ion from the node of the standing-wave laser to the loop, the vibration frequency of the quantum entanglement between the field and the ion becomes slow gradually, and the entanglement degree gets weaker and weaker. With the decrease of the probability of the <b>trapped</b> <b>ion</b> being in the excited state, the quantum entanglement between the <b>trapped</b> <b>ion</b> and the stanging-wave laser field shows the tendency of increase first and then decrease.

However, Paul trap receives a great focus from researchers for a MMS {{because of its}} distinct advantages over other mass analyzers for building MMS. One of the benefits is that <b>ion</b> <b>traps</b> can work at much higher pressures than beam type mass analyzers and can be simplified with different geometry for the ease of fabrication. For example, a miniature quadrupole <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> mass analyzers, such as cilindreal <b>ion</b> <b>trap,</b> linear <b>ion</b> <b>trap,</b> rectilinear <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> (RIT), can operate at several mTorr in contrast to 10−5 Torr or less for other analyzers and {{it is able to}} perform MS/MS in a single device with minimum size of electronics system. Nevertheless, as the size gets smaller, it is hard to maintain the electric field shape and precise configuration and will negatively affect ion motion. The goal is to make the trap smaller without losing ion capacity. Tridion-9 mass spectrometer with toroidal <b>ion</b> <b>trap</b> is designed with a doughnut-shaped volume that can hold up to 400 times more ions.
