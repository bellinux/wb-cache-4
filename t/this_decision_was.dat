5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to live outside their districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of the Christians and their help to the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise the threat to his kingdom from the British and banish the Christians of Canara. According to Severine Silva, <b>this</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> the logical outcome of the plans he had nurtured since the time of the conquest of Mangalore with his father Hyder in 1768.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>this</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> {{a boon to}} the Stationers, it was short-lived. Following Millar, {{the right}} to print The Seasons was sold to a {{coalition}} of publishers including Thomas Becket. Two Scottish printers, Alexander and John Donaldson, began publishing an unlicensed edition, and Becket successfully obtained an injunction to stop them. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> appealed in Donaldson v Beckett, and eventually went to the House of Lords. After consulting with the judges of the King's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas, the Lords concluded that copyright was not perpetual, and that the term permitted by the Statute of Anne was the maximum length of legal protection for publishers and authors alike.|$|E

5|$|On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts {{became the}} first state in the U.S. to legalize {{same-sex}} marriage after a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in November 2003 determined that the exclusion of same-sex couples from {{the right to a}} civil marriage was unconstitutional. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> eventually superseded by the U.S. Supreme Court's affirmation of same-sex marriage in the United States in 2015.|$|E

5|$|The RAAF and Army jointly {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} the Chinooks from service in May 1989. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made to reduce costs, the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient air lift capability.

5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the car park. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> severely criticised in an internal audit report.|$|E
5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because <b>this</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|After {{construction}} of the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge was completed in late 1902, tolls were immediately charged along the one lane structure. However, unlike the other two bridges, the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge cost $0.22 (1902 USD). A person traveling on foot {{did not have to}} pay to cross the structure. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> different compared to the other bridges, which made it separate. Another decision was that ministers were not tolled so they could better serve their communities. However, when one minister began to abuse the special privilege, he was charged $0.05 for crossing. The tollhouse for collection was in Milanville and was run by the Dexter family.|$|E

5|$|Although El Hatillo {{has been}} {{independent}} from Petare since 1809, it later {{became part of}} Sucre Municipality, where Petare is located. On November 19, 1991, Miranda's Legislative Assembly gave El Hatillo full autonomy, making it an independent municipality; <b>this</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> issued in Gaceta Oficial on January 17, 1992.

5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> questioned by some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{variations}} {{in the size of}} the yearly catch, Hume and others believed his methods of fish-propagation to be successful. However, as salmon runs declined over time despite the hatcheries, recreational fishing interests began to oppose large-scale operations. In 1910, a state referendum banned commercial fishing on the Rogue, but <b>this</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> reversed in 1913. As fish runs continued to dwindle, the state legislature finally closed the river to commercial fishing in 1935.|$|E

Ticket prices were increased from last year's final, with the most expensive tickets costing £90 up £4 from the previous year. The least expensive tickets cost £40, which was £2 more than last year. It was decided that before the match started national anthems would not be played. <b>This</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> made to avoid spectators jeering the anthems, as happened during the 2008 FA Cup Final between Portsmouth and Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that <b>this</b> <b>decision</b> <b>was</b> properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E
