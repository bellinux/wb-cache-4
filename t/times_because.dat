5|$|Lexical {{differences}} between dialects are often considerable. This {{is due to}} the earlier cultural practice of imposing taboo on words which had served as names for a deceased person. Since people were often named after everyday objects, many of these have changed their name several <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of taboo rules, causing dialectal vocabulary to diverge further.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish National Party (SNP) has {{campaigned for}} a place in Eurovision for Scotland but had been {{rejected}} numerous <b>times</b> <b>because</b> Scotland is represented {{as a part of}} the British entry and is represented by the BBC. On 11 February 2008 the EBU stated that a Scottish broadcaster could apply for EBU membership, but under the current rules could not enter the Eurovision Song Contest as the BBC currently has exclusive rights to represent the entire United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|A {{script for}} text {{was not used}} by the Muisca, but the numerals were written with hieroglyphs. They have been {{analysed}} by various authors, such as Joaquín Acosta, Alexander von Humboldt and Liborio Zerda, and appear as rock art and on textiles. The frog {{is the most important}} and is represented in the numbers from one (ata) to twenty (gueta) five <b>times,</b> <b>because</b> the Muisca didn't have hieroglpyhs for the numbers 11 to 19, so used the numerals one to nine again in combination with ten; fifteen was thus ten-and-five; qhicħâ hɣcſcâ.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} a capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of his ability to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the fifth-longest-lived Atlantic {{tropical}} or subtropical cyclone on record. The eleventh named {{storm and}} third hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Kyle {{developed as a}} subtropical cyclone on September 20 to the east-southeast of Bermuda. Looping westward, it transitioned into a tropical cyclone and became a hurricane on September 25. For the next two weeks, Kyle tracked generally westward, oscillating in strength several <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of fluctuations in environmental conditions. On October 11, the cyclone turned northeastward and made landfalls near Charleston, South Carolina, and Long Beach, North Carolina, at tropical storm status. After lasting as a cyclone for 22days, Kyle dissipated on October 12 as it was absorbed by an approaching cold front.|$|E

5|$|The {{essential}} {{target was}} RAF Fighter Command. The service's destruction would deny the British their air superiority asset. Throughout July and early August, the Germans made preparations for Adlertag. The {{date of the}} assault was postponed several <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of bad weather. Eventually, it was carried out on 13 August 1940. The German attacks on 13 August inflicted significant damage and casualties on the ground, but, marred by poor intelligence and communication, they {{did not make a}} significant impression on Fighter Command's ability to defend British air space.|$|E
5|$|The manga began {{serialization}} in 2004 in the Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine, {{published by}} Shueisha. Production {{of the series}} was suspended several <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of Hoshino's health. D.Gray-man made {{the transition from a}} weekly to a monthly series in November 2009, when it began serialization in Jump Square. On December 29, 2012, the series went on indefinite hiatus. It resumed serialization on July 17, 2015 after the release of Jump SQ.Crown, a spin-off from the magazine Jump SQ. The manga's chapters have been collected in twenty-five tankōbon volumes. By August 5, 2014, Viz Media had released 24 volumes in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E

5|$|The {{range of}} Naja nigricollis is {{currently}} expanding from the southeastern regions of Nigeria {{to the more}} desert and arid conditions in {{the central part of}} the nation. They also live in coastal scrubs and dry grasslands. Like other cobra species, they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent holes to hide or cool off. However, tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places. They are excellent tree climbers, thus can be arboreal at <b>times.</b> <b>Because</b> they are so common across Africa, they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people.|$|E
5|$|The stolen {{capuchin}} monkey named Oscar {{is played}} by live animal actor Katie, best known for playing Marcel, Ross Geller's pet monkey, on the sitcom Friends. Near {{the time of the}} episode's airing, she had also appeared in Bruce Almighty and an episode of 30 Rock. When the episode's editor first received one take of the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing a poor job on a school project, the editor called the writing staff into the editing room; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of its humorous nature. They immediately included the take in the final cut of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Chicado V started {{only six}} <b>times</b> <b>because</b> knee {{problems}} cut short her racing career. However, she won her first two starts while breaking or equaling track records, {{and was given}} the title of co-Champion Quarter Running Two-Year-Old Filly by the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) in 1952. The next year she ran her last four races, winning once and setting one more speed record. After her last race, in , she was retired from the track to become a broodmare, and had nine foals. Two of her offspring were named Champion Quarter Running Horses, and all her foals had a total of seven stakes race wins. One of her daughters, Table Tennis, {{went on to become}} a noted broodmare herself, as did Table Tennis' daughter Rapid Volley and granddaughter Perks. However, three of ChicadoV's sons—Triple Chick, Three Chicks, and The Ole Man—were her best known offspring; all three became leading sires and are the main cause of her fame. She was inducted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Rain hit {{the circuit}} on Saturday afternoon, ending {{three hours before}} the session started, {{resulting}} in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates {{making it difficult for}} drivers to tell precisely how wet or dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton was third fastest, two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa. Rosberg was fifth, ahead of Webber and Nico Hülkenberg. Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of the limited time available.|$|E
5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by about five <b>times</b> <b>because</b> {{of a more}} hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with {{a family history of}} VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|The stunt {{simulating}} Lange's {{fall into}} the subway train was filmed on August 27, the second production day, and Yoshimura {{said that it was}} the most challenging part of the shoot. D'Onofrio and MacVittie had to arrive at the platform just as the subway train was approaching, and their scene had to be reshot several <b>times</b> <b>because</b> the train did not pass the actors on time. The crew also filmed shots of a dummy dressed as Lange being dragged by the train inside the dummy wall, but most of those scenes were not used in the final cut. The remaining five filming days focused primarily on the scenes between Braugher and D'Onofrio, which Yoshimura and Fleder felt were the most crucial element of the episode. During the filming of the climactic scene with Pembleton and Lange which ends with Lange's death, several members of the crew reacted emotionally, something Yoshimura said is extremely rare because the crew members typically look at their work as a job and do not become emotionally invested in the story that they are filming.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all <b>times</b> <b>because</b> of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, the bullets are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E
