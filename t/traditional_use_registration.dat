Currently, {{a considerable amount of}} monographs demonstrating the efficacy of several plants are already approved at community level, with indications for use either as well established authorization or <b>traditional</b> <b>use</b> <b>registration.</b> Several of these plants grow spontaneously in Portugal, indicating that it is possible their culture and exploitation by companies interested in their use, trade and export, as medicines. In this article the approved indications at Community level for plants that arise spontaneously in Portugal are presented, being also suggested the creation of a platform that brings together authorities, universities and economic actors to promote and facilitate the exploitation of these valuable national natural resources...|$|E

40|$|Image {{registration}} {{is one of}} the important image processing procedures in remote sensing; it has been studied and developed for a long time. However, until now, it is still rare to find an accurate, robust, and automatic image registration method, and most existing image registration methods are designed for particular application. At present, high resolution remote sensing images have made it more convenient for people to study the earth; however, they also bring some challenges for the traditional research methods. In terms of image registration, there are some problems with <b>using</b> current image <b>registration</b> techniques for high resolution images, namely: (a) precisely locating control points is not as simple as with moderate resolution images; (b) manually selecting the large number of control points required for precise {{registration is}} tedious and time consuming; (c) high data volume will adversely affect the processing speed in the image registration; and (d) local geometric distortion can not be removed very well <b>using</b> <b>traditional</b> image <b>registration</b> methods even with enough control points. Based on these reasons, the need for an image registration approach that will resolve these problems is urgent. This paper proposes a new automated image registration technique, which is based on the combination of feature-based and area-based matching. Wavelet-based feature extraction technique and relaxation-based image matching technique are employed in this research. Local distortions caused by terrain relief can be greatly reduced in this procedure. IKONOS and QuickBird data are used to evaluate this technique. 1...|$|R

40|$|Methods 3 -D CT-based {{registration}} {{was performed}} to match the shapes of both bones. We <b>used</b> the <b>registration</b> to align the allograft volume onto the recipient's bone. Hemipelvic allograft selection was tested in 10 virtual recipients with a panel of 10 potential allografts, including one from the recipient himself (trap graft). 4 observers were asked to visually inspect the superposition of allograft over the recipient, to classify the allografts into 4 categories according to the matching of anatomic zones, and to select the 3 best matching allografts. The results obtained <b>using</b> the <b>registration</b> method were compared with those from a previous study on the template method. Results <b>Using</b> the <b>registration</b> method, the observers systematically detected the trap graft. Selections of the 3 best matching allografts performed <b>using</b> <b>registration</b> and template methods were different. Selection of the 3 best matching allografts was improved by the registration method. Finally, reproducibility of the selection was improved when <b>using</b> the <b>registration</b> method. Interpretation 3 -D CT registration provides more useful information than the template method but the final decision lies with the surgeon, who should select the optimal allograft according {{to his or her}} own preferences and the needs of the recipient...|$|R
