5|$|The first epizoic {{species of}} earwig was {{discovered}} by a London <b>taxidermist</b> {{on the body of}} a Malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909, then described by Karl Jordan. By the 1950s, the two suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina had been added to Dermaptera.|$|E
5|$|Over the Hedge is set {{immediately}} after {{the events of the}} animated film. Gladys Sharp, president of the homeowners' association, plans to bulldoze the forest in order to build a swimming pool. She has been joined by a new character, the <b>taxidermist.</b> The animals decide to lure endangered species to the forest in order to have it declared a protected habitat, preventing its destruction. The householders have been warned about RJ and company's intentions, and have created traps from everyday objects to repel the thieves.|$|E
5|$|Percy Powell-Cotton {{was born}} in 1866, and was a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers. His expeditions were {{conducted}} for scientific research, and would sometimes take 18 months. In 1896, Major Powell-Cotton founded the Powell-Cotton Museum at Quex Park to display his collection of mammals and artefacts acquired on his expeditions to Africa and Asia. The animals were mounted by the noted <b>taxidermist</b> Rowland Ward.|$|E
50|$|<b>Taxidermists</b> seek to {{continually}} maintain their skills to ensure attractive, lifelike results. Mounting an animal {{has long been}} considered an art form, often involving months of work; not all modern <b>taxidermists</b> trap or hunt for prize specimens.|$|R
50|$|Treatments {{should be}} carried out by conservators or {{qualified}} <b>taxidermists.</b> Some <b>taxidermists</b> have experience working with museums and can coordinate with conservators to preserve specimens. When cleaning specimens, it is necessary to wear protective gear such as nitrile gloves, dust masks, eye protection, and lab coats.|$|R

5|$|Barry is {{described}} as the most famous St. Bernard by the Natural History Museum of Bern. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a <b>taxidermist</b> for the museum, {{while the rest of}} his body was buried. He was originally given a humble and meek pose, as the <b>taxidermist</b> felt that this would serve as a reminder of servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the St. Bernard of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A barrel was added hanging from his collar, following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by Edwin Landseer's work Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller. The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced. A monument to Barry is located opposite the entrance to the Cimetière des Chiens in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Between 1800 and 1814, a dog named Barry {{lived as}} a rescue dog at the hospice, and was famous enough {{at the time}} for his body to be {{preserved}} at the Natural History Museum of Bern. However, during the preservation, the <b>taxidermist</b> {{and the director of}} the Museum agreed to modify the body towards what they thought was a good example of the breed during that period. The head itself was further modified in 1923 to represent the Saint Bernard of that era. Prior to this the skull was a great deal flatter with a moderate stop.|$|E
5|$|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid $6,000 to <b>taxidermist</b> Sergio Vigilato to {{preserve}} the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor once it was defrosted. It was treated with bleach, formaldehyde and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so {{to give it the}} same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.|$|E

5|$|The expedition's {{scientific}} staff {{consisted of}} six persons, including Bruce. The zoologist was David Wilton who, like Bruce, {{had been a}} member of the Jackson-Harmsworth Expedition. He had acquired skiing and sledging skills during several years living in northern Russia. Robert Rudmose-Brown, of University College, Dundee, and formerly an assistant in the Botany Department at the British Museum, was the party's botanist. Dr James Harvie Pirie, who had worked in the Challenger office under John Murray, was geologist, bacteriologist, and the expedition's medical officer. Robert Mossman directed meteorological and magnetic work, and Alastair Ross, a medical student, was <b>taxidermist.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bummer {{was also}} mounted by the <b>taxidermist</b> {{and placed on}} display. In 1906, both {{specimens}} were donated to the Golden Gate Park museum (now the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum) where they remained in storage until they were destroyed in 1910.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} only episode, The <b>Taxidermist,</b> follows Madison as she visits Leland White, a <b>taxidermist,</b> to {{question}} him about the Origami Killer. Finding his house empty, Madison breaks in and discovers an upstairs area containing several female corpses, stuffed and posed in various positions (including a freshly killed cadaver in a bathroom), which Leland created {{in order to satisfy}} his agalmatophilia fetish. After collecting information, Madison hears Leland's car return. From here the player's actions can lead to several different endings – she can surprise Leland and kill him, be killed herself and added to his collection, escape, or contact the police and wait for them to arrest Leland. Regardless of what happens, it becomes clear that he has no connection to the Origami murders.|$|E

50|$|Though taxidermy’s early roots {{developed}} in Africa and Western Europe, modern-day taxidermy {{began in the}} United States in 1861 when Henry Augustus Ward's Natural Science Establishment was founded in Rochester, New York. Modern-day <b>taxidermists</b> often give credit to this establishment for placing taxidermy on a level with other allied arts and beginning {{a new era in}} museum exhibitions. Many later <b>taxidermists,</b> whose work was among the most advanced exhibited, could credit their careers to Ward's Establishment, and many present museums have display collections built around these early Ward specimens.|$|R
25|$|Carl Ethan Akeley (May 19, 1864 – November 18, 1926) Explorer, sculptor, biologist, conservationist, inventor, <b>taxidermist,</b> {{and nature}} photographer, noted for his {{contributions}} to American museums, most notably to the Field Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History. He is considered the father of modern taxidermy.|$|E
25|$|Heavy Rains Chronicles: The <b>Taxidermist,</b> a {{downloadable}} prequel for {{the game}} and an update to an earlier demo, stars Madison. Intended {{to be the first}} in a series, the rest of the Chronicles were put on indefinite hiatus after work on a PlayStation Move version of the main game began. Madison, investigating the Origami Killer, intends on interviewing Leland White, a <b>taxidermist</b> and possible suspect. However, when she arrives, he is not home, so thus she sneaks in. In his house, she discovers a murdered woman in a bloody bathtub, and in another room numerous stuffed and posed corpses of women. Depending on the player's actions, Madison may end up sneaking out without Leland noticing, be noticed but manage to escape regardless, kill Leland, be killed herself, or phone the police and hide until they come.|$|E

25|$|During the industry's height {{there were}} three fusee {{factories}} in the town and a large cottage industry. By 1855 {{there were more than}} 500 people making the chains in their own homes. Then in 1875, because of changes in watch design, the chains were no longer required, and the factories were closed. Hart was originally a <b>taxidermist</b> who built up a large collection of stuffed animals, many of which are now housed in the Red House Museum; and his factory which still stands today is a grade II listed building.|$|E
25|$|After a short stay in Cincinnati {{to work as}} {{a naturalist}} and <b>taxidermist</b> at a museum, Audubon {{traveled}} south on the Mississippi with his gun, paintbox, and assistant Joseph Mason, who stayed with him from October 1820 to August 1822 and painted the plant life backgrounds of many of Audubon's bird studies. He was committed to find and paint all the birds of North America for eventual publication. His goal was to surpass the earlier ornithological work of poet-naturalist Alexander Wilson. Though he could not afford to buy Wilson's work, Audubon used it to guide him when he had access to a copy.|$|E
50|$|Harriman {{also brought}} a medical team, a chaplain, hunters and packers, guides, and <b>taxidermists.</b> He brought {{his own family}} and his servants. Together, with {{the crew of the}} Elder, the total number of people on the ship was 126.|$|R
5000|$|It was at Ward's {{that the}} Society of American <b>Taxidermists</b> {{was founded on}} March 24, 1880.

Terminated after the last exhibit in 1883, “the society in three years had done more for taxidermy and the natural history museum in general in the United States than had ever previously been accomplished". Founded by America's most skilled <b>taxidermists</b> of the day, the Society presented to the public modern methods and techniques, which were freely discussed and served to bring about a higher standard of commercial work and museum exhibits. It was during this time in which the [...] "stuffing" [...] of animals transformed into a purely elaborate art form. In addition, this institution generated many famous <b>taxidermists</b> and naturalists such as William T. Hornaday, Frederic S. Webster, John Martens, Carl E. Akeley, Joseph Palmer, William J.
