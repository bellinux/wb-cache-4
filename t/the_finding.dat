30|$|These {{findings}} are consistent with <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study conducted by Bardovi-Harlig et al. (2008) who found that knowledge of formulaic sequences, regardless of language-cultural background, plays a significant role in determining the proficiency level of language learners. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> of <b>the</b> current study are also in line with <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study conducted by Qi and Ding (2011) who found that more proficient language learners possess a higher inventory of formulaic sequence knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> current study further support <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study conducted by Rafieyan (2018) who found a strong positive relationship between language learners’ knowledge of formulaic sequences and their level of language proficiency. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study, however, do not support <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> studies conducted by Staples et al. (2013) and Serrano et al. (2015) who found a lack of correlation between knowledge of formulaic sequences and language proficiency.|$|R

5|$|A {{physician}} will initially assess for Parkinson's {{disease with}} a careful medical history and neurological examination. People {{may be given}} levodopa, with any resulting improvement in motor impairment helping to confirm the PD diagnosis. <b>The</b> <b>finding</b> of Lewy bodies in the midbrain on autopsy is usually considered final proof that the person had PD. The clinical course of the illness over time may reveal it is not Parkinson's disease, requiring that the clinical presentation be periodically reviewed to confirm accuracy of the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{agreed with}} <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> {{that the state}} court's decision was reasonable.

5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura {{to search for the}} bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. <b>The</b> <b>finding</b> in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females.

It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that colors can be {{flexibly}} associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes {{were presented with}} Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E

5|$|Generally, <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|Mt.

5|$|Other {{relationships}} {{include the}} algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that traditional batiks from {{different regions of}} Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's projective geometry. A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that prepared low-risk primiparae would experience shorter labors than unprepared low-risk primiparae was not upheld in <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> of <b>the</b> present study. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> of <b>the</b> present study did appear to validate <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> {{of several other}} similar studies which reported no differences in length of labor between prepared and unprepared women.

30|$|However, {{extrapolation}} of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> across nations has limitations {{owing to the}} heterogeneity of factors associated with depression across large geographic areas. Albeit this limitation, <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> could be applicable in countries which have similar policing work profiles to that of Sri Lanka. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> could be having practical implications in exploring the predictors of depression among law enforcing officers working in South Asian countries which have similar job demands, work profiles and work stressors. Furthermore, given the evident similarities in the contexts of social impression and media criticism associated with policing in these countries, <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> of <b>the</b> present study could be applicable for {{other countries in the}} region.|$|R
5|$|The Chalukyas revived their {{fortunes}} in 973 after over 200 years of dormancy when {{much of the}} Deccan was {{under the rule of}} the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami Chalukya dynasty of the 6th century while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas.|$|E
5|$|The bishopric of Aarhus {{dates back}} to at least 948 when Adam of Bremen {{reported}} the bishop Reginbrand attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany. The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth {{and development of the}} early medieval town. <b>The</b> <b>finding</b> of six runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them. The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as Harald Hardrada's assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground.|$|E

5|$|These geyser observations, {{along with}} <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> of {{escaping}} internal heat {{and very few}} (if any) impact craters in the south polar region, show that Enceladus is currently geologically active. Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets, Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance. Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity, which is damped by tidal forces, tidally heating its interior, possibly driving the geological activity.|$|E
5|$|This {{development}} greatly facilitated {{vaccine research}} and ultimately {{allowed for the}} development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their labors with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Other important advances that {{led to the development of}} polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 — PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
40|$|This article {{draws on}} the multi-theoretical {{approach}} to governance and a qualitative research method to examine {{the extent to which}} the corporate approach is practised in Australian public universities. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> reveal that in meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders, universities are faced with a number of structural, legalistic, and behavioural issues that are in tension with the corporate culture. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> emerging from <b>the</b> interview data are: (a) the current constraints on the structural and operational framework of Australian public universities do not support corporate managerialism; and (b) the current governance framework of Australian public universities supports a pseudo-management culture. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> help to explain the consequent type of governance control processes to be developed and implemented within the sector, and challenge the current myth that these universities are practising a corporate approach. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> provide avenues for further research to confirm <b>the</b> <b>findings...</b>|$|R
