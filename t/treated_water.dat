5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in <b>treated</b> <b>water.</b> They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the <b>treated</b> <b>water</b> into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

5|$|For over {{a century}} the water was {{supplied}} untreated. In the 1980s a dam at Westbury allowed selective pumping from the river and some improvement in water quality. As Hagley's water was not fully treated, {{from time to time}} contamination required boil-water notices. Sedimentation damaged hot-water cylinders and restricted supply due to the deposits left in the water delivery system. Work began in 2012 on a $5.5 million water treatment work at Westbury to supply Westbury, Hagley and Exton. This water treatment plant was opened by Ben Lomond Water in June 2013, supplying filtered and <b>treated</b> <b>water</b> to Hagley.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} {{sewerage}} was processed at a plant near the town, which also handles sewerage from nearby Hadspen. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into {{a tributary of}} the Liffey River. As of 2003 the reticulated water supply in the town was untreated and both were operated by the Meander Valley council. By 2011 Carrick's water was supplied from the Mount Leslie Water Treatment Plant. This plant was built in 1996 and supplies <b>treated</b> <b>water</b> from the Trevallyn Dam.|$|E
5|$|The outflow {{from the}} works, which passes under the River Don Navigation and joins the river beside Jordans weir, {{has in the}} past been a major {{contributor}} to the pollution of the River Don, but some £70 million has been invested in upgrading the plant, to ensure that discharges to the river meet the requirements of the Freshwater Fish Directive. In dry weather, the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of <b>treated</b> <b>water</b> each day, more than doubling the flow in the river at this point.|$|E

5|$|Water used in {{the steam}} cycle is taken from the local mains water, {{supplied}} by Northumbrian Water. Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid boiler tube corrosion. This <b>treated</b> <b>water</b> is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E
5|$|The River Don Navigation {{ended at}} Tinsley Wharf, but {{it forms a}} {{convenient}} place to start {{a description of the}} route. The wharf was on the river, just upstream from the present junction with the canal to Sheffield. It was close {{to the site of the}} Meadowhall Shopping Centre and the Tinsley Viaduct, which carries the M1 motorway over the valley of the River Don. From here there is a towpath along the canal to Victoria Quays (formerly Sheffield Basin) in Sheffield City Centre, or the Five Weirs Walk follows the course of the River Don to the same destination. The towpath extends to Rotherham in the opposite direction, passing the large Jordans Weir and the three locks on the Holmes Cut. Beside Jordans Weir is the outfall from Blackburn Meadows sewage treatment plant. In dry weather, this discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of <b>treated</b> <b>water</b> each day, more than doubling the flow in the river.|$|E
25|$|Only 20% of the <b>treated</b> <b>water</b> is lost (due to evaporation, leaks, {{overflows}} and seeping). The recycled water allows {{farmers to}} plan ahead {{and not be}} limited by water shortages.|$|E

50|$|Slow {{sand filters}} differ {{from all other}} filters used to <b>treat</b> {{drinking}} <b>water</b> in that they work by using a complex biological film that grows naturally {{on the surface of}} the sand. The sand itself does not perform any filtration function but simply acts as a substrate, unlike its counterparts for UV and pressurized treatments. Although they are often preferred technology in many developing countries because of their low energy requirements and robust performance, they are also used to <b>treat</b> <b>water</b> in some developed countries, such as the UK, where they are used to <b>treat</b> <b>water</b> supplied to London. Slow sand filters now are also being tested for pathogen control of nutrient solutions in hydroponic systems.|$|R

50|$|To improve water quality, the University of Oklahoma’s {{department}} of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science has implemented a 1.2 million dollar passive water treatment system to bioremediate ground water from abandoned mines using {{a series of}} ponds to naturally remove lead, zinc, cadmium and iron from the water, and then discharges it into a tributary of Tar Creek. It uses gravity and renewable energy to flow water through a filtration system, composed of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria treatments, and periodic oxidation of <b>treated</b> <b>waters.</b> It has greatly reduced heavy metals in <b>treated</b> <b>waters.</b>|$|R
