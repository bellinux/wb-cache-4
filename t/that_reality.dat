5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|Both Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans {{attempt to}} {{diagnose}} {{what is going}} on with Michael. They both see it as a coping mechanism, and both insist that the other reality is a dream. To try to prove this to Michael, Dr. Evans has Michael read a part of the United States Constitution, as if <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> was a dream, Michael could not have done so, unless he had memorized the Constitution. Michael learned that he had alcohol in his system the night of the car accident, with Dr. Lee hypothesizing that Michael has this dream because he feels guilty for killing his son.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{confusion}} appears through the transplantation of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom of This World. Often, the characters find <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> does not lie entirely in either world. It is possible that this theme is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's work because of the author's own personal experience with cultural transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E

They were allies with the Defenders of the Realm and the Ex-Men. The Revengers are all destroyed when Thanos brought Death to this Deathless reality.|$|R

5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|After A You {{spends time}} in this world, Grandpa Beard decides that his {{problems}} are solved and returns to take {{him away from the}} imaginary world. A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> if he dislikes it. Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|After {{competing}} in a bat'leth tournament {{on the planet}} Forcas III, Lieutenant Worf returns to the Enterprise and is treated to a surprise birthday party, much to his annoyance. As he attends the party, he starts to notice subtle changes, such as {{the flavor of the}} cake changing, and a painting given to him by Data appearing on a different wall. The changes start to become more pronounced; as a Cardassian vessel attacks the Enterprise, unfamiliar controls result in Worf failing to raise the shields, leading to the death of Geordi La Forge. Despite retaining his initial memories, Worf has no evidence <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> has changed, and his own personal logs support the stories given by the other crew members. Other major changes occur: Riker is Captain of the Enterprise in a reality wherein Picard was killed by the Borg, the Bajorans became the oppressors of the Cardassians and enemies of the Federation, Wesley Crusher is a lieutenant on the Enterprise, Alyssa Ogawa is the Chief Medical Officer, and Worf finds himself married to Deanna Troi.|$|E

5|$|Finn {{wakes up}} to {{discover}} that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) is now his wife {{and he is now}} the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to hint <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is not what it seems. Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by Jessica DiCicco), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Jain {{references}} to this parable {{are found in}} Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of <b>that</b> <b>reality,</b> it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.|$|E
5|$|The Brittens are {{a family}} who live in Los Angeles, California, in the United States, at an unknown address. Michael, the father, works at the Los Angeles Police Department as a police detective, {{alongside}} his partner Isaiah Freeman, who he calls Bird. After a car crash, Michael, the father, has to live in two separate realities, one in which his wife Hannah {{was killed in the}} crash, and in the other his son Rex was the one killed. Also, in one reality, his now works with a new rookie partner Efrem Vega, where Isaiah goes to work in the Western Division with Ed Hawkins. In the other reality, he is still partnered with Bird. He see two two separate therapists: Dr. John Lee in one reality, and Dr. Judith Evans in the other. Michael is married to Hannah, an American housewife and mother. They have one son child: Rex, a school teenager who is very emotional, rude, and gets low grades after Hannah's death in <b>that</b> <b>reality.</b> His best friend is Cole, whom he works on a motorbike with. The family owns a Chevrolet as a vehicle.|$|E

5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E

25|$|Within {{this broad}} definition, {{theories}} of spiritual evolution are very diverse. They may be cosmological (describing existence at large), personal (describing {{development of an}} individual), or both. They can be holistic (holding that higher realities emerge from and are not reducible to the lower), idealist (holding <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is primarily mental or spiritual) or nondual (holding {{that there is no}} ultimate distinction between mental and physical reality). One can regard all of them as teleological {{to a greater or lesser}} degree.|$|E
25|$|Dnyaneshwar {{takes up}} the {{examination}} of being or brahman in Amrutanubhava. He considers being to be the substratum of thought which enables thought and cognition. Since being is prior to thought and concepts, it is distinct from Kantian categories, and methods of thought such as epistemological analysis {{cannot be applied to}} it. Dnyaneshwar believes <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is self–evident and does not require any proof. It antedates dualistic divisions into knower and known, existence and nonexistence, subject and object, knowledge and ignorance.|$|E
25|$|Social constructivist {{scholars}} view {{learning as}} an active process where learners should learn to discover principles, concepts and facts for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in learners (Brown et al.1989; Ackerman 1996). In fact, for the social constructivist, reality {{is not something that}} we can discover because it does not pre-exist prior to our social invention of it. Kukla (2000) argues <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is constructed by our own activities and that people, together as members of a society, invent the properties of the world.|$|E

25|$|Socrates' idea <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is {{unavailable}} {{to those who}} use their senses is what puts him {{at odds with the}} common man, and with common sense. Socrates says that he who sees with his eyes is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his Allegory of the Cave, and more explicitly in his description of the divided line. The Allegory of the Cave (begins Republic 7.514a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible ("noeton") and that the visible world ("(h)oraton") is the least knowable, and the most obscure.|$|E
25|$|Objectivism's central tenets are <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> exists {{independently}} of consciousness, {{that human beings}} have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception {{through the process of}} concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>reality</b> is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend {{to see the world}} according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E
