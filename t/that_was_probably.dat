5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the largest of}} the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Sratsimir was proclaimed emperor in Vidin in 1356 {{and began}} to use the title Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks, as his father. In order to secure the {{alliance}} of Wallachia, he married his first cousin Anna, {{the daughter of the}} Wallachian voivode Nicholas Alexander, in 1356 or 1357, a move <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> arranged with the help of Ivan Sratsimir's mother Theodora as a reaction to the actions of Ivan Alexander.|$|E

5|$|The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer. Loaded with an arrow-like bolt <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{wrapped in}} leather to allow greater {{thrusting}} power, {{it was set}} off through a touch hole with a heated wire. This weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English, during the Hundred Years' War, when cannon saw their first real use on the European battlefield. Even then, cannon were still a relatively rare weapon.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{rocks at}} Irruputuncu are lavas {{that have been}} dated by potassium-argon dating to 10.8 ± 0.6 mya. The oldest {{component}} clearly belonging to the volcano is the El Pozo ignimbrite that was erupted 258.2 ± 48.8 ka, forming a multi-layered ignimbrite <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> generated by the injection of new, hot magma into older, cooler magma. A lava dome on the upper flank {{on the western side}} of the volcano is 0.14 ± 0.04 mya old. The block-and-ash flow between 55.9 ka and 140 ka old, but has not been pecisely dated. The Crater lavas are 55.9 ± 26.8 ka old. The block-and-ash flow on the southwestern flank was formed 1570 ± 900 years BP.|$|E

His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it from the window. He {{never had a chance to}} drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|Church {{architecture}} in Scotland incorporates all church building within the modern borders of Scotland, {{from the earliest}} Christian structures in the sixth century until the present day. The early Christian churches {{for which there is}} evidence are basic masonry-built constructions on the west coast and islands. As Christianity spread, local churches tended to remain much simpler than their English counterparts. By the eighth century more sophisticated ashlar block-built buildings began to be constructed. From the eleventh century, there were larger and more ornate Romanesque buildings, as with Dunfermline Abbey and St Magnus Cathedral in Orkney. From the twelfth century the introduction of new monastic orders led to a boom in ecclesiastical building, often using English and Continental forms. From the thirteenth century elements of the European Gothic style began to appear in Scotland, cumulating in buildings such as Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilt Melrose Abbey. Renaissance influences can be seen in a move to a low-massive style <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> influenced by contacts with Italy and the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E

25|$|Celtic art is very ornamental, {{avoiding}} {{straight lines}} and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature nor ideal of beauty {{central to the}} classical tradition, but apparently, often involves complex symbolism.
