5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and that Williams had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided to bury <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the beach and {{send a letter to}} Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never know for sure whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to pull on the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E

5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> herself. But {{weeks after the}} murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E
50|$|The {{third and}} final charge stood little chance of {{reaching}} <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b> <b>On</b> each occasion individual cavalrymen passed between <b>the</b> <b>guns,</b> but only so as to escape to the British rear. As the third attack withdrew, the troop had to cease firing to allow the Duke of Wellington to pass along the road. Shortly afterwards Wellington's infantry advanced, leaving <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ridge to engage masses of French troops in the valley below.|$|R
50|$|Price's {{assault on}} the center of the Union lines did not {{commence}} for almost an hour after Fagan's attack began. Price's men charged the Federal lines but were repulsed by concentrated artillery fire from the batteries and the USS Tyler. Price's Confederates made two more desperate charges before successfully capturing <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> Graveyard Hill. Price attempted to turn <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remaining Federals but found that <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> had been successfully disabled before their capture.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of 'A' and 'Y' turrets {{were removed}} in 1915–16. <b>The</b> aftermost 3-pounder <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{superstructure}} were removed during 1917 {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> top of <b>the</b> forward 9.2-inch wing turrets. This reduced her total to twenty 3-pounder <b>guns,</b> excluding <b>the</b> AA <b>guns.</b> Some of these guns were landed at Murmansk while she was based there. Seventeen 3-pounders were on board when she was lost in 1919, but it is unclear if that total includes <b>the</b> AA <b>guns.</b> Cochranes foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support {{the weight of a}} fire-control director in 1917, but the director was not actually fitted until August 1918.|$|R
5|$|The same {{model was}} used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was {{achieved}} through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial Galaxy 4 (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse {{at the end of}} Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from The Ambassadors of Death (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that {{it is one of the}} very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah's fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with The Deadly Assassin. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros' speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.|$|E

25|$|Growing up in Chicago and New York, Silverthorne {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} American socialites of her time; a relative of the powerful Armour family, she was a multi-millionaire heiress. She entered French aristocracy in the early 1920s, when she married Count de Janzé. In the mid-1920s, she was introduced to the infamous Happy Valley set, a community of white expatriates in East Africa, notorious for their hedonistic lifestyle. In 1927, she made international news when she shot her lover in a Paris railway station and then turned <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> herself; they both survived. De Janze stood trial but was only fined a small amount, and was later pardoned by the French state. She further scandalized the public by marrying, and then later divorcing, the man she shot.|$|E
25|$|The COW gun {{mounting}} in {{the nose}} was of Westland design, and allowed the gun to be trained over a wide arc. It supported <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the apex of a pyramidal structure, that was asymmetric to allow the gunner to {{have easy access to}} the weapon. This structure was fixed on a rotating base, which also provided the gunner with a rotating platform to stand on. The gunner could train the mount by turning a hand gear, or push on a pedal to engage a brake that locked the mount in its position. The elevation and depression of the gun were accomplished by the muscle power of the gunner. As the large ammunition clip of the COW gun prevented sighting over the barrel, a sight was installed to its left. The gun is reported to have been successfully fired in the air, also when trained to the side.|$|E

However, a man who worked with Kinne admitted to having secretly purchased a new [...]22 caliber pistol at her request in the beginning of May. Police were unable to locate the gun in question when they searched Kinne's house, though they did find an empty box that they believed had once held a gun.

[...] Power told the police that the letter had been written by a friend of his called John Williams, who he claimed had visited Sztaray's house to burgle it before killing the policeman and fleeing. Williams then met with his girlfriend Florence Seymour and explained what had happened.

500|$|The {{pilot model}} was {{built at the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground in May 1942. The 57mm Gun M1 was mounted in the M12 recoil {{mechanism}} and installed on a tubular pedestal. The tubular pedestal was soon replaced with a conical structure that was designated the [...] "57mm gun mount T5". <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> the pilot model had a traverse of 27.5 degrees {{either side of the}} centerline (total of 55 degrees), while having an elevation of +15 to -5 degrees. The short-barrelled (43 caliber) British Mark III 6-pounder gun was installed in the pilot, but the longer-barrelled (50 caliber) 57mm Gun M1 was specified for the production models. The original travel lock – to hold the gun in a fixed position when the vehicle was moving – proved to be unsatisfactory, and was replaced by a travel lock on the front hood.|$|E
500|$|In German use, 72 {{rounds of}} 37mm {{ammunition}} were carried.

For the machine gun, 1,800 rounds of belted 7.92mm ammunition were carried. The machine gun ammunition was in 100 round belts, stored three to a box. In Czech service, the LT vz. 35 carried 78 rounds (24 AP, 54 HE) and 2,700 rounds of machine gun ammunition, the difference being removed {{to make room for}} the fourth crewmember in German service. The German command tank version (Panzerbefehlswagen 35(t)) exchanged some ammunition - exactly how much isn't known - for another radio set and a gyrocompass. It could be recognized by the prominent [...] "clothesline" [...] radio antenna mounted on the rear deck.|$|E
500|$|On December 6, 1989, Lépine {{walked into}} the École Polytechnique de Montréal.

Claiming that he was fighting feminism, he shot the nine women who remained, killing six and injuring the rest. After this, Lépine moved to other areas of the building, including the cafeteria, corridors and another classroom. A total of 14 women (12 engineering students, one nursing student, and one university employee) were killed, and four men and ten women injured before Lépine turned <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>on</b> himself.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forward turret roof were {{transferred}} to the superstructure in 1913–1914 on Bellerophon and on her sisters in 1914. During {{the first year of}} <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing turrets were moved into the aft part of the superstructure. Sometime around 1915, <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stern turret were removed as were a pair from the superstructure, which reduced their secondary armament to a total of twelve guns. About that time, a pair of 3-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. Approximately [...] of additional deck armour were added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. By April 1917, the sisters mounted single 4-inch and 3-inch AA <b>guns</b> and <b>the</b> stern torpedo tube had been removed. One additional 4-inch gun was removed from Superb in 1917–1918. In 1918, a high-angle rangefinder was fitted on the forward spotting top and flying-off platforms were installed on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets of Bellerophon. After the war, Temeraire had four 4-inch guns removed to make space for naval cadets and <b>the</b> AA <b>guns</b> were stripped from her and Superb.|$|R
