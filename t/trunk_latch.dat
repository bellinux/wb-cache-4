50|$|Facelift models {{featured}} a redesigned {{front and rear}} bumper with rounded fog lights, a silver painted grill (instead of black), body-colour painted side-skirts and door handles, indicators now integrated into the wing mirrors, a restyled steering wheel, and the position for the <b>trunk</b> <b>latch</b> release was moved from {{the right side of}} the trunk, to above the license plate. Newly designed sport seats with better support was added in facelift models, after initial customer complaints that the original seats were too uncomfortable.|$|E
50|$|To {{back its}} {{image as a}} {{technically}} advanced car for the 1980s, the Mark VII was equipped with {{a long list of}} standard equipment. A fully digital dashboard featured an onboard trip computer and message center; automatic climate control was also standard. Other standard features included four-wheel air suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, power seats, an AM/FM stereo, and power windows, locks, and mirrors. All Mark VIIs featured a power deck-lid release (through an interior mounted button) and electric pull-down, in which the trunk lid was partially lowered by hand, and then automatically pulled down about an inch by a motor mounted inside the <b>trunk</b> <b>latch.</b> All models were now installed with Ford's Keyless Entry System, and an automatic dimming high-beam module. This worked via a sensor located adjacent to the rear-view mirror, and sensitivity could be adjusted by a dial located on the dashboard.|$|E
50|$|Some known {{problems}} {{include the}} front spring perch has corroded and tearing {{away from the}} inner fender (wing), causing the front suspension to collapse. (4Matic models are not believed to be affected.) Other problems include defective harmonic balancer pulleys (recall), rust on <b>trunk</b> lid near <b>latch,</b> rust on Mercedes emblem on front hood, rust on door frames under window seals (recall), rust on front wings just above bumper, defective mass airflow meter, melted rear light bulb sockets, defective blower motor regulators, and rear window regulator failures.|$|R
2500|$|Again in 1956 {{the top of}} {{the line}} Oldsmobile 98 series had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase, [...] longer than the 88. Power came from the 240 horsepower Rocket V8 shared with the Super 88. Standard equipment included armrests, bumper guards, lined <b>trunk,</b> rotary door <b>latches,</b> dual horns, cigarette lighter, turn signals, rubber floor mats, aluminum door sill plates, sun visors, front and rear carpeting, foam rubber seat cushions, courtesy lights, front fender medallions, deck lid '98' script, back-up light moldings, electric clock, Jetaway Hydramatic Drive, padded dash, power steering, windshield washers and Deluxe steering wheel. Upholstery choices were pattern cloth and leather in a variety of colors and combinations. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] made by either U.S. Royal, Goodrich, or Firestone. The parking brake was now a foot pedal.|$|R
50|$|The escape trunk {{can also}} be used for the rescue of a crew inside a {{disabled}} submarine using a Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle (DSRV). The crew of the DSRV will maneuver the vessel above the upper hatch of the escape <b>trunk</b> and then <b>latch</b> on to the submarine using the built-in eyes on the outer hull of the submarine. Most submarines do not have the built-in eyes and rely on the DSRV establishing a watertight seal on the area surrounding the hatch. Once the sub has settled on the correct location the skirt is pumped out and the hydrostatic pressure on the exterior of the skirt is enough to maintain the seal when the hatches are opened and the transfer undertaken. The crew can then quickly equalize the pressure in the small chamber between the DSRV and the submarine and open their own lower hatch.|$|R
