40|$|The study {{objectives}} were {{to provide a}} province-wide description of stall dimensions and the aspects of cattle welfare linked to stall design in the tie-stall industry. Data on stall design; stall dimensions; and the prevalence of lameness, injury, and hind limb and udder cleanliness in lactating dairy cattle were collected from a sample of 317 tie-stall farms across Ontario. The majority of the study farms (90 %) had stalls with dimensions (length, width, <b>tie-chain</b> length, and tie rail height) that were less than the current recommendations. This may explain, in part, the prevalence of lameness measured as the prevalence of back arch (3. 2 %) and severe hind claw rotation (23 %), hock lesions (44 %), neck lesions (3. 8 %), broken tails (3 %), dirty hind limbs (23 %), and dirty udders (4. 6 %). Veterinarians and producers may use this information to compare farms with the industry averages and target areas in need of improvement...|$|E
40|$|This thesis utilises {{computational}} simulations {{to investigate}} the relationship between morphological structure of the active layer within organic photovoltaic devices, {{and its impact on}} the device performance. Specifically, the effects of hot charge transfer states, the mixed molecular phase and fullerene aggregation on organic photovoltaic performance, and polymer crystallinity on carrier mobility, are explored using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. These investigations agree with experimental results and shed new light on the processes of recombination, ultrafast charge separation and the utility of the amorphous phase within the context of <b>tie-chains.</b> A more accurate charge separation kinetic model is proposed in order to correctly describe the biexponential carrier recombination determined from Monte Carlo investigations. The model incorporates a `quasi-free' state where charges are still Coulombically bound but sufficiently separated to prevent recombination. This is conceptually similar to the cooled remains of hot charge transfer states, the effects of which are investigated on device operation and shown to provide a benefit that is strongly dependent on the aggregation of the fullerene phase, the limitation of the molecularly mixed phase and the relative charge carrier mobilities. Crystallisation within the polymer medium is then comprehensively explored using a combination of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, along with quantum chemical calculations to help elucidate the observed annealing temperature and molecular weight dependencies of the carrier mobility for a poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl) test system. The annealing temperature trend can be explained by increased crystallite size and order, but the molecular weight dependence is not satisfactorily explained by the crystalline regions. Instead, mobility is shown to be limited by the availability of <b>tie-chains</b> in the amorphous phase of the morphology, linking together crystals and providing regions of high mobility through the amorphous material...|$|R
40|$|In this work, tensile dynamic {{mechanical}} analysis (DMA) {{was used}} to characterise the solid-state rheological properties of a commercial ß-polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film in the two main directions (longitudinal and transversal to the stretch direction). The ß-relaxation, assigned to the segmental motions within the amorphous phase, is observed at∼− 25 ◦C. The alpha-c-relaxation is observed above room temperature. This relaxation is the main responsible for the anelastic properties of the material and to the short-term creep behaviour. Longer-term creep tests along the longitudinal direction were also performed and the Eyring model was applied, in order to characterize the flow-process within the polymeric structure. The results suggest that long-term creep is mostly controlled by the deformation of amorphous <b>tie-chains</b> that connect adjacent crystalline lamellae.

40|$|The {{morphological}} {{origin of}} anisotropic charge transport in uniaxially strain aligned poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) films is investigated. The macroscale field effect mobility anisotropy {{is measured in}} an organic thin fi lm transistor (OTFT) configuration and compared to the local aggregate P 3 HT mobility anisotropy determined using time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements. The field effect mobility anisotropy in highly aligned P 3 HT films is substantially higher than the local mobility anisotropy in the aggregate P 3 HT. This difference is attributed to preferentially aligned polymer <b>tie-chains</b> at grain boundaries that contribute to macroscale charge transport anisotropy but not the local anisotropy. The formation of sharp grains between oriented crystalline P 3 HT, through tie chain removal by thermal annealing the strained aligned films, results in {{an order of magnitude}} drop in the measured field effect mobility for charge transport parallel to the strain direction. The field effect mobility anisotropy is cut in half while the local mobility anisotropy remains relatively constant. The local mobility anisotropy is found to be surprisingly low in the aligned films, suggesting that the π−π stacking direction supports charge carrier mobility on the same order of magnitude as that in the intrachain direction, possibly due to poor intrachain mobility through chain torsion. 10 page(s...|$|R
