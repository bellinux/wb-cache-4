40|$|We take a {{new look}} at {{parameter}} estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). In particular, we propose using Riemannian manifold optimization as a powerful counterpart to Expectation Maximization (EM). An out-of-the-box invocation of manifold optimization, however, fails spectacularly: it converges to the same solution but vastly slower. Driven by intuition from manifold convexity, we then propose a reparamerization that has remarkable empirical consequences. It makes manifold optimization not only match EM [...] -a highly encouraging result in itself given the poor record nonlinear programming methods have had against EM so far [...] -but also outperform EM in many practical settings, while displaying much less variability in running times. We further highlight the strengths of manifold optimization by developing a somewhat <b>tuned</b> <b>manifold</b> LBFGS method that proves even more competitive and reliable than existing manifold optimization tools. We hope that our results encourage a wider consideration of manifold optimization for parameter estimation problems. Comment: 19 page...|$|E

5000|$|In a {{four-stroke}} engine, <b>tuned</b> extractor <b>manifolds</b> {{are used}} to promote scavenging of the exhaust gases by delivering a pulse of negative pressure just before the exhaust valve closes.|$|R
25|$|The {{resulting}} engine weighs {{less than}} the O-235 and incorporates a throttle body injector system with a <b>tuned</b> intake <b>manifold</b> and dual electronic ignition, or optionally a carburetor {{in place of the}} throttle body injector to save further cost and weight. The engine has a 2400-hour time between overhauls. Additional features include a lightweight 14 volt alternator, an optimized oil sump, a streamlined accessory housing, a lightweight starter and roller tappets.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tuned</b> intake <b>manifold</b> {{was used}} in a Wankel engine {{for the first time}} with the 13B-RESI. RESI = Rotary Engine Super Injection. The {{so-called}} Dynamic Effect Intake featured a two-level intake box which derived a supercharger-like effect from the Helmholtz resonance of the opening and closing intake ports. The RESI engine also featured Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection. Output was much improved at 135 hp (101 kW) and 180 N·m (133 lb·ft).|$|R
50|$|The S63 is BMW's Motorsport {{division}} {{version of}} the N63, which debuted in the BMW X6 M. The S63 uses two twin-scroll turbochargers plus a pulse <b>tuned,</b> cross-engine exhaust <b>manifold</b> to keep constant exhaust pulses flowing to the turbos at every 180 degree rotation.|$|R
5000|$|Nova Rossi {{produce a}} range of engines, <b>manifolds,</b> <b>tuned</b> pipes, glow plugs and other {{accessories}} for all forms of radio controlled models. Nova Rossi hold a very high share of sales with radio controlled cars, boats and aircraft. Many world championships have been won {{in all of these}} classes, which have led to the company slogan [...] "World champion engines" [...] often found on decals and apparel.|$|R
50|$|The 1987 Allanté {{featured}} a removable aluminum hardtop, the industry's first power retractable AM/FM/Cellular Telephone antenna and a multi-port fuel injected variant of GM's aluminum 4.1 L HT-Cadillac 4100 V8, along with roller valve lifters, high-flow cylinder heads, and a <b>tuned</b> intake <b>manifold.</b> The roadster {{featured a}}n independent strut-based suspension system front and rear, Bosch ABS III four-wheel disc brakes and a complex lamp-out module that substituted a burned-out bulb in the exterior lighting system with an adjacent lamp until correction of the problem. The Delco-GM/Bose Symphony Sound System - a $905 option on other Cadillacs - was standard on Allanté. The only option was a cellular telephone, {{installed in a}} lockable center console.|$|R
5000|$|The Max Wedge was a race-only {{version of}} the 426 Wedge engine offered from the factory. Known as the Super Stock Plymouth and Ramcharger Dodge, the Max Wedge {{featured}} high-flow cylinder heads developed through state-of-the-art (at the time) airflow testing. They had 1⅞-inch exhaust valves, which required the cylinder bores to be notched for clearance. The blocks were a special severe-duty casting with larger oil-feed passages than other RB engines, and the blocks were stress-relieved by the factory. Induction came {{by means of a}} cross-ram intake <b>manifold</b> <b>tuned</b> for peak power above 4000 rpm and two Carter AFB-3447SA 4-barrel carburetors. The Max Wedge also included high-flow cast-iron exhaust manifolds that, on the later versions, resembled steel tube headers. The Max Wedge was factory rated at [...] (depending on compression), and [...] at 4400 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The 1969 ZL1 {{version of}} the 427 engine was {{developed}} primarily for Can-Am racing, where it was very successful in cars like the McLaren M8B. The ZL1 had specifications nearly identical to the production L88 {{version of the}} 427, but featured an all-aluminum cylinder block in addition to aluminum cylinder heads, which dropped total engine weight into small-block Chevrolet territory (approx. 575 lb dressed). The engine was also fitted with the new open combustion chamber cylinder heads, a light weight aluminum water pump, a camshaft that was slightly [...] "hotter" [...] than the L88's, and a specially <b>tuned</b> aluminum intake <b>manifold.</b> Like the L88, the ZL1 required 103 octane (RON) (minimum) fuel, used an unshrouded radiator, and had poor low speed idle qualities - all of which made the two engines largely unsuitable for street use. (102 octane RON 260 represented the highest octane gasoline sold at common retail stations.) ...|$|R
40|$|Electrohydraulic and {{electromechanical}} {{valve train}} technologies for four-stroke engines are emerging which allow much greater flexibility {{and control of}} the valve events than can be achieved using mechanically-based systems. Much of the work done on exploiting the benefits of these systems has been directed towards improving engine fuel economy and reducing emissions. In the present work a study has been made, using an engine simulation program, in to some of the possible benefits to engine performance that may be facilitated by the flexibility of fully variable valve train (FVVT) systems. The simulation study indicates that FVVT systems, limited by realistic opening and closing rates, provide sufficient range in the valve event duration and timing to enable the engine to produce very high specific outputs whilst achieving a high level of torque in the low- and mid-speed range. It is also shown that an FVVT system makes it possible to modify the basic intake <b>manifold</b> <b>tuning</b> mechanism by modifying the engine firing order, without recourse to variable geometry manifold systems. Additionally, the operation of a 'pneumatic hybridisation' concept are investigated and a range of further operating strategies, including Differential Cylinder Loading, which become viable upon the adoption of FVVT systems are also discussed...|$|R
