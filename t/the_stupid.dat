25|$|Arizona has {{an average}} annual {{rainfall}} of , which comes during two rainy seasons, with cold fronts coming from the Pacific Ocean during the winter and a monsoon in the summer. The monsoon season occurs {{toward the end of}} summer. In July or August, the dewpoint rises dramatically for a brief period. During this time, the air contains large amounts of water vapor. Dewpoints as high as 81°F (27°C) have been recorded during the Phoenix monsoon season. This hot moisture brings lightning, thunderstorms, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. These downpours often cause flash floods, which can turn deadly. In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams, the Arizona Legislature enacted <b>the</b> <b>Stupid</b> Motorist Law. It is rare for tornadoes or hurricanes to occur in Arizona.|$|E

500|$|In an {{analysis}} of how the show has changed throughout its run, Channel Frederator argued that the main characters of SpongeBob–specifically Sandy, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Squidward and Karen–have been reduced from multidimensional to reliant on single traits. According to this view, [...] "Karen is now a full-blown nag" [...] in newer episodes. This aspect of Karen's character has also been criticized by author Joseph J. Foy, in his book SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy. He considers this trope one of several harmful stereotypes present on the program, writing that [...] "the motif of the nagging wife is certainly an issue worthy of dissection in dealing with a young audience, along with the spoiled teen daughter [...] and <b>the</b> <b>stupid</b> best friend [...] ".|$|E

[...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy gave the track three out of five stars; he jokingly noted that Diamandis comes across as the dominant person in a relationship, citing the [...] "anguish" [...] in her vocals as an indication that [...] "this man doesn't stand a chance." [...] However, Ben Hewitt from NME was disappointed by [...] "Power & Control"; he felt that its production was [...] "anaemic" [...] and [...] "piss-weak", and criticized the lyrics [...] "Women and men we are the same / And we still play <b>the</b> <b>stupid</b> game" [...] for sounding like an excerpt from a self-help book.

Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after [...] Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, [...] "thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted’s seeing {{her for the first time}}, America’s seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive".|$|E

500|$|The French action {{drew the}} {{attention}} of not just the British, but also the Indian tribes of the area. [...] Despite good Franco-Indian relations, British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens, and the planned large-scale advance was not well received by all. [...] In particular, Tanacharison, a Mingo chief {{also known as the}} [...] "Half King", became decidedly anti-French as a consequence. [...] In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue, commander of the French and Canadien construction force, the latter reportedly lost his temper, and shouted at the Indian chief, [...] "I tell you, down the river I will go. [...] If the river is blocked up, I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me. [...] I despise all <b>the</b> <b>stupid</b> things you have said."

Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's <b>the</b> <b>stupid</b> people wearing expensive clothes."

500|$|The berries of C.australis are {{enjoyed by}} bellbirds, tūī and pigeons. Māori {{sometimes}} planted groves of cabbage trees (pā tī) to attract pigeons {{which could be}} snared {{when they came to}} eat the berries. Reminiscing in 1903 about life in New Zealand sixty or more years earlier, George Clarke describes how such a tapu grove of cabbage trees would attract huge numbers of pigeons: [...] "About four miles from our house, there was a great preserve of wood pigeons, that was made as tapu as the native chiefs could devise. At a certain season, the pigeons came in vast flocks to feed on the white berries of the Ti tree (bracœna) [...] and got so heavy with fat that they could hardly fly from one tree to another. No gun was allowed in the place. The Maoris, with a long slender rod and a slip noose at the end, squatted under the leaves and noiselessly slipped the noose over the necks of <b>the</b> <b>stupid</b> pigeons as they were feeding." [...] As the native birds have vanished from much of New Zealand with the clearing of forests, it is now flocks of starlings which descend upon the fruit.|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weeklys Lanford Beard observed that the song [...] "blends Katy Perry-meets-Gwen Stefani chanting, echoes of Ashlee Simpson's regrettable foray into New Wave-y synth-guitar sounds, and a 'Hold It Against Me' redux breakdown." [...] John Mitchell of MTV News commented that the instrumentation {{of the song}} consists of [...] "glittery synths, marching band drums, claps and a catchy-as-hell chorus." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called the song an [...] "'80s-inspired electro-thumper complete with a cheerleader chant of 'L-U-V Madonna!'" [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] is written in the key of D major and has a moderately fast tempo of 144 beats per minute. It follows a basic chord progression of D–G–A in the verses, and D–F–C–G in the chorus and intermediate bridge. Madonna's vocals span from the tonal nodes of C4 to A4.|$|E

[...] At Paste, Eric Van Allen criticized her outfit by stating [...] "Even by Street Fighter standards, this amount of gratuitous flesh is rather ridiculous." [...] However, this opinion is not shared between all critics, with Nadia Oxford of USgamer finding Mika to be an example of positive female gender representation, writing [...] "I can say that I have nothing against, er, voluptuous women in games. Or even scantily-clad women", and that [...] "My problem has always been women characters whom I'm expected to take seriously while they slay dragons/wander the desert/travel the frozen wastes while baring their midriff through the majority of their journey", and that she enjoys Mika's [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "goofy" [...] design.|$|E
500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... <b>The</b> <b>stupid</b> thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E
