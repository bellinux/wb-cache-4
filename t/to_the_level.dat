5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of 1950.|$|E

5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations on their side, making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> seen during World War I.|$|E

Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present).

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{summarizes}} {{information on}} diversity of benthic fauna of Georgia {{based on the}} literature sources. 126 publications were analyzed published after 1899. Our investigation showed that 15 lotic and 20 lentic ecosystems were studied out of which 21 (5 rivers and 16 lakes) belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Caspian Sea basin and 14 (10 rivers and 4 lakes) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea basin. As a result, 206 benthic animal taxa were described. From the described groups 81 are identified <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species <b>level,</b> 61 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genus <b>level,</b> 28 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family <b>level,</b> 16 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> order <b>level,</b> 10 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> class <b>level,</b> 10 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> phylum <b>level.</b> Since <b>the</b> most of observed freshwater systems are poorly studied, Paravani and Saghamo Lakes, Tsalka and Tbilisi Reservoirs and Kura (Mtkvari) and Rioni Rivers are rather well investigated.

5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her.

Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of her knees.

5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful.

CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
