25|$|The first {{leveraged}} buyout {{may have been}} the purchase by McLean Industries, Inc. of Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company in January 1955 and Waterman Steamship Corporation in May 1955. Under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> transaction, McLean borrowed $42 million and raised an additional $7 million through an issue of preferred stock. When the deal closed, $20 million of Waterman cash and assets were used to retire $20 million of the loan debt.|$|E

25|$|Many {{mathematical}} objects, such as sets {{of numbers}} and functions, exhibit internal structure {{as a consequence of}} operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Illingworth {{played a central}} role in the history of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, or the Glasgow Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons as it was then known. From 1960 to 1962 he served two annual <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> organisation's Visitorship, {{followed}} from 1962 to 1964 by two annual terms as President of what was by then called the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. It was during this period, in 1963, that Illingworth was granted the title of Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Glasgow (FRCSGlas). This award followed the recent name change (instigated by Illingworth's predecessor as President) that changed the Glasgow Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons from a Faculty to a Royal College. This period also saw attempts made to standardise and consolidate the range of diplomas offered across the UK medical colleges, with some of these changes proposed and debated by Illingworth during his leadership of the College.|$|E
25|$|In 1852, Edward Barker {{obtained}} a take-note, which he {{then transferred to}} a partnership. Barker {{was the son of}} Ormsby Gore's agent, while the partnership consisted of a surgeon called William Taylor, a warehouseman called John Pearce, both from London, and John Harper, who was from Porthmadog. Harper briefly acted as managing director, but was soon replaced by a naval captain called Richard Oliver. The agent or general manager was Thomas Jones, who had assisted Barker in his search for slate. On 27 June 1853, the partnership became the Rhosydd Slate Company, which negotiated the conversion of the take-note into a lease in September. Finished slates were carried by the Ffestiniog Railway in 1854, and in 1855 some Rhosydd slates were shipped from Porthmadog. In the following year, the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 was passed by parliament, and the quarrying company became the Rhosydd Slate Company Ltd on 7 November, under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> act.|$|E

500|$|When the Convention {{assembled}} in Edinburgh on 14th March, more than 70 of the 125 members were Presbyterians, although {{this did not}} mean they all shared the same views. Only a tiny minority remained loyal to James due to ties of religion or personal relationship, including the Catholic Duke of Gordon and John Graham, Viscount Dundee, his military commander in Scotland. As a result, the issue before the Convention was not whether to offer the throne to William and Mary but the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> offer.

500|$|The {{second part}} {{consists}} of five chapters {{and focuses on}} the rise, development, and fall of civilizations. Rifkin connects the qualitative changes in energy regimes and communication techniques with changes in how people understand and organize reality. Hunter-gatherer societies were all oral cultures and thus only existed in geographically-limited small groups and identified themselves symbiotically in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> group. Spiritually, these societies believed in local gods who were only known to others through oral tales. The development of writing, as well as hydraulics and irrigation, allowed agricultural societies to better organize themselves so that a larger geographic area and a larger population could be controlled. Hydraulic power was labour-intensive, requiring large populations of subservient people. With scripts, there was a shift from [...] a mythological consciousness to a theological consciousness; individuals thought of themselves less {{in terms of a}} small, local group and more with a monotheistic religion which included a personal relationship with a god.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} under the 1909 Act [...] which had become {{effective}} January 1, 1909 [...] the taxpayer should be taxed only on the increase in value after 1908. Increases in value prior to the effective date of the statute {{were not to be}} taxed under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> statute. Thus, the taxpayer was entitled to deduct, from its gross receipts from the sale of finished lumber, a basis amount computed with reference to the $40 per acre value as of December 31, 1908. [...] Doyle is a case involving statutory (not constitutional) interpretation. In this case, the Court was interpreting the 1909 statute. Although some tax protesters cite this case for an argument about the constitutional definition of income as excluding income of individuals, no issues involving the constitutional definition of income, or of income under any other tax statutes, were presented to or decided by the Court.|$|E

In <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her... People will miss her because she's been such an important part of EastEnders for so many years." [...] However, not all viewers were sorry to hear of the character's retirement, with one commenting [...] "How can you have someone like Pauline Fowler on the television for 21 years? It's the best thing that's ever happened to television [...] Kill her off? I would have blown her up years ago".|$|E
