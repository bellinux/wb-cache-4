5|$|After the First World War, another {{programme}} of {{improvements to}} <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> was carried out, extending <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly. Experiments with trains {{as long as}} 38 tubs were carried out, but the difficulty of splitting the train to pass through <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> meant that 19 was the usual maximum. The compartments continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal, long after most British canals had ceased {{to be used for}} commercial traffic, but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Below <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> and again {{the movement of the}} gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir to the east of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>locks</b> on the Bow Back Rivers are {{not built}} {{to a single}} standard, and sizes vary.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> ceased permanently {{when the government}} received word from logging operators that they {{would no longer be}} using <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> [...] All commercial boat service through <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> had stopped many years before. [...] After <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> was shut down, a large log drifting down the river floated over the top of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> striking <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> machinery, effectively putting <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> permanently out of operation.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>lock</b> {{floor and}} <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> walls {{rested on a}} poured {{concrete}} foundation four feet thick, with <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> walls rising [...] above it. [...] <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> floor was also [...] thick. [...] The sub foundation consisted of a timber grillage placed on 700 round piles, driven [...] feet deep. [...] 8000 cubic yards of concrete were used for <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> and foundation. [...] <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> had a lift of [...]|$|R
50|$|Each of <b>the</b> Environment Agency's <b>locks</b> and weirs is {{manned by}} a lock keeper, who {{normally}} {{lives in a}} house adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> keeper's duties involve both operating <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and managing <b>the</b> river levels above <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> by adjusting <b>the</b> weir openings.|$|R
5|$|From 1893 until 1934 the Clifton Rocks Railway {{provided}} an underground funicular railway link {{from the western}} end of the harbour, which is close to <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> into Clifton.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{has been}} studied for many years with {{exploration}} and restoration work being undertaken in Wellow and elsewhere. Particular effort, so far unsuccessful, has been put into {{trying to find the}} site of the second and third caisson locks at Combe Hay. In October 2006 a grant of Â£20,000 was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund, by the Somersetshire Coal Canal Society in association with Bath & North East Somerset Council and the Avon Industrial Buildings Trust to carry out a technical study on one of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> and associated structures at Combe Hay. Many of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> and associated workings are listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} list numbers <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> {{from the}} River Avon in Bristol to the River Thames. It includes one lock {{that has been}} removed (98, Ufton Lock) and two that have been combined to form a single deep lock (8 and 9, now Bath Deep Lock). Travelling from Bristol to Reading, locks 1 to 54 are uphill, and locks 55 to 107 are downhill.|$|E
50|$|Another way to {{classify}} locks is by {{what happens when}} <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> strategy prevents progress of a thread. Most <b>locking</b> designs block <b>the</b> execution of the thread requesting <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> until it is allowed to access <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> resource. With a spinlock, the thread simply waits ("spins") until <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> becomes available. This is efficient if threads are blocked for a short time, because it avoids the overhead of operating system process re-scheduling. It is inefficient if <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is held for a long time, or if {{the progress of the}} thread that is holding <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> depends on preemption of <b>the</b> <b>locked</b> thread.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lock</b> {{was built}} in stone in 1790 by the Thames Navigation Commission. The weir is {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> on <b>the</b> other side of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> island.|$|R
50|$|The above example {{does not}} {{guarantee}} that the task has <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> since more than one task can be testing <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> at <b>the</b> same time. Since both tasks will detect that <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is free, both tasks will attempt to set <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> not knowing that the other task is also setting <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> Dekker's or Peterson's algorithm are possible substitutes if atomic locking operations are not available.|$|R
5|$|By the 1930s {{these had}} fallen into disuse, and <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> were {{dismantled}} in 1933. The Forth and Clyde Canal closed {{at the end of}} 1962, and by the mid-1970s the Union Canal was filled in at both ends, rendered impassable by culverts in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate. The British Waterways Board (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the Forth and Clyde Canal was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Except for <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> the dam {{project was}} {{completed}} and fully functional as of July 4, 2012, {{when the last}} of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. The ship lift was complete in December 2015. Each main water turbine has a capacity of 700MW. The dam body was completed in 2006. Coupling the dam's 32 main turbines with two smaller generators (50MW each) to power the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the dam is 22,500MW.|$|E
5|$|James and Sanborn's unit {{is called}} to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An {{innocent}} Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries to cut off <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> to remove the vest, but {{there are too many}} of them. He abandons the man, who is killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James that he can no longer cope with the pressure, and wants to return home and have a son.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the event}} of a lost key, a {{duplicate}} key can be set up to unlock <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and upon changing the arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> <b>the</b> lost key will be powerless to open <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|R
50|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> <b>the</b> {{variation}} in river level has been between 0.08 m at <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> gate and 0.99 m. This compares favourably to variation below <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> at between 2.67 m and 4.95 m in depth.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lock</b> House {{is located}} on Wall Street in Leesport, Pennsylvania, on the east bank of the Schuylkill River. Adjacent <b>the</b> <b>Lock</b> House a car wash stood for maNy years, {{situated}} on the foundation of <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> More recently <b>the</b> car wash was acquired by <b>the</b> Leesport <b>Lock</b> House Foundation and the car wash was removed. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> walls can still be seen just above the remaining portion of <b>the</b> lower <b>lock.</b>|$|R
5|$|The A82 runs {{towards the}} centre of Loch Oich, passes Invergarry Castle, and crosses the River Garry. Just after the bridge, the A87 heads west towards Skye, while the A82 {{continues}} along the western shore of the loch up to the Bridge of Oich at its northern end. This bridge was constructed in 1932, bypassing the 1850s Bridge of Oich, a Taper Suspension Bridge built by James Dredge. The A82 continues along the general line of Wade's Military Road up to Fort Augustus, crossing the canal at a swing bridge next to <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> in the village.|$|E
5|$|The canal became disused after 1898 and officially {{closed in}} 1902, being sold {{off to the}} various railway {{companies}} who were expanding their networks. The land bordering the canal route was then used {{for a few years}} to construct a railway. In October 2006 a grant was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a technical study on one of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> and its associated structures at Combe Hay.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the barge with a harness over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E
50|$|A weir, mill, ferry {{and flash}} <b>lock</b> on <b>the</b> site were {{referenced}} in 1493 when granted to Notley Abbey. <b>The</b> pound <b>lock</b> opened in 1778, but <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> house, long promised, was not built until after 1819. In 1871 Reading Corporation planned {{to build a}} swingbridge over <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> cut upstream of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> {{but this was not}} implemented. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> was rebuilt in 1875.|$|R
2500|$|The {{overall length}} of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> was , and <b>the</b> {{distance}} between the gates was [...] [...] <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> was [...] wide. There was [...] depth of water over <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> sills, so that any boat that could pass <b>the</b> Willamette Falls <b>Locks</b> could also transit <b>the</b> new <b>lock</b> on <b>the</b> Yamhill.|$|R
50|$|Lever tumbler locks can {{be picked}} with a tool called a curtain pick which is {{inserted}} into the keyway of <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> and a {{force is applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>locking</b> bolt. <b>The</b> pick is then used to lift each lever inside <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> to <b>the</b> correct height so that <b>the</b> <b>locking</b> bolt can pass.|$|R
5|$|Water {{is pumped}} {{to the summit}} at {{the western end of}} <b>the</b> <b>locks,</b> from Wilton Water, by the {{restored}} Crofton Pumping Station. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational Watt-style beam engines in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.|$|E
5|$|After {{joining the}} III Battle Squadron in December 1913, Kaiserin {{participated in the}} routine fleet {{training}} exercises. Squadron exercises were conducted in February, followed by fleet maneuvers, both in the North Sea. The fleet trained again in May, in both the North and Baltic Seas. Kaiserin left Germany on 7 July for the annual summer cruise to Norway, but was recalled prematurely on 22 July because of rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Upon returning to Germany, Kaiserin steamed to BrunsbÃ¼ttel on 24 July, where {{she was the first}} battleship to traverse the recently deepened Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The voyage required lightening, and in just under twelve hours Kaiserin exited <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> at Holtenau in Kiel where she met the rest of her squadron. On 31 July, the entire squadron returned to the North Sea via the Canal. At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom, with its powerful Grand Fleet, declared war on Germany.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to drift, CofresÃ­ and {{his crew}} were {{captured}} after his ship reached Santo Domingo. Sentenced to six years in prison, they were sent to a keep named Torre del Homenaje. CofresÃ­ and his men escaped, were recaptured and again imprisoned. The group escaped again, breaking <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> on their cell doors and climbing down the prison walls on a stormy night on a rope made from their clothing. With CofresÃ­ were two other inmates: a man known as PortalatÃ­n and Manuel Reyes Paz, former boatswain of El ScipiÃ³n. After reaching the province of San Pedro de MacorÃ­s, the pirates bought a ship. They sailed from Hispaniola in late September to Naguabo, where PortalatÃ­n disembarked. From there {{they went to the}} island of Vieques, where they set up another hideout and regrouped.|$|E
25|$|To release <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> <b>the</b> user presses <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> bar {{back toward}} the handle side, at which time the blade is free to close. In the closed {{position}} <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> bar (leaf spring) rests alongside the handle and the blade.|$|R
50|$|The {{overall length}} of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> was 275 ft, and the {{distance}} between the gates was 210 ft. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> was 40 ft wide. There was 4 ft depth of water over <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> sills, so that any boat that could pass <b>the</b> Willamette Falls <b>Locks</b> could also transit <b>the</b> new <b>lock</b> on <b>the</b> Yamhill.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lock</b> is a single-rise lock {{with two}} pairs of lock gates to allow light river traffic to {{negotiate}} the barrage.The dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> are length 24.88 m, beam 6.08 m, height 5.37 m with a draught of 2.48 m.If necessary, when <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is in use, a single leaf steel bascule lifting bridge over <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> is raised to allow <b>the</b> passage of <b>lock</b> traffic.There is no charge to use <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> however users must have permits to use the river both {{above and below the}} barrage.|$|R
5|$|Cooper {{was named}} to the Senate Committee on Labor, Education and Public Welfare and chaired its {{education}} and labor subcommittees. He sponsored a bill authorizing public works projects along the Big Sandy River, including the Tug and Levisa forks. He also supported the reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> and dams along the Ohio River and the construction of locks, dams, and reservoirs in the Green River Valley. He opposed the Dixon-Yates contract, which would have paid a private company to construct a new power station to generate power for the city of Memphis, Tennessee, calling instead for authorization for the Tennessee Valley Authority to issue bonds to finance the construction of new power stations. He supported a comprehensive program benefiting the coal industry and cosponsored a bill to extending public library services to rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} {{becoming}} abbot, one {{morning after the}} Divine Liturgy a group of approximately thirty monks rose against Symeon, who drove them away. Breaking <b>the</b> <b>locks</b> on the monastery gate on their way out, the monks took their appeal to the Patriarch Sisinios, who sided with Symeon and sent the monks into exile. Symeon pleaded on their behalf, doing {{everything he could to}} have the monks return to the monastery, including seeking out some of the monks to apologize to them. During his time as abbot, Symeon wrote Hymns of Divine Love (completed during his exile), the Discourses, and many letters and polemical works which have been lost. He also wrote articles relating to his disputes with the church theologiansâthese survived as his theological and ethical treatises. In 1005 Symeon resigned as abbot of St. Mammas, appointing one of his disciples in his stead, and taking up a more solitary life at the monastery.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} lockout assembly for locking {{a circuit}} breaker in a selected off or on position is provided. The lockout assembly includes a lock block and a <b>lock</b> pin. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> block has a hollow interior which fits over the free end of a switch handle of the circuit breaker. <b>The</b> <b>lock</b> block includes at least one hole that is placed in registration {{with a hole in}} the free end of the switch handle. A <b>lock</b> tab on <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> block serves to align and register the respective holes on <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> block and switch handle. A lock pin is inserted through the registered holes and serves to connect <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> block to <b>the</b> switch handle. Once <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> block and <b>the</b> switch handle are connected, the position of the switch handle is prevented from being changed by <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> tab bumping up against a stationary housing portion of the circuit breaker. When <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> pin is installed, an apertured-end portion of <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> pin is in registration with another hole on <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> block. Then a special scissors conforming to O. S. H.

We use a thread modular verification approach to check that each thread obeys <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> interface. We verify <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> implementation assuming that the threads behave according to <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> interface.

5000|$|Read-preferring RW locks {{allow for}} maximum concurrency, but {{can lead to}} write-starvation if {{contention}} is high. This is because writer threads {{will not be able}} to acquire <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> as long as at least one reading thread holds it. Since multiple reader threads may hold <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> at once, this means that a writer thread may continue waiting for <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> while new reader threads are able to acquire <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> even to <b>the</b> point where the writer may still be waiting after all of the readers which were holding <b>the</b> <b>lock</b> when it first attempted to acquire it have released <b>the</b> <b>lock.</b> Priority to readers may be weak, as just described, or strong, meaning that whenever a writer releases <b>the</b> <b>lock,</b> any blocking readers always acquire it next.|$|R
