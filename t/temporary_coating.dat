40|$|An active {{protective}} coating based on chitosan (CTS) polymer with corrosion inhibitor 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) is reported. Structural and morphological {{analysis indicated that}} MBT is present in large amounts within the CTS matrix without affecting detrimentally the properties of CTS. More relevant, the release of MBT is dependent upon pH, resulting from the contribution of two factors: the chemistry of CTS (low pH) and the solubility of MBT (high pH). The performance of CTS-MBT was assessed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and found to be promising as a <b>temporary</b> <b>coating</b> for active corrosion protection.

40|$|Due to {{specifics}} of structure and properties of {{some kinds of}} polymer fibrous composites (organoplastics, hybrid materials containing organofiberes etc.), when cutting, a hairiness of cut fibrous material and a property damage of surface appear on the machined surface, thereby substantially restricting achievable classes of surface quality, i. e. surface roughness, material condition of the surface layer, dimensional accuracy, etc. These features of polymer composite materials (PCM) allow their referring to a special group of hard-to-cut materials, which requires creation and use of unconventional machining methods and tools to provide high-quality treatment and desirable engineering and economic indicators. The BMSTU has developed a clean finishing method of PCM, i. e. cutting with an additional technological coating (ATC). A principle of the method is that the two-pass machining in the finish size is provided. The first cutting tool pass provides processing in the pre-finish size of the product surface; then the hairiness appeared after machining is bound by applying a curing technological coating, and the second (finishing) pass in the final size removes a tightly binderheld hairiness together with cured <b>temporary</b> <b>coating.</b> This allows us to reduce roughness, significantly reduce dimensions and number of defects of the surface layer. However, {{the time required to}} cure the <b>temporary</b> <b>coating</b> before the second (final) pass of a cutting tool results in lower production rates of finishing with ATC, reduced performance rate, and higher product cost. Increased performance rate in ATC cutting, with the same high quality of the processed surfaces of fibrous composites, has been achieved by reducing the curing time of coating that can be realized in different ways. It has been experimentally established that under optimum processing conditions high quality of surface (roughness class of 7 - 8) and substantially reduced curing time of coating, i. e. the time interval between preliminary and final tool passes are achieved through the temperature control of ATC curing. Thus, the coating heated from 20 °C to 120 °C provides 18 times reduction of its curing time. Time of ATC cutting operation can be lessened more through pre-curing of technological coating on the site where components are mixed before applying it on the product to be cut. Changing weight ratio between the epoxide compound and the curing agent also has {{a significant impact on the}} curing time. The study has shown that the quality of the machined surface when cutting with ATC is also dependent on processing conditions such as the thickness of the coating layer (0. 8 [...] . 1 mm at least), the surface crispness after preliminary pass of a tool before applying the <b>temporary</b> <b>coating,</b> and the wear rate of a cutting tool. To ensure the economic efficiency of the ATC cutting process and high quality of treatment it is necessary to take into account all abovementioned factors that affect the machined surface. </p...|$|E

50|$|The Birdriware {{undergoes}} an eight-stage process. The eight stages are moulding, smoothening by file, designing by chisels, engraving by chisel and hammer, {{pure silver}} inlaying, smoothening again, buffing and finally oxidising by soil and ammonium chloride.Bidriware is manufactured from an alloy of copper and zinc (in the ratio 1:16) by casting.

40|$|Many airport {{surfaces}} in Australia are constructed of dense graded asphalt. These surfaces are generally replaced by asphalt overlay every 10 - 15 years. Airport asphalt surfaces are highly suited to sprayed surface preservation treatments. There are {{a range of}} treatments to preserve and {{extend the life of}} asphalt surfaces. These generally replace lost binder and/or fine mineral material. These treatments generally create a <b>temporary</b> protective <b>coating</b> over the existing surface. A number of new materials have largely replaced the traditional coal-tar based and cutback bitumen products. These new materials are emulsion based and often include polymers. This paper presents a summary of experience and new materials for treatment of asphalt surfaces at Australian airports. Oxidation retarders and surface filling treatments are explored, as well as fuel resistant membranes.

40|$|Chitosan {{is known}} for its {{hemostatic}} and antimicrobial properties and might be useful for <b>temporary</b> <b>coating</b> of removable dentures or intraoral splints to control bleeding after oral surgery or as a supportive treatment in denture stomatitis. This study investigated a new method to adhere chitosan to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). There were 70 cylindrical specimens made from PMMA and 70 from PET (13 mm diameter, 6 mm thickness). The materials with ten specimens each were sandblasted at 2. 8 or 4. 0 bar with aluminum oxide 110 μm or/and aluminum oxide coated with silica. After sandblasting, all specimens were coated with a 2 % or 4 % acetic chitosan solution with a thickness of 1 mm. Then the specimens were dried for 120 min at 45 °C. The precipitated chitosan was neutralized with 1 mol NaOH. After neutralization, all specimens underwent abrasion tests using the tooth-brushing simulator with soft brushes (load 2 N, 2 cycles/s, 32 °C, 3000 and 30, 000 cycles). After each run, the specimen surfaces were analyzed for areas of remaining chitosan by digital planimetry under a light microscope. The best chitosan adhesion was found after sandblasting with aluminum oxide coated with silica (U-Test, p < 0. 05) in both the PMMA and the PET groups. Hence, with relatively simple technology, a reliable bond of chitosan to PMMA and PET could be achieved...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Fluoride release fromglass-ionomers (GI) may be {{important}} {{for the prevention of}} secondary caries. The addition of chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to glass-ionomer cement (3 %) adds an effect that enables it {{to be used as a}} varnish for the <b>temporary</b> <b>coating</b> of surfaces at risk for caries. This study investigated the fluoride release pattern and antibacterial effect of such a material. Glassionomer luting cement powder (Aqua-Cem) was mixed with water, 10 % CHX or 10 % CHX with 11 % tartaric acid (TA), respectively, to test specimens (6 * 1. 5 mm). After setting, the specimens were immersed in 10 ml deionized water and transferred to new vials after various intervals over a period of two months. The antibacterial effect towards mutans streptococci was assessed using agar diffusion. The fluoride release was measured after two hours and after shifting the specimens to new vials 10 times during the two-month period. The total fluoride release was 69. 02, 50. 64 and 48. 56 μg/cm 2 from each specimen in the GI, GI-CHX and the GI-CHX-TA groups, respectively. For two-hour old specimens, the mean inhibition zone was 0, 50, 36 mm 2 in the GI, GI-CHX and GICHX- TA groups, respectively, and, after two months, 45 mm 2 in the GI-CHX group and 19 mm 2 in the GI-CHX-TA group. It can be concluded that the addition of CHX and CHX-TA adds antibacterial properties to GI and the release of fluoride is decreased...|$|E
40|$|The {{shift to}} use {{environmentally}} friendly technologies throughout future space-related launch programs prompted a study aimed at replacing current petroleum and solvent-based Corrosion Preventive Compounds (CPCs) with environmentally friendly alternatives. The {{work in this}} paper focused on the identification and evaluation of environmentally friendly CPCs for use in protecting flight hardware and ground support equipment from atmospheric corrosion. The CPCs, while a <b>temporary</b> protective <b>coating,</b> must survive in the aggressive coastal marine environment that exists throughout the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The different protection behaviors of fifteen different soft film CPCs, both common petroleum-based and newer environmentally friendly types, were evaluated on various steel and aluminum substrates. The CPC and substrate systems were subjected to atmospheric testing at the Kennedy Space Center's Beachside Atmospheric Corrosion Test Site, as well as cyclic accelerated corrosion testing. Each CPC also underwent physical characterization and launch-related compatibility testing.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{production}} of superhydrophobic coatings on various substrates (e. g., glass slide, silicon wafer, aluminum foil, plastic film, nanofiber mat, textile fabrics) using hydrophobic magnetic nanoparticles and a magnet-assembly technique. Fe 3 O 4 magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with a thin layer of fluoroalkyl silica on the surface were synthesized by one-step coprecipitation of Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + under an alkaline condition {{in the presence of a}} fluorinated alkyl silane. Under a magnetic field, the magnetic nanoparticles can be easily deposited on any solid substrate to form a thin superhydrophobic coating with water contact angle as high as 172 °, and the surface superhydrophobicity showed very little dependence on the substrate type. The particulate coating showed reasonable durability because of strong aggregation effect of nanoparticles, but the coating layer can be removed (e. g., by ultrasonication) to restore the original surface feature of the substrates. By comparison, the thin particle layer deposited under no magnetic field showed much lower hydrophobicity. The main reason for magnet-induced superhydrophobic surfaces is theformation of nano- and microstructured surface features. Such a magnet-induced <b>temporary</b> superhydrophobic <b>coating</b> may have wide applications in electronic, biomedical, and defense-related areas...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the bonding {{performance of a}} coating material "White Coat" (Kuraray) to enamel. Methods: Effect of surface treatment on bonding, durability of bonding, as well as re-bonding as a repeated treatment were investigated using extracted human incisors. To {{evaluate the}} effect of surface treatment, intact or ground enamel surfaces were treated using White Coat primer for 20 seconds or 40 % phosphoric acid (K-etchant) for 10 or 60 seconds, as well as combination usage of White Coat primer and 40 % phosphoric acid. Small resin cylinders of the base-coat of White Coat were bonded to the treated surfaces and irradiated for 30 seconds. For the durability test, small resin cylinders of base coat were bonded to intact enamel using White Coat primer and stored in 37 °C saline for 1 day, 1 week, 1, 3, and 6 months. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of re-bonding after the removal, re-bonding was done after various removal regimens. A micro-shear {{test was used to}} assess the bond strength of all specimens. Results: Application of the primer for 20 seconds to intact enamel produced a mean micro-shear bond strength of 28 MPa for intact and ground enamel. Values were similar to 10 seconds phosphoric acid etching to ground enamel (P> 0. 05). The bond strength of the primed intact enamel did not decrease up to 3 months (P> 0. 05), but decreased significantly by 6 months (P 0. 05). Consequently, White Coat was considered an acceptable <b>temporary</b> <b>coating</b> material tor no longer than 3 months. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Some {{years after}} the death of David Smith (1906 – 1965), Clement Greenberg, then {{executor}} of his estate, made a decision to have the white painted surface stripped from five sculptures and present them as authentic works by the artist. In removing what he considered to be a <b>temporary</b> primer <b>coating</b> that had already begun to deteriorate, Greenberg believed that he was restoring unfinished works to a state that would more accurately reflect Smith’s artistic intention, something over which he felt he could claim to have authority. Although supported in his actions by several prominent critics at the time, Greenberg was tarnished by the scandal and resigned from the estate in 1979. Raising questions about authenticity, the value of the original, the availability of the artist’s intent and who speaks for the artist after his death, a discussion on the reasons behind the original alteration and subsequent restoration of these works by the present David Smith Estate is provided. The idea that a single authentic state for Smith’s stripped sculptures can be identified is questioned, and the possibility of authenticity being linked to multiple biographies of the work is suggested...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the long term}} outcomes of temporary urethral stent placement {{for the treatment of}} recurrent bulbar urethral stricture. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight patients who underwent <b>temporary</b> polymer <b>coated</b> urethral stent placement due to recurrent bulbar urethral stricture between 2010 and 2014 were enrolled in the study. The long term outcomes of the patients were analyzed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 62. 3 ± 6. 4 (44 – 81). The overall clinical success was achieved in 18 (64. 2 %) of the 28 patients at a median (range) follow-up of 29 (7 – 46) months. No patient reported discomfort at the stent site. Stone formation was observed at the urethral stent implantation area only in one patient. Stenosis occurred in the distal end of the stents in two patients and took place in bulbar urethra in seven patients after removed the stents. The mean maximum urine flow rates were 6. 24 ± 2. 81 mL/sec and 19. 12 ± 4. 31 mL/sec before and at 3 months after the procedure, respectively. Conclusion: In this study, the success rate of temporary urethral stent placement has remained at 64. 2 % at a median follow-up of 29 months. Therefore, our outcomes have not achieved desired success rate for the standard treatment of recurrent bulbar urethral stricture...|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a <b>temporary</b> support sheet <b>coated</b> {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigment—originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional silver bromide paper print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|R
