25|$|Apart {{from the}} novel's three female protagonists, {{and the three}} {{symbiotic}} storylines that they appear in, there are other examples in the novel where Cunningham patterns his story on groups of three. Most conspicuous {{of all is the}} <b>threeway</b> relationship that once existed between Clarissa, Richard and Louis when they were three students on holiday together. In the 'Mrs. Woolf' storyline there is another grouping of three (biographically factual) in Vanessa's three children, Quentin, Julian, and Angelica, who come with their mother to visit Virginia. Then there is the nuclear family of three we find in Laura Brown, her husband Dan, and their son Richie.|$|E
500|$|The local paper, The Galway Advertiser, dubbed their <b>threeway</b> {{meeting at}} Oranmore Castle a [...] "reconciliation". Subsequently Akira Tsurukame {{released}} video material of his interviews with Bill King on the internet. Two installations in July 2006 at the Project 06 art exhibition in Galway referenced King. Response to Japanese Peace and Reconciliation was arranged in Swan House, and featured art-works by his daughter Leonie King and grand-daughter Heather Finn. The Lost at Sea installation was {{a collaboration between}} Galway-based Cane 141, who set stories told by Bill King to electronic music, and visual artist Roisin Coyle. The latter installation has since been exhibited in Dublin, and in May 2007 at Grace Exhibition Space in New York City.|$|E

500|$|In 1940, US131 {{ended at}} a <b>threeway</b> {{convergence}} with M-113 and M-131 four miles (6km) north of Walton Junction in Paradise Township. [...] From this intersection, US131 ran south to Walton Junction, M-113 ran west to Kingsley, and M-131 ran east toward Fife Lake before turning north to Petoskey. A new alignment of US131 was built from Walton Junction directly to Fife Lake. This formed a third {{leg of a}} triangle of roads, allowing US 131 to bypass the Paradise Township intersection. US131 replaced M-131 north from Fife Lake to Petoskey. M-113 was extended along the former section of US131 south to Walton Junction. The remaining leg of the triangle from Paradise Township to Fife Lake along {{a portion of the}} former M-131 was designated M-186 at this time.|$|E

50|$|Cockermouth, in Cumberland, held by Thomas Percy, was a {{traditional}} Percy Honour, as {{was that of}} Egremont; {{it is likely to}} have been due to his father's influence at court, as the earl of Northumberland was currently a Royal Councillor, and his connections with the king's chief minister Cardinal Beaufort that on 20 November 1449 he was made Lord Egremont by Letters Patent, drawing £10 per annum from the county revenues. This figure reflects the fact that Egremont was never to be a wealthy man; it has been calculated that the Percy Cumberland estates suffered a decline of 25% between 1416 and 1470. Equally diminishing to Egremont's income {{was the fact that the}} barony itself had been divided <b>threeways</b> through inheritances, and at least one-third of it- that of the Fitzwalter family- had been granted to the earl of Salisbury under a 40-year lease at the time of Thomas Percy's grant.|$|R
