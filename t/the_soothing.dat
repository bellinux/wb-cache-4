500|$|According to Bronson, {{the song}} {{summarizes}} the movie's philosophy. His opinion was somewhat echoed by Ted Cox, {{author of the}} book Whitney Houston, who noted that <b>the</b> <b>soothing</b> quality of the song fitted perfectly with the mood and texture of the movie. He described that the song has a [...] "slow groove" [...] that features the most relaxed singing of Houston's career. The Miami Herald described the song as a model of [...] "refined, easy-going soul", and Kyle Anderson of MTV described it as a [...] "smooth jam" [...] with a [...] "crazy-catchy groove". Describing the instrumentation as [...] "silky," [...] Larry Flick of Billboard wrote that Houston's performance was more soulful than before, with far more [...] "vocal colors". Stephen Holden of The New York Times commented that the song is reminiscent of 1960s girl group records, and the verses speak about growing up and learning to let go.|$|E

500|$|Lucy O'Brien, {{author of}} Madonna: Like an Icon, {{characterized}} the song as [...] "harkening {{back to a}} childlike innocence", but felt that Madonna overdid the elaborate fantasy imagery. O'Brien preferred Madonna's later attempts to sing lullaby-like songs on her 1994 and 2003 albums, Bedtime Stories and American Life. Edna Gunderson from USA Today called the song a [...] "sugary lullaby", while opining {{that it would not}} go down as one of Madonna's well-remembered songs. The Chicago Tribunes Ian Blair described the track as [...] "bouncy" [...] and praised <b>the</b> <b>soothing</b> quality of the music's composition. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post deduced that with the song, Madonna was harkening back to her own maternal emotions, the feelings she could not receive from her own mother, due to her untimely death. Reviewing the Like a Prayer album, Mike Mentos from Los Angeles Daily News was not impressed with [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] and commented that [...] "Madonna's voice possesses neither the control, power nor emotion to carry neo-baroque experiments like 'Dear Jessie' and 'Oh Father'." ...|$|E

Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the soundtrack {{four out of}} five, calling it an [...] "excellent album": [...] "There is not one single number which doesn't work. In fact if three soft numbers 'Kuch Kum', 'Khabar Nahi' and 'Jaane Kyun' are the pick of the lot, then 'Desi Girl' is a definite must for the dance floors. 'Maa Da Laadla' and 'Shut up & Bounce' have their own place under the sun." [...] Planet Bollywood rated the album eight out of ten and called it Vishal–Shekhar's best album of the year: [...] "Whether it be through the touching vocal, musical, and lyrical poetry of Kuch Kum, Vishal's riveting vocal performance in Jaane Kyun, <b>the</b> <b>soothing</b> depths of Khabar Nahin, or the uplifting, feel-good breeze of Desi Girl, Dostana has music for everyone to savor." [...] Hindustan Times also gave it a positive review, calling it [...] "a surefire chartbuster." [...] According to CNN-News18, [...] "Except for 'Shut Up and Bounce', each song in Dostana is wrapped in fun and peppiness {{on the one hand}} and melody and rhythm on the other." [...] According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 17,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's fourth highest-selling.|$|E
500|$|From the {{academic}} world, positive reviews came from Michael Campbell, author of Popular Music in America: And the Beat Goes On, {{who felt that}} <b>the</b> <b>soothing</b> melody of the track resembles British singer Steve Winwood's 1986 single [...] "Higher Love". The author noted the song for merging disparate and contradictory musical features in it. He found that the simple melody of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] offered an easy listen, but the contrasts in sound, rhythm and texture appealed to different target audiences. Australian rock music journalist Toby Creswell wrote in his book 1001 Songs that [...] "'Like a Prayer' is a beautifully crafted devotional song {{in the guise of}} perfect pop. God is the drum machine here." [...] Scholar Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna as Postmodern Myth: How One Star's Self-Construction Rewrites Sex, Gender, Hollywood and the American Dream, noted that there is a polysemy in [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] since the singer addresses either God or her lover, and in doing so [...] "Madonna achieves the gold-card of attaining her own divinity. Whenever someone calls her name, it alludes to the song". Theologian Andrew Greeley compared [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] with the biblical Song of Songs. Greeley, although focusing more on the video, acknowledged the fact that sexual passion may be revelatory, and complimented Madonna for glorifying ideologies of female subjectivity and womanhood in the song.|$|E

500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] is a down-tempo soulful R ballad with {{a female}} {{empowerment}} theme and live-sounding instruments. <b>The</b> <b>soothing</b> track starts off with Blige singing with a dark voice, [...] "So {{you think you know}} how to love a woman/ But I think it's still some things you need to know." [...] As the flowery instrumental builds with a serene piano melody and accentuating horns, Blige goes on to warn that a woman needs more than material things. A writer of Billboard magazine further noted that the song was schooling men on just how good to love a woman. During her lines, Beyoncé sings with a vibrato voice, [...] "A woman / Needs you to make love to her / She needs more than sex / Oh, a real woman needs a real man / They don’t talk about it, be about it / Put that work in, still shows his woman real romance". According to Rob Markman of MTV News, [...] "From there, the song plays as a lyrical how-to. Communication is a must, as is respect, but coming home late and being a one-minute man is a no-no." [...] Writers further noted that the duet was inspired by the music from the 1990s including a new jack swing-era R production. Beyoncé and Blige further sing the lines [...] "She doesn’t want makeup sex, she wants your respect." [...] The song also has an extended bridge section during the 2:30 mark where Blige sings the lines [...] "Pick up your phone…just to say you're still in love from time to time…" [...] with a vocal styling which was compared to Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall" [...] era. It ends with the sound of sparkler synths.Jada Gomez-Lacayo of HipHopDx compared the song with Aaron Hall's material. Ayanna Guyhto of Yahoo! Music compared the first minute of the song with Busta Rhymes' songs due to the speedy wordplay. She further noted that it was similar to the songs by Keith Sweat from the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, The Archers {{released}} {{their only}} live album, Celebrate – Live, recorded en-the-round {{at one of}} America's first mega-churches, [...] "Melodyland Christian Center" [...] in Southern California. Rick Riso, formerly of the CCM group, [...] "Messenger", wrote the title song and they performed a decade of previous hits. Another career highpoint came in 1981, when they performed on the 1980 Grammy Awards telecast, winning a Grammy for Best Gospel Performance, Contemporary or Inspirational for their contribution to Reba Rambo and Dony McGuire's The Lord's Prayer. They sang on the telecast again the next year, nominated {{in the same category}} for Spreadin' Like Wildfire, also produced by McGuire. In 1982, with opening act Bryan Duncan, they were the first Contemporary Christian band to perform at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. The performance was sold out. The anniversary year of their first decade as recording artists also brought the release of The Archers: At Their Very Best a compilation of their most popular Light tracks. Billboard Magazine reviewed the release saying, [...] "This collection of the Archers' popular songs of the past decade proves their versatility, covering mainstream pop, light jazz and near-choral arrangements.

2500|$|For his {{assignment}} of his brother, Ashurbanipal sent {{a statue of}} the divinity Marduk with him as sign of good will. [...] Shamash-shuma-ukin's power was limited. He performed Babylonian rituals but the official building projects were still executed by his younger brother. During his first years Elam was still in peace as it was under his father. Ashurbanipal sent food supplies to the Elamites during a famine. Around 664 BC the situation changed and Urtaku, the Elamite king, attacked Assyria's colony of Babylonia by surprise. Assyria delayed in sending aid to Babylon. This could have been caused for two reasons: either <b>the</b> <b>soothing</b> messages of Elamite ambassadors or Ashurbanipal might simply not have been present at that time. However the Assyrians eventually attacked and the Elamites retreated before the Assyrian troops, {{and in the same}} year Urtaku died. He was succeeded by Teumman (Tempti-Khumma-In-Shushinak) who was not his legitimate heir, so many Elamite princes had to flee [...] to Ashurbanipal's court, including Urtaku's oldest son Humban-nikash. In 658/657 BC the two empires clashed again, when the province of Gambulu in 664 rebelled against the Assyrians and Ashurbanipal decided to punish them. On the other hand, Teumman saw his authority threatened by the Elamite princes at the Assyrian court and demanded their extradition. The Assyrian forces invaded Elam and fought a battle at the Ulaya river.|$|E

[...] However, in his view, over time, Iron Dome may do the Israeli public more harm than good because despite the fact it is a [...] "tactical miracle" [...] it may help create a serious strategic problem to Israelis' long-term security because, by temporarily minimizing the dangers posed by rocket attacks, it distracts Israelis from seeking a broader regional political solution that could finally make systems such as Iron Dome unnecessary. [...] In Fromer's view, the Israeli government is [...] "not exactly brimming with creative ideas to reignite the peace process with the Palestinians. And with Iron Dome, why would it? As long as the Israeli public believes it is safe, for now, under <b>the</b> <b>soothing</b> embrace of technology, it will not demand that its political leaders wage diplomacy to end violence that mandated Iron Dome in the first place. Since Iron Dome has transformed a grim reality into a rather bearable ordeal, Israelis have lost the sense of urgency and outrage that might have pushed their government" [...] to make necessary concessions in exchange for peace. [...] In Fromer's view, Israelis risk confusing the short-term military advantage provided by Iron Dome with the long term need for an original and comprehensive diplomatic solution.|$|E
