40|$|International audienceComposites {{are being}} {{increasingly}} used in various applications {{because of their}} light weight and high performance. One of the common disadvantages of composite materials is the formation of defects during manufacturing such as voids and dry spots that adversely affect mechanical and physical properties. Although void formation mechanisms and analytical prediction of performance degradation due to voidage have been studied in more detail, knowledge of morphology and spatial variation of voids in resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> composites is limited. In this work, the radial and through-the-thickness variation of void morphology in a resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> composite disk is investigated. A resin <b>transfer</b> <b>molded</b> composite disk is fabricated using a mixture of epoxy resin EPON 815 C and curing agent EPICURE 3282. The molding is achieved by injecting the mixture into a center-gated mold cavity preloaded with randomly-oriented glass preform, yielding a fiber volume fraction of 18 %. After demolding, a radial sample is {{cut out of the}} disk and embedded into a quick cure acrylic resin for subsequent polishing. Spatial void distribution as well as the shape and size of voids are investigated along the radial axis and through the thickness of the disk. The studied cross-section is divided into three radial regions. Each region is subsequently divided into three thickness layers. Using 200 X magnification, each layer and region is scanned, and the images of identified voids are captured. Image Tool® software is utilized to determine the area and maximum length of each void.

I. THE DIP-IPM Historically, small motor drives for consumer appliance applications have relied mainly on discrete copackaged (containing both IGBT and free wheel diode) devices in TO- 220 or TO- 247 packages. The main drawback of this approach is its cumbersome assembly that requires mounting and isolating multiple packages.

50|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>molding</b> (BrE moulding) is a {{manufacturing}} process where casting material is {{forced into a}} mold. <b>Transfer</b> <b>molding</b> is different from compression molding in that the mold is enclosed Hayward rather than open to the fill plunger resulting in higher dimensional tolerances and less environmental impact. Compared to injection molding, <b>transfer</b> <b>molding</b> uses higher pressures to uniformly fill the mold cavity. This allows thicker reinforcing fiber matrices to be more completely saturated by resin. Furthermore, unlike injection molding the transfer mold casting material may start the process as a solid. This can reduce equipment costs and time dependency. The transfer process may have a slower fill rate than an equivalent injection molding processes.|$|E

The ability to dice the package size independent to the molding chase or punching equipment is the largest benefit of this technology.

Initially the root cause was suspected to be the CTE difference of the materials that generates mechanical warpage to the laminate, but simulational analysis showed no impact. To solve the phenomenon, we discovered the correlation of the laminate profile, solder mask thickness variations, and mechanical stresses on the chip surface. A “bath tub ” shaped solder mask profile at the center of chip placement area on the laminate may cause excessive pressure on the chip during <b>transferring</b> <b>mold</b> compound, and result in chip fractures.
