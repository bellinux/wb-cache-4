500|$|Minerve was {{the closest}} to the {{arriving}} French vessels and immediately gave chase, Cockburn signalling to Halsted and Leveson-Gower to join him. On sighting the British frigates Bretel turned back northwards towards Leghorn, but by 09:00 all three British warships were gaining on his small squadron. Unable to escape pursuit and with Minerve rapidly approaching, Bretel drove Succès ashore at Vada beach near Cecina {{in the hope of}} luring Minerve away from Bravoure, but Cockburn instead simply fired on the grounded vessel in passing before continuing towards the remaining ship while Bretel surrendered to Pomone. Captain Louis-Auguste Dordelin made desperate attempts to reach Leghorn before he was overtaken, but a northerly wind drove him back repeatedly and eventually he was forced to drive his frigate ashore under the Antignano battery, [...] south of Leghorn harbour. Waves battered Bravoure, causing all three masts <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> and the ship to become a total wreck. The small British force under Lieutenant William Kelly that boarded Bravoure was only able to bring off a few prisoners before heavy fire from batteries ashore forced them to quit her. Kelly ignored his instructions to burn Bravoure in order to spare the lives of the many French sailors still trapped on the ship.

2500|$|His last log entry was on 1 July 1969; it {{is assumed}} that he then either fell or jumped {{overboard}} and drowned. The state of the boat gave no indication that it had been overrun by a rogue wave, or that any accident had occurred which might have caused Crowhurst <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard.</b> He may have taken with him a single deceptive log book and the ship's clock. Three log books (two navigational logs and a radio log) and a large mass of other papers were left on his boat in order to communicate his philosophical ideas and to reveal his actual navigational course during the voyage.The boat was found with the sail up, and there was no indication that it had been overrun by a rogue wave or that any accident had occurred. [...] Items missing from the boat were only a possible fourth log book and the ship's clock. Although his biographers, Tomalin and Hall, discounted the possibility that some sort of food poisoning contributed to his mental deterioration, they acknowledged that there is insufficient evidence to rule it, or several other hypotheses, out.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that salvage teams had made [...] "good progress" [...] on 4 February. A crane travelled from York on 5 February and lifted equipment onto the ship. The salvage team aimed to reduce {{the list of the}} ship and make it more stable. On 4 February, around 50 members of the public ignored the exclusion zone to get close to the ship. Police and Coastguard admitted they were powerless to prevent the breach of the Government-imposed exclusion zone and vowed to step up security to prevent a recurrence. The imposition of the exclusion zone on grounds of public safety was proved to be correct when several trucks fell off on the afternoon of 5 February, caused by the ship moving at high tide. The exclusion zone was enforced on 6 February, with police, coastguard and security patrols being used. More of the ship's cargo fell overboard on 6 February. It {{was reported}} on 7 February that the salvage operation was going well, and about half of the equipment required for the operation was aboard. On 8 February, shackles holding the remaining trailers were released, allowing the vehicles on the top deck <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard.</b> The wreckage was cleared by a specialist demolition contractor.|$|E

50|$|There was {{a second}} {{accident}} at about 05:00 hrs when No. 8 lifeboat capsized in a heavy sea below {{the stern of the}} yacht Southern Cross, killing 10 people. Three passengers were crushed to death while trying to transfer from lifeboats to the Royal Navy destroyers. Other deaths were due <b>to</b> <b>falling</b> <b>overboard</b> from Athenia and her lifeboats, or to injuries and exposure. Ultimately, all deaths were the result of the U-boat violating orders and torpedoing a merchant passenger liner.|$|R
25|$|A {{memorial}} {{featuring a}} bust of Meagher was dedicated in 2009 {{on the bank of}} the Missouri River in Fort Benton, Montana, believed to be near the site of the riverboat where he was said <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> <b>overboard.</b>|$|R
60|$|He was an oldish, shabby little fellow, {{with bad}} teeth and no {{hair on his}} face. He had been shipped in a hurry in Shanghai, that trip when the second officer brought from home had delayed the ship three hours in port by contriving (in some manner Captain MacWhirr could never understand) <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> into an empty coal-lighter lying alongside, {{and had to be}} sent ashore to the {{hospital}} with concussion of the brain and a broken limb or two.|$|E
6000|$|But {{presently}} I heard a distant, hoarse {{noise from}} below; and though I {{could not make}} out any thing intelligible, I knew it was the mate hurrying me. So in a nervous, trembling desperation, I went to casting off the gaskets, or lines tying up the sail; and when all was ready, sung out as I had been told, to [...] "hoist away!" [...] And hoist they did, and me too along with the yard and sail; for I had no time to get off, they were so unexpectedly quick about it. It seemed like magic; there I was, going up higher and higher; the yard rising under me, as if it were alive, and no soul in sight. Without knowing it at the time, I was in a good deal of danger, but it was so dark that I could not see well enough to feel afraid--at least on that account; though I felt frightened enough in a promiscuous way. I only held on hard, and made good the saying of old sailors, that the last person <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> from the rigging is a landsman, because he grips the ropes so fiercely; whereas old tars are less careful, and sometimes pay the penalty.|$|E
60|$|The sea {{has ever}} been an inexhaustible subject for the pens of most classes of writers. The poet, the traveller, and the novelist has each devoted {{a portion of his}} time and talents to the mighty ocean; but that part of it which it has fallen to my lot to {{describe}} is very different from those portions about which poets have sung with rapture. Here, none of the many wonders of the tropical latitudes beguile the tedium of the voyage; no glittering dolphins force the winged inhabitants of the deep to seek shelter on the vessel's deck; no ravenous sharks follow in our wake to eat us if we chance <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard,</b> or amuse us by swallowing our baited hook; no passing vessel cheers us with the knowledge that there are others besides ourselves roaming over the interminable waste of waters. All was dreary and monotonous; the same unvarying expanse of sky and water met our gaze each morning as we ascended to the deck, to walk for half an hour before breakfast, except when the topsails of the other two vessels fluttered for a moment on the distant horizon. Occasionally we approached closer to each other, and once or twice hailed with the trumpet; but these breaks in the solitude of our existence were few and far between.|$|E

5000|$|Like his {{previous}} book, The End: Montauk, N.Y., Mermaids {{was inspired by}} Dweck's experiences interacting with the local environment. While night fishing in the waters off Long Island's south shore, Dweck was captivated by the flashing streaks of light caused by fish swimming beneath him. [...] "The idea was, if I happen <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> one night, what would I see down there? Those flashes of light could be mermaids." ...|$|E
50|$|A boat neck, {{also called}} a bateau neck or Sabrina {{neckline}}, {{is a wide}} neckline that runs horizontally, front and back, almost to the shoulder points, across the collarbone. It is traditionally used in nautically inspired sweaters and knitwear, but is also featured in more elegant cocktail dresses and eveningwear. The style derives from sailors' blouses or sweaters, often with wide navy and white horizontal stripes. The wide, plain neck was said to facilitate quick removal if a sailor were <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{incidents}} on the Chebucto, happened on June 29, 1875, when {{a man and his}} daughter were aboard the ferry on their horse and wagon heading to Halifax. Something caused the horses to panic which resulted in the daughter, horse, and wagon <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard.</b> The horse drowned despite trying to swim for a short time. The horse was pulled under the surface by the sinking wagon, as it was still attached to it. The daughter was rescued and survived.|$|E
2500|$|At about 1:00a.m. on {{the morning}} of April 11, 1908, Arthur “Kelso” Pscherer, a {{deckhand}} on Chester, went missing and was presumed <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> <b>overboard</b> and drowned. [...] Pscherer was last seen by the night watchman of the steamer Kellogg crossing the deck of the Kellogg over to the Chester. [...] Pscherer was not thought to have left back across the Kellogg to shore, because all of his effects were still on Chester.|$|R

After a search, George Allen Smith was discovered to be missing and thought <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> <b>overboard.</b> A criminal investigation into possible foul play was conducted, and a brief press release on the company's investor relations website announced the settlement of the case, later revealed to be more than $1 million.|$|R
5|$|Exeter {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his armour and left for dead on the battlefield at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured. His followers found him {{and took him to}} Westminster Abbey. On his recovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for four years before submitting to Edward's rule. Exeter did not participate in the later battles of the Wars of the Roses. Edward sent him on a Yorkist expedition to France in 1475, and the duke was reported <b>to</b> have <b>fallen</b> <b>overboard</b> and drowned without any witnesses.|$|R

Unknown to her, he's been raising his three orphaned nephews in their unkempt house and desperately needs a nanny. Taking advantage of her memory loss, he manages to convince her that she's his live-in girlfriend and renames her Na Sang-shil. But he didn't expect her spoiled selfishness to slowly turn into compassion. And he didn't expect <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> again — this time, for her.|$|E
5000|$|Superficially, {{the film}} is framed as a murder mystery. While {{hitching}} a ride in a back {{of a pickup truck}} full of workers, Alice is attacked by a strange cloaked person. She pushes him <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> while the truck is crossing a high bridge, and she is accused of murder. However the body mysteriously disappears, she is relieved of murder charges, and she narrates her story, presented as a flashback in the film. Her adventure starts when she is delegated to a small town of Maravillas ("Wondertown"; maravilla=wonder). While the title is an allusion to Alice in Wonderland, it is not an adaptation of the English book. [...] There are a number of allusions and parallels, but they are difficult to recognize to people who did not live in Cuba at this time period. In fact, Juan Borrero mentioned that a young Cuban born the year the film was cast told him that he could not understand why the film caused such a controversy.|$|E
50|$|The {{officers}} escaped in {{the starboard}} lifeboat, leaving the pilgrims to their fate. The Board of Trade inquiry proceedings {{note that a}} scuffle broke out while the lifeboat was being launched; the passengers threw whatever they could onto the lifeboat {{to prevent it from}} being lowered, and pulled away the first mate, who was lowering the boat from the ship, causing him <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard.</b> The first mate later was pulled into the lifeboat. Thus, the captain, his wife, the chief engineer, the first officer and several other crew members escaped in the lifeboat, leaving the passengers {{and a few of the}} officers and crew on their own on board Jeddah. The British convict ship SS Scindian picked up the people in the lifeboat a few hours later at 10:00 a.m. on 8 August and took them to Aden, where they told a story of violent passengers murdering two of the ship′s engineers and reported that Jeddah had sunk near Yemen with great loss of life among her passengers.|$|E
50|$|On July 23, 1999, {{during the}} offseason after his rookie NHL campaign, Tertyshny was on a boating trip to Okanagan Lake in British Columbia with two players from the Flyers' minor-league {{affiliate}} Philadelphia Phantoms, Francis Belanger and Mikhail Chernov, when a freak accident caused him to suffer fatal injuries.

5000|$|At the Central Park Zoo, Marty {{the zebra}} is celebrating his tenth birthday, but has grown bored with his daily routine and longs to {{experience}} the wild. Marty's best friend is Alex the lion, who enjoys showing off for the public and his celebrity status as [...] "the king of New York". Alex attempts to cheer Marty up, but Marty, still unsatisfied, gets some tips from the zoo's penguins—Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private—who are trying to escape the zoo, and follows them out. Alex, Melman the giraffe, and Gloria the hippopotamus pursue Marty {{in an attempt to}} convince him to return. The four, along with the penguins and two chimpanzees named Mason and Phil, find themselves at Grand Central Station, where they are quickly sedated via tranquillizer gun when Alex's attempt to communicate with humans is mistaken for aggression. The zoo, under pressure from anti-captivity activists, is forced to ship the escaped animals by sea to a Kenyan wildlife preserve. During their travels, the penguins escape from their enclosure and take over the ship, intent on taking it to Antarctica. Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> and wash ashore on Madagascar.|$|E

Steph lies that Shelley only wants Alan's money so Shelley left, leading Alan to begin drinking heavily. Alan and Steph argue on the B&B stairs before Alan falls down them and Steph looks after him but drugs him, leaving him at her mercy, as she plans to sell Alan's business and put him into sheltered accommodation. Alan realises what Steph is doing and manages to tell his neighbours, leading Steph to almost kill them both by driving to a quarry edge but she can't {{go through with it}} and what she has been doing is revealed. Shelley disappears and Steph is suspected of murdering her and Alan accepts Shelley is dead, only for her to attend the memorial service. Although horrified that Shelley had let Steph go to prison for suspected murder, he forgave her and they tried to rebuild their relationship but Shelley couldn't cope with Steph around and Alan couldn't disown his daughter so he begged Steph to go after Shelly and bring her home.

5000|$|Steamboat {{operation}} was hazardous during this time. The vessels were endangered by snags and other dangers in the rivers, {{and even when}} there was no overall threat to the vessel, the crewmen themselves were at risk. This was illustrated by an incident involving Ruth which occurred on February 16, 1901, which was investigated by the Portland local office of the Steamboat Inspection Service: At about 4.30 a. m., while the steamer Ruth was en route from Portland to Corvallis. Oreg., she struck a piece of driftwood near the mouth of the Santiam River, Oregon, Willamette River. The watchman, Ira Bell, was sent into the hold to see if any damage had been done to the hull.

Ark Three heads back out to sea but has nowhere to go, given that the floods are now lapping around the Rocky Mountains. Seaborn piracy is rife from those refugee seaborn populations who have taken to scavenging the refuse from the posthumous remains of human civilization; and after a visit to coastal Colorado, the pirates ultimately board and destroy Ark Three.

40|$|The SAR-DRIFT project aims at {{developing}} a forecast system for localisation of drifting objects, {{as well as}} decision aid tools for Maritime Search and Rescue. Its basic principle is to predict the position of drifting objects, when combining environmental measurements and forecast through sophisticated stochastic modelling. Among the different tasks of the project, one is to assess the hydrodynamic behaviour of various objects drifting at sea when submitted to the joint action of wind, waves and currents. Thousands of cargo containers are reported <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>overboard</b> each year. A significant part of these containers will stay afloat from several hours to several weeks and represent a major hazard to navigation. In order to evaluate the drift coefficients of such cargo containers, trials were conducted at sea during which a 20 feet container was let adrift for 24 hours while measuring environmental parameters. Experimental set-up and operational process are described in this report. Main results on evaluation of the behaviour of the drifting container are also presented...|$|E
