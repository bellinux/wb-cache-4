5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|The main {{adaptations of}} the {{pinniped}} circulatory system for diving are the enlargement and increased complexity of veins {{to increase their}} capacity. Retia mirabilia form blocks of tissue on the inner wall of the thoracic cavity and the body periphery. These tissue masses, which contain extensive contorted spirals of arteries and thin-walled veins, act as blood reservoirs that increase oxygen stores for use during diving. As with other diving mammals, pinnipeds have high amounts of hemoglobin and myoglobin stored in their blood and muscles. This allows them to stay submerged {{for long periods of}} time while still having enough oxygen. Deep-diving species such as elephant seals have blood volumes that make up to 20% of their body weight. When diving, they reduce their heart rate and maintain blood flow only to the heart, brain and lungs. To keep <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> stable, phocids have an elastic aorta that dissipates some energy of each heartbeat.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{pressure}} readings do vary but experts recommend that blood pressure should not range above 140/80.

25|$|Diabetes {{has several}} {{complications}} of {{which one is}} hypertension or high blood pressure. Data indicate that at least 60-80 percent of individuals whom develop diabetes will eventually develop high blood pressure. The high blood pressure is gradual at early stages and may take at least 10–15 years to fully develop. Besides diabetes, other factors that may also increase high blood pressure include obesity, insulin resistance and high cholesterol levels. In general, fewer than 25 percent of diabetics have good control of <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> The presence {{of high blood pressure}} in diabetes is associated with a 4 fold increase in death chiefly from heart disease and strokes.|$|E

50|$|For some patients, <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> {{measurements}} {{taken in}} a doctor's office may not correctly characterize <b>their</b> typical <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> In up to 25% of patients, the office measurement is higher than <b>their</b> typical <b>blood</b> <b>pressure.</b> This type of error is called white-coat hypertension (WCH) and can result from anxiety related to an examination by a health care professional. White coat hypertension can also occur because, in a clinical setting, patients are seldom {{given the opportunity to}} rest for five minutes before <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> readings are taken. The misdiagnosis of hypertension for these patients can result in needless and possibly harmful medication. WCH can be reduced (but not eliminated) with automated <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements over 15 to 20 minutes in a quiet part of the office or clinic.

500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held {{in the guest room}} of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper took place in a triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis, a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if his feet were supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E

Interestingly enough, the outcome to the recall of the grudge the candidates’ blood pressure and heart rate increased, and they sweated more.

They showed no more of an anxiety reaction than normal wakefulness produces.|$|E
2500|$|Cabergoline is also {{associated}} with side-effects such as nausea and dizziness, but these may be less common and less severe than with bromocriptine. However, people with low blood pressure should use caution when starting cabergoline treatment, as the long half-life of the drug (4–7 days) may inadvertently affect their ability to keep <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> within normal limits, creating intense discomfort, dizziness, and even fainting upon standing and walking until the single first dose clears from their system. [...] As with bromocriptine therapy, side-effects may be avoided or minimized if treatment is started slowly. [...] If a patient's prolactin level remains normal for 6 months, a doctor may consider stopping treatment. [...] Cabergoline should not be interrupted without consulting a qualified endocrinologist.|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of adults with hypertension {{do not get}} <b>their</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> controlled to currently recommended targets, despite relatively consistent <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> targets in guidelines from around the world.
