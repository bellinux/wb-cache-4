25|$|The export range, from 1948 {{were the}} OPS2, OPS3 and OPS4. They also {{featured}} the O600 engine and synchromesh gearbox as introduced, but air brakes were optional. The OPS2 shared the PS2's 17ft 6in wheelbase, although the frames, springs and axles were heavier duty than their home market equivalents, bodies {{could be as}} long as 29ft 3in where laws permitted, the OPS3 was introduced {{at the same time}} as the OPS2 but had a 19ft wheelbase for bodies up to 31ft long. This variant would not have met UK turning circle requirements when the new 30ft length was legalised in 1950. Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the Irish state <b>transport</b> <b>undertaking</b> uniquely took Tigers of both PS2/13 and OPS3 type, these become the last vehicles of over 300 to be numbered in the P series that had started with Dublin United Transport's first Tiger in 1935. Walter Alexander took some OPS2 coaches as well as PS2s but these are believed to have been a frustrated export order. The OPS4, had a 21ft 6in wheelbase for a bodied length of 35ft, Duple produced a batch of fifteen LOPS4/3 with Park Royal metal frames in 1949 for coach operators in Buenos Aires and a single coach to the same outline for Gibraltar motorways. Production of the 'overseas' Tiger concentrated in the 1950s on the OPS4/5 variant with exposed radiator, O680 engine, air brakes and Pneumocyclic gearbox as standard, the final (post 1967) versions were coded OPS4A/15 following updates in the Titan range and a rationalisation of nomenclature and components. The last Tiger OPS4s were delivered to South African fleets in 1970, some of these were still working at the turn of the century.|$|E
2500|$|But {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} plan {{actually}} lies in agriculture, contrary to the image of CPEC as a massive industrial and <b>transport</b> <b>undertaking,</b> involving power plants and highways. The plan acquires its greatest specificity, and lays out the largest number of projects and plans for their facilitation, in agriculture. For agriculture, the plan outlines an engagement that runs {{from one end of the}} supply chain all the way to the other. From provision of seeds and other inputs, like fertiliser, credit and pesticides, Chinese enterprises will also operate their own farms, processing facilities for fruits and vegetables and grain. Logistics companies will operate a large storage and transportation system for agrarian produce, as stated by the plan in DAWN News.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe main aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse the impact of urban {{projects}} related to passenger and freight <b>transport</b> <b>undertaken</b> by local governments on the reduction of environmental degradation. The authors have presented the survey results conducted among 36 cities with administration county rights in Poland. In addition in the paper the multidimensional comparative analysis, including correspondence analysis, has been applied. This analysis enabled different classes of cities to be obtained related to the passenger and freight transport and targeted at environmental protection projects. The study results quite clearly show {{that there are no}} standards in the measurement of urban projects’ efficiency according to their impact on environmental protection and the range of implemented projects in this field depends on the city population size...|$|R

25|$|The {{foresight}} of council planners {{in constructing}} such an iconic investment has spurred further development. The $600 million Project DART (Developing Auckland's Rail <b>Transport)</b> was <b>undertaken,</b> with the state-owned enterprise ONTRACK (now KiwiRail) providing the ‘below rail’ construction (i.e. platforms, tracks and signals) and ARTA providing the passenger services and facilities at stations (i.e. lighting, shelters and access), {{with funding from}} the Auckland Regional Council and Land Transport New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{transport}} authorities {{throughout the}} world are increasingly looking to combat congestion {{by a combination of}} demand management and improvements in public transport systems. To encourage greater use of public transport, it is essential that frequent, reliable and 'undelayed' journeys can be provided and this has led to a range of public transport priority measures being introduced in many cities. With the emergence of new technologies, particularly advanced transport telematics (ATT), opportunities now exist to supplement the more traditional priority measures, such as bus lanes, with new priority techniques for traffic control systems. This paper describes the development, evaluation and implementation of such systems in Europe, with particular reference to the PROMPT project (Priority and Informatics in Public <b>Transport)</b> <b>undertaken</b> under the European Commission's DRIVE II ATT programme. The paper describes the philosophy, strategies and performance of the advanced priority systems in PROMPT, based on results from simulations and field trials. Key findings relevant to wider applications are also presented, including alternative technologies, such as GPS. (a) For the covering entry of this conference, see IRRD abstract 868345...|$|R
