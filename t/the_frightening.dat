5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|This day a {{dense fog}} {{obscured}} everything. Things a foot away {{could not be}} made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. <b>The</b> <b>frightening</b> waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up into the blue sky and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|E
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can see out a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Frightened</b> was a {{radio program}} {{broadcast}} {{in the late}} 1950s. During 1956 Lyle Kenyon Engel put together a package of two radio shows and four magazines. The shows were American Agent, a spy drama, and <b>The</b> <b>Frightened,</b> narrated by Boris Karloff; the magazines included Tales of <b>the</b> <b>Frightened,</b> a tie in to the radio show.

25|$|Bene Gesserit {{also have}} the ability to {{practice}} simulflow, literally the simultaneous flow of several threads of consciousness at any given time; mental multitasking, as it were. The combination of simulflow with their analytical abilities and Other Memory are responsible for <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> intelligence of the average Bene Gesserit, though this ability is less powerful than the analytical abilities of a Mentat. This simulflow can also be held with Other Memory; Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade practiced both forms in Heretics of Dune.|$|E

500|$|... "Home" [...] has {{continued}} to receive positive reviews. In a 2011 review, Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] rating and wrote that, like many episodes of The X-Files, the episode was a statement of its time and likely could not be produced in a post-9/11 climate. He praised the depiction of urban sensibilities and <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> Peacock family, observing that it represented a [...] "sad farewell to a weird America that was rapidly smoothing itself out." [...] Author Dean A. Kowalski, in The Philosophy of The X-Files, cited [...] "Home", [...] "Squeeze", and [...] "The Host" [...] as the most notable [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] episodes.|$|E
500|$|A trilogy {{of young}} adult novels, The Whitby Witches, makes {{much of the}} town's setting and history, embellishing local traditions whilst {{incorporating}} them into the narrative. The author, Robin Jarvis, recalls [...] "The first time I visited Whitby, I stepped off the train and knew I was somewhere very special. It was a grey, drizzling day but that only added to the haunting beauty and lonely atmosphere of the place. Listening to Carmina Burana on my headphones, I explored the ruined abbey on the clifftop. The place was a fantastic inspiration. In the Whitby Witches I have interwoven many of the existing local legends, such as <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> Barguest, whilst inventing {{a few of my}} own, most notably the aufwaders." [...] Jarvis returned to Whitby for his 2016 novel, The Power of Dark, the first in The Witching Legacy series.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} his Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973), [...] "a formidable piece of abstract composition" [...] according to Bowen, Tippett {{returned to the}} modern vernacular in his fourth opera The Ice Break (1976). Describing the music in {{an introduction to the}} published libretto, Tippett identifies [...] "two archetypal sounds: one relating to <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> but exhilarating sound of the ice breaking on the great northern rivers in the spring; the other related to the exciting or terrifying sound of the slogan-shouting crowds, which can lift you on your shoulders in triumph, or stamp you to death". [...] Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of The Midsummer Marriage". William Mann in The Times [...] was equally enthusiastic, finding the music compelling and worthy of many a rehearing.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five and called it [...] "terrific". They applauded Shiban's script, noting that it focused on [...] "greater {{attention}} {{to the relationship between}} Mulder and Scully", rather than the X-File itself. The two called the shot where Scully sees the apparition in the bathroom [...] "one of the most chilling things the series has offered this year", and noted that the part with Scully conferring with her counselor [...] "is the highlight of the season". Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Elegy" [...] three stars out of four, writing that the X-File part of the episode [...] "falls apart by the end" [...] but that the installment is saved by [...] "the emotional impact of Scully". Vitaris praised the acting of the cast, and especially lauded Anderson's performance, noting that she conveyed [...] "the shock and confusion at witnessing <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> sight of the ghostly girl with a cut throat".|$|E
500|$|Derek Yu from The Indie Games Source {{compared}} {{the game with}} Portal and stated that Chung was able to develop [...] "an impeccable flair for graphic design" [...] while manufacturing Gravity Bone.

[...] Yu elaborated that it had [...] "enough panache in its two levels to make it somewhat of an indie sleeper hit of the end of 2008." [...] An editor from The Refined Geek was pleased with Gravity Bone and its sequel, Thirty Flights of Loving, awarding them each a score of 8 out of 10 and stating, [...] "the enjoyment from these games comes from noticing all the subtle environmental clues and then using your imagination to draw the connecting dots." [...] The editor commented that both games highlight story elements over graphics and technical innovations, saying each game's [...] "true strength comes from its ability to tell a story in the extremely short time frame." ...|$|E

500|$|Dylan concludes Highway 61 Revisited {{with the}} sole {{acoustic}} exception to his rock album. Gill has characterized [...] "Desolation Row" [...] as [...] "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which {{takes the form of}} a Fellini-esque parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of iconic characters". These include historical celebrities such as Einstein and Nero, the biblical characters Noah and Cain and Abel, the Shakespearian figures of Ophelia and Romeo, ending with literary titans T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. The song opens with a report that [...] "they're selling postcards of the hanging", and adds [...] "the circus is in town". Polizzotti connects this song with the lynching of three black circus workers in Duluth, Minnesota, which was Dylan's birthplace, and describes [...] "Desolation Row" [...] as a cowboy song, [...] "the 'Home On The Range' of <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> territory that was mid-sixties America". In the penultimate verse, the passengers on the Titanic are shouting [...] "Which side are you on?". Shelton suggests Dylan is asking, [...] "What difference which side you're on if you're sailing on the Titanic?" [...] and is thus satirizing [...] "simpleminded political commitment".|$|E
500|$|Time {{magazine}} television critic James Poniewozik said Ansari did [...] "an excellent job" [...] at {{showing a}} new side to Tom, and complimented the staging {{of the fourth}} floor sequence. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "Tom's Divorce" [...] was [...] "by design, more melancholy" [...] than previous Parks and Recreation episodes, but served to develop Tom's character and proved Aziz Ansari [...] "could tone it down and play a quieter, sadder Tom for once". Sepinwall said the Mark, Ann and Andy subplot was not as funny as in previous episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez {{said she had been}} awaiting a storyline centering on Tom, and said the episode [...] "makes us love the show more". However, she said Andy's continued obsession with Ann was growing tiresome and expressed hope his character should go in a new direction. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode further added to the strong character development that has been consistent throughout the show's second season. Fowler also enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> portrayal of the fourth floor, which he said helps establish Pawnee as [...] "a place where both the engrossingly real and the entertainingly surreal can co-exist". GQ writer Dan Fierman praised the episode, particularly Ron's character and the singing telegram [...] "divorce horse".|$|E
500|$|... "Hush" [...] {{was highly}} praised when it aired, {{not only for}} its riskiness in {{presenting}} viewers with extended silence, but for <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> qualities of The Gentlemen. Robert Bianco from USA Today comments, [...] "(i)n a medium in which producers tend to grow bored with their own creations, either trashing them or taking them in increasingly bizarre directions, Whedon continues {{to find new ways to}} make his fabulously entertaining series richer and more compelling. With or without words, he's a TV treasure." [...] In the Ottawa Citizen, Chuck Barney writes, [...] "I wondered if this enormously entertaining cult favourite would lose some starch once our favourite little slayer moved on to college. But happily, it continues to win us over with the way it deftly bounces between the genres of comedy, horror and romance. The recent silent episode (Hush) was brilliant." [...] Alan Sepinwall in The Star-Ledger calls it a [...] "magnificently daring episode", explaining [...] "(w)hat makes it particularly brave is that, even when Buffy has been failing to click dramatically this year, the show has still been able to get by on the witty dialogue, which is all but absent after the first few scenes. Whedon finds ways to get around that, with several cast members—particularly Anthony Head as the scholarly Giles and Alyson Hannigan as nervous witch Willow—proving to be wonderfully expressive silent comedians." ...|$|E

500|$|A notable {{feature of}} the Final Destination films is the {{threshold}} or tipping-point logic of characters' deaths. Conrich frames the complex death sequences in Final Destination films as [...] "death games, contraptions or puzzles {{in which there are}} only losers", which he compares to Rube Goldberg machines, the Grand Guignol, and Mouse Trap. Brinkema picks out the deaths of Ashley and Ashlyn from Final Destination 3 as epitomizing the death sequences in the Final Destination series. The characters' deaths are brought about by [...] "a series of neutral gestures, a set of constraints that will ultimately lead to their conflagratory ends"; these include the placing of a drink, a rifling-through of CDs, and an ill-chosen doorstop. The scene utilizes logics of temperature, color, and light to realize the deaths of the characters, as well as to allow Wendy to recognize the threat that they face. The [...] "literal tipping point", at which the characters can no longer escape, occurs when a coat rack is knocked onto the sunbeds; it is blown by an air-conditioning unit, which was turned on by the rising heat. Conrich identifies the roller-coaster derailment as paradigmatic of the franchise's focus on mobility in death sequences. He argues that theme-park rides and horror cinema are mutually influential; the former draw from <b>the</b> <b>frightening</b> aspects of the latter, while the latter draw from the [...] "theatrics and kinetics" [...] of the former.|$|E
