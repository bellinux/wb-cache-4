25|$|The 21-K {{used the}} same {{ammunition}} as the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1937 (53-K). The biggest problem in its role as an anti-aircraft gun was that it wasn't provided with a <b>time</b> <b>fuze</b> that would detonate the shell at a specified distance from the gun. This meant that only a direct hit would damage its target.|$|E
50|$|Artillery <b>Time</b> <b>fuzes</b> {{detonate}} after a set {{period of}} <b>time.</b> Early <b>time</b> <b>fuzes</b> were igniferous (i.e. combustible) using a powder train.

500|$|Parsons had the new {{proximity}} fuzes, {{now known}} as VT (variable <b>time)</b> <b>fuze,</b> Mark 32, flown to the Mare Island Navy Yard, where they were mated with 5"/38 caliber gun rounds. Some 5,000 of them were then shipped to the South Pacific. Parsons flew there himself, where he met with Admiral William F. Halsey at his headquarters in Noumea. He arranged for Parsons to take VT fuzes out {{with him on the}} cruiser [...] On 6 January 1943, Helena was part of a cruiser force that bombarded Munda in the Solomon Islands. On the return trip, the cruisers were attacked by four Aichi D3A (Val) dive bombers. Helena fired at one with a VT fuze. It exploded close to the aircraft, which crashed into the sea.|$|E
500|$|A 1922 {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy, Parsons served {{on a variety of}} warships beginning with the battleship [...] He was trained in ordnance and studied ballistics under L.T.E. Thompson at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia. In July 1933, Parsons became liaison officer between the Bureau of Ordnance and the Naval Research Laboratory. He became interested in radar {{and was one of the}} first to recognize its potential to locate ships and aircraft, and perhaps even track shells in flight. In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of the National Defense Research Committee began work on the development of the proximity fuze, a radar-triggered fuze that would explode a shell in the proximity of the target. The fuze, eventually known as the VT (variable <b>time)</b> <b>fuze,</b> Mark 32, went into production in 1942. Parsons was on hand to watch the cruiser [...] shoot down the first enemy aircraft with a VT fuze in the Solomon Islands in January 1943.|$|E
500|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{consists of a}} cathode ray tube connected to an oscilloscope {{with a set of}} knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. The CRT projects a spot on the oscilloscope display screen, which traces a parabolic arc across the screen when a switch is activated by the player. This beam spot represents the trajectory of an artillery shell. Overlaid on the screen are transparent plastic targets representing objects such as airplanes. At the end of the spot's trajectory, the beam defocuses, resulting in the spot expanding and blurring. This represents the shell exploding as if detonated by a <b>time</b> <b>fuze.</b> The goal of the game is to have the beam defocus when it is within the bounds of a target. Prior to the beam spot beginning its arc, the player can turn the control knobs to direct the beam spot's trajectory and adjust the delay of the shell burst. The machine can be set to fire a [...] "shell" [...] either once or at a regular interval, which is adjustable by the player. This gives the player the goal of hitting one of the overlay targets with the shell burst within a time limit. The player was recommended to make the trajectory far removed from a straight line [...] "so as to require an increased amount of skill and care".|$|E
50|$|British <b>time</b> <b>fuzes,</b> {{required}} for airburst shooting, were powder burning (igniferous). However, the powder burning rate changed as air pressure reduced, making them erratic {{for the new}} vertical shooting. Modified fuzes reduced the variability but did not cure the problem. Britain lagged behind Germany in developing clockwork <b>time</b> <b>fuzes.</b> In addition, experience showed that the percussion mechanism in <b>time</b> <b>fuzes,</b> which burst the shrapnel shell on impact if the timer failed, {{had to be removed}} because AA shells could land among friendly troops and nearby civilians. Igniferous fuzes had to have a gaine in order to detonate HE shells.|$|R

50|$|Broadly, fuzes {{function}} {{on impact}} (percussion fuzes) or at a pre-determined time period after firing (<b>time</b> <b>fuzes).</b> However, by the 18th century <b>time</b> <b>fuzes</b> were aimed {{to function in}} the air and in the 1940s proximity fuzes were introduced to achieve more precisely positioned airburst. Therefore, the terms ‘percussion’ and ‘airburst’ are generally used here unless ‘time’ fuzes are being explicitly described.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the primary}} {{armament}} of the Yamato class was officially {{designated as the}} 40cm/45 caliber (15.9in) Type 94, it actually {{took the form of}} nine 46 cm/45 caliber (18.1 in) guns—the largest guns ever fitted to a warship—mounted in three 3-gun turrets, each of which weighed 2,774 metric tons. Each gun was [...] long and weighed [...] High-explosive armour-piercing shells were used which were capable of being fired [...] at a rate of 1½ to 2 per minute. The main guns were also capable of firing [...] 3 Shiki tsûjôdan ("Common Type 3") anti-aircraft shells. [...] A <b>time</b> <b>fuze</b> was used to set how far away the shells would explode (although they were commonly set to go off [...] away). Upon detonation, each of these shells would release 900 incendiary-filled tubes in a 20° cone facing towards incoming aircraft; a bursting charge was then used to explode the shell itself so that more steel splinters were created, and then the tubes would ignite. The tubes would burn for five seconds at about [...] and would start a flame that was around [...] long. Even though they comprised 40% of the total main ammunition load by 1944, 3 Shiki tsûjôdan were rarely used in combat against enemy aircraft due to the severe damage the firing of these shells inflicted on the barrels of the main guns; indeed, one of the shells may have exploded early and disabled one of Musashis guns during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. [...] The shells were intended to put up a barrage of flame that any aircraft attempting to attack would have to navigate through. However, U.S. pilots considered these shells {{to be more of a}} pyrotechnics display than a competent anti-aircraft weapon.|$|E
2500|$|The 45mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun (21-K) was a Soviet design {{adapted from the}} 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K). This was {{a copy of a}} [...] German weapon designed by Rheinmetall that was sold to the Soviets before Hitler came to power in 1933 that had been enlarged to [...] to reuse a large stock of old 47mm ammunition. It was used by the Soviet Navy to equip almost all of their ships from 1934 as its primary light {{anti-aircraft gun}} until replaced by the fully automatic 37mm 70-K gun from 1942 to 1943. It was used in World War II and during the Cold War as the Soviets exported their World War II-era ships to their friends and allies. However it was not very effective as its slow rate of fire and lack of a <b>time</b> <b>fuze</b> required a direct hit to damage targets.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{projectile}} drawing, an Auxiliary Detonating Fuze is {{screwed onto}} {{the bottom of}} the Mechanical <b>Time</b> <b>Fuze.</b> This is because the <b>time</b> <b>fuze</b> primer does not have enough explosive shock to detonate the relatively insensitive Explosive [...] "D". The Auxiliary fuze uses an intermediate explosive that is set off by the <b>time</b> <b>fuze</b> primer, and in turn, sets off the Explosive [...] "D".|$|E
50|$|<b>Time</b> <b>fuzes</b> were {{essential}} for larger calibre anti-aircraft guns, and {{it soon became}} clear that igniferous fuzes were insufficiently accurate and this drove the development of mechanical <b>time</b> <b>fuzes</b> between the world wars. During World War 2 radio proximity fuzes were introduced, initially for use against aircraft where they proved far superior to mechanical time, and at the end of 1944 for field artillery.|$|R

50|$|Early {{airburst}} fuzes used igniferous timers {{which lasted}} {{into the second}} half of the 20th century. Mechanical <b>time</b> <b>fuzes</b> appeared in the early part of the century. These required a means of powering them. The Thiel mechanism used a spring and escapement (i.e. 'clockwork'), Junghans used centrifugal force and gears, and Dixi used centrifugal force and balls. From about 1980, electronic <b>time</b> <b>fuzes</b> started replacing mechanical ones for use with cargo munitions.|$|R

5000|$|In the mid-to-late 19th century {{adjustable}} metal <b>time</b> <b>fuzes,</b> the fore-runners of today's <b>time</b> <b>fuzes,</b> containing burning gunpowder as {{the delay}} mechanism became common, {{in conjunction with}} the introduction of rifled artillery. Rifled guns introduced a tight fit between shell and barrel and hence could no longer rely on the flame from the propellant to initiate the timer. The new metal fuzes typically use the shock of firing ("setback") and/or the projectiles's rotation to [...] "arm" [...] the fuze and initiate the timer : hence introducing a safety factor previously absent.|$|R
50|$|Proximity fuzes {{have been}} of two types: photo-electric or radar. The former was not very {{successful}} and seems only to have been used with British anti-aircraft artillery 'unrotated projectiles' (rockets) in World War II. Radar proximity fuzes were a big improvement over the mechanical (<b>time)</b> <b>fuzes</b> which they replaced. Mechanical <b>time</b> <b>fuzes</b> required an accurate calculation of their running time, which was affected by non-standard conditions. With HE (requiring a burst 20 to 30 ft above the ground), if this was very slightly wrong the rounds would either hit the ground or burst too high. Accurate running time was less important with cargo munitions that burst much higher.|$|R
