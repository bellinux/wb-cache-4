At Cooper’s Lake, the course is built to mimic a real golf course. All distance is measured in feet (instead of yards), all 18 holes are dug into the ground, there are tee markers that indicate the teeing grounds, a driving range and practice green for players to warm up and a scoring tent and scoreboard beside the 18th green. Par for the course is generally 71 or 72. The tournaments are played on a rotation of courses similar to major championship golf. The goals of the tournaments are to provide a championship test for the best cross golfers and urban golfers in the world, grow the game of golf, cultivate creativity in course design and style of play, and present a safe, affordable and environmentally friendly version of golf to the golfing world.

40|$|Particle {{size was}} found to be an {{important}} factor in air bubble-induced detachment of colloidal particles from collector surfaces in a parallel plate flow chamber and generally polystyrene particles with a diameter of 806 nm detached less than particles with a diameter of 1400 nm. Particle detachment increased linearly with decreasing air bubble velocity and increasing liquid-air interfacial tension, regardless of particle diameter. The influence of air bubble velocity and liquid-air interfacial tension upon particle detachment was stronger on a hydrophilic collector surface than on a hydrophobic collector surface, whereas detachment was also less on positively-charged collector surfaces. In general, polystyrene particles with a diameter of 806 nm were less sensitive to the air bubble velocity than particles with a diameter of 1400 nm. However the larger particles were less sensitive to variations in liquid-air interfacial tension than the smaller ones. Hence, it is proposed that for larger particles, the liquid film in between the air bubble and the particle takes more time <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> <b>down</b> and form the three-phase contact, necessary to induce a detachment force.

Dual-wavelength optical interferometry was used so that unambiguous fringe order assignments could be made, enabling absolute film thicknesses to be calculated with confidence. Films were stabilized by nonionic polypropylene glycol surfactant. Halfmicrometer silica particles {{with varying degrees of}} hydrophobicity were added to the film-forming liquid to investigate their effect on film drainage rate and stability. Hydrophilic particles had little or no effect, while hydrophobic particles slowed the drainage of the film and caused a minor increase in film lifetime, from ∼ 10 to ∼ 30 s. In both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic cases the films ruptured when they reached a thickness of ∼ 2 particle diameters. Particles of intermediate hydrophobicity had the most significant effect, increasing film lifetime by an order of magnitude over that for hydrophilic particles. The intermediate particles allowed films <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> <b>down</b> to a thickness less than the particle diameter, indicating that particles bridge across the entire film.

40|$|In {{solar cell}} technology, {{the current trend}} is <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> <b>down</b> the active {{absorber}} layer. The main advantage of a thinner absorber is primarily the reduced consumption of material and energy during production. For thin film silicon (Si) technology, thinning down the absorber layer {{is of particular interest}} since both the device throughput of vacuum deposition systems and the stability of the devices are significantly enhanced. These features lead to lower cost per installed watt peak for solar cells, provided that the (stabilized) efficiency is the same as for thicker devices. However, merely thinning down inevitably leads to a reduced light absorption. Therefore, advanced light trapping schemes are crucial to increase the light path length. The use of elongated nanostructures is a promising method for advanced light trapping. The enhanced optical performance originates from orthogonalization of the light's travel path with respect to the direction of carrier collection due to the radial junction, an improved anti-reflection effect thanks to the three-dimensional geometric configuration and the multiple scattering between individual nanostructures. These advantages potentially allow for high efficiency at a significantly reduced quantity and even at a reduced material quality, of the semiconductor material. In this article, several types of elongated nanostructures with the high potential to improve the device performance are reviewed. First, we briefly introduce the conventional solar cells with emphasis on thin film technology, following the most commonly used fabrication techniques for creating nanostructures with a high aspect ratio.

These materials {{have a unique}} crystal structure with strong intra-layer bonding and weak van der Waals inter-layer bonding.

With the discovery of this method to produce stable monolayer sheets of graphene and the observation of its remarkable properties, a new research area started to develop. Besides graphene {{there is a whole}} class of two-dimensional materials with similar crystal structure. One of the most prominent are transition-metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum and tungsten selenide and sulphide. They are semiconducting materials that experience an indirect-to-direct bandgap transition when the material is thinned down to monolayer thickness. This change of the bandstructure leads to a remarkable increase in the emission efficiency of those materials in monolayer form. Strong spin-orbit coupling, inversion symmetry breaking, large exciton binding energy and large oscillator strength means that this class of materials are very promising for future room temperature opto-electronic devices. In this work monolayer sheets of transition-metal dichalcogenides, as well as vertically stacked heterostructure of two-dimensional materials, are coupled to microcavity structures in order to study lightmatter interaction of these materials. A tunable open-acces microcavity structure has been developed to have full control of the light-matter interaction.

40|$|D. C. Lau {{established}} his reputation {{both at home}} and abroad as a distinguished scholar and translator of ancient Chinese classics. Although Lau did not try to formulate a complete set of theories about translation, his renderings invariably featured particular regard for the target audience and scrupulous selection of equivalents. Lau’s English versions of Lao Tzu not only enjoyed immense popularity with the general reader, but also gained an influential position in the academic community. Unlike many previous translators who had treated Lao Tzu as a mystical text, Lau held it to be a practical philosophy whose overriding object was just to survive both physically and politically the dreadful Warring States Period. He perceived the work as a Taoist florilegium by a number of compilers instead of a logical whole ascribed to the fictitious Lao Tzu. The present study attempts to discover the relationship between Lau’s non-mystical thinking on Lao Tzu and his actual translation of it. Chapter One discusses Lau’s endeavours mainly in the introduction and the appendices to his first translation to demystify the form as well as the content of Lao Tzu, including the refutation of the evidence concerning mysticism and the presentation of proof that the book should be seen as a rather disorganized compilation addressing the problem of survival. Chapter Two compares Lau’s translation with John Wu’s and Arthur Waley’s in order to make obvious the influence of Lau’s above opinions of Lao Tzu upon his translational language. Chapter Three commences with an analysis of Lau’s intensified efforts <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> <b>down</b> the mystique surrounding Lao Tzu in his second translation. Attention then is transferred to where Lau objectively preserved the mystical quality of the original and the inner contradiction of his non-mystical view. The reasons for the coexistence of realistic and mysterious elements in Lau’s two renditions of Lao Tzu are explored with the aid of André Lefevere’s concept of rewriting. A tentative suggestion of reading Lao Tzu in a middle way between demystification and mystification is made at the end of the thesis. published_or_final_versionChineseMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} {{to examine the effects}} of body force on flow boiling critical heat flux (CHF). FC- 72 was boiled along one wall of a transparent rectangular flow channel that permitted photographic study of the vapor-liquid interface just prior to CHF. High-speed video imaging techniques were used to identify dominant CHF mechanisms corresponding to different flow orientations and liquid velocities. Six different CHF regimes were identified: Wavy Vapor Layer, Pool Boiling, Stratification, Vapor Counterflow, Vapor Stagnation, and Separated Concurrent Vapor Flow. CHF showed significant sensitivity to orientation for flow velocities below 0. 2 m/s, where extremely low CHF values where measured, especially with downward-facing heated wall and downflow orientations. High flow velocities dampened the effects of orientation considerably. The CHF data were used to assess the suitability of previous CHF models and correlations. It is shown the Interfacial Lift-off Model is very effective at predicting CHF for high velocities at all orientations. The flooding limit, on the other hand, is useful at estimating CHF at low velocities and for downflow orientations. A new method consisting of three dimensionless criteria is developed for determining the minimum flow velocity required to overcome body force effects on near-saturated flow boiling CHF. Vertical upflow boiling experiments {{were performed}} in pursuit of identifying the trigger mechanism for subcooled flow boiling CHF. While virtually all prior studies on flow boiling CHF concern the prediction or measurement of conditions that lead to CHF, this study was focused on events that take place during the CHF transient. High-speed video imaging and photomicrographic techniques were used to record the transient behavior of interfacial features from the last steady-state power level before CHF until the moment of power cut-off following CHF. The video records show the development of a wavy vapor layer which propagates along the heated wall, permitting cooling prior to CHF only in wetting fronts corresponding to the wave troughs. Image analysis software was developed to estimate void fraction from the individual video images. The void fraction records for subcooled flow boiling show the CHF transient is accompanied by gradual lift-off of wetting fronts culminating in some maximum vapor layer mean thickness, following which the vapor layer begins <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> <b>down</b> as the transition to film boiling ensues.

40|$|In {{solar cell}} technology, {{the current trend}} is <b>to</b> <b>thin</b> <b>down</b> the active {{absorber}} layer. The main advantage of a thinner absorber layer primarily is the reduced consumption of material and energy during production, but also the increased production rates and lower cost. While this is of interest to all photovoltaic technologies, for thin-film silicon technology thinning down the absorber layer is of crucial importance since both the device throughput of vacuum deposition systems and {{the stability of the}} devices need to be significantly enhanced. These features lead to lower cost per installed watt peak for solar cells, provided that the (stabilized) efficiency is the same as for thicker devices. However, merely thinning down inevitably leads to reduced light absorption. Therefore advanced light-trapping schemes are crucial to increase light absorption in the ultrathin devices. The use of nanorods/nanowires is an innovative method for advanced light trapping. The enhanced light absorption performance originates from the multiple scattering between individual nanostructures and an improved anti-reflection effect thanks to the three-dimensional geometric configuration. These advantages potentially allow for high efficiency at significantly reduced material quantity, and even at reduced material quality of the semiconductor. In this work we propose a simple, low-cost, and scalable approach for ultrathin nanostructured three-dimensional (nano- 3 D) solar cells. Self-assembled ZnO nanorods are synthesized by chemical bath deposition at 80 °C and are used as the scaffolds for the nano- 3 D cells. With an only 100 nm thick a‑Si:H light absorbing layer, an efficiency of 7. 1 % has been achieved for the nano- 3 D cells. Increasing the absorber layer thickness to 200 nm the efficiency goes up to 8. 4 %, significantly higher than that of 6. 4 % for the flat counterparts. The light-trapping mechanisms in the nano- 3 D cells are systematically investigated by both experiments and three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations (FDTD). The nanorod cells show a substantially enhanced optical performance with respect to conventional thin film solar cells with flat or textured structures. Corrugation {{at the top of the}} nanorod-based devices leads to an enhanced response in the blue part of the spectrum and light trapping is observed in the red part. The nano- 3 D cells have very little total reflection. Although parasitic absorption is enhanced in the nanostructured Ag layer at the back, the nano- 3 D concept provides net gain over cell concepts that utilize conventional light-scattering textured interfaces. Our simulations provide approaches to reduce absorption in the Ag while maintaining the nano- 3 D concept, thus further enhancing the utilization of incident light. The inexpensive design proposed in this work opens up a new platform for novel efficient cell design that can be made at low cost.

60|$|One {{example of}} the ease of making good, but not {{permanent}} impressions, is found, and should be tried, by pressing the bulb of a finger against well-polished glass, or against the highly-polished blade of a razor. The finger must be very slightly oiled, as by passing it through the hair; if it be moist, dry it with a handkerchief before the oiling. Then press the bulb of the finger on the glass or razor, {{as the case may}} be, and a beautiful impression will be left. The hardness of the glass or steel prevents its surface from rising into the furrows under the pressure of the ridges, while the layer of oil which covers the bottom of the furrows is too <b>thin</b> <b>to</b> reach <b>down</b> to the glass or steel; consequently the ridges alone are printed. There is no capillary or other action to spread the oil, so the impression remains distinct. A merely moist and not oily finger leaves a similar mark, but it soon evaporates.|$|R
