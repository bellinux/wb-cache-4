25|$|In February 2010, TNA {{restarted}} {{their working}} relationship with AAA and in early May 2011, Jarrett made his return to AAA television, announcing his and TNA's alignment with Dorian Roldán and his heel stable La Sociedad and their participation in Triplemanía XIX. Konnan, the co-leader of La Sociedad and former TNA worker, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán {{had made a mistake}} by inviting him to the promotion. Jarrett and Abyss arrived to AAA on May 18 for a confrontation with Konnan and La Sociedad. In the end, Jarrett and Konnan revealed that they were in fact on the same page with each other and turned on AAA Mega Champion El Zorro with Konnan announcing that Jarrett would be challenging for his <b>title</b> at Triplemanía <b>XIX.</b> On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Jarrett defeated El Zorro to become the new AAA Mega Champion. On July 31 at Verano de Escándalo, Jarrett successfully defended the title in a three-way elimination match against Dr. Wagner, Jr. and L.A. Park, when someone wearing El Zorro's old mask interfered and hit Park with a guitar. This person was later revealed as La Sociedad member Chessman, whom Konnan had sent to interfere in the match in order to have Park go after El Zorro instead of continuing to chase his stablemate's title. The storyline continued on October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, where both Jarrett and Park took part in the Copa Antonio Peña gauntlet match. After working together for the entire match, Park eventually turned on Jarrett and eliminated him. After a distraction from the Jarretts, Park was attacked by another masked El Zorro, costing him the match.|$|R

50|$|The 2014 St Helens R.F.C. {{season is}} the clubs 140th in their history; their 119th in rugby league. The Saints {{will be looking}} to end a 6-year {{silverware}} drought this season by competing for the Super League <b>XIX</b> <b>title</b> {{as well as the}} 113th edition of the Challenge Cup. This season marks Australian Nathan Brown's second season as head coach of the club, continuing from his first season in 2013 which ended in a 5th-place finish and an early playoff exit courtesy of an 11-10 defeat at Leeds Rhinos. They began their season by taking on last seasons runner-up Warrington Wolves at the Halliwell Jones Stadium, which ended in an 8-38 win for Saints. This win sent Saints on a win streak that lasted for eight Super League games before being defeated on 18 April 2014 by arch-rivals Wigan Warriors at Langtree Park in the annual Good Friday derby match. Easter was a period to forget for the Saints as they were beaten by Widnes Vikings for their second league defeat in a row, following the Good Friday defeat to bitter rivals Wigan, and then by Leeds Rhinos in Round 5 of the Challenge Cup meaning the Saints will miss out on the trophy for a sixth year. The Saints bounced back however on 1 May with a 48-18 win over the London Broncos. Saints suffered another Magic Weekend to the Warrington Wolves on 18 May with the game ending 41-24 to the Wolves. Results picked up after the Magic Weekend with two straight wins at home against Huddersfield & Salford however the Saints then traveled to Perpignan where they suffered a humiliating 42-0 loss to the Catalans Dragons. Once again, the Saints bounced back with an impressive win over Castleford Tigers at Langtree Park and with another outstanding performance in a pulsating game at the DW Stadium against arch-rivals Wigan Warriors that ended 12-16 in favour of the Saints; the win avenging the Good Friday defeat at Langtree Park. Following this win, Saints suffered a shock 40-10 defeat to Hull Kingston Rovers but bounced back with three straight wins before losing to Hull KR's cross-town rivals, Hull F.C., 19-12. However, a 40-16 win over Wakefield Trinity Wildcats & an extremely tight 12-13 win over Leeds Rhinos at Headingly put the Saints in a position where a win against Warrington on 4 September would hand them their first League Leaders Shield since the 2008 season; with Castleford Tigers being the only other team in contention for the top spot. Despite losing their last two games of the regular season, Saints acquired the league leaders shield following Castleford's failure to beat Catalans Dragons in their last game of the season; meaning that the Saints took their first piece of silverware since 2008. The unlikely success of the 2014 season culminated in a 14-6 win over arch-rivals Wigan Warriors in the 2014 Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford making Saints the Super League champions {{for the first time since}} 2006 in an extremely lively, well-fought contest that saw Wigan player Ben Flower sent off for a sucker punch on a defenceless Lance Hohaia in the 2nd minute of the game.|$|R
50|$|At Triplemania XVII, El Zorro {{turned on}} the Legion during the main event of the show. El Zorro came out wearing his old mask, handed Joaquin Roldan his kendo stick to help him keep Konnan from interfering in the main event. Keeping Konnan from interfering helped Roldan's Team AAA to win the match and take control of AAA away from the Legion. In October El Zorro once again turned rudo and re-joined La Legion Extranjera. In the summer of 2010 La Legión Extranjera merged with Los Perros del Mal, La Milicia and Los Maniacos to form La Sociedad. Afterwards, El Zorro, teaming with his Legión stablemate Hernandez, began feuding with La Hermandad 187 (Nicho el Millonario and Joe Lider). On September 14 El Zorro and Hernandez {{defeated}} La Hermandad 187 via disqualification and afterwards beat them down, injuring Nicho and ruining his and Lider's upcoming rematch for the AAA World Tag Team Championship. The feud {{came to an end}} on October 30, 2010, when El Zorro defeated Nicho in a Lucha de Apuesta weapons match to take his hair. After spending years working as a midcard talent, El Zorro was placed in a main event storyline in November 2010, when he teamed up with technico and AAA Mega Champion Dr. Wagner, Jr. in the 2010 Lucha Libre Premier parejas increibles tournament. After reaching the semifinals of the tournament, El Zorro turned on Wagner, Jr. and challenged him to a match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Guerra de Titanes. On November 28 El Zorro, Dr. Wagner, Jr., El Mesías and Electroshock faced each other in the Lucha Libre Premier semifinal four-way match. After eliminating Electroshock and Wagner, Jr., El Zorro and El Mesías faced each other in the final match, with El Mesías coming out victorious. In {{the days leading up to}} Guerra de Titanes, El Zorro made another prophecy, saying that he was going to leave the event with the AAA Mega Championship. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes El Zorro defeated Dr. Wagner, Jr. with help from his La Sociedad stable mates to win the AAA Mega Championship for the first time. In January 2011, Martínez confirmed that he had signed a two-year non-exclusive contract with American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), with whom AAA had a working relationship with, and was just waiting for a start date with the promotion. He, however, never made his debut for TNA. El Zorro made his first title defense on March 18, 2011, at Rey de Reyes, defeating Los Bizarros member Charly Manson, who had recently been tormenting him by hinting at a return of the iron mask. Meanwhile, El Zorro's La Sociedad stablemate L.A. Park had earned himself a shot at the AAA Mega Championship, but Konnan, wanting to avoid dissension within his group, denied him his shot and instead named Manson the number one contender at Rey de Reyes. Following the event, El Zorro, having caught wind of Park's intention of going for his title, seemingly started interfering in Park's matches under his old mask, costing him back-to-back multi-man tag team matches at the April 27 and 30 TV tapings. On May 18, the rest of La Sociedad turned on El Zorro, after which Konnan announced that his new business partner, TNA founder Jeff Jarrett, would be challenging for his <b>title</b> at Triplemanía <b>XIX.</b> It was later revealed that the man who had attacked Park under El Zorro's mask was actually Charly Manson, who had been sent by Cibernético to cause dissension within the ranks of La Sociedad.|$|R

Fluid milk processors through a commodity checkoff program develop and finance generic advertising programs designed to maintain and expand markets and uses for fluid milk products produced in the United States. The mandatory national fluid milk program is financed by a 20¢ per hundredweight assessment on all fluid milk processed and marketed commercially in consumer-type packages (except by small processors). Fluid Milk Board annual revenue is approximately $110 million.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{held that}} states {{participating}} in the Medicaid program were not obligated to fund medically necessary abortions under <b>Title</b> <b>XIX.</b> The Court found that a woman's freedom of choice did not carry with it [...] "a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of {{the full range of}} protected choices." [...] The Court ruled that because the Equal Protection Clause was not a source of substantive rights and because poverty did not qualify as a [...] "suspect classification," [...] the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Fifth Amendment. Finally, the Court held that the coincidence of the funding restrictions of the statute with tenets of the Roman Catholic Church did not constitute an establishment of religion.|$|E
50|$|The {{costs of}} {{treating}} the uninsured must often be absorbed by providers as charity care, {{passed on to}} the insured via cost shifting and higher health insurance premiums, or paid by taxpayers through higher taxes. However, hospitals and other providers are reimbursed for the cost of providing uncompensated care via a federal matching fund program. Each state enacts legislation governing the reimbursement of funds to providers. In Missouri, for example, providers assessments totaling $800 million are matched - $2 for each assessed $1 - to create a pool of approximately $2 billion. By federal law these funds are transferred to the Missouri Hospital Association for disbursement to hospitals for the costs incurred providing uncompenstated care including Disproportionate Share Payments (to hospitals with high quantities of uninsured patients), Medicaid shortfalls, Medicaid managed care payments to insurance companies and other costs incurred by hospitals. In New Hampshire, by statute, reimbursable uncompensated care costs shall include: charity care costs, any portion of Medicaid patient care costs that are unreimbursed by Medicaid payments, and any portion of bad debt costs that the commissioner determines would meet the criteria under 42 U.S.C. section 1396r-4(g) governing hospital-specific limits on disproportionate share hospital payments under <b>Title</b> <b>XIX</b> of the Social Security Act.|$|E
5000|$|Economic {{incentives}} and career reasons also motivate women to choose sterilization. With regard {{to women who}} are voluntarily childless, studies show that there are higher [...] "opportunity costs" [...] for women of higher socioeconomic status because {{women are more likely}} than men to forfeit labor force participation once they have children. Some women stated the lack of financial resources as a reason why they remained childfree. Combined with the costliness of raising children, having children was viewed as a negative impact on financial resources. Thus, childlessness is generally correlated with working full-time. [...] "Many women expressed the view that women ultimately have to make a choice between motherhood and career." [...] In contrast, childlessness was also found among adults who were not overly committed to careers. In these finding, the importance of leisure time and the potential to retire early was emphasized over career ambitions.Sterilization is also an option for low-income families. Public funding for contraceptive services come from a variety of federal and state sources in the United States. Until the mid-1990s, [...] "federal funds for contraceptive services were provided under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, <b>Title</b> <b>XIX</b> of the Social Security (Medicaid), and two block-grant programs, Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Social Services." [...] The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families was another federal block granted created in 1996 and is the main federal source of financial [...] "welfare" [...] aid. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services administers Title X, which is the sole federal program dedicated to family planning. Under Title X, public and nonprofit private agencies receive grants to operate clinics that provide care largely to the uninsured and the underinsured. Unlike Title X, Medicaid is an entitlement program that is jointly funded by federal and state governments to [...] "provide medical care to various low-income populations." [...] Medicaid provided the majority of publicly funded sterilizations. In 1979, regulations were implemented on sterilizations funded by the Department of Health and Human Services. The regulations included [...] "a complex procedure to ensure women's informed consent, a 30-day waiting period between consent and the procedure, and a prohibition on sterilization of anyone younger than 21 or who is mentally incompetent." ...|$|E
