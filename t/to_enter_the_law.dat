25|$|Changes in {{immigration}} {{laws in the}} United States in the 1920s greatly restricted the number of immigrants allowed <b>to</b> <b>enter.</b> <b>The</b> <b>law</b> limited the number of immigrants to about 160,000 per year in 1924. This led to a major reduction in the immigrant trade for the shipping lines, forcing them to cater to the tourist trade to survive. At the turn of 1927–28, Olympic was converted to carry tourist third cabin passengers as well as first, second and third class. Tourist third cabin {{was an attempt to}} attract travellers who desired comfort without the accompanying high ticket price. New public rooms were constructed for this class, although tourist third cabin and second class would merge to become 'tourist' by late 1931.|$|E
25|$|The young Clarence {{attended}} Allegheny College and the University of Michigan Law School, {{but did not}} {{graduate from}} either institution.

25|$|Porter {{began his}} {{military}} career in 1809 {{as an office}} clerk {{at the request of}} his father, who served as the Surveyor General of Pennsylvania at the time. His time spent as an office clerk proved to be beneficial in allowing him to acquire the knowledge that would lead him <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> office of John Passmore, Esquire. Porter was settled in Philadelphia in 1813 when rumors spread across the city that the British were coming during the War of 1812. Porter took matters into his own hands and organized militia units along the Delaware River. Although the British never arrived, the people of Philadelphia applauded his efforts. His military service ceased upon his arrival in Easton, Pennsylvania in 1818, but resumed in 1843 when President John Tyler appointed him Secretary of War. President Tyler named Porter his secretary ad interim, hoping that after time, the Senate would approve Porter's nomination. However, Porter served in the Cabinet only eleven months because the Senate did not confirm his nomination. This arose due to President Tyler's troubled relationship with the Senate in previous years. President Tyler had offended the Whigs with his independent nomination and upon hearing of the Senate's action, Porter immediately resigned his commission and returned to Easton.|$|E

The Law Society is authorized by act of law, by the law chancellor {{and a few other}} high-ranking judges to regulate the education and admission of barristers.

5000|$|As a {{professional}} doctorate, the Juris Doctor {{is the degree}} that prepares the recipient <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> profession (as do the M.D. or D.O. in the medical profession and the D.D.S in the dental profession). While the J.D. is the sole degree necessary to become {{a professor of law}} or to obtain a license to practice law, it (like the M.D. or D.D.S.) is not a [...] "research degree". Research degrees in the study of law include the Master of Laws (LL.M.), which ordinarily requires the J.D. as a prerequisite, and the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D./J.S.D.), which ordinarily requires the LL.M. as a prerequisite. [...] However, the American Bar Association has issued a Council Statement, advising law schools that the J.D. should be considered equivalent to the Ph.D. for educational employment purposes. Accordingly, while most law professors are required to conduct original writing and research in order to be awarded tenure, the majority have a J.D. as their highest degree. Research in 2015 showed an increasing trend toward hiring professors with both J.D. and Ph.D. degrees, particularly at more highly ranked schools. Some international commentators have called the Council Statement [...] "self-seeking and egocentric", pointing out that it illogically compares the J.D. only to the taught component of the US Ph.D., ignoring the research and dissertation components.|$|E
