40|$|Recent {{technological}} advances {{have increased the}} size and number of <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>networks</b> as well as broadened their scope and complexity. This added size and complexity has magn$ed the need for communications network management. One approach to communications network management is to provide centralized control which is integrated into the Systems Network Architecture user network. This approach is described in this paper by focusing on two program products that provide centralized operator control and problem determination capabilities for a network. An integrated approach to centralized communications network management by R. A. Weingarten In the 1960 s, teleprocessing was in its initial stages.

In addition to its typical use as a test tool exchanging message traffic with a system under test, TPNS has been deployed: ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{approximate}} iterative {{technique for}} the analysis of complex queuing networks with general service times is presented. The technique is based on an application of Nortonâ€™s theorem from electrical circuit theory to queuing networks which obey local balance. The technique determines approximations of the queue length and waiting time distributions for each queue in the network. Comparison of results obtained by the approximate method with simulated and exact results shows that the approximate method has reasonable accuracy. introduction Queuing network models are being widely used in the analysis of computer systems and <b>teleprocessing</b> <b>networks</b> [1, 21. Some efficient computational techniques for analyzing complex networks, limited to problems which satisfy local balance, have been described [3]. Efficient methods {{for the analysis}} of specijic networks which do not satisfy local balance exist [4]. Approximating a general network by one which satisfies local balance results, usually, in unacceptable error for compute...|$|R
