Quality of life {{has been the subject of}} numerous studies in the Health area, especially aimed at people with chronic diseases, such as TMD. Objective: To evaluate effects of a physical <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> on the quality of life of patients with temporomandibular disorder. Methods: Blinded, prospective, clinical trial, with 60 patients of both genders, aged between 18 and 70 years with TMD diagnosis attended in the clinic of Ribeirão Preto School of Dentistry. The patients were divided into two groups, with one group, in addition to dental treatment, receiving a physical <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> and the other group dental treatment only, for 5 weeks. The measurement of quality of life was obtained through the generic SF- 36 questionnaire, at the beginning and end of the proposed protocol. Results: The patients to whom the physical <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> was applied associated with dental care presented increased scores in all the domains of the questionnaire. In the group that received only dental treatment, improvements were only found in the domain related to pain. Conclusion: The application of a physical <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> was able to improve the quality of life of patients with temporomandibular disorder...|$|E

Hall 2, 4 Objectives. In {{addition to its}} vasoactive effects, angiotensin II has proinflammatory properties. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the production of angiotensin II and could therefore act as anti-inflammatory agents. Here we investigated {{the capacity of the}} ACE inhibitor quinapril to modulate inflammatory arthritis. Methods. We studied the effect of quinapril on disease activity in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Mice received oral quinapril (10 mg/kg/day) at the time of arthritis induction (prophylaxis protocol) or at the onset of mild arthritis (<b>therapy</b> <b>protocol).</b> Concentrations of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subtypes specific for bovine Type II collagen and TNF-a were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Results. Quinapril significantly diminished the activity of CIA when given as prophylaxis or therapy (prophylaxis protocol, P< 0. 001; <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> P 0. 002). Antigen-specific IgG 2 a antibodies were reduced by 52 % (P 0. 02) in the quinapril prophylaxis protocol.

40|$|We report {{here that}} a cancer gene <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> using a {{combination}} of IL- 12, pro-IL- 18, and IL- 1 β converting enzyme (ICE) cDNA expression vectors simultaneously delivered via gene gun can significantly augment antitumor effects, evidently by generating increased levels of bioactive IL- 18 and consequently IFN-γ. First, we compared the levels of IFN-γ secreted by mouse splenocytes stimulated with tumor cells transfected with various test genes, including IL- 12 alone; pro-IL- 18 alone; pro-IL- 18 and ICE; IL- 12 and pro-IL- 18; and IL- 12, pro-IL- 18, and ICE. Among these treatments, the combination of IL- 12, pro-IL- 18, and ICE cDNA resulted in the highest level of IFN-γ production from splenocytes in vitro, and similar results were obtained when these same treatments were delivered to the skin of a mouse by gene gun and IFN-γ levels were measured at the skin transfection site in vivo. Furthermore, the triple gene combinatorial gene <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> was the most effective among all tested groups at suppressing the growth of TS/A (murine mammary adenocarcinoma) tumors previously implanted intradermally at the skin site receiving DNA transfer by gene gun on days 6, 8, 10, and 12 after tumor implantation. Fifty percent of mice treated with the combined three-gene protocol underwent complete tumor regression. In vivo depletion experiments showed that this antitumor effect was CD 8 + T cell-mediated and partially IFN-γ-dependent. These results suggest that a combinatorial gene <b>therapy</b> <b>protocol</b> using a mixture of IL- 12, pro-IL- 18, and ICE cDNAs can confer potent antitumor activities against established TS/A tumors via cytotoxic CD 8 + T cells and IFN-γ-dependent pathways...|$|E
