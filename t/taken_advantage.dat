5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of until very late in a patient's illness. The {{reasons for this}} have {{as much to do}} with financial considerations as with the psycho-social difficulty in choosing hospice. A 2009 study found that with proper case management hospice access could be liberalized without additional costs to insurers.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Illinois, Polish-born {{research}} engineer Joseph Tykociński-Tykociner {{was working}} independently {{on a similar}} process. On June 9, 1922, he gave the first reported U.S. demonstration of a sound-on-film motion picture {{to members of the}} American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

Vehicles such as the Triumph Spitfire based largely on Triumph Herald parts, was produced, by Triumph, to <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> of the early 1960's desire for small sports cars. The Ducati 350XL was produced by Ducati to quickly <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> of a tax break. The Moto Guzzi 1000S is another example.|$|R

The expedition was successful, and Khuttal returned to Arab rule. A short while later, in February 738, Asad died at Balkh after a brief illness. Ja'far ibn Hanzala al-Bahrani succeeded him temporarily until, in July, Nasr ibn Sayyar was named to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E

5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers have <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of these rules and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, {{with the approval of}} the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{does not}} say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one recent history asserts that Beornwulf was almost {{certainly}} the one who attacked. According to this view, Beornwulf may have <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia {{in the summer of}} 825. Beornwulf's motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} control measures for invasive Caprellamutica populations as of 2012. It {{has been suggested}} that the seasonal population fluctuations may be <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of. Eradication efforts done during the winter months when C.mutica populations are dormant and at their lowest numbers, are potentially more effective in preventing their recovery during the summer months. Because of the great difficulty in detecting and removing them, however, control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than the eradication of established C. mutica.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} method for volume {{rendering}} of regular grids which <b>takes</b> <b>advantage</b> of 3 D texture mapping hardware currently available on graphics workstations. Our method produces accurate shading for arbitrary and dynamically changing directional lights, viewing parameters, and transfer functions. This is achieved by hardware interpolating the data values and gradients before software classi cation and shading. The method works equally well for parallel and perspective projections. We present two approaches for our method: one which <b>takes</b> <b>advantage</b> of software ray casting optimizations and another which <b>takes</b> <b>advantage</b> of hardware blending acceleration...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} special worship events {{have been held}} since the renovation. They have <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of the cover, {{temperature}} control, and enhanced security. However, {{in addition to the}} more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|After Boisselier {{announced}} that {{no evidence of}} the cloning would be provided, journalists became very skeptical of her story. While discussing Boisselier's management of Clonaid, Palmer notes {{that it is impossible}} to know why she stated that a clone was produced but then refused to provide evidence. She argues that her refusal to provide evidence may have been because she organized a hoax, did not wish to publicize the birth of an unhealthy child, or was <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of by a scientist she had hired. American science journalist Steven S. Hall criticized the media for their coverage of Clonaid, believe that they were inarticulately represented as a credible group. He speculates that the coverage of Boisselier and other cloning adherents galvanized sentiment against cloning, leading to its banning in the U.S.|$|E

The first removed legal loopholes that permitted terrorists to live and raise money in Germany. The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence and law enforcement. Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E
5|$|General Eusebio Canales (alias Chamarrita or Prince of Arms) {{is forced}} into exile after {{being accused of}} the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente.

The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being <b>taken</b> <b>advantage</b> of by a doctor who visited their ailing mother.
