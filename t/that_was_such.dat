25|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of the}} twentieth century there was some talk of {{creating}} a National Battlefield Park in Nashville. This movement failed, due to lack of support from Nashville's civic leaders, who as Southerners were not particularly interested in commemorating a battle <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a profound Confederate defeat. As a result, much like Atlanta, most of the Nashville battlefield has been lost to development. However, the battle is memorialized and small parts of it have been preserved.|$|E
500|$|Bowie {{found himself}} under great stress during the tour, {{and after the}} tour ended in New Zealand, he {{reportedly}} had the Spider set burned, saying [...] "It was so great ... We just put the thing in a field and set light to it. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a relief!" [...] This was, however, partially refuted in 2016 by road manager Peter Grumley, {{who claimed to have}} purchased and stored {{at least one of the}} sets in his West Auckland warehouse.|$|E
500|$|Just {{consider}} {{the course of}} events if their action were to proceed to trial ... If the six men failed it would mean that much time and money and worry would have been expended by many people to no good purpose. If they won, it would mean that the police were guilty of perjury; that they were guilty of violence and threats; that the confessions were involuntary and improperly admitted in evidence; and that the convictions were erroneous. ... <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an appalling vista that every sensible person would say, [...] "It cannot be right that these actions should go any further." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{decided to}} have the film open with the statement [...] "Hell is a teenage girl" [...] to reflect the [...] "horrors" [...] of puberty and that [...] "the hellish emotions felt during high school often reappear as teenage girls mature into young women". Cody stated: There's the scene where Jennifer's sitting alone smearing makeup on her face. I always thought <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a sad image. She's so vulnerable. I don't know any woman who hasn't had a moment {{sitting in front of}} the mirror and thinking, 'Help me, I want to be somebody else.' What makes it extra affecting is that [...] is stunning.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, {{other aspects of}} his personality have been explored. In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", when the football team is forced {{to spend a week}} working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the [...] "softer side" [...] of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club. After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that makes it sound like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do. Adler said, [...] "I feel like that it did make him happy and, obviously, he has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance or learn a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an obstacle to overcome." [...] In [...] "Furt" [...] and [...] "Born This Way", it is revealed that he had been kind, a cub scout, and an [...] "A" [...] student. However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter. Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in [...] "Born This Way" [...] is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in [...] "Prom Queen", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next class period.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{needs to}} {{know there is a}} degree of dissatisfaction among the public. I think people want to see that EastEnders is {{populated}} by many different ethnic groups. Black people in real life run businesses, fall in and out of love, have fascinating and exciting lives. So why can't we in EastEnders. We are not all losers or nobodies so why can't the BBC show that?...I really felt so ineffectual as a character because I had nothing to get my teeth into - there were no great dramatic scenes or relationships. My character was never given anything meaningful to say and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a wasted opportunity.

Thus, therefore, when I {{had heard}} and {{considered}} what they said, I left them, and went about my employment again, but their talk and discourse went with me; also my heart would tarry with them, for I was greatly affected with their words, both because by them I {{was convinced that}} I wanted the true tokens of a truly godly man, and also because by them I was convinced of the happy and blessed condition of him <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a one.|$|E
60|$|Of course {{very much}} was {{said about the}} time when Toby was an unwilling member of the circus, and Mrs. Treat and Ben told of the boy's {{experiences}} {{in a way that}} brought many a blush to his cheeks. Mr. Treat was too busy with Aunt Olive's lamb, as he affectionately spoke of it, {{to be able to say}} anything; he was wonderfully fortunate in not choking himself but once, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a trifling matter that it was all over in a moment.|$|E

60|$|After a {{few years}} he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, {{as well as the}} little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter.

60|$|For {{a second}} or two Peter was quite {{undecided}} what to do. He couldn't warn Chewink without making his own presence known to Reddy Fox. Of course he could sit perfectly still and let Chewink be caught, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a dreadful thought that Peter didn't consider it for more than {{a second or}} two. He suddenly thumped the ground with his feet. It was his danger signal which all his friends know. Then he turned and scampered lipperty-lipperty-lip to a thick bramble-tangle not far behind him.|$|E
60|$|Gradually {{the events}} of the {{preceding}} night crept with silent blood-stained feet into his brain, and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair, came back to him, and he grew cold with passion. The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible <b>that</b> <b>was!</b> <b>Such</b> hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.|$|E

60|$|As for the servants, in solemn {{conclave}} in the hall, {{they had}} unanimously but one theory {{to account for}} all the facts: some poacher or other, for choice Joe Harley, had come across the vicar in the copse, with gun and traps in hand. The wretch had seen he was discovered, had felled the poor old vicar by a blow {{in the face with}} the butt-end of his rifle, and after he fell, fainting, had stabbed him for greater security in the back. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an obvious solution of the difficulty, that nobody in the servants' hall had a moment's hesitation in accepting it.|$|E
