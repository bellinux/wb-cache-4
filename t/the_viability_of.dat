On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe were submitted by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E

The company also considered investing in an English soccer club, and in May 2012, after the Leeds United Supporters Trust put out {{a request for a}} takeover from majority shareholder Ken Bates, it was reported that MLSE were in talks to buy the Football League Championship team. However, the company later denied that it planned to purchase the club. In 2015 reports emerged that MLSE was investigating taking over the bankrupt Parma F.C. of Italy's Serie A.|$|E
5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E

A preliminary survey was conducted by India in May 2006 and the survey team from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006. In October 2008 the project was shelved, and the Bhutanese government decided that the airport at Gelephu {{would be used for}} domestic flights only.|$|E

In early October, several test trains proved <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> the planned sub-3-hour schedules.

As a result, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Ranger Companies were ordered to form. Altogether, another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and six of them would see combat in Korea.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} reason for BCal's interest in Concorde was that the British Government's 1976 aviation policy review had opened the possibility of BA setting up supersonic services in competition with BCal's established sphere of influence. To counteract this potential threat, BCal considered their own independent Concorde plans, {{as well as a}} partnership with BA. BCal were considered most likely to have set up a Concorde service on the Gatwick–Lagos route, a major source of revenue and profits within BCal's scheduled route network; BCal's Concorde task force did assess <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> a daily supersonic service complementing the existing subsonic widebody service on this route.|$|E

5|$|Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is {{considered}} an important game {{in the history of}} first-person shooters for demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to a more realistic style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode.

A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.|$|E

The Hitmen lost CAD$250,000 in their first season and saw their season ticket base halved to 700 for the 1996–97 season.

5|$|The Japanese {{video game}} {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix (formally two companies called Square and Enix prior to 2003) has been translating its games for North America {{since the late}} 1980s, and the PAL region and Asia since the late 1990s. It has not always released all of its games in all major regions, and continues to selectively release games even today depending on multiple factors such as <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> platforms or {{the condition of the}} game itself. The process of localization has changed during that time from having a one-person team with a short time and tight memory capacities to having a team of translators preparing simultaneous launches in multiple languages.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> the Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E
