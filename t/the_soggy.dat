25|$|The Bangladeshi wickets {{receive a}} lot of rain fall in little time which {{reflects}} <b>the</b> <b>soggy</b> nature. The conditions vary from grounds like Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium and Chittagong Divisional Stadium. The basic idea of producing wickets in Bangladesh is to avoid using grassroots when they are building up the layers of soil. The roots hold the water and retain moisture for an extended period. It helps bind the wicket better, making it a harder surface eventually. It also slows the process of wearing down.|$|E
25|$|Everett convinces Pete, Delmar and Tommy to {{help him}} win his wife back. They sneak into a Stokes {{campaign}} gala dinner she is attending, disguised as musicians. The group begins a performance of their radio hit. The crowd recognizes the song and goes wild. Homer recognizes them as the group who humiliated his mob. When he demands the group be arrested and reveals his white supremacist views, the crowd runs him {{out of town on}} a rail. Pappy O'Daniel, the incumbent candidate, seizes the opportunity, endorses <b>the</b> <b>Soggy</b> Bottom Boys and grants them full pardons. Penny agrees to marry Everett with the condition that he find her original ring.|$|E

25|$|Knowing that Murfreesboro and the {{surrounding}} area were staunchly pro-Southern in sentiment, Bragg felt compelled to make a stand on relatively flat ground north of the city, even though several more-defensible areas lay further to the north and south. The Federal Army of the Cumberland, now under the command of Major General William S. Rosecrans, closed with Bragg in late December 1862, arriving at Murfreesboro on December 29 and moving into position the following day. Following a musical contest between Southern and Federal bands during the evening hours on the 30th, both armies prepared to attack each other at dawn on the 31st. Incredibly, Bragg and Rosecrans had each made plans to assault each other's right flank, at almost the same moment. Hardee's corpsmore than 10,000 troops in all would attack at dawn in a massive wave, hoping to catch their enemy off guard and preoccupied with eating breakfast and other morning activities, just as they had done at Shiloh where they had achieved complete surprise. A ration of whiskey was issued to the troops at 8:00pm; soon afterwards they bedded down for the night, sleeping on cornstalks {{in an effort to keep}} off <b>the</b> <b>soggy</b> ground.|$|E
25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of June 29, 1659, Vyhovsky {{at the head of a}} small {{detachment}} attacked Prince Pozharsky's army. After a little skirmish, he started to retreat, feigning a disorganized flight in the direction of his main forces. The unsuspecting Pozharsky ordered his army to pursue the enemy. Once the enemy's army entered Sosnivka, the Cossacks fired three cannon shots to give the signal to the Tatars and counterattacked with all the forces stationed at Sosnivka. Having discovered the trap, Prince Semen Pozharsky ordered retreat; but his heavy cavalry got bogged down in <b>the</b> <b>soggy</b> ground created from the flooding the night before. At this moment the Tatars also advanced from the eastern flank, and the outright slaughter ensued. Almost all troops perished, with few of them captured alive. Among the captured were Prince Semen Romanovich Pozharsky himself, Prince Semen Petrovich Lvov, both Princes Buturlins, Prince Lyapunov, Prince Skuratov, Prince Kurakin and others. A relative of the Great Liberator of Moscow from the Poles, Dmitry Pozharsky, Prince Semen Romanovich Pozharsky was brought before the Khan of Crimea Mehmed IV Giray. Being forced to carry out acts of submissiveness Pozharsky insulted the Khan and spat in his face. For that he was promptly beheaded by the Tatars, and his severed head was dispatched with one of the captives to Prince Trubetskoy's camp.|$|E
500|$|Holt {{returned}} to Stockton and applied his skills and his company's expertise in metallurgy, design, and testing {{to develop a}} workable track-laying system. He replaced the wheels on a [...] Holt steamer, No. 77, {{with a set of}} wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing <b>the</b> <b>soggy</b> delta land of Roberts Island. Company photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a caterpillar, and Holt seized on the metaphor. [...] "Caterpillar it is. That's the name for it!" [...] Others reported that Holt got the name from British troops who witnessed a working prototype of Hornsby's track-type vehicle in July 1907. Continuous tracks allowed practical cultivation of the rich farmland on an industrial scale. The invention also allowed planters to reclaim thousands of acres of delta land previously unusable for farming.|$|E

500|$|Miller {{caused a}} {{stoppage}} {{after his first}} ball in order to sprinkle sawdust on the crease. With the second ball, he bowled Dewes—who was playing across the line—middle stump for one with an inswinger to leave England at 2/1. However, despite the early wicket, the bowlers appeared to lack confidence in their run-up on <b>the</b> <b>soggy</b> ground. Bradman made an early bowling change and brought Johnston into the attack to replace Miller after the latter had bowled three overs for the concession of two runs. At this time, Bradman adopted relatively defensive field settings despite the early breakthrough. Bill Edrich joined Hutton and they played cautiously until the former attempted to hook a short ball from Johnston. He failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around [...] Lindsay Hassett took the catch just behind square leg, diving sideways and getting two hands to the ball. This left England at 10/2 as Denis Compton came to the crease. Lindwall bounced Compton, drawing an edge that flew towards the slips cordon. However, the ball continued to rise and cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton for a run, but his surprised partner was watching the ball narrowly evade the slips catchers and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who stopped the ball and waited for Compton to regain his bat and his composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to run him out. However, this sporting gesture did not cost Australia many runs because when Compton was on three, Lindwall bowled another bouncer. Compton went for a hook shot and Arthur Morris ran from his position at short square leg to take a difficult catch. Bradman later said he had remembered how Compton had been out in exactly the same position in the corresponding match at the same ground during the 1938 series. Fingleton described Morris's effort as [...] "one of the catches of the season". England were 17/3, and Crapp came in to join Hutton. At this point, Bradman began to put in place more attacking field settings. Johnston then hit Hutton on the fingers with a ball that rose sharply after pitching. Bradman took Lindwall off after 50 minutes and replaced him with Miller, who then removed Crapp, caught behind from an outside edge for a 23-ball duck, leaving England at 23/4. When play was adjourned for lunch with England on 29/4, Hutton was 17 while Yardley was on four. According to Fingleton, Hutton [...] "had never been in the slightest difficulty". He had played cautiously but did not seem hurried by the bowling. Miller had taken 2/3 from six overs.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1839, Smith rejoined his {{followers}} who, having fled east from Missouri, had spread {{out along the}} banks of the Mississippi, near Quincy, Illinois. There, for both humanitarian and political reasons, the refugees had been welcomed.

[...] He renamed the area [...] "Nauvoo", which he said meant [...] "beautiful" [...] in Hebrew. <b>The</b> <b>soggy</b> low land and river eddies were exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and the Saints suffered plagues of malaria in the summers of 1839, 1840, and 1841.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Soggy</b> Bottom Boys, {{the musical}} group {{that the main}} {{characters}} form, serve as accompaniment for the film. The name is an homage to the Foggy Mountain Boys, a bluegrass band led by Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs. In the film, the songs credited to the band are lip-synched by the actors, except that Tim Blake Nelson does sing his own vocals on [...] "In the Jailhouse Now." [...] The actual musicians are Dan Tyminski (guitar and lead vocals), Harley Allen, and Pat Enright. The band's hit single is Dick Burnett's [...] "Man of Constant Sorrow," [...] a song that had already enjoyed much success in real life. After the film's release, the fictitious band became so popular that the country and folk musicians who were dubbed into the film, such as Ralph Stanley, John Hartford, Alison Krauss, Emmylou Harris, Gillian Welch, Chris Sharp, and others, all got together and performed the music from the film in a Down from the Mountain concert tour which was filmed for TV and DVD.|$|E
2500|$|Season one of The O.C. {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and is frequently {{regarded as the}} best season. Upon the show's premiere, Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC described Ryan and Seth's friendship as [...] "the most promising plot". The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr. Schwartz pulled it off, sneaking a truly smart show past the gatekeepers {{in the guise of}} something commercial and trashy and fun." [...] The reviewer also praised how the show [...] "steered clear of both Aaron Spelling-style camp and <b>the</b> <b>soggy</b> earnestness that often characterises teen drama" [...] and praised the integration of the adult cast into the plotlines. IGN called it [...] "far more engaging and interesting" [...] than its predecessors in the teen genre. The reviewer pointed to the show's sense of humor and respect for its audience, praising the series as [...] "very funny" [...] and [...] "well-acted", while referring to Mischa Barton as the weak link. Time Magazine critic James Poniewozik was fond of the premiere episode, saying that the show [...] "looks to have enough heart, talent and wit to generate a few seasons' worth of luxurious suds. As Ryan would say, in the teen-soap business, being 100% original doesn't make you smart. Delivering a formula with so much style and believability that it feels new again—that does." ...|$|E
