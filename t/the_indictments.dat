5|$|Henry had Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May {{she was arrested}} {{and sent to the}} Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers – which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard – and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but <b>the</b> <b>indictments</b> make no mention of this charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{grand jury}} {{continued}} its investigation, issuing five more indictments after Fletcher issued his blanket pardon. Two were returned against members of Fletcher's staff, {{and two were}} against unpaid advisors to Fletcher. The fifth was issued against Acting Secretary Nighbert for retaliation against a whistleblower. Only the additional charge against Nighbert was alleged to have occurred after Fletcher issued the pardon. On October 24, 2005, Fletcher filed a motion asking Franklin Circuit Court Judge William Graham to order the grand jury to stop issuing indictments for offenses that occurred prior to the blanket pardon; only the names of indicted officials could {{be included in the}} jury's final report. On November 16, Graham ruled that the grand jury could continue issuing indictments, but in a separate ruling, dismissed <b>the</b> <b>indictments</b> against Fletcher's staff and volunteer advisors on grounds that they were covered by the pardon. Graham did not rule on the latest indictment against Nighbert. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed Graham's ruling on December 16. Immediately after the Court of Appeals' ruling, Fletcher announced his intent to appeal the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|The defense, {{led by a}} Phelps Dodge {{corporate}} attorney (provided pro bono), filed a pre-trial {{motion in}} a federal district court to release the 21 men {{on the grounds that}} no federal laws had been violated.

5000|$|In {{criminal}} cases, a demurrer {{may be used}} in {{some circumstances}} to challenge the legal sufficiency of <b>the</b> <b>indictment</b> or other similar charging instrument. Traditionally, if the defendant could admit every allegation of <b>the</b> <b>indictment</b> and still be innocent of any crime, then a general demurrer would be sustained and <b>the</b> <b>indictment</b> would be dismissed. A special demurrer refers to an attack on the form, rather than the substance, of the charge: if the defendant correctly identifies some defect [...] "on the face" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>indictment,</b> then <b>the</b> charges are subject to being dismissed, although usually <b>the</b> <b>indictment</b> can be re-drawn (re-written) and re-presented to the grand jury or other charging authority. While there are different ways to accomplish the goals of a special demurrer, often an alternative method to challenge the sufficiency of <b>the</b> <b>indictment</b> is an attack on the prosecution's case prior to trial, and is generally made by means of motion to dismiss.|$|R

25|$|The defense {{moved to}} dismiss <b>the</b> <b>indictments</b> {{on the grounds}} that federal {{obscenity}} statutes violated the constitutional guarantees of privacy and liberty that were protected by the due process clause.

The defense argued that this right was not affected {{by the fact that the}} material does not have any literary or artistic merit, and that since the federal obscenity laws imposed a complete ban on materials which people have the right to possess, they were unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|On May 15, 1918, the U.S. Department of Justice {{ordered the}} arrest of 21 mining company {{executives}} and several Bisbee and Cochise County elected leaders and law enforcement officers.

One of them, Richard DiNome, was later murdered on February 4, 1984. As with DeMeo, DiNome's killers were never identified, but law enforcement assumed they were the remaining DeMeo crew members. DiNome's brother, Frederick DiNome, also suspected the DeMeo crew of killing Richard and agreed to become a government witness.|$|E

From Sicily heroin {{was moved to}} the Gambino crime family in New York, who were related to the Inzerillos. Chinnici appointed Falcone to investigate the case, one of the biggest Antimafia operations in more than a decade. Costa signed <b>the</b> <b>indictments</b> after virtually all of the other prosecutors in his office had declined to do so – a fact that leaked out of the office and eventually cost him his life.
