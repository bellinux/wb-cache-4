Also, his optic nerve had been reconfigured to function like a high-speed camera and the processing speed of his neuronal system having been increased a thousandfold. The conclusion reached is that Clifford's physiology was re-structured by the aliens to function as a computer. During this, Bergman's suspicions <b>are</b> confirmed as <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> into <b>the</b> sphere where unseen entities reside in a black void, surrounded by swirling coloured light and melodic sound.

40|$|The three presentations were {{developed}} by three undergraduate students studying Sociology at the University of Northampton. Each student took a topic of their choice related to the broad themes of globalization and development in the 21 st century, and created an attractive and informative presentation which can stand alone as {{an introduction to the}} key issues and debates surrounding the chosen topic. The guidelines for creating the presentations include a limit on the number of slides to be used, recommendations on having a balance of text and graphics, and, crucially, that <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> on a self-contained guided tour through the topic, culminating in a concluding slide to encourage <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to follow up the topic by using the key references provided. The intended audience for the presentations includes other students interested in globalization and development, but also a wider audience who may have a general rather than an academic interest in contemporary global issues. The presentations are therefore designed to be widely accessible. A similar approach could be adopted in other fields and teaching contexts. ...|$|R

50|$|Socotra: The Hidden Land, is {{the story}} of an {{extraordinary}} lost land, whose ancient beliefs and lifestyles remained unchanged for centuries, hidden from the eyes of the world. Every step you <b>take</b> on Socotra <b>is</b> a discovery.

The documentary {{is a reflection of the}} life and customs of this isolated society, told by some of the most remarkable characters on the island, who use their own words, and their own traditional tales, beliefs and ways of life, to tell us about their spirit, their future and their daily struggle to preserve their traditions in the face of globalization.|$|R
50|$|Park of Laments is {{situated}} in the woodland area southeast of the lake in 100 acres. The overall form of the park is a square within a square, one rigid and made of limestone-filled gabion baskets, while the other consisting of indigenous trees and shrubs. Natural, minimalist wooden benches, made from kiln-treated poplar, are built into {{the edge of an}} amphitheater of stairs, vines, and stones. <b>The</b> <b>viewer</b> begins their experience by walking down a concrete platform flanked on both sides with limestone-filled gabion baskets and indigenous shrubbery. During their walk, the baskets become taller {{in the form of a}} progressive step system that correlates with the actual topography of the landscape; the minimum height being at approximately 2’, and the maximum at about 12’. At that point <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> underground through a dark, pre-cast concrete “box culvert” tunnel (made of nine individual segments, attached and mortared together) and walk towards the sunlit area on the other end of the tunnel. The entire length of the tunnel is approximately 72’ in length. The visitor then proceeds up the stairs to reach the enclosed park area, where no other portion of the Art & Nature Park is visible due to both the surrounding gabion baskets and natural woodlands. There the visitor may sit or interact with the space and be surrounded by over 53 different indigenous plant species located within the installation (more than 3,000 plants total).|$|R

5000|$|Daniel Rozin (1961) is an Israeli-American artist {{working in}} the area of {{interactive}} digital art. As an interactive artist Rozin creates installations and sculptures that have the unique ability to change and respond to the presence and point of view of <b>the</b> <b>viewer.</b> In many cases <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> becomes <b>the</b> contents of the piece and in others <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> invited to <b>take</b> {{an active role in the}} creation of the piece.|$|R
5000|$|The {{subject of}} the {{painting}} is a woman sitting in a green and yellow striped armchair. Her figure and the chair take {{up the majority of}} the canvas. She is nude except for sheer, gold-trimmed harem pants that covers her legs and touches the floor. The woman is heavily sexualized by her suggestive pose and how Matisse portrays the curvature of her body. Her breasts are round and idealized. However, the whole body of the sitter is not idealized because she has hair under her arms, which was considered scandalous by contemporary critics. [...] The brushwork in the painting is loose and shows the gestural movements of the artist. The painting has very little spatial depth, forcing <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> to confront <b>the</b> woman in the foreground. The architectural and decorative elements further focus <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> on <b>the</b> seated female. The shadows and curvature of her body is accentuated in contrast with the flat rendering of patterns in the planes behind her. The red decorative element, possibly a tapestry or a painting, hanging on the wall and the striped armchair that she is sitting in offer movement to <b>the</b> <b>viewer’s</b> eye. As <b>the</b> <b>viewers</b> gaze <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> around <b>the</b> painting by the geometric shapes to the pattern, and after their gaze glazes over the flat olive wall and muted orange floor <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> will come to rest upon the reclined female. The air of comfortability that the woman exudes ensures that even as <b>the</b> <b>viewer’s</b> gaze <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> around <b>the</b> painting, it will always land on the female.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to his online teaching presence Farber toured extensively throughout the United States and internationally giving lectures at the Smithsonian Institution, the George Eastman House and many universities, as well as seminars and on-location workshops with models. Education about the craft and profession {{has always been an}} integral aspect of Farber’s professional life. In his books during this period Natural Beauty (2001) and American Mood (2004) he includes a technical glossary of the locations, camera, film speeds and processing for each photograph, a consistent theme throughout his literary oeuvre. When describing his teaching methods with the magazines Photo Insider and the British Journal of Photography he also emphasizes the unique perspective of every photographer: “I like sharing how I do my work. But even in the exact same settings, no two pictures turn out identically. All photographs reflect the photographer, the technical is just one side.” And further in his introduction to Natural Beauty: “Of course, many powerful images are technically perfect, but that is not what makes them great. If <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> in by a perfect exposure, then the image lacks what is most important: the soul of its creator. All this translates as sensitivity: sensitivity to the subject, whether it be human or otherwise. A spark in the eyes is not merely a reflection of light, just as a tear is more than a drop of water. You have to feel your subject {{in the same way that}} a dancer has to feel the music.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Johnson {{has said}} the {{following}} about his art: [...] "Rather than flee from the dowdy, I make it my own. My work is a celebration of America’s built environment. In many of my images, buildings loom large, isolated almost like sculptures in their own right. Scenes are reduced to the skeleton of their structuring geometries. <b>The</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> invited to <b>take</b> pleasure in not only the subject as a whole, but also in its individual components. My paintings of icehouses and corner stores, of movie theatres and shop signs, revel in precisely these kinds of unassuming geometric marvels. My work lends dignity to the unspectacular." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{episode is}} infamous for certain {{repetitive}} visual effects which induced photosensitive epileptic seizures in {{a substantial number}} of Japanese viewers, an incident referred to as the [...] by the Japanese press. As a result of <b>the</b> seizures 685 <b>viewers</b> <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> to hospitals; 2 people remained hospitalized for more than two weeks. Due to this, the episode has not been rebroadcast worldwide. After the incident, the Pokémon anime went into a four-month hiatus, and it returned on TV Tokyo on April 16, 1998, thus making the episode perhaps the most controversial episode of the entire Pokémon series. Since then, the episode has been parodied and referenced in cultural media, including The Simpsons and South Park.|$|R

Some of these are Goralski, Krakowiak, Kujawiak/Oberek, Polonez, Sieradz, Opolske and many more.|$|R
5000|$|The Tenant {{has been}} {{referred}} to as a precursor to Kubricks The Shining (1980), as another film where the lines between reality, madness, and the supernatural become increasingly blurry (the question usually asked with The Shining is [...] "Ghosts or cabin fever?") as the protagonist finds himself doomed to cyclically repeat another persons nightmarish fall. Just like in The Shining, the audience is slowly brought to accept the supernatural by what at first seems a slow descent into madness, or vice versa: [...] "The audiences predilection to accept a proto-supernatural explanation ... becomes so pronounced that at Trelkovskys break with sanity <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> encouraged to <b>take</b> a straightforward hallucination for a supernatural act." ...|$|R

It is also revealed that they have an incestual son named 'Junior' who has been kept locked up in <b>the</b> basement; <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> also learns that Junior is often viciously beaten by Ernest. Ernest then convinces the subservient Virginia, who <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> now realizes <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> advantage of by Ernest, that Jennifer must be killed upon her return, in order to keep everything under cover.|$|R
5000|$|With {{regard to}} the {{statement}} of Lillian Chynoweth’s death {{after the completion of}} the film, The God Makers II does not make it clear that she committed suicide in 1992, and instead leaves the impression with <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> that she <b>was</b> murdered {{as the result of the}} “blood atonement” threat. The Tanners take issue with the manner in which this is presented in the film, stating, [...] "this statement certainly suggests to all those who see the video, that Lillian Chynoweth was murdered in cold blood. What the producers of The God Makers II fail to tell <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> that Lillian <b>took</b> her own life. Also, the “Mormon Church” Chynoweth refers to on film is the “Church of the Lamb of God” but the film does not make this clear, so <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> left to infer she was speaking about the LDS Church. The Tanners, who do make the claim that the LDS Church practiced “blood atonement” in the 19th century, state, “unfortunately, The God Makers II has presented the material concerning blood atonement in a way that has caused many people to believe that the Mormon (LDS) Church is still involved in the practice”.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 Gonzalez-Torres {{presented}} [...] "Untitled" [...] (Memorial Day Weekend) and [...] "Untitled" [...] (Veterans Day Sale), exhibited {{together as}} [...] "Untitled" [...] (Monuments): block-like stacks of paper printed with content {{related to his}} private life, from which <b>the</b> <b>viewer</b> <b>is</b> invited to <b>take</b> a sheet. Rather than constituting a solid, immovable monument, the stacks can be dispersed, depleted, and renewed over time. [...] "Untitled" [...] (1991), however, is a unique stack of 161 signed and numbered silkscreens that remain together. Similar to the 1989 billboard commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion, its iteration as a stack of prints was meant, as the artist noted at the time, as a “more private and personal object”—one that is not disseminated physically but instead through the experience of remembering. The stark black page and white typeface on each sheet trace a nonlinear chronology of significant events {{in the history of}} the gay-rights movement.|$|R
