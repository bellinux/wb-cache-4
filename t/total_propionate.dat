40|$|The {{administration}} in vivo of the cobalamin analogue hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] inhibits hepatic L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity. The current studies characterize in vivo and in vitro the hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam]-treated rat {{as a model}} of disordered propionate and methylmalonic acid metabolism. Treatment of rats with hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] (2 micrograms/h by osmotic minipump) increased urinary methylmalonic acid excretion from 0. 55 mumol/day to 390 mumol/day after 2 weeks. Hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] treatment was associated with increased urinary propionylcarnitine excretion and increased short-chain acylcarnitine concentrations in plasma and liver. Hepatocytes isolated from cobalamin-analogue-treated rats metabolized propionate (1. 0 mM) to CO 2 and glucose at rates which were only 18 % and 1 % respectively of those observed in hepatocytes from control (saline-treated) rats. In contrast, rates of pyruvate and palmitate oxidation were higher than control in hepatocytes from the hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam]-treated rats. In hepatocytes from hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam]-treated rats, propionylcarnitine was the dominant product generated from propionate when carnitine (10 mM) was present. The addition of carnitine thus resulted in a 4 -fold increase in <b>total</b> <b>propionate</b> utilization under these conditions. Hepatocytes from hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam]-treated rats were more sensitive than control hepatocytes to inhibition of palmitate oxidation by propionate. This inhibition of palmitate oxidation was partially reversed by addition of carnitine. Thus hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] treatment in vivo rapidly causes a severe defect in propionate metabolism. The consequences of this metabolic defect in vivo and in vitro are those predicted on the basis of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA accumulation. The cobalamin-analogue-treated rat provides a useful model for studying metabolism under conditions of a metabolic defect causing acyl-CoA accretion...|$|E
40|$|In anoxic environments, {{degradation}} {{of organic matter}} (OM) results in strong fractionation of carbon isotopes, with formation of C- 13 -depleted CH 4. Propionate and acetate are important products of OM fermentation. Propionate is further fermented to acetate. Acetate is a direct precursor of CH 4, the remainder usually being produced from H- 2 -mediated CO 2 reduction. There is a paucity of data for the turnover of acetate and, even more so, propionate. We therefore analyzed the d 13 C values of organic carbon, propionate, acetate and the methyl (Me) group of acetate (acetate-Me) during the production of CH 4 in anoxic incubations of various flooded and non-flooded soils and various lake sediments. Incubation {{in the presence of}} CH 3 F, which inhibits CH 4 production from acetate, allowed exclusion of isotope effects during aceticlastic methanogenesis. Despite the variation inherent in the wide diversity of sample type and origin, the data collectively showed that the d C- 13 value of acetate was only marginally different (- 2 +/- 5 %) from that of OM, while propionate was depleted in C- 13 relative to total acetate (- 6 +/- 5 parts per thousand). Acetate-Me was generally depleted in C- 13 relative to total acetate (- 8 +/- 5 %). Thus, isotopic enrichment factors during the {{degradation of}} OM to <b>total</b> <b>propionate</b> and acetate were much smaller than those during hydrogenotrophic and aceticlastic methanogenesis or the intramolecular difference in d 13 C between the carboxyl (CO 2 H) and Me of acetate, so that the d C- 13 value of OM may be used as a proxy when data for acetate are not available...|$|E
40|$|Inclusion of lipid into diets {{increases}} the energy density and, {{depending on the}} type of lipid, may alter the fatty acid (FA) composition of tissues. Effects of dietary lipid on the digestive and immune function gastrointestinal tract have been evaluated, but effects on how dietary FA affect short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) absorption have not been investigated. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary lipid supply and lipid type on the FA composition of the ruminal epithelium and absorption of SCFA. Twenty-one Holstein steers (194. 1 ± 26. 77 kg) were randomly assigned to the control (CON; 2. 2 % ether extract) or 1 of 2 lipid supplementation treatments (5 % ether extract) utilizing saturated (SAT) or unsaturated sources and protected fat (UNSAT). After 30 d, calves were killed and samples of ruminal digesta, blood, and ruminal tissue were collected for FA analysis, and ruminal tissue was used for ex vivo measurement of acetate, propionate, and butyrate uptake and flux. Data were analyzed as a randomized complete block design using the mixed model of SAS with the fixed effect of treatment and the random effect of block. Calves fed SAT and UNSAT had greater (P < 0. 01) concentration of total FA in ruminal fluid than CON. Feeding UNSAT increased the monounsaturated (P < 0. 001) and polyunsaturated (P = 0. 002) FA content in ruminal fluid relative to SAT and CON. The concentration of FA in the ruminal epithelium did not differ among treatments but there was a tendency (P = 0. 069) for SAT calves to have more total FA and saturated FA (P = 0. 053) than UNSAT. Moreover, UNSAT calves had greater (P = 0. 006) omega- 3 FA concentration in the ruminal epithelium than CON and SAT calves. Calves fed SAT had greater (P = 0. 038) <b>total</b> <b>propionate</b> uptake with greater passive diffusion (P = 0. 015) than CON and UNSAT. Calves fed SAT also had greater total butyrate uptake (P = 0. 008). However, there were no differences for acetate, propionate, or butyrate flux among treatments. Thus, it is concluded that the provision of dietary lipid alters the FA composition of the ruminal epithelium and the uptake of propionate and butyrate with the greatest response when saturated lipid sources are provided...|$|E

40|$|Scope: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and compare the effects of four types of pectins on dietary fiber (DF) fermentation, microbiota composition, and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production throughout the large intestine in rats. Methods and results: Male Wistar rats were given diets supplemented with or without 3 % structurally different pectins for 7 weeks. Different fermentation patterns of pectins and different location of fermentation of pectin and diet arabinoxylans (AXs) in the large intestine were observed. During cecal fermentation, sugar beet pectin significantly stimulated Lactobacillus (p < 0. 01) and Lachnospiraceae (p < 0. 05). The stimulating effects of sugar beet pectin on these two groups of microbes are stronger than both other pectins. In the cecum, low-methyl esterified citrus pectin and complex soy pectin increased (p < 0. 05) the production of <b>total</b> SCFAs, <b>propionate</b> and butyrate, whereas high-methyl esterified pectin and sugar beet pectin did not. The fermentation patterns of cereal AXs in the cecum were significantly different upon supplementation of different pectins. These differences, however, became smaller in the colon due to an enhanced fermentation of the remaining DFs. Conclusion: Dietary supplementation of pectin is a potential strategy to modulate the location of fermentation of DFs, and consequently microbiota composition and SCFA production for health-promoting effects. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of Aspergillus oryzae culture (AOC) and 2 -hydroxy- 4 -(methylthio) -butanoic acid (HMB) on rumen fermentation and microbial populations between different roughage sources. Two roughage sources (Chinese wild rye [CWR] vs corn silage [CS]) were assigned in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement with HMB (0 or 15 mg) and AOC (0, 3, or 6 mg). Gas production (GP), microbial protein (MCP) and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) were increased in response to addition of HMB and AOC (p< 0. 01) for the two roughages. The HMB and AOC showed inconsistent effects on ammonia-N with different substrates. For CWR, neither HMB nor AOC had significant effect on molar proportion of individual VFA. For CS, acetate was increased (p = 0. 02) and butyrate was decreased (p< 0. 01) by adding HMB and AOC. Increase of propionate was only occurred with AOC (p< 0. 01). Populations of protozoa (p≤ 0. 03) and fungi (p≤ 0. 02) of CWR were differently influenced by HMB and AOC. Percentages of F. succinogenes, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens (p< 0. 01) increased when AOC was added to CWR. For CS, HMB decreased the protozoa population (p = 0. 01) and increased the populations of F. succinogenes and R. albus (p≤ 0. 03). Populations of fungi, F. succinogenes (p = 0. 02) and R. flavefacien (p = 0. 03) were increased by adding AOC. The HMB×AOC interactions were noted in MCP, fungi and R. flavefacien for CWR and GP, ammonia-N, MCP, <b>total</b> VFA, <b>propionate,</b> acetate/propionate (A/P) and R. albus for CS. It is inferred that addition of HMB and AOC could influence rumen fermentation of forages by {{increasing the number of}} rumen microbes...|$|R
40|$|Chromium {{appears to}} be an {{essential}} trace element since 1959, but its effect on ruminal microbes is not clear yet. This experiment was conducted to study the effects of organic chromium supplementation on rumen fermentation activity. An in vitro technique was held using randomized block design with 13 treatments and 3 replications. There were four kinds of organic Cr used, produced with four different species of fungi as carriers. Fungi used as carriers were Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus oryzae, Rhizophus oryzae and “ragi tape”. The result indicated that the optimum organic Cr supplementation was 1 mg organic Cr/kg dry matter. Supplementation of 1 mg organic Cr/kg dry matter increased dry matter and organic matter digestibilities. It also tended to increase NH 3 and <b>total</b> VFA production. <b>Propionate</b> production increased, which decreased methane production and increased hexose conversion efficiency in several treatments. Each fungus used as carrier of organic Cr resulted in different effects on rumen fermentation activity, but the effects was within a normal range. It was concluded that either Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus oryzae, Rhizophus oryzae or “ragi tape” could be used as carrier in organic Cr production...|$|R

Goats had average of body weight of 18 kgand aged at 18 months. Animals were housed in metabolic cages and were alloted to a completelyrandomized design receiving three experimental diets with sugarcane bagasse portions of 15, 25, and 35 % (dry matter basis), respectively. After eight weeks of adjustment period to experimental diets andenvironment, each group of treatment was subjected to ten days of digestion trial, and followed bycollection of rumen liquid samples. Parameters observed were feed digestibility, nitrogen retention,ruminal feed fermentation, and excretion of urinary allantoin to estimate microbial protein synthesis. Data were tested using one way analysis of variance, and followed by Duncan’s mulitiple range test. Drymatter and protein intakes lowered (P< 0. 05) as the increasing of sugarcane bagasse in diets. Proteindigestibility and retention were unaffected by the treatment of bagasse portion. The dietary treatment didnot change ruminal ammonia, <b>total</b> VFA, acetate, <b>propionate,</b> and butyrate concentrations.

This experiment aimed to study digestive anatomy and cæcal fermentation of the growing cane rat. Twenty four cane rats were used from weaning to 103 days of age. They received a pelleted diet contained 12. 5 % of crude protein and 16. 7 % of ADF. Twelve animals were in a collective pen while 12 others were bred in individual cages for growth and feed intake measurements. At weaning, 82 and 103 days of age, six animals were sacrificed for gut parameters measurements and caecal sampling. The growth rate increased with age (P 0. 05). The caecum represented the largest compartment of the digestive tract with more than 40 % of total gut contents. Acetate was the most abundant volatile fatty acid with more than 70 % of <b>total,</b> followed by <b>propionate</b> and butyrate. Acetate proportion increased with age (P 0. 05).

40|$|AN EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF USING GLYCEROL AND WHEAT DRY DISTILLERS’ GRAINS WITH SOLUBLES IN SHEEP DIETS The aims of this {{research}} were to assess the effects of feeding glycerol and wheat based dry distillers’ grains with solubles (WDDGS) on rumen metabolism, performance, carcass characteristics and fatty acid composition of adipose tissue of lambs. In study 1, increasing levels of glycerol as replacement of barley grain in in vitro batch cultures did not affect culture pH and total methane (CH 4) production, but in vitro dry matter disappearance, total VFA production and propionate proportions were linearly increased. In study 2, increasing levels of glycerol in a forage diet increased <b>total</b> VFA, <b>propionate</b> and butyrate production and DM and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) disappearance in semi continuous fermenters. Methane production was linearly increased despite increases in propionate concentrations {{as a result of}} the more reduced state of glycerol as compared to carbohydrates which implies there is no net incorporation of electrons into glycerol when it is metabolised to propionate. In study 3, increasing concentrations of glycerol did not alter in vivo diet digestibility or CH 4 production. However, dry matter intake (DMI) was reduced at high glycerol concentrations (210 g/kg DM) and average daily gain (ADG) tended to decrease. Fatty acid profiles were improved by reducing concentrations of palmitic, trans- 10 octadecenoic and linoleic acids and the n- 6 /n- 3 ratio and increasing stearic and oleic acids. In study 4, increasing concentrations of WDDGS as direct replacement of barley grain resulted in increased eating rates, DMI and ADG. Linolenic acid in backfat tissue was also increased without altering the n- 6 /n- 3 ratio. However, when WDDGS were included in iso nitrogenous diets as replacement of soybean meal and alfalfa, DM, NDF and CP in sacco effective degradability and in vitro CH 4 production were increased. Animal DMI, ADG and hot carcass weight were linearly reduced but feed efficiency was unaffected and trans- 10 octadecenoic and linoleic acids were increased...|$|R

Ruminal manipulation with additives such as Saccharomyces cerevisiaeyeastculture (YC) {{has been shown}} to alter digestibility when added to this type of diet. An experiment was conducted to investigate the ruminal fermentation and in situ digestibility of diets with 3 different levels of forage to concentrate (F:C) fed at restricted intake without and with YC addition. Three cannulated post-pubertal Holstein heifers (age 18. 0 ± 1. 2 months; body weight 449. 6 ± 19. 7 kg) were feddiets consisting of corn silage as the sole forage source in a 3 period (35 -day) Latin square design. Heifers were feddiets for 21 days with no YC addition, followed by 14 days where YC was added to the diet (1 g/kg as fed basis). Low (LC), medium (MC), and high (HC) concentratediets (20, 40, and 60 % concentrate) were fed once daily on a restricted basis to provide 0. 22 Mcal ME/kg empty BW 0. 75. Rumen fluid was sampled on days 18 and 32 of each period, and rumen contents were evacuated on days 21 and 35 of each period. An in situ study was done on days 14 to 17 and on days 28 to 31. Mean ruminal pH was not different between dietary treatments and no YC effect was detected. Mean total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ruminal ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) concentration was also not different among diets with different F:C. Molar proportions of acetate were decreased, and propionate were increased; while the acetate-to-propionate ratio was decreased as the concentrate level increased from LC to HC. <b>Total</b> VFA, <b>propionate,</b> and acetate as well as isoacids concentration increased, yet NH 3 -N concentration decreased with YC addition in all diets. From these results we conclude that feeding HC diets in restrictedamounts had minimal effects on rumenfermentation rate between different F:C diets. The addition of YC modified NH 3 -N and volatile fatty acid concentrations in the rumen in all 3 diets in this study, presumably through alterations in end-product production and utilization...|$|R

The molecular weight of the PHB polymer made in K. aerogenes and E. coli was approximately 1 x 10 (6) to 2 x 10 (6). Sucrose uptake in K. aerogenes was measured and found to be similar to that found for other Klebsiella strains, but sucrose uptake in the E. coli strain was not detectable. K. aerogenes is able to utilize sugarcane molasses as the sole carbon source to accumulate PHB at the rate of approximately 1 g of PHB per liter of culture fluid per h.

Growth of S. ruminantium in medium that contained 2 g of dl-lactate per liter was stimulated approximately twofold by 10 mM l-aspartate, fumarate, or l-malate after 24 h. Both l-aspartate and fumarate increased lactate uptake over 4 -fold, while l-malate stimulated uptake over 10 -fold. Amaferm enhanced lactate uptake at all concentrations tested (0. 5 to 50 g/liter), and the 10 -g/liter level increased uptake over 12 -fold. A filter-sterilized Amaferm filtrate increased lactate uptake over sevenfold, and growth on lactate was stimulated over twofold by either 2 or 5 % (vol/vol) Amaferm filtrate. The Amaferm filtrate also increased the production of acetate, <b>propionate,</b> <b>total</b> volatile fatty acids, and Ylactate from lactate-grown cells. Since the increase in propionate production was greater relative to acetate, a decrease in the acetate:propionate ratio was observed.

In the first lactation study, milk and milk fat yields, milk fat percentage, and efficiency of feed utilization (FCM/DMI) were increased by the supplementation of 2. 5 % prilled fatty acids (PFA). Cows fed a fish-blood protein combination (FB) had lower milk yield and DMI than those fed cottonseed meal. In the second lactation study, milk yield, 3. 5 % FCM, and fat yield were increased by evaporative cooling. Supplementation of 3 % PFA rendering dietary of FA to 7. 4 % appear to be excessive and resulted in only slightly increased (. 7 kg) milk yield. Supplementation of PFA, increased efficiency of feed utilization, but decreased FA digestibility. In the third study (metabolic trial), both high quality (HQ) protein and {{a high level of}} supplemental fat gave similar positive responses in milk production. Compared to low quality protein (LQ), HQ increased yields of milk, 3. 5 % FCM, milk protein, milk lactose, and milk SNF. Compared to LQ, concentrations of lysine (Lys) in coccygeal plasma were higher for HQ and leucine was lower. Arteriovenous difference of plasma concentrations of Lys also was higher for HQ than LQ.

Cows fed HQ diet had higher concentration of rumen ammonia N and rumen butyrate was increased by the supplemental fat. Concentrations of <b>total</b> VFA, <b>propionate,</b> butyrate, and valerate were increased by supplementation with HQ protein, thus providing more energy for the high milk production.

In ruminants, dietary CT limit DM intake and digestibility, and ruminal protein degradation by forming CT-protein complexes. Effects of dietary CT, animal species, prior dietary CT exposure, and antimicrobial inclusion on 48 -h rate {{and extent of}} digestion were measured in two in vitro experiments. Cattle, sheep, and goats (n = 3 / species) were used in a 2 -period, randomized complete-block experiment with a 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factor 1 was substrate: tannin-free or high-CT. Factor 2 was source of ruminal fluid inoculum: cattle, sheep, or goat. Factor 3 was prior animal exposure to a high-CT diet: non-exposed or exposed. Factor 4 was inclusion of antimicrobials: no antimicrobial, penicillin + streptomycin to suppress bacterial activity, or cycloheximide to suppress fungal activity in the fermentation. Tannin-free or high-CT substrates were incubated in vitro using ruminal fluid from animals either not exposed (period 1) or exposed to dietary CT (period 2). Periods consisted of an adaptation to tannin-free (10 d) or high-CT diets (21 d) and a 15 -d period of ruminal-fluid collection via stomach tube.

The exponential decay rate of the 13 C/ 12 C ratio after pulse-dosing 13 C-acetate, 13 C-propionate, or 13 C-butyrate into the rumen was compared with the decay rate of rumen valerate concentration following a simultaneous pulse dose. The unlabeled valerate, CoEDTA, and each labeled VFA, one at a time, were concurrently mixed with the evacuated ruminal content of 6 lactating cows in two 3 x 3 Latin squares. The clearance of VFA by passage to the omasum {{was assumed to be}} equivalent to the decay in ruminal Co concentration and was around 50 % of the <b>total</b> clearance. Acetate, <b>propionate,</b> and butyrate had similar fractional clearance rates (31. 2, 33. 4, 30. 4 %/h, respectively), but propionate had a higher absorption rate (19. 2 %/h) than butyrate (14. 2 %/h). Linear regression determination coefficients using the valerate clearance rate as an estimator for acetate, propionate, and butyrate rumen clearance were 0. 51, 0. 56, and 0. 99, respectively. In a second experiment, the 13 C-valerate fractional clearance rate estimate (33. 7 %/h) was similar to the estimate obtained with unlabeled valerate (35. 0 %/h) by the valerate-Co technique.

The experiment involved 6 ruminally cannulated late-lactation Holstein cows assigned to 2 treatments: control and 3 NOP (60 mg/kg of feed dry matter). Compared with the control, 3 NOP decreased methane emission by 31 % and increased hydrogen emission from undetectable to 1. 33 g/d. Methane emissions per kilogram of dry matter intake and milk yield were also decreased 34 % by 3 NOP. Milk production and composition were not affected by 3 NOP, except milk fat concentration was increased compared with the control. Concentrations of <b>total</b> VFA and <b>propionate</b> in ruminal fluid were not affected by treatment, but acetate concentration tended to be lower and acetate-to-propionate ratio was lower for 3 NOP compared with the control. The 3 NOP decreased the molar proportion of acetate and increase those of propionate, butyrate, valerate, and isovalerate. Deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios of methane and the abundance of ¹³CH₃D were similar between treatments. Compared with the control, minor (4 ‰) depletion in the ¹³C/¹²C ratio was observed for 3 NOP. Genus composition of methanogenic archaea (Methanobrevibacter, Methanosphaera, and Methanomicrobium) was not affected by 3 NOP, but the proportion of methanogens in the total cell counts tended to be decreased by 3 NOP. Prevotella spp., the predominant bacterial genus in ruminal contents in this experiment, was also not affected by 3 NOP. Compared with the control, Ruminococcus and Clostridium spp. were decreased and Butyrivibrio spp. was increased by 3 NOP.

Nitrogen fertilization increased crude protein concentration of TF pasture and average daily gain of beef steers. Increase in total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia-N (NH 3 -N) concentrations were detected in steers grazing fertilized TF. In comparison with steers on feedlot, pasture-finished steers had greater proportions of cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA and C 18 : 3 n- 3, but lower n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in adipose tissue. In the first in vitro study using 2 energy supplements [corn or dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) ] and 4 pasture mixture forages [TF without or with N fertilizer (TF˗NF or TF+NF), TF-alfalfa mixture (TF+AF), and TF-birdsfoot trefoil mixture (TF+BT) ], we found that corn supplementation increased <b>total</b> VFA and <b>propionate</b> concentrations, while DDGS supplementation decreased total VFA concentrations. Lower NH 3 -N concentration and methane (CH 4) production were observed due to energy supplementation, in particular when corn grain was supplemented. Similar NH 3 -N:VFA ratios were detected in the cultures fed the TF+NF and the TF+BT. This result indicates that the TF+BT had similar fermentation efficiency on in vitro ruminal metabolism compared with the TF+NF. The second in vitro study was performed to investigate the effects of grass-to-legume ratios of 3 different TF-legume mixed diets on in vitro fermentation characteristics in continuous cultures. Propionate concentration increased with the increasing of legume proportion in the mixed diets. The greatest propionate concentration was shown by cultures fed the TF+CM, while the TF+AF and the TF+BT maintained a similar propionate concentration. Increasing legume proportion in the forage diets also increased NH 3 -N concentration, but decreased CH 4 production in the cultures. Further decrease of CH 4 production was recorded when the TF+BT was fed to the cultures. Overall results from the grazing study demonstrate that N fertilizer can improve nutrient quality of TF as well as growth performance of grazing steers, while the in vitro studies showed positive effects of grass-legume mixture diets on in vitro microbial metabolism by improving ruminal fermentation and reducing CH 4 production...|$|R

In Experiment 2, growth, digestibility and nitrogen retention in finishing continental steers offered ad libitum, concentrates based on barley and soyabean or on a mixture of industrial by-products were examined. The observed higher nitrogen retention in animals offered the by-product based ration suggested that there is opportunity to increase carcass protein content by judicious choice of feed ingredients. This suggestion was explored in Experiment 3. In Experiment 3, nitrogen retention and carcass composition were measured in sheep offered rations which resulted in different patterns of volatile fatty acid supply from the rumen. Nitrogen retention and the growth of carcass lean tissue were increased by the inclusion of sodium propionate in a starch-based ration but not in a fibre-based ration. The apparently contradictory effects of an increase in propionate supply by dietary means (starch vs fibrebased rations) or by addition of a salt of propionic acid suggests that the pattern, as well as the <b>total</b> supply of <b>propionate</b> is physiologically important in the growing ruminant. The endocrine mechanism of changes in carcass composition was also explored in this experiment. Differences in plasma concentrations of hormones which {{play a major role in}} the partition of absorbed nutrients towards muscle or adipose tissue suggests a role for the endocrine system in the regulation of growth, independent of energy intake. In Experiment 4, the effect of starch form and concentration (a dietary means of increasing propionate supply) in high concentrate rations on growth, efficiency and estimated lean content was examined in Friesian bulls. Supporting mechanistic measurements were made in Friesian steers fed the corresponding experimental rations. For optimum growth, ground starch should not exceed 210 g/kg of the ration. When included at approximately 300 g/kg, ground rather than rolled starch had a negative impact on growth. Coarse rations containing 300 g or 480 g starch/kg resulted in similar growth and efficiency. An increase in ground but not rolled starch concentration decreased the insulin response to a glucose challenge. End of Project Repor...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of making {{fundamental}} experim e nts concerning the function of male sexual glands in urology, I carried on various experiments with male rats and the results obtained were as follows: (1) The atrophy of a c cessory sexual organs after bilateral castration was brought to completion in 10 days, being remarkable histologically, too. (2) In the case of unilateral castration, atrophy i n accessory sexual organs {{did not take place}} at all either in weight or histologically even at the time when atrophy, in the case of bilateral castration, should be completed. (3) In the case of partial excision (3 / 4) of the testicles, atrophy of accessory sexual organs occurred almost {{in the same way as}} in the case of bilateral castration, both in weight and histologically. This, ho w ever, may depend on the way of manipulation during the operation. (4) The minimum dose of Testosterone propionate for the prohibi t i on of atrophy in accessory sexual organs after castration, was 8 mg in total by 4 week method, administering 2 times a week and 1. 0 mg at a time. (5) At the time when atrophy in accessory sexual organs after castration was completed, I dosed a large amount (50 mg in <b>total)</b> of Testosterone <b>propionate</b> in installments, which restored the atrophy. Depot-testosterone, too, could prohibit atrophy, (6) The minimum dose of Estradiol benzoate for the atrophy of accessory s exual organs suitable to the castration by female sex hormone was 0. 02 mg in total by 10 day method. (7) I compared the efficacies of the 5 drugs of female sex hormone Ovahormon, Estradin B., Suron, Royal, and Estimon. The result was that assuming the efficacy of the former two as 1. 0, that of Suron was 0. 001, that of Rovel and Estimon 0. 2. (8) In the prohibitive method of atrophy in accessory sexual organs af t e r castration, the action of the mixed hormone of both the sexes (Bisteron) reinforced that of Testosterone. (9) P. H. P., a synthetic pituitary-gland dipressant, exerted the atrophic action of accessory sexual organs and on the testicles, but in this case the atrophy of accessory sexual organs took place quickly and that of the testicles was delayed. Compared, however, with Estradiol benzoate, the atrophic action on sexual glands was weaker. (10) Honvan, a medicine for prostatic cancer, had the same atrophic action on accessory sexual organs as Estradiol benzoate, but its characteristic quality was that it did not bring about any decrease in the weight of the testicles and M. levator ani and besides atrophic action was stronger on accessory sexual organs than on the testicles. 11) In the case of testicular transplantation, the secretion of m ale hormone was continued for 10 days in autotransplantation only, while in homotransplantation degeneration seemed to take place earlier than that. (12) Even the hypophysectomy alon e caused a littie decrease of testicular weight and a remarkable atrophy of accessory sexual organs, but when 0. 02 mg in total of Estradiol benzoate was dosed after the excision, both the weight of the testiclees and that of accessory sexual organs decreased by 1 / 2 in comparison with the case of the excision alone, which fact led me to imagine that Estradiol benzoate exerted a direct action on the testicles and accessory sexual organs. (13) Male hormone was administered after the hypophysectomy, but when it exceeded a certain amount the decrease of weight in the testicles and in accessory sexual organs was not observed, which fact seemed to tell that it acted acceleratively on intratubula...|$|R
40|$|Experimento I: Foram utilizadas 60 borregas da raça Santa Inês com o objetivo de avaliar os efeitos de três taxas de crescimento até os 7 meses de idade. Os tratamentos foram delineados visando obter alta taxa de crescimento (ATC), moderada taxa de crescimento (MTC) e baixa taxa de crescimento (BTC). Foram avaliados o consumo de matéria seca, o ganho de peso {{corporal}} e as concentrações séricas de progesterona para a detecção da idade à puberdade. Foram verificados efeitos lineares (p 0, 05) sobre o consumo de MS, MO, e PB em kg/dia e g/kg de PC 0, 75; apenas sobre consumo de FDN com efeito linear (p< 0, 01). O balanço de nitrogênio, assim como a concentração de acetato, propionato, butirato, concentração total de AGCC, amônia no fluido ruminal e a de digestibilidade aparente da MS, MO, PB e FDN não foram afetados pelos tratamentos. Trial I: Sixty Santa Ines ewe lambs {{were used}} to evaluate the effects of three growing rates until 7 months of age. Treatments were defined to achieve high (HGR), moderate (MGR) and low (LGR) growing rates. The dry matter intake and average daily gain (ADG) were evaluated, well as serum levels of progesterone in order to detect the age of puberty. Linear effects (P< 0. 01) to body weight (BW) with values being 59. 5, 61. 4, and 58. 0 to HGR, MGR and LGR, respectively. Linear effects (P< 0. 01) was also observed for average daily gain with values being 0. 182, 0. 156, and 0. 136 kg/day, for HGR, MGR and LGR, respectively. The feed:gain ratio showed a linear effects (p< 0. 02) according to raw sugarcane bagasse inclusion in diet with values being 6. 1, 7. 1 (M) and 9. 2 kgDM/kg BW for HGR, MGR and LGR, respectively. Linear effects (p< 0. 01) was observed for the percentage of animals of ewe lambs the reached puberty at 7 months of age, showing highest values for MGR (60 %), followed by HGR (45 %) and LGR (15 %) treatment. Trial II: The same ewe lambs of Experiment 1 were bred at 37 kg of BW and after lambing they received a unique diet. The ewe lambs were blocked according to body weight and days in milking. According to the energy density increase in the diet, quadratic effects (p< 0. 01) was observed on milk production recorded in a 3 -hour interval (137. 9; 150. 1 and 104. 4 g), fat corrected milk (167. 2, 178. 9 and 129. 4 g) and fat and protein corrected milk (216. 5, 140. 5, 162. 7 g). Fat (9. 77, 8. 92 and 8. 35 %) and protein (4. 2, 4. 2, and 4. 6 %) showed linear effects (P= 0. 01) for fat and (P< 0. 01) for protein. Trial III: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the inclusion of raw sugarcane bagasse (RSB) on dry matter intake and apparent digestibility of nutrients, nitrogen balance and ruminal parameters of Santa Ines ram lambs. Four ruminally fistulated ram lambs averaging 30 kg of BW were placed in metabolism crates. The control treatment (CONT) consisted of a high concentrate diet with 10 % of coastcross (Cynodon sp.) hay in the dietary DM and the others treatments consisted of 10, 20 and, 30 % of RBS in the dietary DM. The diets were formulated to provide similar concentration of crude protein (13. 75 ± 0. 25 %). No effects were observed for DMI, OM, and CP in kg/day and g/kg of BW 0. 75. Linear effects (p< 0. 02) was observed for NDF intake according RBS inclusion. Variables, as well as <b>total</b> SCFA, acetate, <b>propionate,</b> and butyrate concentrations. Ruminal ammonia and apparent nutrient digestibility also did not differ among treatments...|$|R
