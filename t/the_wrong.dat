5|$|Watt {{was waiting}} for the order, and in 1938 had {{arranged}} for production of the transmitters at Metrovick and receivers at A.C. Cossor. These turned out to be <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> products: Metrovick had been told to directly copy ("Chinese") the 1937 design by Percy Hibberd, but Bawdsey had delivered <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> prototype to Metrovick, who copied it. The Cossor receivers were found to be unusable, weighing as much as the entire transmitter and receiver, and having sensitivity about half that of the EMI lash-up.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft {{promised her}} readers a second part to the work. Rather than giving them another {{philosophical}} treatise, however, she offered them a novel tinged with autobiography, appropriately titled <b>The</b> <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman. In her [...] "Preface", she writes that the novel should be considered the story of [...] "woman" [...] and not the story of an [...] "individual". Wollstonecraft attempts to detail, as the scholar Anne K. Mellor has phrased it, [...] "the wrongs done to women and <b>the</b> <b>wrongs</b> done by women" [...] (emphasis Mellor's). <b>The</b> <b>wrongs</b> done to women include stifling and sexually repressed marriages, which Wollstonecraft describes using the language of slavery, while <b>the</b> <b>wrongs</b> done by women include a false sense of self-worth generated through the language of sensibility. Unlike Wollstonecraft's first novel, [...] (1788), <b>The</b> <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman offers solutions to these problems, namely an empowering female sexuality, a purpose-filled maternal role, and the possibility of a feminism that crosses class boundaries.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{attempts}} to define Mary Wollstonecraft’s Mary: A Fiction and Maria or <b>The</b> <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman as early feminist propaganda from its historical perspective. Initially, feministic values {{as well as}} propaganda {{are connected to the}} eighteenth century with the help of contemporary scholars.  These theories are then applied on Wollstonecraft’s Mary: A Fiction and Maria or <b>the</b> <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman, in order to establish these as propaganda. The conclusion reached is that Wollstonecraft had a political and feminist aim when writing her novels as there are many similarities between Mary: A Fiction and Maria or <b>The</b> <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman and her political text A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. Thus, it is possible to regard Mary: A Fiction and Maria or <b>The</b> <b>Wrongs</b> of Woman as early feminist propaganda...|$|R
