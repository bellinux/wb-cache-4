5|$|Many other {{military}} figures, such as bunker designer Josif Zagali, were also {{caught up in}} the 1974 purges. The introduction of a new constitution two years later sealed Hoxha's absolute control of the military by appointing him as Commander-in-Chief of <b>the</b> <b>Armed</b> <b>Forces</b> <b>and</b> Chairman of the Defence Council.|$|E
5|$|The emperor was {{the supreme}} head of government. He {{appointed}} {{all of the}} highest-ranking officials in central, provincial, commandery, and county administrations.

5|$|By January 1967, Suharto felt {{confident}} that he had removed all significant support for Sukarno within <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> the MPRS decided to hold another session to impeach Sukarno. On 22 February 1967, Sukarno announced he would resign from the presidency, and on 12 March, the MPRS session stripped him of his remaining power and named Suharto acting president. Sukarno was placed under house arrest in Bogor Palace; little more was heard from him, and he died in June 1970. On 27 March 1968, the MPRS appointed Suharto {{for the first of}} his five-year terms as President.|$|E

He was responsible for much of the Polish internal and foreign policies. He is considered to be one of the most prominent statesmen in Polish history.|$|E

5|$|Political parties {{gather in}} the National Assembly, which {{consists}} of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote.

The president serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> has the authority to return a bill for further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved especially true in the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E

According to the constitution, the President is commander-in-chief of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> in case of immediate threat during wartime he issues orders directly to the General Staff.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister took {{other steps}} to deter Hitler from aggression. He doubled {{the size of}} the Territorial Army, created a Ministry of Supply to {{expedite}} the provision of equipment to <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> instituted peacetime conscription. The Italian invasion of Albania on 7 April 1939 led to guarantees being given to Greece and Romania. On 17 June 1939, Handley Page received an order for 200 Hampden twin-engined medium bombers, and by 3 September 1939, the chain of radar stations girdling the British coast was fully operational.|$|E
5|$|The monarch {{also has}} power to {{exercise}} her prerogative over {{the granting of}} honours, the regulation of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the monarch is still the person who technically awards them. Exceptions to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the monarch has complete discretion to grant. In relation to the armed forces, the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes {{do not apply to}} the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The prerogative empowers the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible. The monarch also exerts a certain influence power on His or Her weekly and closed conversations with the Prime-Minister of the United Kingdom.|$|E

He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 Barbirolli {{made another}} Atlantic crossing, {{avoiding}} {{death by a}} fluke: he changed flights with the actor Leslie Howard when the latter wished to postpone his own flight for a few days. Barbirolli's plane landed safely; Howard's was shot down. In Manchester, Barbirolli immediately set about reviving the Hallé. The number of players in the orchestra was down to about 30. Most younger players were serving in <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> to compound the shortage {{the management of the}} orchestra had ended the arrangement by which many of its players were also members of the BBC Northern Orchestra. The Hallé board resolved that its orchestra must follow the example of the Liverpool Philharmonic, which the Hallé's former conductor Malcolm Sargent had transformed into a full-time, permanent orchestra. Only four of the players shared with the BBC chose to join the Hallé.|$|E
5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> sole designator of official nominees {{appointed to the}} top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and {{institutions such as the}} court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept the advice of his ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner {{took office}} as {{president}} of Argentina on 25 May 2003. Contrary to tradition, the ceremony {{was held at the}} Palace of the Argentine National Congress rather than Casa Rosada. He announced that he would spearhead change on many issues, from politics to culture. The ceremony was attended by the provincial governors, Supreme Court president Julio Nazareno, the heads of <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces,</b> <b>and</b> Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Raúl Alfonsín was the only former president in attendance. Kirchner walked to the Casa Rosada along Avenida de Mayo, breaking with protocol to get close to the people, and was accidentally hit {{in the head with a}} camera.|$|E
5|$|Registered merchants {{were forced}} {{by law to}} wear white-colored clothes, an {{indication}} of their low status, and could be singled out for conscription into <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> forced to resettle in lands to the deep south where malaria {{was known to be}} prevalent. In contrast, itinerant merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered itinerant merchants who Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, members {{helped to}} sponsor job training, reading enrichment, {{heritage}} and youth programs. By encouraging youth to improve math, science, and reading skills, the sorority continued {{a legacy of}} community service and pledged to enrich the lives of others. Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called Fashionetta. Politically, ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving equality in <b>the</b> <b>armed</b> <b>forces</b> <b>and</b> public places. The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education. However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.|$|E
