25|$|Globalization (or globalisation; see {{spelling}} differences) is {{the increasing}} interaction of people through {{the growth of the}} international flow of money, ideas and culture. Globalization is primarily an economic process of integration which has social and cultural aspects as well.

After a partnership with Microsoft and market struggles, its mobile phone business was eventually bought by the former, with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014. After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its <b>telecommunications</b> <b>infrastructure</b> business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French-American telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).

40|$|Across nine {{transition}} economies, {{it is the}} young, educated, English-speaking {{workers with}} the best access to local <b>telecommunications</b> <b>infrastructures</b> that work with computers. These workers earn about 25 % more than do workers of comparable observable skills who do not use computers. Controlling for likely simultaneity between computer use at work and labor market earnings makes the apparent returns to computer use disappear. These results are corroborated using Russian longitudinal data on earnings and computer use on the job. High costs of computer use in transition economies suppress wages that firms can pay their workers who use computers. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{demand for}} {{telephones}} was ever increasing {{and in the}} 1990s Indian government was under increasing pressure {{to open up the}} telecom sector for private investment as a part of Liberalisation-Privatisation-Globalisation policies that the government had to accept to overcome the severe fiscal crisis and resultant balance of payments issue in 1991. Consequently, private investment in the sector of Value Added Services (VAS) was allowed and cellular telecom sector were opened up for competition from private investments. It was during this period that the Narsimha Rao-led government introduced the National Telecommunications policy (NTP) in 1994 which brought changes in the following areas: ownership, service and regulation of <b>telecommunications</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The policy introduced the concept of telecommunication for all and its vision was to expand the telecommunication facilities to all the villages in India. Liberalisation in the basic telecom sector was also envisaged in this policy. They were also successful in establishing joint ventures between state owned telecom companies and international players. Foreign firms were eligible to 49% of the total stake. The multi-nationals were just involved in technology transfer, and not policy making.|$|E
