Particularly important is the ability <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> iron, which is the function of iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and ferritin. Selenium and zinc are {{commonly referred to as}} antioxidant nutrients, but these chemical elements have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions {{provoked}} a Royalist purge of Venizelist officers and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>sequester</b> Clayton {{from the}} {{affairs in the}} state, the Brindles and the Democrats decided {{the only thing they}} could do was elect him to the US Senate. However, even though he won unanimously, he refused to take his seat, which would mean letting Johnson become governor. In 1871, the state House of Representatives drafted {{articles}} of impeachment against Clayton, charging him {{with a wide variety of}} impeachable actions, including depriving Johnson and several other state officials of offices to which they had been fairly elected, removing state officials and judges from offices to which they had been fairly elected, aiding in fraudulent elections, taking bribes for state railroad bonds, and various other high crimes and misdemeanors. The members of the House then tried to suspend Clayton from his duties as governor by force. They even apparently tried locking him in his office and nailing the door shut. However, Clayton responded that they had no right by the state constitution to deprive him of his office. At the same time, the House also brought impeachment charges against Chief Justice John McClure for his part in trying to deny Johnson the privileges of his office of lieutenant governor.|$|E

5|$|Dole and {{his allies}} in the {{legislature}} used the coin issuance {{as a means of}} attacking the government, accusing Gibson and others of disobeying the laws, and demanding information on Spreckels' profits, which the government stated was about three percent after costs such as transport and insurance were calculated. The political fallout of the coinage was the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. The Currency Act of 1884, passed after the election, restricted acceptance of silver coin as payment to debts under $10, and limited the exchange of silver for gold at the treasury to $150,000 a month. The new silver coins were expected to flow into the Treasury in exchange for gold under this arrangement, but the government refused to implement the law until forced to by the Supreme Court. To avoid a financial panic, major private banks and businesses agreed to exchange gold for the new silver coins, in which there was little public confidence. But in February 1885, faced with a government refusal to pay out gold (of which the Treasury was almost bare), the private businesses stopped this arrangement. Negotiations followed, and the government reluctantly agreed <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> more than $550,000 of the coins in a special account to back the banknotes then in circulation. Although this left the government with little liquidity, the increased confidence in its finances allowed it to borrow on a short-term basis. By mid-1885, sugar prices were rising, and prosperity was returning to the islands. Greater amounts of gold flowed into the islands, balancing the silver that was already there, and stabilizing the monetary situation. The Kalākaua coins became more acceptable, and by 1888, most of the non-US foreign silver had been exchanged for them. They remained in circulation during the turbulent years of the 1890s in Hawaii, as the monarchy fell and the short-lived republic ended in 1898 with annexation to the United States. Despite the urging of local interests, it was not until 1903 that Congress acted, ordering that the Hawaii silver coins be exchanged by January 1, 1904, or lose status as legal tender. By 1907, coins worth about $814,000 of the $1,000,000 originally issued had been redeemed; they were exchanged for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.|$|E

By ingesting a large amount of plants in the genus Asclepias, primarily milkweed, monarch caterpillars are able <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> cardiac glycosides, or more specifically cardenolides, which are steroids that act in heart-arresting ways similar to digitalis. It has been found that monarchs are able <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> cardenolides most effectively from plants of intermediate cardenolide content rather than those of high or low content.|$|E

5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{composition}} and timing of delivery, iron infusions could preferentially favor certain species and alter surface ecosystems to unknown effect. Population explosions of jellyfish, that disturb the food chain impacting whale populations or fisheries is unlikely as iron fertilization experiments that are conducted in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll waters favor the growth of larger diatoms over small flagellates. This {{has been shown to}} lead to increased abundance of fish and whales over jellyfish. A 2010 study showed that iron enrichment stimulates toxic diatom production in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll areas [...] which, the authors argue, raises [...] "serious concerns over the net benefit and sustainability of large-scale iron fertilizations". Nitrogen released by cetaceans and iron chelate are a significant benefit to the marine food chain in addition <b>to</b> <b>sequestering</b> carbon for long periods of time.|$|R
40|$|A new {{mechanism}} to control Planck-scale corrections to the inflationary eta parameter is pro-posed. A common {{approach to the}} eta problem is to impose a shift symmetry on the inflaton field. However, this symmetry has to remain unbroken by Planck-scale effects, which is a rather strong requirement on possible ultraviolet completions of the theory. In this paper, we show that {{the breaking of the}} shift symmetry by Planck-scale corrections can be systematically suppressed if the inflaton field interacts with a conformal sector. The inflaton then receives an anomalous dimension in the conformal field theory, which leads <b>to</b> <b>sequestering</b> of all dangerous high-energy corrections. We analyze a number of models where the mechanism can be seen in action. In our most detailed example we compute the exact anomalous dimensions via a-maximization and show that the eta problem can be solved using only weakly-coupled physics. ar X i...|$|R
25|$|The innate immune {{response}} to the AAV vectors has been characterised in animal models.

Both soluble factor levels and cell infiltration appear to return to baseline within six hours. By contrast, more aggressive viruses produce innate responses lasting 24 hours or longer.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{powered by}} batteries are another alternative, and these {{have the advantage}} of having the highest well-to-wheels efficiency rate of any energy pathway and thus would allow much greater numbers of vehicles than any other methods. In addition, even if the electricity was sourced from coal-fired power plants, two advantages would remain: first it is cheaper <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> carbon from a few thousand smokestacks than it is to retrofit hundreds of millions of vehicles, and second encouraging the use of electric vehicles allows a further pathway for scaling up of renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{is a consequence}} of a female-biased operational sex ratio. This means that at any given time, there are more females than males seeking to copulate. This occurs because males lose up to 11% of their body mass during mating and once they are done mating, they need time <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> resources {{that will allow them to}} deliver a spermatophore to the next female they mate with. On the contrary, females do not need time to prepare for their next copulation. Due to the unequal mating rates, males become valuable to females and female-to-female competition rises dramatically as a consequence.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCarbon dioxide {{capture and}} storage by {{mineralization}} (CCSM), {{also known as}} ex-situ mineralization, is an important technology for industrial CCS. The integration of CO 2 capture using aqueous ammonia with ex-situ mineralisation avoids stripping CO 2 as pure gas from absorbents and compression of c, and therefore, potentially reduces the high energy consumption of capture. It {{was found that the}} solid liquid ratio has a large influence on the energy consumption cost. Therefore, in this study, two different solid liquid ratios values were used for evaluating the OPEX in terms of energy consumption, chemical costs and feedstock cost. The results show that the total cost <b>to</b> <b>sequestering</b> 1 t CO 2 is 100 US$ and 119 US$ for the 50 and at 300 g/l case, respectivelt. Using low solid to liquid ratio (50 g/l) resulted in large streams in the process, and thus resulting in a high energy consumption. However, high solid to liquid ratio (300 g/l) decreases the dissolution and carbonation efficiencies...|$|R

The MIT report also states that “the priority objective with respect to coal should be the successful large-scale demonstration of the technical, economic, and environmental performance of the technologies that make up all of the major components of a large-scale integrated CCS system — capture, transportation and storage.” An injection field test similar to this was done in Norway.|$|E
25|$|Managing CO2 levels was a {{particular}} challenge, {{and a source of}} controversy regarding the Biosphere 2 project's alleged misrepresentation to the public. Daily fluctuation of carbon dioxide dynamics was typically 600 ppm because of the strong drawdown during sunlight hours by plant photosynthesis, followed by a similar rise during the nighttime when system respiration dominated. As expected, there was also a strong seasonal signature to CO2 levels, with wintertime levels as high as 4,000-4,500 ppm and summertime levels near 1,000 ppm. The crew worked to manage the CO2 by occasionally turning on a CO2 scrubber, activating and de-activating the desert and savannah through control of irrigation water, cutting and storing biomass <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> carbon, and utilizing all potential planting areas with fast-growing species to increase system photosynthesis. In November 1991, investigative reporting in the Village Voice alleged that the crew had secretly installed the CO2 scrubber device, violating Biosphere 2's advertised goal of recycling all materials naturally.|$|E
500|$|Marine primary producers—plants and {{microscopic}} {{organisms in}} the plankton—are widespread and very diverse. Microscopic photosynthetic algae, phytoplankton, contribute a {{larger proportion of}} the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. About 45 percent of the sea's primary production of living material is contributed by diatoms. Much larger algae, commonly known as seaweeds, are important locally; Sargassum forms floating drifts, while kelp form seabed forests. Flowering plants in the form of seagrasses grow in [...] "meadows" [...] in sandy shallows, mangroves line the coast in tropical and subtropical regions, and salt-tolerant plants thrive in regularly inundated salt marshes.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{published}} literature on potential membrane fouling components, available cleaning agents and possible interactions between cleaning agents and fouling components. It also lists the cleaning models {{available in the}} literature, and evaluates {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of these models. Based on this outcome, a new cleaning model is proposed to capture cleaning dynamics for 10 different cleaning agents, varying from acidic, alkali and oxidizing <b>to</b> <b>sequestering</b> agents and detergents that were used to clean dead-end ultra filtration membranes fouled by surface water. The model is effectively fitted to the experimental data of the different cleanings. Two criteria are subsequently introduced to quantify the overall cleaning effect of a cleaning agent in terms of cleaning rate and cleaning effectiveness. For membranes fouled by surface water with high organic content it was found that caustic-and oxidizing cleaning agents give the best overall cleaning results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

500|$|Chemical defences are {{widespread}} and are mostly based on chemicals of plant origin. In {{many cases the}} plants themselves evolved these toxic substances as protection against herbivores. Butterflies have evolved mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>sequester</b> these plant toxins and use them instead in their own defence. These defence mechanisms are effective {{only if they are}} well advertised; this has led to the evolution of bright colours in unpalatable butterflies (aposematism). This signal is commonly mimicked by other butterflies, usually only females. [...] A Batesian mimic imitates another species to enjoy the protection of that species' aposematism. The common Mormon of India has female morphs which imitate the unpalatable red-bodied swallowtails, the common rose and the crimson rose. Müllerian mimicry occurs when aposematic species evolve to resemble each other, presumably to reduce predator sampling rates; Heliconius butterflies from the Americas are a good example.|$|E
500|$|The {{mainland}} shorelines {{are dominated}} by a marshy transitional zone chiefly populated by red mangrove and black mangrove growing from the shallow water, with white mangrove growing farther back from the water's edge. [...] The trees' aerial root structure provides a sheltered habitat for crabs, fish and wading birds. The brown waters within the mangrove thickets are nurseries for fish, mollusc and crustacean larvae that require a quiet sheltered environment before the immature animals can disperse into open waters. Mangroves shed leaves at about [...] per year, providing food for fish, worms and crustaceans.

40|$|The Filoviridae {{family of}} viruses, which {{includes}} the genera Ebolavirus (EBOV) and Marburgvirus (MARV), causes severe and often times lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans. Filoviral infections are associated with ineffective innate antiviral responses {{as a result of}} virally encoded immune antagonists, which render the host incapable of mounting effective innate or adaptive immune responses. The Type I interferon (IFN) response is critical for establishing an antiviral state in the host cell and subsequent activation of the adaptive immune responses. Several filoviral encoded components target Type I IFN responses, and this innate immune suppression is important for viral replication and pathogenesis. For example, EBOV VP 35 inhibits the phosphorylation of IRF- 3 / 7 by the TBK- 1 /IKKε kinases in addition <b>to</b> <b>sequestering</b> viral RNA from detection by RIG-I like receptors. MARV VP 40 inhibits STAT 1 / 2 phosphorylation by inhibiting the JAK family kinases. EBOV VP 24 inhibits nuclear translocation of activated STAT 1 by karyopherin-α.
