25|$|Si–C {{bonds are}} {{commonly}} formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often {{carried out in}} small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium, Grignard, or organoaluminium reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic copper as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>cyclic</b> oligomers or linear polymers.|$|E

The CpFe(CO)22 is also an effective precatalyst, requiring photolytic activation.

40|$|B oronic acids can {{interact}} with Lewis bases to generate boronate anions,and {{they can also}} bind with diol units <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>cyclic</b> boronate esters. Boronic acid based receptor designs originated when Lorand and Edwards used the pH drop observed upon the addition of saccharides to boronic acids to determine their association constants. The inherent acidity of the boronic acid is enhanced when 1, 2 -, 1, 3 -, or 1, 4 -diols react with boronic acids <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>cyclic</b> boronic esters (5, 6, or 7 membered rings) in aqueous media, and these interactions form the cornerstone of diol-based receptors used in the construc-tion of sensors and separation systems. In addition, the recognition of saccharides through boronic acid complex (or boronic ester) formation often relies {{on an interaction between}} a Lewis acidic boronic acid and a Lewis base (proximal tertiary amine or anion). These properties of boronic acids have led to them being exploited in sensing and separation systems for anions (Lewis bases) and saccharides (diols) ...|$|E
