5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown {{to a third of}} their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers <b>then</b> <b>push</b> out the old ones before finishing their growth.|$|E
5|$|As the US X Corps {{was pushing}} towards the reservoir, the Chinese {{formulated}} their strategy, {{based on their}} experiences in the Chinese Civil War. Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence {{would be at the}} reservoir, the Chinese 9th Corps Army was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, <b>then</b> <b>push</b> towards Hagaru-ri. Believing the bulk of the US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Army would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for the battle, with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.|$|E
5|$|The bear follows {{and climbs}} {{on top of}} the Jeep, smashing up the car and {{eventually}} overturning it before leaving as the sun sets. Sean wakes up and tells them about the hunting paraphernalia, crying about wanting to go home before he dies. Wes and Lauren turn the Jeep right side up, load him back in the car, <b>then</b> <b>push</b> the Jeep down the hilly road as a thunderstorm hits. Using the downward momentum and occasionally pushing, they arrive near the buildings. While Lauren is exploring the building with the trap, the bear swings at her through a window sending her back against the trap, which impales her back. She returns to the vehicle where the bear rips off the tailgate and drags away Sean's body.|$|E

5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes <b>then</b> <b>push</b> it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} plan for Juno {{was divided into}} two main sectors: Mike (west) and Nan (east). Mike Sector would be attacked by the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade, with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, The Canadian Scottish Regiment and the 1st Hussars in support. The 7th Brigade was to take Courseulles and drive inland. Nan Sector would be assaulted by the Regina Rifle Regiment of 7th Brigade, {{as well as the}} North Shore Regiment and the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada of the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade, while tanks of the Fort Garry Horse provided armoured support; a squadron of specialized Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) from the British 79th Armoured Division would land on each beach sector as well. The 8th Brigade was to capture Bernières and the western edge of Saint-Aubin, <b>then</b> <b>push</b> south into Normandy. The {{operational plan}} also called for the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade and the Sherbrooke Fusiliers to be deployed to Juno as reinforcements within 4 to 6 hours of the initial assault. By nightfall of D-Day, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division was slated to have captured the high ground west of Caen, the Bayeux–Caen railway line, and the seaside towns of Courseulles, Bernières, Saint-Aubin and Bény-sur-Mer.|$|E
25|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{handling}} hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and <b>then</b> <b>push</b> the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole <b>then</b> <b>push</b> the hook out the way it came in.|$|E

25|$|New {{research}} {{has revealed that}} a kangaroos tail acts as a third leg rather than just a balancing strut. Kangaroos have a unique three-stage walk where they plant their front legs and tail first, <b>then</b> <b>push</b> off their tail, followed lastly by the back legs. The propulsive force of the tail is {{equal to that of}} both the front and hind legs combined and performs as much work as what a human leg walking can at the same speed.|$|E
25|$|When {{a sailor}} falls and must recover to a sailing position, the boom is {{sometimes}} used {{in one of}} the initial steps of performing a waterstart. When the sail is first lifted from the water, it often helps to push the back of the board slightly underwater, and then setting the front of the boom onto the board (near the footstraps). The buoyancy of the board will <b>then</b> <b>push</b> the boom upward, helping to lift the sail out of the water.|$|E

25|$|It formed {{part of the}} Australian {{pursuit of}} the Japanese towards the beachheads around Buna and Gona, {{following}} the abandonment of plans to capture Port Moresby. The Australians took heavy casualties as part of efforts to advance north to re-take Kokoda and <b>then</b> <b>push</b> on towards Oivi and Gorari in November. Eora Creek village and Templeton's Crossing had also been {{the site of a}} battle from August – September 1942, as the Australian forces were forced to retire toward Port Moresby by the advancing Japanese.|$|E
25|$|During a waterstart, {{a sailor}} clears the sail {{of water and}} powers {{it up in the}} wind. The powered sail then pulls the sailor out of the water enough so they could step up and onto the board. When the sail is first being lifted, it often helps to push the back of the board {{slightly}} underwater, and setting the front of the boom onto the board (near the footstraps). The buoyancy of the board will <b>then</b> <b>push</b> the boom upward, helping to lift the sail out of the water.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 1940, the Wehrmacht {{launched}} {{the invasion of}} France and the Low Countries. The {{first phase of the}} invasion Fall Gelb called for an invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium in which the Germans correctly predicted the French and British Forces would <b>then</b> <b>push</b> into Belgium to stop advances into France. Gelb would then deliver the main blow, as most of the German armoured divisions would strike through the Ardennes and cut off the Allied forces in northern France, leaving {{the rest of the country}} defenseless.|$|E
50|$|It {{was briefly}} in the line outside Metz, holding {{defensive}} positions, but was withdrawn on 7 November (being replaced by the 818th Tank Destroyer Battalion), and moved northwards to join the 90th Infantry Division. It crossed the Moselle {{for the third time}} north of Metz on the 12th, helping shore up a fragile bridgehead, <b>then</b> <b>pushed</b> south; on the 19th, elements of the battalion linked up with the 5th Infantry Division, sealing off the Metz garrison, <b>then</b> <b>pushed</b> east towards the Saar River.|$|R

25|$|The {{mole plow}} allows {{underdrainage}} {{to be installed}} without trenches, or it breaks up deep impermeable soil layers which impede drainage. It is a very deep plow, with a torpedo-shaped or wedge-shaped tip, and a narrow blade connecting this to the body. When dragged through the ground, it leaves a channel deep under the ground, and this acts as a drain. Modern mole plow may also bury a flexible perforated plastic drain pipe as they go, making a more permanent drain– {{or they may be}} used to lay pipes for water supply or other purposes. A simple check can be made to find if the subsoil is in the right condition for mole ploughing. Compact a tennis ball sized sample taken at moling depth by hand, <b>then</b> <b>push</b> a pencil through. If the hole remains intact without splitting the ball the soil is in an ideal condition for the mole plough.|$|E
25|$|Braddock's {{expedition}} {{was part}} of a massive British offensive against the French in North America that summer. As commander-in-chief of the British Army in America, General Braddock led the main thrust against the Ohio Country with a column some 2,100 strong. His command consisted of two regular line regiments, the 44th and 48th with about 1,350 men, along with about 500 regular soldiers and militiamen from several British American colonies, and artillery and other support troops. With these men, Braddock expected to seize Fort Duquesne easily, and <b>then</b> <b>push</b> on to capture a series of French forts, eventually reaching Fort Niagara. George Washington, then just 23, knew the territory and served as a volunteer aide-de-camp to General Braddock. Braddock's Chief of Scouts was Lieutenant John Fraser of the Virginia Regiment. Fraser owned land at Turtle Creek, had been at Fort Necessity, and had served as Second-in-Command at Fort Prince George (renamed Fort Duquesne by the French), at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1993, drug {{trafficking}} charges against Ovidio and Ponce Torres were {{dropped in the}} U.S without a stated reason. On May 3, 1994, Aldrete was sentenced to 62 years in prison. Cult members Elio, Serafín Jr., Martínez Salinas, and Serna Valdez, received 67 years each. In {{an interview with the}} press, Kilroy's parents stated that they were relieved to hear that the cultists were sentenced. The charges were multiple homicide (31 years), possession of narcotics (12 years), involvement in organized crime (5 years), police impersonation (2 years), illegal body desecration (2 years), illegal possession of firearms (10 years), and illegal possession of weapons exclusive to the Mexican Armed Forces (5 years). The Mexican federal judge explained that the reason Aldrete received fewer years in prison than the rest was because she was not charged with using weapons that were military-exclusive, which carries a 5-year maximum sentence. He also stated that the maximum conviction a person in Mexico can receive for capital murder is 50 years. Since Mexico's judicial system does not have parole, it allows for prisoners to file motions at an appeal court to reduce their sentences after several years. If this condition is denied or granted, inmates can <b>then</b> <b>push</b> for a writ of amparo.|$|E

25|$|The advance resumed on 2 October, {{with the}} 1st Bavarian Reserve Division in the south, attacking through Brebières to St. Laurent and the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division to advance via Izel and Oppy to Bailleul-Sir-Berthoult. It was {{known that the}} French 70th Reserve Division was moving south-east, also towards Bailleul and Lens. The French {{advanced}} with a left flank guard facing Douai, to link with the 77th Division at Gavrelle and Fresnes. The French divisions had been rushed from the Vosges and were also deployed at short notice. A brigade of the 70th Reserve Division moved towards Fresnes and one advanced south-west to Gavrelle, ready to pause on 2 October and <b>then</b> <b>push</b> outposts southwards. The French moved south in parallel brigade columns, as the Germans moved west in divisional columns. Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade 9 of the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, reached Esquerchin and set flank guards facing north, before advancing on Quiéry la Motte, when French artillery near Izel pinned down the German infantry and destroyed a German artillery battery. French infantry then attacked from Drocourt and forced the German columns to deploy and work forward closer to Izel, to try to overrun the artillery. Bavarian Reserve Infantry Brigade 11 advanced on Beaumont, Drocourt and Bois-Bernard, moving the rearguard round to the right flank, which arrived {{just in time to}} meet a French attack from Hénin Liétard. Both German brigades attacked again and captured Izel, the heights east of Bois-Bernard and Beaumont Station. Later in the evening Drocourt and Fresnoy were captured and Bois-Bernard was entered, being captured by dawn on 3 October.|$|E
500|$|On January 14, 1780, the {{regiment}} {{participated in a}} [...] "commando" [...] raid of Staten Island planned in secrecy by General Washington and led by Lord Stirling. The object of the raid was a surprise attack on the enemy at the Watering Place Redoubts and to secure provisions. Preparations for the raid called for British attention {{to be focused on}} Irvine's detachment in the vicinity of Elizabethtown, while the 2nd Canadian marched to Connecticut Farms (present-day Union). Meanwhile, Steward's detachment would advance onto Staten Island, and Stirling's forces would <b>then</b> <b>push</b> to Richmond, in the center of Staten Island, where they would surprise enemy troops.|$|E
500|$|The {{plan called}} for units to {{leapfrog}} over one another, as the advance progressed, to maintain momentum during the attack. The initial wave would capture and consolidate the Black Line and <b>then</b> <b>push</b> forward to the Red Line. The barrage would pause, to enable reserve units to move up and then move forward with the units pushing beyond the Red Line to the Blue Line. Once the corps secured the Blue Line, advancing units would once again leapfrog established ones and capture the Brown Line. Conducted properly, the plan would leave the German forces little time to exit the security of their deep dugouts and defend their positions against the infantry advance. If the corps maintained its schedule, the troops would advance as much as [...] and have {{the majority of the}} ridge under control by 1:00pm of the first day.|$|E
