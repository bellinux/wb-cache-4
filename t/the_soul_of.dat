5|$|Blackwyche is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Ultimate Play the Game for the Commodore 64 in 1985. The game is the third instalment of the Pendragon series and is a sequel to Entombed. In the game, aristocrat adventurer Sir Arthur Pendragon is trapped on board a haunted galleon and must free <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> its captain. The game is presented in a 3D isometric format.|$|E
5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> Hades imbues the Blades with purple flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E

To save their jobs, Rao makes up a far-fetched story that Mary is possessed by <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> a Christian woman named after the mother of Jesus. Gopalam lies that he will marry Sita off to Rao. Raju, like Gopalam, is unaware of Rao's deception. In love with Sita, he wants to keep Rao away from her and turns to Mary for help in {{teaching}} music (which ends in disaster). At the end of their first month at the school, Rao and Mary receive their salaries and Mary repays her debt.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik {{with the belief that}} <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the deceased will pray for them in Heaven. The visitor usually sits beside the grave to write his kvitel and meditate on his request, and then tears the kvitel and throws it on top of the grave. Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church teaches that, {{immediately}} after death, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> each person {{will receive a}} particular judgement from God, based on their sins {{and their relationship to}} Christ. This teaching also attests to another day when Christ will sit in universal judgement of all mankind. This final judgement, according to the church's teaching, will bring an end to human history and mark the beginning of both a new and better heaven and earth ruled by God in righteousness.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player off-screen, thus killing him.|$|E
5|$|The last Hindu {{function}} for Hell-based reincarnations is the text Preta khanda in the Garuda Purana used by Hindu priests during Śrāddha rituals. During these rituals, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> a dying or deceased individual is given safe passage {{into the next}} life. This ritual {{is directly related to}} the economic prosperity of Hindu priests and their ability to “save” the dying soul from a hellish reincarnation through gifts given on behalf of the deceased to the priest performing the ritual. With each gift given, crimes committed during the deceased's life are forgiven and the next life is progressively improved.|$|E

50|$|Youdu is {{the home}} or {{official}} residence of various deities, and also the location of their official offices or palaces. <b>The</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead are their fellow inhabitants and subjects. There are also many subordinate demons which serve {{to carry out the}} commands of the judges. Many of these are concerned with punishing or processing <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead for reincarnation. The sovereign deity is generally considered to be King Yama. Beneath him in rank ten other kings serve as judges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead.|$|R
5|$|According to Hinduism, {{the souls}} of three {{preceding}} generations of one's ancestor reside in Pitru–loka, a realm between heaven and earth. This realm is governed by Yama, the god of death, who takes <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> a dying man from earth to Pitru–loka. When a person {{of the next generation}} dies, the first generation shifts to heaven and unites with God, so Shraddha offerings are not given. Thus, only the three generations in Pitru–loka are given Shraddha rites, in which Yama plays a significant role. According to the sacred Hindu epics, at the beginning of Pitru Paksha, the sun enters the zodiac sign of Libra (Tula). Coinciding with this moment, it is believed that the spirits leave Pitru–loka and reside in their descendants' homes for a month until the sun enters the next zodiacScorpio (Vrichchhika)and there is a full moon. Hindus are expected to propitiate the ancestors in the first half, during the dark fortnight.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, <b>The</b> <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom {{until the end of}} ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E
