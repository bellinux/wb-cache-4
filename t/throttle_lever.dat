5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{concluded the}} accident sequence {{began when the}} check pilot, while the aircraft was on the ground, retarded the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> for No. 4 engine past the idle position, and therefore reversed the propellers of that engine. Once the airplane took off and started banking to the right, {{it would have been}} a natural reaction for one of the flight crew to increase power to No. 4 engine, thinking that by doing so the engine would start producing positive thrust and the aircraft could be recovered. However, since the metal flag was not raised, there was no electrical power to the rotating mechanismsand increasing power to No. 4 engine would only have created more reverse thrust.|$|E
25|$|As {{he moved}} about the {{locomotive}} works of New England gathering experience and {{an eye for}} engineering detail, he also produced his first book, The <b>Throttle</b> <b>Lever.</b> Designed as {{an introduction to the}} steam locomotive, this became the standard U.S. textbook on building locomotives. It not only took Colburn, then not 20, deeper into the world of publishing, but also earned him wider respect amongst railroad men across America – locomotive builders and train operators.|$|E
50|$|The {{dual control}} <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> are {{situated}} between the legs, and pivot {{from side to}} side so can be folded out of the way making entry and exit of the aircraft easier.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{had been}} flown {{for a long}} time with a throttle problem. The pilots had a higher workload because they had to operate the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> for the left and right engines independently.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} column {{passes through the}} straight dashboard and spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> worked in sectors inside the wheel rim. All main bearing were lubricated by a force feed lubricator, located {{in front of the}} dashboard. Sight glasses were attached to the left-hand side of the engine.|$|R
25|$|The second non-fatal {{incident}} occurred on 14 January 1969. It involved a BUA mainline BAC One-Eleven 201AC (registration: G-ASJJ) operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Milan's Linate Airport to London Gatwick. This {{was the same}} aircraft BUA had used to operate the One-Eleven's inaugural revenue service. On {{the day of the}} accident, the aircraft had been diverted to Linate on the outbound flight because of fog at Genoa's Cristoforo Colombo Airport. A normal take-off run was followed by a bang immediately after the aircraft had become airborne. The captain in the jumpseat who was supervising the co-pilot at the time thought that there was a problem with the no. 1 engine. He advised the pilot in command to close the throttle a short while later. The pilot in command followed this advice and lowered the nose pitch from 12 to six degrees. The engine shutdown was accompanied by an decrease in airspeed from 140 knots (161mph/ 259km/h to 115 kn (132mph / 212km/h). Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair in the resulting forced landing on snow-covered sand about two miles from the end of runway 18, there were no fatalities among the 33 occupants (seven crew and 26 passengers) though there were two serious injuries. The accident investigators concluded that this crash was caused by the crew failing to recognise their mistake, which had resulted in shutting down the wrong engine (no. 1) in error following a compressor bang/surge in the no. 2 engine. In addition, the crew did not notice that an inadvertent movement of the relevant <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> had partially reduced the no. 2 engine's thrust.|$|E
2500|$|A miswired {{flight control}} system led to two minor {{injuries}} when the left nacelle struck the ground while the aircraft was hovering [...] in the air, causing it to bounce and catch fire on 11 June 1991. [...] The pilot, Grady Wilson, suspected {{that he may have}} accidentally set the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> the opposite direction to that intended, exacerbating the crash if not causing it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crew were}} trying to manage the {{situation}} they were facing. The Captain then asked the First Officer {{if one of the}} ground crews had tampered with the panel near the plane's rear door, and subsequently stated that [...] "the guy" [...] had problems and was pissed at them. The flight continued to Lagos and the crew continued to discuss the problem they were facing. They noticed that there were differences on the EPR value on the engines. The crew also noticed that there was no response from the left engine when they advanced the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> thus concluded that the left engine was inoperative. The crew decided to start their descent towards Lagos. As a failure on the left engine occurred, the crew should have looked at their Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and followed procedures accordingly, but failed to do so.|$|E
50|$|The 1904 {{model was}} a larger touring car. Equipped with a rear {{entrance}} tonneau body, it could seat 5 passengers and sold for US$3500. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-4, {{situated at the}} front of the car, produced 24hp (17.9kW). A 3-speed sliding transmission was fitted. The channel steel-framed car weighed 2350lb (1066kg). This modern Système Panhard car had spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> on steering wheel, a novelty at the time.|$|R

50|$|On August 11, 2010 fifteen {{people were}} injured as a train entered a curve at the park going between 12 and 17 mph, causing {{five of the six}} cars to tip over. An {{investigation}} determined the operator was not adequately trained in steam locomotive operation which resulted in confusion of the brake and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers.</b> The state fined Tiny Town $30,500 consisting of $1000 per incident the operator operated the train and $500 for not having documented training of emergency and safety procedures.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "black boxes", {{the flight}} data {{recorder}} (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), along with the quick access recorder (QAR), were recovered from the aircraft {{within hours of the}} accident, and transported to the AAIB's Farnborough headquarters, some thirty miles from Heathrow. The information downloaded from these devices confirmed what the crew had already told the investigators, that the engines had not responded when the throttles were advanced during final approach.Recorded data indicates that an adequate fuel quantity was on board the aircraft and that the autothrottle and engine control commands were performing as expected prior to, and after, the reduction in thrust.All possible scenarios that could explain the thrust reduction and continued lack of response of the engines to <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> inputs are being examined, in close co-operation with Boeing, Rolls Royce and British Airways. This work includes a detailed analysis and examination of the complete fuel flow path from the aircraft tanks to the engine fuel nozzles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{throttles}} {{were pulled}} back to idle thrust {{to slow the}} aircraft to descend and acquire the glideslope, but the autothrottle unexpectedly reverted to [...] "retard" [...] mode, {{which is designed to}} automatically decrease thrust shortly before touching down on the runway at [...] above runway height. At 144 kt, the pilots manually increased thrust to sustain that speed, but the autothrottle immediately returned the thrust lever to idle power because the first officer did not hold the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> in position. The throttles remained at idle for about 100 seconds while the aircraft slowed to , [...] below reference speed as the aircraft descended below the required height to stay on the glideslope. The stick-shaker activated at about [...] above the ground, indicating an imminent stall, the autothrottle advanced, and the captain attempted to apply full power. The engines responded, but there was not enough altitude or forward airspeed to recover, and the aircraft hit the ground tail-first at [...]|$|E
2500|$|The newly fitted Daimler-Benz DB 605A {{engine was}} a {{development}} of the DB 601E engine utilised by the preceding Bf 109 F-4; displacement and compression ratio were increased {{as well as other}} detail improvements to ease large-scale mass production. Takeoff and emergency power of 1,475PS (1,455hp, 1,085kW) was achieved with 1.42atm (42.5 inches/6.17lbs) of boost at 2,800rpm. The DB 605 suffered from reliability problems {{during the first year of}} operation, and this output was initially banned by VT-Anw.Nr.2206, forcing Luftwaffe units to limit maximum power output to 1,310PS (1,292hp, 964kW) at 2,600rpm and 1.3atm manifold pressure (38.9 inches/4.4lbs). The full output was not reinstated until 8 June 1943 when Daimler-Benz issued a technical directive. Up to 1944, the G-series was powered by the 1,475 PS Daimler-Benz DB 605 driving a three-blade VDM 9-12087A variable-pitch propeller with a diameter of [...] with even broader blades than used on the F-series. Pitch control, as on the 109F, was either electro-mechanical (automatic) or manual-electric using a thumb-switch on the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever.</b> From 1944 a new high-altitude propeller with broader blades was introduced, designated VDM 9-12159, and was fitted to high-altitude variants with the DB 605AS or D-series engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{hand-operated}} {{gear and}} rear-wheel brake controls {{are on the}} driver's right {{but there is a}} door for the driver which there was not on the 30-98 or 25. The spark and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> are on the steering wheel together with an air lever working a valve in the induction pipe (after the throttle). There is also a mixture control (choke) on the dash. Gear and brake levers are well to hand. Accelerator and (transmission) brake pedals were set close together.|$|R
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce forward thrust, enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{inspected}} {{the wreckage of}} Flight 3130 and {{found that there was}} not a single indication of a rotation on the propeller during the crash. Further inspection on the wreckage revealed that the propeller, mixture and <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> were all the way back. This indicated that the engine might have not running at the time of the crash. The engine could have been shut down by Captain Abdul. There are three possibilities that caused the shutdown; those are engine fire, engine failure, or an emergency procedure.|$|R
60|$|The pace grew even faster. We were racing down an incline, and now, ice, station, and prairie alike were blotted {{out by a}} {{blinding}} whiteness; while presently I was flung backward off my feet, and would have fallen but that I clutched a guard-rail. The whole cab rattled, the great locomotive lurched, and a white smother hurtled under the lamp glare, until once more the motion grew even, and we could feel the well-braced frame of iron and steel leap forward beneath us. Engineer Robertson swayed easily to the oscillation as, with {{one side of his}} intent face toward me, he clutched the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> until he called hoarsely as his fingers moved along it. Then, even while the steam roared in blown-down wreaths from the lifting valve, the lever was straight at wide-open again, and I caught my breath as I made out another yellow halo with something that moved behind it in the snow ahead.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{commands}} are duplicated, {{with the}} front seat's center stick, <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> rudder pedals and brake pedals mechanically connected to the rear seat's. The rear stick and the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> can be disassembled when carrying passenger(s).|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of each lever {{can be described}} by the current angle indicated. This {{is referred to as}} the <b>Throttle</b> <b>Lever</b> Angle or TLA. The greater the TLA, the greater the engine thrust.|$|E
50|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers</b> to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust.

50|$|A Takeoff/Go-around switch (TO/GA) is {{a switch}} on the {{autothrottle}} of modern large aircraft, with two modes: takeoff (TO) and go-around (GA). The mode {{is dependent on the}} phase of flight; usually, on approach to land, the autopilot will be set to approach mode, therefore if the TO/GA switch is pressed it will activate the go-around mode of the autothrottle; conversely, when take-off is set on the autopilot, the switch activates take off mode of the autothrottle. On Boeing aircraft TO/GA modes are selected by a separate switch near the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers,</b> but on Airbus aircraft it is activated by pushing the thrust levers fully forward to the TO/GA detent.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 June 2013 - {{collided}} with Manly Wharf after a malfunction of the <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever,</b> causing major {{damage to the}} bow above the waterline, {{as well as the}} timber arrester {{at the end of the}} wharf.|$|R
50|$|The <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> {{assembly}} {{is often}} designed to incorporate high-pressure (HP) cock switches {{so that the}} pilot has instinctive control of the fuel supply to the engine. Microswitches {{are located in the}} throttle box so that the throttle levers actuate the switches to shut the valves when the levers are at their aft end of travel. Pushing the levers forward automatically operates the switches to open the fuel cocks, which remain open during the normal operating range of the levers. Two distinct actions are required to actuate the switches again. The <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> must be pulled back to its aft position and a mechanical latch operated, or a detent (hard point) overcome, to allow the lever to travel further and shut off the fuel valve.|$|E
50|$|After {{the second}} circuit Erich Warsitz set the He 178 {{up for the}} landing. The turbine responded to the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> very obediently. Just above the ground he {{corrected}} the machine’s attitude, pulled off a perfect landing {{and came to a}} halt just short of the waters of the Warnow.|$|E
50|$|So for example, if the {{throttle}} valve is {{moved up to}} let more fuel in, it will mean that {{the throttle}} valve has moved into a position which allows more fuel to flow through {{and on the other}} side, the required pressure ports are opened to keep the pressure balance so that the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> stays where it is.|$|E
50|$|Peripherals {{specifically}} designed for use with driving simulations include RailDriver by US manufacturer P.I. Engineering. RailDriver is a programmable desktop cab controller with <b>throttle,</b> brake <b>lever</b> and switches designed to work with Trainz, TrainMaster, Microsoft Train Simulator and Rail Simulator.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, {{during the}} time the reverse thrust lever for the right engine was being moved forward (to reduce the reverse thrust), the {{airplane}} captain unintentionally moved the <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever</b> for the left engine forward (increasing forward thrust). The reverse thrust of the right engine was reduced by the pilot gradually up to the stowed position and remained in that position until the time of colliding with the barriers. The <b>throttle</b> control <b>lever</b> for the left engine was in the position corresponding to the forward thrust setting of roughly 60% of its full rated takeoff thrust, and remained in that position until the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. The crew apparently did not notice the left engine’s increase in forward thrust.|$|R
50|$|The {{go-around}} {{setting is}} used during approach. If a pilot finds {{that he or}} she is unable to land safely, activating this switch (usually positioned on the back of the <b>throttle</b> <b>levers)</b> will increase the power to go-around thrust. Most importantly, the TO/GA switch modifies the autopilot mode, so it does not follow the ILS glide slope anymore and it overrides any autothrottle mode which would keep the aircraft in landing configuration. On Airbus aircraft it does not disengage the autopilot, but causes it to stop following the Instrument landing system (ILS) and perform go-around manoeuvre automatically. In an emergency situation, using a TO/GA switch is often the quickest way of increasing thrust to abort a landing. On Airbus planes pushing throttles to TO/GA detent does all regarding flight path and speed.|$|R
5000|$|Whenever {{the rate}} of change ′ of a {{quantity}} [...] is proportional to the displacement of an object, the quantity [...] is a linear function of the object's absement. For example, when the fuel flow rate is proportional to the position of the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever,</b> then the total amount of fuel consumed is proportional to the lever's absement.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{pneumatic}} {{die grinder}} throttles (also called triggers) feature a spring-loaded [...] "kickstand" [...] mechanism between the <b>throttle</b> <b>lever</b> {{and the body}} of the grinder. This prevents the throttle from opening (being pressed down towards {{the body of the}} grinder) without operator intervention and inhibits accidental activation. It is similar in principle to the safety catches used on many handguns.|$|E
5000|$|A miswired {{flight control}} system led to two minor {{injuries}} when the left nacelle struck the ground while the aircraft was hovering 15 ft in the air, causing it to bounce and catch fire on 11 June 1991.
