5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss by Germany with Austria, Yugoslavia {{shared a}} border with the Third Reich and came under {{increasing}} pro-Axis political pressure as her neighbours fell {{into line with}} the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined <b>the</b> <b>Pact.</b> From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that Yugoslavia also join <b>the</b> <b>Pact.</b> Two weeks later, Bulgaria joined <b>the</b> <b>Pact.</b> The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Despite of the {{internal}} opposition of Fernando de la Rúa, Alfonsín got his party to approve <b>the</b> <b>pact.</b> He reasoned that Menem would be supported by the eventual referendum, that many legislators would turn to his side, and he would eventually be able to amend the constitution reinforcing presidential power rather than limiting it. Still, as both sides feared a betrayal, all the contents of <b>the</b> <b>pact</b> were included as a single proposal, not allowing the Constituent Assembly to discuss each one separately. The Broad Front, a new political party composed of former Peronists, led by Carlos Álvarez, grew in the elections for the Constituent Assembly. Both the PJ and the UCR respected <b>the</b> <b>pact,</b> which was completely approved. Duhalde made a similar {{amendment to the constitution}} of the Buenos Aires province, in order to be re-elected in 1995. Menem won the elections with more than 50% of the vote, followed by José Octavio Bordón, and Carlos Álvarez. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time.|$|E

He initiated <b>the</b> <b>Pact</b> of Olivos with Menem in order to negotiate the terms for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. Fernando de la Rúa led a faction of the UCR that opposed <b>the</b> <b>pact,</b> and eventually became president in 1999. DelaRúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Alfonsín's faction provided the support needed for the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde to be appointed president by the Congress. Alfonsín died of lung cancer on 31March 2009, at the age of 82, and was given a large state funeral.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Tripartite <b>Pact</b> (also called <b>the</b> Three-Power <b>Pact,</b> <b>the</b> Axis <b>Pact,</b> <b>the</b> Three-way <b>Pact</b> or <b>the</b> Tripartite Treaty), an {{agreement}} signed in Berlin (Germany) on September 27, 1940, linked Germany, Italy and Japan as the Axis powers of World War II. On November 24, 1940, Slovakia also signed <b>the</b> Tripartite <b>Pact.</b> After a few months, Hitler asked {{the newly formed}} Slovak Republic (independent from March 1939) to join the invasion of Poland.|$|R

2500|$|Four days later, the Soviet Union and Germany signed <b>the</b> Molotov–Ribbentrop <b>Pact,</b> an {{agreement}} of mutual non-aggression between the parties.

The infrastructure created by <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Pact</b> was part of the economies of all member states, and <b>the</b> <b>Pact's</b> dissolution necessitated restructuring that took many years to complete. Furthermore, it took time to dismantle <b>the</b> Warsaw <b>Pact's</b> institutions; for example, it took two years for Soviet troops to fully withdraw from Czechoslovakia.|$|R

5|$|The National Reorganization Process {{ended in}} 1983. De la Rúa {{intended}} {{to run for}} president but lost in the primary elections of the UCR to Raúl Alfonsín, who was elected in the general election. De la Rúa ran for the post of senator instead, defeating the Peronist Carlos Ruckauf. He ran for re-election as senator in 1989 but, despite of his electoral victory, the electoral college voted for the Peronist Eduardo Vaca. De la Rúa was elected deputy in 1991 and returned to the senate in 1993. President Carlos Menem, elected in 1989, wanted to amend the constitution to allow him to run for re-election in 1995, which was opposed by the UCR. Alfonsín signed <b>the</b> <b>Pact</b> of Olivos with Menem, negotiating terms to support the proposal. De la Rúa led the opposition to <b>the</b> <b>pact</b> within the UCR, but Alfonsín prevailed in the internal dispute. This damaged the relationship between both leaders, but helped the party to retain a number of radicals who were against <b>the</b> <b>pact.</b> De la Rúa could not prevent the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. As a result, Menem was re-elected in 1995. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time, being surpassed by the Frepaso, a new party composed by former Peronists.|$|E

After receiving the request, Agoncillo delegated her eldest daughter, five-year-old Lorenza Agoncillo, and Mrs. Delfina Herbosa de Natividad, Jose Rizal's niece by his sister Lucia, to help her.|$|E
5|$|After unrelenting {{pressure}} from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew the government that had signed <b>the</b> <b>pact,</b> and a new government was formed under the VVKJ commander, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not called by the new government until 3 April, {{out of fear of}} offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. On the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the plan of attack and command structure for the invasion.|$|E

30|$|Keeping <b>the</b> single <b>pact</b> as <b>the</b> {{reference}} unit of measure, it {{is possible}} to identify connections between the political colour of <b>the</b> <b>pacts</b> and their national geographical distribution by macro-area. Most interestingly, in the North West of the country, 60 % of <b>the</b> <b>pacts</b> were signed by right-centre political majorities, including the national government in charge {{at the time of the}} agreement. This is almost certainly due to the greater spread of right-centre administrations in this area, with respect to the national total, as well as the greater presence of small and very small-sized municipalities in the region (with respect to the national total). However, since consolidated data are not available, it is not possible to confirm this relationship.|$|R
5|$|During Morgan's {{absence from}} Jamaica, news reached the island that England and Spain had signed the Treaty of Madrid. <b>The</b> <b>pact</b> aimed to {{establish}} {{peace in the}} Caribbean between the two countries; it included an agreement to revoke all letters of marque and similar commissions.

Modyford was arrested and sent to England by Sir Thomas Lynch, his recent replacement.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Louis I, Poland formed a Polish-Hungarian union. In <b>the</b> <b>pact</b> of 1374 (the Privilege of Koszyce), the Polish nobility was granted {{extensive}} concessions and agreed to extend the Anjou succession to Louis's daughters, as Louis had no sons. Louis's neglect of Polish affairs resulted {{in the loss of}} Casimir's territorial gains, including Halych Rus', which was recovered by Queen Jadwiga in 1387. In 1396, Jadwiga and her husband Jagiełło (Jogaila) forcefully annexed the central Polish lands separating Lesser Poland from Greater Poland, previously granted by King Louis to his Silesian Piast ally Duke Władysław of Opole.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of <b>the</b> <b>Pact,</b> the Scandinavian countries and Finland were relieved. The Germans and Soviets were now allies, and there was no German threat against the Soviet Union. But shortly afterwards, Germany invaded Poland and Great Britain and France declared war against Germany. Next, the Soviets invaded eastern Poland, and later Moscow requested that the Baltic states allow the establishment of Soviet military bases and the stationing of troops on their soil. The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement in September, while Latvia and Lithuania followed suit in October.|$|E
