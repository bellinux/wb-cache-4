5|$|Operation Ironside formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. The overall aim of Bodyguard was to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> German forces away from Normandy by threatening other targets. Ironside's specific objective was to tie up the 17th SS and 11th Panzer divisions deployed {{in the south of}} France.|$|E
5|$|The various deceptions {{to fulfil}} the Mediterranean portion of Bodyguard {{were given the}} codename Zeppelin, with follow up {{subsidiaries}} called Vendetta and Turpitude. Its initial overall aims were to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> German defensive forces in the region, but without suggesting too great a threat to Southern France (until the Allies had decided {{whether or not to}} conduct landings there).|$|E

5|$|This time Thomas {{planned to}} launch {{simultaneous}} sorties from four gates. The main sector {{was to be}} again the Thomas gate, {{to take full advantage}} of the exhausted Muslim corps stationed there. The attacks from the other gates—Jabiya Gate, the Small Gate and the Eastern Gate—were intended to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> the other Muslim corps so that they could not aid Shurhabil's corps at the Thomas gate.|$|E
5|$|The {{order by}} Allawi to attack Fallujah again came on 6 November, {{just four days}} after George W. Bush was reelected as president. 1st Marine Division {{commander}} General Richard F. Natonski assembled an ad-hoc force of six Marine battalions, three Army battalions, three Iraqi battalions, and the British Black Watch Regiment. The insurgents, loosely led by Zarqawi, Abdullah al-Janabi, and Zarqawi's lieutenant Hadid, had replaced their losses and reportedly now had between 3,000 and 4,000 men in the city. They planned to hinder the Marine advance with roadblocks, berms, and mines, while conducting attacks outside the city to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> Marine units.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof of the}} south, {{east and}} west stands built for the {{athletics}} stadium configuration {{was supported by the}} cable net system. The temporary open stand at the north end was built around the masts and <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> cables that would ultimately support the roof of the North Stand. After the games the track and field were excavated. The temporary bleachers at the north end were removed and the North Stand and lower tier of seats constructed on the prepared excavation. The North Stand roof was completed by adding rafters, purlins and cladding.|$|E

5|$|To {{ensure the}} success of the Chinese counterattack against ROK II Corps, the PVA 40th Corps was {{assigned}} the mission of protecting the PVA 38th Corps' flank against the US 2nd Infantry Division. To accomplish this mission, the PVA 119th Division of the 40th Corps would first attack Somin-dong and to prevent the Americans from reinforcing the Koreans. The 120th Division would then fight its way across the Ch'ongch'on River and <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> the bulk of the US 2nd Infantry Division. Finally, the 118th Division would flank the Americans from the west and capture Kujang-dong from the rear.|$|E
5|$|As the Muslim {{forces were}} {{geographically}} divided, Heraclius sought to exploit this situation {{and planned to}} attack. He {{did not wish to}} engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the Muslims to retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would fulfill his strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius' son Constantine III probably to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> Yazid's forces which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria sometime in the middle of June 636.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, the {{mobilization}} of the fleet was complete; Kaiser Karl VI {{was assigned to the}} Cruiser Flotilla, which was commanded by Vice Admiral Paul Fiedler. For most of the war, the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though the armored cruisers were too slow to operate with the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations. In May 1915, Italy declared war on the Central Powers. The Austro-Hungarians continued their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> the now further numerically superior Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{earmarked}} three field armies for the offensive: the 7th and the Fifth and Sixth Panzer. These {{accumulated over}} 240,000 soldiers, spread over seven panzer divisions, two panzer brigades and thirteen infantry divisions. The {{bulk of the}} offensive's armored strength was in the Sixth Panzer Army, which was tasked with the capture of the Belgian port of Antwerp. To its south was the Fifth Panzer Army, outfitted to protect the Sixth's flank while it crossed the Meuse river. The southernmost flank was covered by the Seventh Army, composed of three infantry corps and ordered to protect the Fifth Army's southern flank and <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> American reserves in Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|Once Huế {{had been}} isolated, Military Region 5 Command would {{initiate}} the Nam-Ngai Campaign from {{the provinces of}} Quảng Tin and Quảng Ngãi, to isolate Da Nang from the Central Highlands. North Vietnamese units such as the 2nd Division, the 141st Regiment, the 52nd Brigade, along with two artillery regiments (368th and 572nd Artillery Regiments) would coordinate their efforts with the Viet Cong 94th and 96th Local Force Regiments, and the 70th and 72nd Local Force Battalions. As part of their overall objective, they would <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> the ARVN 2nd Division (South Vietnam), the 11th Armoured Squadron and the 912th Regional Force Company in Quảng Ngãi Province. And, if the opportunity arises, they would also capture Bình Định Province {{and the city of}} Qui Nhơn.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy a price for their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to be}} sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{preparations}} for Operation Downfall, {{the invasion of}} Japan, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC) in April 1945, assuming command of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific except the Twentieth Air Force. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. During his planning of the invasion of Japan, MacArthur stressed to the decision-makers in Washington that it was essential to have the Soviet Union enter the war as he argued it was crucial to have the Red Army <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> the Kwantung army in Manchuria. The invasion was pre-empted by the surrender of Japan in August 1945. On 2 September MacArthur accepted the formal Japanese surrender aboard the battleship , thus ending hostilities in World War II. In recognition of {{his role as a}} maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|Following the Italian {{declaration}} of war against the Central Powers on 23 May 1915, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied to bombard Italian coastal targets. Sankt Georg {{took part in the}} operation; escorted by a pair of torpedo boats, she shelled the city of Rimini. She damaged a railroad bridge and was not engaged by Italian forces. Thereafter, the Austro-Hungarians returned to their strategy of serving as a fleet in being, which would <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> Allied naval forces. Haus hoped that torpedo boats and mines could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the Italian fleet before a decisive battle could be fought. For most of the war, Sankt Georg was assigned to the Cruiser Flotilla and based at Cattaro, though she was too slow to operate with the newer s that carried out the bulk of offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|German forces {{continued}} their counterattacks on Übach, suffering heavy casualties to American artillery and infantry fire. Although {{the inability to}} retake Übach persuaded German commanders that they had insufficient forces to properly defend the approaches to Aachen, the counterattacks did <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> American troops which could have otherwise continued the advance. On 4 October, the Allied advance was limited, with only the towns of Hoverdor and Beggendorf taken, the Americans having lost roughly 1,800 soldiers {{in the past three}} days of combat. Better progress was made on 5 October, as the 119th Regiment of the 30th Infantry Division captured Merkstein-Herbach. The following day the Germans launched another counterattack against Übach, again failing to dislodge the Americans. German armor was unable to cope with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the American tanks, and as a last-ditch effort to halt the advance the Germans began concentrated attacks on American positions with what artillery and aircraft they could muster. They found themselves severely hamstrung by lack of reserves, although General Koechling was able to deploy a Tiger detachment to the town of Alsdorf in an attempt to plug the American penetration of Aachen's northern defenses.|$|E

5|$|Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, the {{commander}} of the Kriegsmarine, proposed on 13 November that Tirpitz be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, as well as act as a fleet in being to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of Bismarck, agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's antiaircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5cm guns on the superstructure next to the catapult were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit. The ship's commander, Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Karl Topp, pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942. The following day, Tirpitz left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 and 1945, U-boats {{became less}} and less effective. They {{remained}} at sea to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> as much Allied air and sea forces as possible, to relieve pressure on the other two services (Heer and Luftwaffe). When the Allies launched Operation Overlord in June 1944, U-boats attempted to interdict shipping, but lost 24 of their number from 6—30 June. A further 12 submarines from Norway joined 35 from French ports for operations, only to suffer 50 attacks on the first day. Six returned due to damage. On 25 August 1944, owing to the Allied advance toward U-boat ports, all submarines were ordered to Norway. This evacuation from France was complete by 30 September. Between 6 June and 31 August 20 out of 30 Schnorchel boats were lost. For Coastal Command, the end of 1944 witnessed the interception of 47 percent of all sighted U-boats, {{which resulted in a}} 20 percent of those attacked being sunk.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Diarra {{was signed}} to an amateur {{contract}} by professional club CS Louhans-Cuiseaux who were playing in Ligue 2, {{the second level}} of French football, and was inserted into the club's youth academy. In the 1998–99 season, Diarra was promoted to the club's reserve team and spent two seasons playing there. In {{the latter part of}} the 1999–2000 season, he was called up to the senior team by manager Philippe Hinschberger. On 15 April 2000, Diarra made his professional debut in a 2–1 defeat to Toulouse picking up a yellow card. Two weeks later, he made his first professional start in the team's 3–2 loss to Niort. In his final appearance with Louhans-Cuiseaux, Diarra received his first red card of his career after incurring two yellow card infractions in a 2–1 defeat to Le Mans. Louhans-Cuiseaux finished the campaign in last place and were relegated to the semi-professional Championnat National, the third division of French football. After the season, Louhans-Cuiseaux attempted to <b>tie</b> <b>down</b> Diarra on a long-term deal and offered the player a trainee contract. Diarra refused the deal and was subsequently available to sign with any club on a free transfer.|$|E
