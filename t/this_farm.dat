The 'footprint' and some foundations stones of the old Lambroughtonend Farm can still be seen in the field (2010), next to the site of a small burn, now piped down to the Lochrig Burn.

25|$|South of {{the city}} center is Acapantzingo, which had been a {{separate}} town, but now is part {{of the city}}. A large farm owned by Emperor Maximilian I existed there in the 1860s.

The emperor used this property as one of his residences in Cuernavaca, and according to rumor, to enjoy the company of a certain beautiful Indian woman. On <b>this</b> <b>farm</b> and in what was the Pavilion, is now the Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine (Museo de Medicina Tradicional).

The farm buildings comprise a two-storeyed farmhouse flanked to the south by stables, a harness room and a forge and to the north by a byre and a dairy. A barn and a cart shed are in a detached range to the rear (to the east) of the main block and a small watermill is to the north, adjacent to the dairy. The farm steading is built of whinstone rubble and has slate roofs. It was visited by the RCAHMS in 1993. In the surrounding fields can be seen the earthworks of a rig, some of which is slightly reverse-S in plan.

[...] As he was unsuccessful at farming, he supplemented his income using the stonemason's skills he had learned from his father: he laid foundations for the Canadian Pacific Railway, worked on the High Level Bridge in Edmonton, and dug Killam's town well.

500|$|In exile Rosas was not destitute, but {{he lived}} {{modestly}} amid financial constraints during {{the remainder of}} his life. A very few loyal friends sent him money, but it was never enough. He sold one of his estancias before the confiscation and became a tenant farmer in Swaythling, near Southampton. He employed a housekeeper and two to four laborers, to whom he paid above-average wages. Despite constant concern over his shortage of funds, Rosas found joy in farm life, once remarking: [...] "I now consider myself happy on <b>this</b> <b>farm,</b> living in modest circumstances as you see, earning a living the hard way by the sweat of my brow". A contemporary described him in final years: [...] "He was then eighty, a man still handsome and imposing; his manners were most refined, and the modest environment did nothing to lessen his air of a great lord, inherited from his family." [...] After a walk on a cold day, Rosas caught pneumonia and died at 07:00 on the morning of 14 March 1877. Following a private mass attended by his family and a few friends, he was buried in the town cemetery of Southampton.|$|E
500|$|Wormshill {{includes}} two farms: Yew Tree Farm (dairy farming) {{at the south}} end of the village, and Norwood Farm (fruit and other crops) at the north end. A third farm, Home Farm appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. <b>This</b> <b>farm</b> is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898. [...] According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid-to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as [...] "labourers and servants". The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The socio-economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were [...] "lower managerial and professional occupations" [...] (21.9 percent) and [...] "small employers and own account workers" [...] (15.2 percent).|$|E
40|$|To {{meet the}} growing need {{of people for}} {{increasing}} farm income and to minimize the negative environmental impact of today¿s farm practices, a new farming concept has been evolved where inputs are fine tuned and optimized according to the local field variability such that yield increment is achieved with a minimum harm to the local environment. <b>This</b> <b>farming</b> concept is different than the traditional farming system and can be highlighted as a precision agriculture system or more specifically termed as site specific land management (SSLM) which takes the advantage of recent technological developments and their uses in agriculture. It operates by matching resource application and agronomic practices with soil attributes and crop requirements as they vary across a field leading to the overall economic and environmental benefits. This report explains in brief a general concept and principle of <b>this</b> eco-friendly <b>farming</b> approach with some common procedures to be followed while planning of SSLM in any area. It also {{provides an example of}} applying <b>this</b> <b>farming</b> concept in a small area in Belgium and recommends some land and crop management practices.
