The effects of the electric field can be observed in both the J SC and the fill factor of the h-OPV devices.

30|$|As a {{very direct}} {{approach}} to adapt photosynthetic electrochemical energy conversion, the photosystem protein {{itself can be}} used as an electrode material. The photosystem’s modified photo-electrode is promising due to its higher energy conversion efficiency (the charge separation efficiency of PSI is ~ 100  % [33]) and lower recombination rate compared to that of a semiconductor. However, challenges remain, such as the instability of the photosystems on the electrode and the inefficient transport of photo-electrons from the photosystem to the electrode. Many efforts have been focused on the development of a proper platform to trap the photosystem and <b>transfer</b> <b>charges,</b> and a conducting polymer is often proposed as an electrode material that can fulfill these requirements. Nafion, for example, has been reported for its ability to encapsulate a photosystem while permitting electron transfer [34]. Attributed to its unique selective conductivity for cations, photo-excited electrons can be carried by positively charged electron transfer mediators, such as methyl viologen. On the other hand, a polyaniline-based photo-electrode has also been suggested [35]. Polyaniline can be synthesized on the electrode surface {{in the form of a}} three-dimensional network, which can trap photosystems and directly transfer excited electrons through a chain-hopping mechanism.|$|E

40|$|Platinum {{films of}} 1 nm {{thickness}} were deposited by {{electron beam evaporation}} onto 100 nm thick titanium oxide films (TiOx) with variable oxygen vacancy concentrations and fluorine (F) doping. Methanol oxidation on the platinum films produced formaldehyde, methyl formate, and carbon dioxide. F-doped samples demonstrated significantly higher activity for methanol oxidation when the TiOx was stoichiometric (TiO 2), but lower activity when it was nonstoichiometric (TiO 1. 7 and TiO 1. 9). These results correlate with the chemical behavior of {{the same types of}} catalysts in CO oxidation. Fluorine doping of stoichiometric TiO 2 also increased selectivity toward partial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and methyl formate, but had an opposite effect in the case of nonstoichiometric TiOx. Introduction of oxygen vacancies and fluorine doping both increased the conductivity of the TiO x film. For oxygen vacancies, this occurred by the formation of a conduction channel in the band gap, whereas in the case of fluorine doping, F acted as an n-type donor, forming a conduction channel {{at the bottom of the}} conduction band, about 0. 5 - 1. 0 eV higher in energy. The higher energy electrons in F-doped stoichiometric TiOx led to higher turnover rates and increased selectivity toward partial oxidation of methanol.

40|$|Long {{distance}} {{electron transfer}} in proteins requires relay stations {{that can be}} transitorily oxidized or reduced. Although individual prolines cannot assume this function, because of their high ionization energy, {{it has been shown}} that polyprolines have the ability to <b>transfer</b> <b>charges.</b> In order to determine the role of the proline in the hole distribution and transport within a PheProPhe tripeptide, the radical cation of a model compound where the phenylalanines carry two or three methoxy groups, respectively, was generated by flash photolysis. Surprisingly, after equilibration, about two thirds of the holes were found to reside on the phen(OMe) 2 instead of the more easily oxidizable phen(OMe) 3 moiety. DFT calculations showed that, in most of the accessible conformations, the phen(OMe) 2 • +-moiety profits more from stabilization by N- and/or O-lone pairs of neighboring amide groups than the phen(OMe) 3 • + moiety can, which explains the apparently counterthermodynamic hole distribution. Similar calculations showed that, in several conformers of the natural PheProPhe radical cation, the unpaired electron is delocalized over two amide groups, by residing in a σ MO which links the N-lone pair of the central proline unit with the O-lone pair of a proximate amino acid, through hyperconjugation via the intervening C―Cα σ-bond. The same pattern is found in a model compound, N-acetylproline dimethylamide. It seems that prolines favor conformers which foster hyperconjugation of two amide groups, which lowers the ionization energy of peptides. One should thus consider such interacting amide groups as potential relay stations in the course of electron transfer in polyprolines...|$|E
