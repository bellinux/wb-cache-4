5|$|The Pomeranian is a {{small but}} {{energetic}} breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from frequent attention, they need relatively little exercise: it is recommended to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> on a short daily walk or let them run around an enclosed space.|$|E
5|$|After Pine leaves, Sasha is {{attacked}} by the queen while Hawk and Moth are {{attacked by}} the she-cat's kits, but Sasha beats her. She leaves with the kits and decides to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to RiverClan. In the outskirts of RiverClan territory, Sasha tells the kits who their father is and {{says that it is}} their secret. Sasha tells RiverClan that she and her kits wish to become warriors.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> away from the men would probably lead to mutiny.|$|E

5|$|China's late-20th-century {{economic}} reforms produced {{a middle class}} that increased demand for traditional luxury items like shark fins. Chinese traditional medicine ascribes various restorative and healing effects to the fins, and the soup is considered a delicacy, costing as much as US$100 per bowl. The Chinese demand for fins led fishing crews to both <b>take</b> <b>them</b> from sharks in their bycatch and start fishing for sharks directly.|$|E

5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may <b>take</b> <b>them</b> as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace barn owls from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.|$|E

5|$|Most comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies with {{elongated}} elliptical orbits that <b>take</b> <b>them</b> {{close to the}} Sun for {{a part of their}} orbit and then out into the further reaches of the Solar System for the remainder. Comets are often classified according to the length of their orbital periods: The longer the period the more elongated the ellipse.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 1919, {{the order}} to {{transfer}} the Marine units to the Services of Supply branch for transport back to the United States was given. Ten days later, {{the last of the}} Marines boarded trains which took them to ports from where they would join transports that were to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> across the Atlantic. The 6th Machine Gun Battalion embarked aboard the Santa Paula and arrived in New York on 5 August 1919.|$|E

5|$|The new cent {{was issued}} in {{exchange}} for the worn Spanish colonial silver coin that had circulated in the U.S. until then, as well as for its larger predecessor. So many cents were issued that they choked commercial channels, especially as they were not legal tender and no one had to <b>take</b> <b>them.</b> The eagle design did not strike well, and was replaced in 1859 by Longacre's Indian Head cent.|$|E

5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen {{would provide the}} duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels of the firm to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to the stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, {{in return for a}} flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to round up people from Portland saloons, and then <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to the land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
5|$|After Bart and Lisa see Krusty the Clown do {{his show}} at the Mt. Splashmore water park on TV, they {{consistently}} irritate and supplicate Homer about going there. Homer gets annoyed, but reluctantly decides to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> there. The family goes to Mt. Splashmore, where Bart, Lisa and Homer ride an intense water slide named H2WHOA!. Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced {{to shut down the}} ride and remove him {{with the help of a}} large crane. Homer is made a fool of on the news for his massive size and admits that he needs to lose weight.|$|E

Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the Eiffel Tower and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower {{and some of the}} surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in so doing, he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained fire-fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to <b>take</b> <b>them</b> onto the island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
