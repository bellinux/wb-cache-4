5|$|A later source, Johannes Aventinus, {{writes that}} Taksony {{fought in the}} Battle of Lechfeld on August 10, 955. There, future Holy Roman Emperor Otto I routed an 8,000-strong Hungarian army. If this report is reliable, Taksony {{was one of the}} few Hungarian leaders to survive the battlefield. Modern historians, {{including}} Zoltán Kordé and Gyula Kristó, suggest that Fajsz abdicated in favor of Taksony around that time. After that battle the Hungarians' plundering raids in Western Europe stopped, and they were forced <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> the lands between the Enns and Traisen rivers. However, the Hungarians continued their incursions into the Byzantine Empire until the 970s.|$|E

He spent the summer {{training}} to improve the skills of his men and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia.

5|$|In 66, the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted {{against the}} Roman Empire.

Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the fifth and tenth legions. He was later joined by Titus at Ptolemais, bringing with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across the Galilee, and by 68 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In the Duchy of Warsaw, Poniatowski {{defeated}} the Austrians at Raszyn on 19 April, prevented Austrian forces from crossing the Vistula river, {{and forced the}} Austrians <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> occupied Warsaw.

Eventually, the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war.|$|E

5|$|Kościuszko's {{force was}} {{assigned}} to protect the front's southern flank, touching up to the Austrian border. At the Battle of Dubienka (July 18, 1792) Kościuszko repulsed a numerically superior enemy, skilfully using terrain obstacles and field fortifications, and came {{to be regarded as}} one of Poland's most brilliant military commanders of the age. With some 5,300 men, he defeated 25,000 Russians led by General Michail Kachovski. Despite the tactical victory, Kościuszko had <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> Dubienka, as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>from</b> Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E

50|$|Camp {{participants}} {{came from}} a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. A resident directory from the late 19th and early 20th century includes entries for a shoe manufacturer, teamster, oil dealer, carpenter, and a tin ware dealer.
