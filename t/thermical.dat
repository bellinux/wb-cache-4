Percutaneus nucleotomy uses a percutaneous approach to the intervertebral disc. The article presents the evolution of numerous procedureds in clinical practice. Methods : Percutaneous nucleoplasty is a fluoroscopy-guided procedure which enables controlled and safe entrance into the intervertebral disc. The procedure is performed under strict aseptic conditions, using a local anaesthesia with the patient under analgosedation. Based on the principle of therapeutic intradiscal action, the procedures can be divided into three groups: chemical (chemonucleolysis with chimopapain, alcohol, ozone), mechanical (automated percutaneous lumbar discectomy – APLD, arthroscopic discectomy) and <b>thermical</b> methods (laser, radiofrequency ablation, intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty – IDET, Coblation®).

In spite of the advantages, the thermal treatment above 160 ºC can inactive the surface of the wood, reducing the penetration of the adhesive and, this way, reducing the quality of the adhesion. The sanding of the surface of OSB panels can remove this effect, increasing the quality of the adhesion and the glue line strength. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the thermal treatment on the glue-line shear strength of OSB panels and the effect of the sanding process on this strength, as well.

O pacu apresentou um rendimento de filé {{superior}} (p It {{has been}} analysed the processing yield of Oreochromis niloticus and Piaractus mesopotamicus. A total of 20 individuals from each species, presenting a mean weight of 816, 0 ± 74, 0 g and 1958, 0 ± 164, 0 g, and total length of 33. 6 ± 1, 1 cm and 42. 4 ± 1, 2 cm, respectively, for tilapia and pacu. They were killed with <b>thermical</b> shock, weighed, measured, then extracted internal organs and fillets. The fillet yield was higher in pacu (p < 0, 01) than those observed in tilapia. These values for pacu were superior (p < 0. 01) to tilapia’s. These values were 51. 60 % for fillet with skin and 46. 73 % without skin, while for tilapia they were 39. 21 % and 36. 44 %, respectively. There {{were no significant}} difference for the yield on the visceral carcass and skin between the two species. The percentage for the tilapia’s head (28. 34 %) was significantly superior (p < 0. 01) to pacu’s (16. 57 %). Individuals with big and long head promoted low fillet yield, as verified for tilapia, and those with small head as pacu, the yield ranges higher values, evidencing {{the existence of a}} inverse relationship between the size of the head and fillet yield...|$|E

El autor ofrece un panorama sintético de los conoci&# 39; mientos científicos sobre este tipo de ambiente continental acuático, definiéndolo como categoría; detalla los tipos lagunares según una clasificación original con criterio genético, pero con fundamento limnológico, y pasa revista a los rasgos esenciales: geomorfológicos, sedimentológicos, térmicos, químicos, factores bióticos especialmente vida planctónica, productividad, fenómenos rítmicos de varias amplitudes, trofismo y sus tipos, y sucesión. The {{most common}} type of inland water in the chaco-panr pasic plain of Argentina is a lenitic body called regionally “laguna”. Correspond to a third order or polymyctic lake by the thermic characteristics: the continuous circulation and the absence of <b>thermical</b> stratification. The bassin is commonly a “píanne” or a “wanns” or else a sector of an ancient river. The salinitv range fro:n oligohaline to mesohaline, and otber Chemical factors are: high alcalinity and Mg/Ca, and high content of clorures and sulfates. The sediment is peculiar, ussually a loessic or sandy mud. The planctonic life correspond to an culimnoplancton, with adventitious elements, with the usual autumnal and spring peaks. The aquatic vegetation and ccmmunities other than plancton are usuallv rich, accordingly to an eutrophic lenitic body with médium to high productivity. There are two trophic types; saprotrophic in “lagunas” with plenty organic material and in advanced process of accumula- tion, and halitrophic type of the more or less saline “lagunas”. Usually there is one pronounced seasonal cycle and a cycle of many years accordingly with climatic cycles. The sucesión con- vey to a marsh or to a saline in correlation with the trophic type just mentioned...|$|E
40|$|The Compact Sodium-cooled Nuclear Reactor Facility (KNK) was an {{experimental}} {{nuclear power plant}} of 20 MW electric power erected on the premises of the Karlsruhe Research Center. The plant was initially run as KNK I with a thermal core between 1971 and 1974 and then, between 1977 and 1991, with a fast core as the KNK II fast breeder plant. Under the decommissioning concept, the plant is to be decommissioned completely to green field conditions {{at the end of}} 2005 in ten steps, i. e. under the corresponding ten decommissioning permits. To this day, nine decommissioning permits have been issued, the first one in 1993 and the most recent one, number nine, in 2001. The decommissioning and demolition activities covered by decommissioning permits 1 to 7 have been completed. Under the 8 th Decommissioning Permit, the components of the primary system and the rotating reactor top shield are to be removed by late 2001. Under the 9 th Decommissioning Permit, the reactor vessel with its internals, the primary shield, and the biological shield are to be dismantled. The residual sodium volume in the reactor vessel was estimated to amount to approx. 30 l. The maximum Co- 60 activation is on the order of 107 - 108 Bq/g; the maximum dose rate {{in the middle of the}} vessel was measured in April 1997 to be 55 Sv/h. The difficulty involved especially in dismantling KNK, on the one hand, is posed by the residual sodium in the plant, which determines the choice of neither wet nor <b>thermical</b> techniques to be used in disassembly. Another difficulty is caused by the depth of activation by fast neutrons, as a result of which not only the reactor vessel proper, but also the entire primary shield (60 cm of grey cast iron) and large parts of the biological shield must be disassembled and disposed of under remote control...|$|E
