In this study, I use literary approach which focus on characterization and conflict, and feminist theory which focus on gender concept as the supporting. The reason why she fails is because she is not properly educated by her father, and her reaction which is considered as improper reaction towards men. She reacts towards men in such way because she is being provoked. However, Katherine?s failure in fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> `ideal? is not her fault. Men as the representatives of her society have provoked Katherine by saying negatives words and treated her badly. It is her socialization experiences which construct her become a shrew and fails in fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> `ideal? Elizabethan women...|$|R

40|$|For millennia {{people have}} speculated {{about the nature}} of time—without success. Time plays a role with all {{processes}} and events studied by all the disciplines. It is reported here that the existence of time is a direct consequence of the existence of space. Space exists, and it continues to exist. Space is there, and it continues to be there. Space exists as place, the three-dimensional place that matter can occupy. The three-dimensional extension of spatial-place is measured with a ruler of some kind. Place, three-dimensionality, and extension are intrinsic-qualities of space itself. The continuing-existence of space is a direct consequence of the existence of space. The continuing-existence of space is measured with a clock. Spatial continuing-existence also has intrinsic-qualities. A list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuing-existence of space appears to be the same as a list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> time.
