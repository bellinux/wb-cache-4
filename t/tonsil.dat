5|$|In his {{personal}} life, Chapman was openly homosexual {{and a strong}} supporter of gay rights, and was in a relationship with David Sherlock. He was an alcoholic during his time at Cambridge and the Python years, quitting shortly before working on Life of Brian. Chapman died of <b>tonsil</b> and spinal cancer on 4 October 1989, on the eve of Monty Python's 20th anniversary, and his life and legacy were commemorated at a private memorial service at St Bartholomew's with the other five Pythons.|$|E
5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a <b>tonsil</b> {{infection}} that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E
25|$|Much rarer {{than the}} typical <b>tonsil</b> stones are giant tonsilloliths. Giant tonsilloliths may often be mistaken for other oral maladies, {{including}} peritonsillar abscess, and tumours of the <b>tonsil.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tonsils</b> {{in humans}} include, from {{superior}} to inferior: nasopharyngeal <b>tonsils</b> (also known as adenoids), palatine <b>tonsils,</b> and lingual <b>tonsils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Palatine <b>tonsils,</b> {{commonly}} called the <b>tonsils</b> and occasionally called the faucial <b>tonsils,</b> are <b>tonsils</b> {{located on the}} left and right sides {{at the back of the}} throat, which can often be seen as flesh-colored, pinkish lumps. <b>Tonsils</b> only present as [...] "white lumps" [...] if they are inflamed or infected with symptoms of exudates (pus drainage) and severe swelling.|$|R
50|$|Abnormal {{findings}} include bright-red, enlarged <b>tonsils</b> {{or white}} or yellow tonsillar exudate.Tonsillitis is an {{inflammation of the}} <b>tonsils.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1828, {{physician}} Philip Syng Physick modified {{an existing}} instrument originally designed by Benjamin Bell for removing the uvula; the instrument, {{known as the}} <b>tonsil</b> guillotine (and later as a tonsillotome), became the standard instrument for <b>tonsil</b> removal for over 80 years. By 1897, it became more common to perform complete rather than partial removal of the <b>tonsil</b> after American physician Ballenger noted that partial removal failed to completely alleviate symptoms in a majority of cases. His results using a technique involving removal of the <b>tonsil</b> with a scalpel and forceps were much better than partial removal; tonsillectomy using the guillotine eventually fell out of favor in America.|$|E
25|$|More simply still, gargling with warm, salty {{water may}} help {{alleviate}} the discomfort of tonsillitis, which often accompanies <b>tonsil</b> stones. Vigorous gargling each morning can also keep the <b>tonsil</b> crypts clear {{of all but}} the most persistent tonsilloliths.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people are}} able to remove <b>tonsil</b> stones using the tip of the tongue. Oral irrigators are also simple yet {{effective}} and will thoroughly clean the <b>tonsil</b> crypts. Most electric oral irrigators are unsuitable for <b>tonsil</b> stone removal because they are too powerful and are likely to cause discomfort and rupture the tonsils, which could result in further complications such as infection. Irrigators that connect directly to the sink tap via a threaded attachment or otherwise are suitable for <b>tonsil</b> stone removal and everyday washing of the tonsils because they can jet water at low pressure levels that the user can adjust by simply turning the sink tap, allowing for a continuous range of pressures to suit each user's specific requirements.|$|E
50|$|One {{common type}} of {{anatomical}} crypt is the Crypts of Lieberkühn. However, {{it is not the}} only type: some types of <b>tonsils</b> also have crypts. Because these crypts allow external access to the deep portions of the <b>tonsils,</b> these <b>tonsils</b> are more vulnerable to infection.|$|R
5000|$|The adenoid, {{unlike the}} palatine <b>tonsils,</b> has pseudostratified epithelium. [...] The adenoid is often removed {{along with the}} palatine <b>tonsils.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like other lymphatic tissues, the {{function}} of lingual <b>tonsils</b> is to prevent infections. These <b>tonsils</b> contain B and T lymphocytes which get activated when harmful bacteria and viruses {{come in contact with}} <b>tonsils.</b> B lymphocytes kill pathogens by producing antibodies against them, while T lymphocytes directly kill them by engulfing them.|$|R
25|$|Radiofrequency ablation: Monopolar {{radiofrequency}} thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency {{energy to}} the <b>tonsil</b> tissue through probes inserted in the <b>tonsil.</b> The procedure can be performed in an office (outpatient) setting under light sedation or local anesthesia. After the treatment is performed, scarring occurs within the <b>tonsil</b> causing it to decrease in size {{over a period of}} several weeks. The treatment can be performed several times. The advantages of this technique are minimal discomfort, ease of operations, and immediate return to work or school. Tonsillar tissue remains after the procedure but is less prominent. This procedure is recommended for treating enlarged tonsils and not chronic or recurrent tonsillitis.|$|E
25|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} <b>tonsil</b> is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute tonsillitis, sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or peritonsillar abscess. For children, the adenoids (also known as a pharyngeal <b>tonsil</b> or nasopharyngeal <b>tonsil)</b> are usually removed, a procedure called adenoidectomy (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually vestigial. Although tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains a common surgical procedures in children in the United States and many other western countries.|$|E
25|$|Larger tonsilloliths {{may cause}} {{multiple}} symptoms, including recurrent halitosis, which frequently accompanies a <b>tonsil</b> infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste {{in the back}} of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and <b>tonsil</b> swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad breath in patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist {{in the back of}} the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: During my 40 {{years of}} {{performing}} tonsillectomy, I {{have noticed that}} t onsils seem to increase in size with ag ing. The purpose was to study {{the relationship between the}} weight of <b>tonsils</b> and patients’ age. Subjects and Methods : Tonsillectomies were performed in 1246 patients diagnosed with sleep disorders with hypertrophied <b>tonsils.</b> The ex cised <b>tonsils</b> were weighed. Results: 1) The number of male tonsillectomy cases was 2. 3 times higher than the number of female cases; 2) Most tonsillectomies were performed in children three to six years of age, and in adults who were around 30 years old; 3) The maximum age of the male patients was 57 years and that of the female patients was 63 years; 4) The weight of <b>tonsils</b> increased with age in the males, but the maximum weight of female <b>tonsils</b> was reached at around nine years of age; 5) <b>Tonsils</b> of males were heavier and larger than those of females of the same age; 6) A high degree of correlation was observed between the weights of the right and left <b>tonsils</b> of a subject. Conclusions: 1) The weight of <b>tonsils</b> increased with growth; 2) <b>Tonsils</b> in males were more hypertrophic than those in females; 3) The age distribution of the cases suggested that the lifespan of these patients is shorter than the norm; 4) The ideal age at which to perform tonsillectomy is thought in two to three years; 5) A high degree of corelation eixists between the weight of the right and left <b>tonsils</b> of a subject. </div...|$|R
50|$|Palatine <b>tonsils</b> {{consist of}} {{approximately}} 15 crypts, which {{result in a}} large internal surface. The <b>tonsils</b> contain four lymphoid compartments that influence immune functions, namely the reticular crypt epithelium, the extrafollicular area, the mantle zones of lymphoid follicles, and the follicular germinal centers. In human palatine <b>tonsils,</b> the very first part exposed to the outside environment is tonsillar epithelium.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the factors influencing gonorrhea detection at the pharynx. One hundred men infected with Neisseria gonorrhoeae were swabbed from the <b>tonsils</b> and posterior oropharynx.

25|$|Protruding tonsilloliths {{may feel}} like foreign objects {{lodged in the}} <b>tonsil</b> crypt. They may be a {{nuisance}} and difficult to remove, but are usually not harmful. They {{are one of the}} causes of halitosis (bad breath) and always give off a putrid smell.|$|E
25|$|Larger <b>tonsil</b> stones {{may require}} removal by {{curettage}} (scooping) or otherwise, although thorough irrigation {{will still be}} required afterwards to effectively wash out smaller pieces.

50|$|Lingual <b>tonsils</b> {{are covered}} {{externally}} by stratified squamous nonkeratinized epithelium. The epithelium invaginates inward {{to form a}} single crypt. Beneath the epithelium is a layer of lymphoid nodules containing lymphocytes. These <b>tonsils</b> are surrounded by thin capsule of connective tissue which separates them from adjacent structures. Mucous glands located {{at the root of}} tongue are drained through several ducts into the crypt of lingual <b>tonsils.</b> Secretions of these mucous glands keep the crypt clean and free of any debris. Therefore, the lingual <b>tonsils</b> are less prone to infection.|$|R

Objective: To propose a new staging for indication of pharyngeal surgery in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Methods: A total of 54 patients undergoing extended tonsillectomy were retrospectively included, divided into six stages. Stage I: patients with palatine <b>tonsils</b> grade 3 / 4 and modified Mallampati index 1 / 2; stage II: palatine <b>tonsils</b> 3 / 4 and modified Mallampati index 3 / 4; stage III: palatine <b>tonsils</b> 1 / 2 and modified Mallampati index 1 / 2; stage IV: palatine <b>tonsils</b> 1 / 2 and modified Mallampati index 3 / 4; stage V: body mass index &# 8805; 40 kg/m 2 with palatine <b>tonsils</b> 3 / 4 and modified Mallampati index 1, 2, 3, or 4.

25|$|The {{details of}} the {{surgical}} approach depend on the location {{and size of the}} primary tumour and its N stage.

For tumours of the <b>tonsil</b> and lateral pharyngeal wall, and clinically node negative (N0) disease, dissection of the neck typically involves levels 2–4 (see diagram) ipsilaterally. Where nodes are involved clinically, dissection will depend on the location and size of the node or nodes.

40|$|International audiencePersistent Typhimurium {{infections in}} pigs {{are a major}} concern for food safety and human health. <b>Tonsils</b> {{play a key role}} in the {{persistence}} of Typhimurium in pigs. Previous studies indicated that virulence genes involved in invasion and intracellular survival are of little importance for the colonization of porcine <b>tonsils,</b> suggesting a predominantly extracellular location of the bacteria. Biofilm formation might promote extracellular persistence of Typhimurium. The aim of this study was to determine whether the bacterium resides predominantly intra- or extracellularly in <b>tonsils</b> of pigs and to examine the contribution of biofilm-associated genes, and in persistence in porcine <b>tonsils.</b> Single cell suspensions were prepared from <b>tonsils</b> of orally inoculated pigs (2 x 10 colony forming units (CFU) wild type Typhimurium) to determine the ratio of extracellular versus intracellular bacteria. Both at 5 and 28 days post inoculation (pi), the majority of bacteria was found extracellularly in porcine <b>tonsils.</b> To determine the contribution of biofilm formation in extracellular persistence, pigs were orally inoculated with a mixture of 2 x 10 CFU of the Typhimurium wild type strain and 2 x 10 CFU of one of the Typhimurium, or mutants. At ten days pi, equal numbers of both wild type and mutant bacteria were found not only in <b>tonsils,</b> but also in ileum, ileum contents, ileocecal lymph nodes and faeces.

25|$|Early stage {{disease is}} {{associated}} with a relatively favourable outcome, for which single modality therapy is recommended, the choice depending on tumour location and accessibility. For instance unilateral <b>tonsil</b> or tongue base tumours will generally be treated with transoral resection and selective ipsilateral neck dissection. On the other hand, a large midline tongue lesion would require bilateral neck dissection, but in the absence of what are considered adverse pathology (positive margins, extracapsular extension) will likely be treated by surgery alone or radiation including ipsilateral or bilateral neck radiation fields, with surgery for those instances where the likelihood of adjuvant therapy is low.|$|E
25|$|Altered {{fractionation}} schemes, such as RTOG 9003 and RTOG 0129 {{have not}} conferred additional benefit. Radiation dose recommendations were largely determined empirically in clinical studies with few HPV+OPC patients, and have remained unchanged {{for half a}} century, {{making it difficult to}} determine the optimum dose for this subgroup. A common approach uses 70Gy bilaterally and anteriorly, such as RTOG 9003 (1991–1997) and RTOG 0129 (2002–2005). For lateralized <b>tonsil</b> cancer unilateral neck radiation is usually prescribed, but for tongue base primaries bilateral neck radiation is more common, but unilateral radiation may be used where tongue base lesions are lateralised.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} 50 years at least, {{tonsillectomy}} has been performed by dissecting the <b>tonsil</b> from its surrounding fascia, a so-called 'total', or extra-capsular tonsillectomy. Problems including pain and bleeding {{led to a}} recent resurgence in interest in sub-total tonsillectomy or 'tonsillotomy' which was popular 60–100 years ago, {{in an effort to}} reduce these complications. The generally accepted procedure for 'total' tonsillectomy uses a scalpel and blunt dissection or electrocautery, although harmonic scalpels or lasers have also been used. Bleeding is stopped with electrocautery, ligation by sutures, and the topical use of thrombin, a protein that induces blood clotting.|$|E
