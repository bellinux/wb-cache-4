5|$|The {{specific}} epithet of the Sind sparrow, pyrrhonotus, {{comes from}} the Greek purrhos ("flame-coloured"), and -nōtos ("-backed"). E. C. Stuart Baker suggested the English name rufous-backed sparrow, but as <b>this</b> <b>name</b> might cause confusion with other species, Ticehurst suggested the name Sind jungle-sparrow, which became the accepted name for the species. <b>This</b> <b>name</b> refers to Sindh, a province now in Pakistan which makes up {{a large part of}} the Sind sparrow's range, and the jungle habitat of the bird (in the word's original sense of tangled dry thicket). <b>This</b> <b>name</b> is shortened to jungle sparrow or Sind sparrow, of which the first was used in the IOC World Bird List, until Sind sparrow was adopted in 2009.|$|E
