40|$|We {{present results}} from four {{independent}} models of a granular assembly subjected to tapping. We {{find that the}} steady-state packing fraction {{as a function of}} the <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> is nonmonotonic. In particular, for high tapping intensities, we observe an increase of the packing fraction with tapping strength. This finding challenges the current understanding of compaction of granular media since the steady-state packing fraction is believed to decrease monotonically with increasing <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity.</b> We propose an explanation of our results based on the properties of the arches formed by the particles.

40|$|The {{steady state}} packing {{fraction}} of a tapped granular bed is studied for different grain shapes via a discrete element method. Grains are monosized regular polygons, from triangles to icosagons. Comparisons with disk packings show that the steady state packing fraction {{as a function of}} the <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> presents the same general trends in polygon packings. However, better packing fractions are obtained, as expected, for shapes that can tessellate the plane (triangles, squares and hexagons). In addition, we find a sharp transition for packings of polygons with more than 13 vertices signaled by a discontinuity in the packing fraction at a particular <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity.</b> Density fluctuations for most shapes are consistent with recent experimental findings in disk packing; however, a peculiar behavior is found for triangles and squares.

40|$|A semi-continuum {{model is}} {{introduced}} {{to study the}} dynamics of the formation of granular heaplets in tapped granular layers. By taking into account the energy dissipation of collisions and screening effects due to avalanches, this model is able to reproduce qualitatively the pattern of these heaplets. Our simulations show that the granular heaplets are characterised by an effective surface tension which depends on the magnitude of the <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity.</b> Also, we observe that there is a coarsening effect in that the average size of the heaplets, V grows as the number of taps k increases. The growth law at intermediate times can be fitted by a scaling function V ~ k^z but the range of validity of the power law is limited by size effects. The growth exponent z appears to diverge as the <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> is increased. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Static {{granular}} packs {{have been}} studied {{in the last three}} decades in the frame of a modified equilibrium statistical mechanics that assumes ergodicity as a basic postulate. The canonical example on which this framework is tested consists in the series of static configurations visited by a granular column subjected to taps. By analyzing the response of a realistic model of grains, we demonstrate that volume and stress variables visit different regions of the phase space at low <b>tap</b> <b>intensities</b> in different realizations of the experiment. We show that the <b>tap</b> <b>intensity</b> beyond which sampling by tapping becomes ergodic coincides with the forcing necessary to break all particle-particle contacts during each tap. These results imply that the well-known "reversible" branch of tapped granular columns is only valid at relatively high <b>tap</b> <b>intensities.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} lattice model for {{studying}} the Brazil Nut Effect (BNE), i. e. the phase segregation occuring when a granular material is vertically shaked. The model considers the <b>tap</b> <b>intensity</b> and the mobility mu of the grains as the main physical parameters. Different mobilities for different grain species lead to segregation (BNE) patterns, reverse segregation (RBNE) patterns, "sandwhich" layered structures or vertical domains. A phase diagram (decompaction chi, mobility difference between both species Delta mu) is obtained in which the different phases are emphasized. In a narrow region of the diagram, different phases coexist. It is shown that the BNE segregation could be reversed by increasing the <b>tap</b> <b>intensity</b> or {{the characteristics of the}} grains.

We find that the mechanism responsible for the relaxation phenomenon is evolving quasi-ordered packing structure propagating upwards from the plane floor. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Resin {{production}} in trees probably depends on trade-offs within the tree, its environment and on tapping activities. Frankincense, the highly esteemed resin from dry woodland frankincense trees of Boswellia papyrifera is exploited in traditional ways for millennia. New exploitation practices lead to weak trees and non-sustainable resin production. For 500 trees from four populations of B. papyrifera we evaluated how frankincense yield {{is affected by}} different tapping intensities (number of incision spots) and frequencies (number of resin collection rounds during the dry season), since both {{of them have been}} intensified recently. These effects are considered for trees of different size, since larger trees probably provide more resources for resin production. We predicted that frankincense production would initially increase with <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> and tapping frequency, but later level-off because of resin depletion. Frankincense production varied highly: yield per tree per year of all 500 monitored trees averaged 261 g (± 231, but largely varied and ranged from 41 to 1829 g. We indeed found that resin yield increased with <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity,</b> but not anymore beyond an intensity of 6 – 9 incision spots. Yield peaked around the seventh collection round, and declined thereafter. Yield increased with trunk diameter, but leveled-off beyond trees with a stem diameter of > 20 cm. These patterns were similar across populations, and between contrasting areas. Our results suggest that high <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> risks short-term resource depletion, warranting tuning down the intensity of the current collection practices. Less intense tapping rounds per season will reduce damage, increase the health of tree populations, and contribute to long term frankincense production. This study thus allows for developing less damaging and more sustainable management for frankincense trees...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of the bark of rubber tree {{over a long period}} is a major concern for rubber planters in order to cope with problems of early replanting due to limited financial means. One of the efficient solutions to this concern is tapping with less longer tapping cuts. The reduction of the tapping cut length in reverse tapping permits to manage better the tapping panel, to improve the productivity of the tapper and to increase the economical life span of rubber trees. On that respect, a study was conducted during six years in south-eastern Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to determine the}} length(s) of tapping cut, in downward tapping, which would provide a suitable solution to the problem of rubber farmers. The influence of the reduction of the tapping cut length on the parameters of yield, radial vegetative growth and physiological profile is evaluated in clones GT 1 and PB 235 of Hevea brasiliensis. Half, third, quarter and eighth spiral tapping cuts were compared to each other and to a full spiral cut (control). The reduction of the tapping cuts length induces losses in rubber yield compared with the control which yet are not proportional to the reduction of the tapping cuts length. The yield per centimetre of tapping cut is more important with the short cuts than the long cuts. Very strong correlations were determinate between <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> and rubber yield, <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> and annual mean girth increment and between <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> and physiological parameters (DRC and Pi). The curve tendency equations were also determinate. In terms of rubber yield, the PB 235 fits the reduction of the tapping cut length better than the GT 1. The reduction of tapping cuts length favours a better vegetative radial growth. It does not impair the physiological profile of the trees which show signs of under-exploitation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{productivity}} and the susceptibility to the tapping panel dryness (TPD) of Hevea brasiliensis are determined by the intrinsic feature of each clone but also by the tapping system. Thus, in order to establish the tapping system that minimizes the TDP occurrence an experiment was carried out in Côte d'Ivoire with four high yielding clones including, PB 235, PB 255, IRCA 18 and IRCA 111. Five tapping systems (d 2 6 d/ 7 0 /y, d 3 6 d/ 7 4 /y, d 4 6 d/ 7 6 /y, d 5 6 d/ 7 8 /y, d 6 6 d/ 7 10 /y) were applied to these clones, corresponding to a range of 100 % to 30 % of tapping intensities. The results show that the occurrence of TPD is closely related to the <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> and the tapping system which consists in tapping twice per week with one day rest (S/ 2 d 3 6 d/ 7 4 /y), was found to be the best tapping system. A quadratic relation was found between the rate of the TPD and the <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity.</b> Thus the clones IRCA 18 and IRCA 111, like PB 235 and PB 255, belong to the active metabolism clones. These clones also showed their adherence to the group of high rubber producer clones. This experiment also gave further evidence that the production of a tree for the tapping strongly depends on the intensity of tapping. It has also indicated that the intensity of tapping governed the tapping panel dryness rate among the clones having active metabolism, such as IRCA 18, IRCA 111, PB 235 and PB 255.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the steady-state packing fraction ϕ and force moment tensor Σ of quasi-two-dimensional granular columns subjected to tapping. Systems of different height h and width L are considered. We find that ϕ and Σ, which describe the macroscopic {{state of the}} system, are insensitive to L for L> 50 d (with d the grain diameter). However, results for granular columns of different heights cannot be conciliated. This suggests that comparison between results of different laboratories on this type of experiments can be done only for systems of same height. We show that a parameter ɛ= 1 +(Aω) ^{ 2 }/(2 gh), with A and ω the amplitude and frequency of the tap and g the acceleration of gravity, can be defined to characterize the <b>tap</b> <b>intensity.</b> This parameter {{is based on the}} effective flight of the granular bed, which takes into account the h dependency. When ϕ is plotted as a function of ɛ, the data collapses for systems of different h.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study by}} {{numerical}} simulation the compaction dynamics of frictional hard disks in two dimensions, subjected to vertical shaking. Shaking is modeled {{by a series}} of vertical expansions of the disk packing, followed by dynamical recompression of the assembly under the action of gravity. The second phase of the shake cycle is based on an efficient event−driven molecular−dynamics algorithm. We analyze the compaction dynamics for various values of friction coefficient and coefficient of normal restitution. We find that the time evolution of the density is described by ρ(t) =ρ ∞ − ∆ρEα[−(t/τ) α], where Eα denotes the Mittag−Leffler function of order 0 <α< 1. The parameter τ is found to decay with <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> Γ according to a power law τ ∝ Γ−γ, where parameter γ is almost independent of the material properties of grains.

40|$|The {{compaction}} {{dynamics of}} a granular media {{subject to a}} sequence of vertical taps made of fluid pulses is investigated via Molecular Dynamics simulations. Our study focuses on three different levels: macroscopic (volume fraction), mesoscopic (Voronoï volumes, force distributions) and microscopic (grain displacements). We show that the compaction process has many characteristics which are reminiscent of the slow dynamics of glass forming systems, as previously suggested. For instance the mean volume fraction slowly increases in time and approaches a stationary value following a stretched exponential law, and the associated compaction time diverges as the <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> decreases. The study of microscopic quantities also put in evidence the existence of analogies with the dynamics of glass formers, as the existence of dynamical heterogeneities and spatially correlated motion of grains; however it also shows that there are important qualitative differences, as for instance {{in the role of}} the cage effect. Correlations between geometry and dynamics of the system at the grain level are put in evidence by comparing a particle Voronoï volume and its displacement in a single tap...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Boswellian papyrifera, Frankincense tree, matrix model, {{population}} dynamics, population bottleneck, tapping. Combretum – Terminalia woodlands and Acacia – Commiphora woodlands {{are the two}} dominant vegetation {{types that}} cover {{large parts of the}} dry land areas in Ethiopia. Several of their tree and shrub species yield economically valuable products such as gum Arabic, frankincense and myrrh. Boswellia papyrifera provides the widely traded frankincense that accounts for > 80 % of the export revenues that the country is earning from gum and resin resources. Unfortunately, the Ethiopian dry woodlands and the B. papyrifera populations are disappearing rapidly due to the combined effects of over-harvesting gums and resins, overgrazing by livestock, recurrent fires, and excessive wood harvesting. The current lack of small saplings in the remaining populations of Boswellia suggests that the populations may not be sustained for the future. The main objectives of this thesis were to determine diversity and production patterns in B. papyrifera dominated dry woodlands, to show the regeneration status in various B. papyrifera populations, and to evaluate the effects of environment, frankincense harvesting, and grazing on the population dynamics of B. papyrifera. The main research questions were: (1) how do environmental conditions affect the tree/shrub species richness and production of Ethiopian dry woodlands? (2) what factors determine the frankincense production by B. papyrifera trees? (3) how do the vital rates and population dynamics of B. papyrifera vary across habitats that differ in soil conditions and biotic factors? (4) What are the major bottlenecks in the life cycle of the trees that hinder the sustainability of the remaining populations? To address these questions, tree populations were studied in the highlands of Abergelle and the lowlands of Metema. Metema also has a longer wet season length, higher annual rainfall and better soil fertility status than Abergelle. In total 36 and 22 tree and shrub species representing 20 and 9 families were recorded in Metema and Abergelle woodlands, respectively. The most dominant plant families were Burseraceae, Fabaceae, Combretaceae and Anacardiaceae. The vegetation at both sites was dominated by B. papyrifera. The two sites differed in species richness, diversity and production. Metema, the site with the longer wet season, had a higher species richness, diversity and production than Abergelle. The productivity of woodlands also increased with a higher clay content and greater soil depth. Populations structures indeed lacked the saplings, except for one very isolated population on a steep mountain slope. The studied frankincense trees produced 41 to 840 gram of frankincense during a year with seven collection rounds, and 185 to 1826 gram of frankincense during a year with 14 collection rounds. The variation in frankincense production was large across individuals. Frankincense production increased with tree size, <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity,</b> and tapping frequency. The increase in production, however, levelled-off beyond a stem diameter of 20 cm, a <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> of 9 spots, and a <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> of 10 rounds. Growth rate, survival rate and fruiting probability varied across populations, but were not related to soil conditions or biotic factors. The growth rates of the 12 Metema populations varied between 0. 86 to 0. 98, suggesting that they were all decreasing. Matrix model analyses indicated that the mortality of adult trees was the major bottleneck for sustainable population growth, and that the lack of sapling recruitment was a second major bottleneck. These bottlenecks appear both in tapped and non-tapped stands. Remarkably, tapped stand showed higher growth rates than nontapped stands, probably because productive stands were selected for harvesting resin. All results suggest that the remaining populations of B. papyrifera will disappear in the near future if the current situation continues. Frankincense production is expected to halve in 15 - 20 years. Unexpectedly, tapping had no negative effect on vital rates, nor on population growth rates indicating that other factors are responsible for the decline of the populations. Adult mortality by insect infestation and windfall, and the negative impact of grazing and fire on the establishment of saplings need extra attention. Management should be directed towards releasing two major population bottlenecks (improve sapling regeneration, reduce adult mortability) to maintain the Boswellia populations and frankincense production in the future.  ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the flow and jamming through small apertures of {{a column of}} granular disks via a pseudo-dynamic model. We focus on {{the effect that the}} preparation of the granular assembly has {{on the size of the}} avalanches obtained. Ensembles of packings with different mean packing fractions are created by tapping the system at different intensities. Surprisingly, packing fraction is not a good indicator of the ability of the deposit to jam a given orifice. Different mean avalanche sizes are obtained for deposits with the same mean packing fraction that were prepared with very different <b>tap</b> <b>intensities.</b> It has been speculated that the number and size of arches in the bulk of the granular column should be correlated with the ability of the system to jam a small opening. We show that this correlation, if exists, is rather poor. A comparison between bulk arches and jamming arches (i. e., arches that block the opening) reveals that the aperture imposes a lower cut-off on the horizontal span of the arches which is greater than the actual size of the opening. This is related to the fact that blocking arches have to have the appropriate orientation to fit the gap between two piles of grains resting at each side of the aperture.

40|$|We prepare static {{granular}} beds under gravity {{in different}} stationary states by tapping the system with pulsed excitations of controlled amplitude and duration. The macroscopic state [...] -defined by the ensemble of static configurations explored {{by the system}} tap after tap [...] -for a given <b>tap</b> <b>intensity</b> and duration is studied in terms of volume, $V$, and force moment tensor, $Sigma$. In a previous paper [Pugnaloni et al., Phys. Rev.

In this work, we present an analysis of the fluctuations of these variables that indicates that $V$ and $Sigma$ may be sufficient to define the macroscopic states. Moreover, we show that only one of the invariants of $Sigma$ is necessary, since each component of $Sigma$ falls onto a master curve when plotted as a function of $m{Tr}(Sigma) $. This  implies that these granular assemblies have a common shape for the stress tensor, even though it does not correspond to the hydrostatic type.

40|$|Understanding {{resource}} capture {{can help}} design appropriate species combinations, planting designs and management. Leaf area index (LAI) and its longevity {{are the most}} important factors defining dry matter production and thus growth and productivity. The ecophysiological modifications and yield of rubber (Hevea spp.) in an agroforestry system (AFS) with beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) were studied. The experiment was established in Southeast-Brazil, with three rubber cultivars: IAN 3087, RRIM 600 and RRIM 527. The AFS comprised double rows of rubber trees along with beans sown in autumn and winter seasons in 1999. There was about 50 % higher rubber yield per tree in the AFS than the rubber monoculture. Trees within the AFS responded to higher solar radiation availability with higher LAI and total foliage area, allowing its greater interception. All three cultivars had higher LAI in the AFS than monoculture, reaching maximum values in the AFS between April and May of 3. 17 for RRIM 527; 2. 83 for RRIM 600 and 2. 28 for IAN 3087. The maximum LAI values for monocrop rubber trees were: 2. 65, 2. 62 and 1. 99, respectively, for each cultivar. Rubber production and LAI were positively correlated in both the AFS and monoculture but leaf fall of rubber trees in the AFS was delayed and total phytomass was larger. It is suggested that trees in the AFS were under exploited and could yield more without compromising their life cycle if the tapping system was intensified. This shows how knowledge of LAI can be used to manage <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> in the field, leading to higher rubber yield...|$|E
40|$|In Thailand, the {{continuous}} {{decrease in the}} size of rubber plantations has led to the general adoption of intensive tapping systems which may lead to over harvesting, high rates of tapping panel dryness (TPD), short life-cycles of the plantations, and low labour productivity. In Thailand, farmers use a half-spiral downward tapping system (S/ 2) or a one third-spiral (S/ 3) with a tapping frequency of once two days (d 2) or more. To increase productivity, it is difficult to reduce tapping frequencies, even with ethylene stimulation, as this would result in days without work for tappers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize the behaviour of the Hevea latex yield under the double cut alternative tapping system (DCA). The aim was ensure the long-term sustainability of latex yield by increasing the time required for latex regeneration between two tappings through splitting this high <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> (100 % or above) into two different tapping cuts tapped alternately (S/ 2 d 47 d 7 (t,t). Over a period of 10 years, compared to a single cut tapping system (S/ 2 d 2) of equivalent intensity, DCA increased cumulative rubber production by 9 %. Ability of the trees to produce more latex under DCA was related to the sucrose and inorganic phosphorus contents of the latex cells in each tapping panel. DCA produced metabolic activity more favourable to yield during the first 10 years of tapping. But DCA also resulted in higher TPD rates, a sign of a metabolic dysfunction of the productive bark. DCA is a new tapping system. Further research is required to optimize the use of the DCA strategy. Such research will lead to new advances in our knowledge of the physiology of the rubber tree, mainly at the trunk scale. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Latex {{is a key}} {{product for}} many {{tropical}} countries, of which 80 % is produced by smallholders. Latex is produced by the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Given the 7 -year immature unproductive period, establishing a rubber plantation requires considerable investment by smallholders, emphasizing the need for sustainable management. The difficulty of performing an agronomic diagnosis of a tree crop is to obtain an accurate picture of current and past cultivation practices, {{to be able to}} assess their impacts on the agro-ecosystem as well as on sustainability. Smallholders do not usually keep records of latex yield or of their technical practices, making it impossible to perform a diagnosis based on productivity. As latex harvesting involves tapping the bark, which leaves scars on the trunk, we hypothesised that these morphological traces would be good indicators of current and past practices and would thus enable a diagnosis based on the economic lifespan of plantation. To this end, we formalised a tapping panel diagnosis that involved reproducing the scars on tapping panel diagrams, and analysing them using two indicators: the amount of virgin bark consumed and the number of tapping years that remained. We validated this tapping panel diagnosis in a sample of 25 smallholder plantations in Cameroon, where we characterised eight tapping management systems reflecting different levels of <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity.</b> The assessment of the respective share of each tapping practice on virgin bark consumption revealed major effects of tapping frequency and of shaving thickness. We showed that the tapping panel diagnosis used as a decision support tool can increase remaining tapping years by 33 % to 355 %. To conclude, the tapping panel diagnosis formalised {{here for the first time}} will be a useful support for the participatory development of innovating tapping management schemes involving both technicians and smallholders.

40|$|A {{granular}} material submitted to regular vertical vibrations {{such as those}} applied by a “tap-tap”, undergoes a progressive densification whose kinetic can be modelled by several empirical or heuristic models. These models, which correlate the experimental data of densification, use fitting parameters which are not related with a “local physics”. One of these famous models is the three parameters model of the James Frank Institute of Chicago [Knight et al., Phys. Rev. E 51, 3957 (1995) ]. This relation {{makes it possible to}} highlight two stages: a short first stage during which the relaxation occurs quickly and a second stage during which the steady state is reached asymptotically for very long times. Boutreux and de Gennes [Boutreux and De Gennes, Physica 244, 59 (1997) ] gave a theoretical justification of this equation by using an approach based on arguments of free volume and geometrical exclusion at the grain scale. On the other hand, {{on the basis of the}} works of Chicago's team, Lesaffre et al. [Lesaffre et al., C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Série IV, 647 (2000) ] developed a more general model that enables to describe the kinetics of relaxation of {{granular material}}s saturated with fluids of very different viscosities.

Nevertheless, these models require fitting parameters which are very dependent on the <b>taps</b> <b>intensity</b> and on the initial density.

The aim of this work is to develop a model describing the relaxation kinetic of a granular medium subjected to vertical vibrations. By using an approach of granular physics on one hand, and of soil mechanic on the other hand, the proposed model can be applied both to dry, saturated and unsaturated granular materials. The ability of this new model to describe the relaxation under taps for different granular materials and several water contents was successfully tested.

We show that the number of clusters and loops observed in the force networks as a function of the force threshold are markedly different for disks and pentagons if the tangential contact forces are considered, whereas they are surprisingly similar for the network defined by the normal forces. In particular, the results indicate that, overall, the force network is more heterogeneous for disks than for pentagons.

Previous scales were critically examined and compared and the need for a scale which simultaneously measures same and opposite sex responsiveness independently, and accounts for dynamic changes over time, while testing a number of overt and covert dimensions of sexual orientations, was established. A 48 -item scale was designed to <b>tap</b> self-reported <b>intensity</b> and frequency of Emotional Attachment, Sexual Fantasy, Sexual Attraction and Sexual Contact towards males and females in the Past, Present and Future. An initial study was conducted with 13 undergraduate university students of both genders, representing a variety of sexual orientations and nationalities, and qualitative feedback was obtained and utilized to make appropriate adjustments and refinements to the scale. The scale was then administered to 133 Rhodes University undergraduate psychology students to obtain quantitative data with regard to its internal structure. The scale was found to have a good internal consistency reliability Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0. 8106. Existing sub-scales had lower alpha coefficients. Factor analysis, a form of construct validation, was performed and four factors emerged. These had very good internal consistency reliability alpha coefficients: Sexual Responsiveness to Females (0. 9894), Sexual Responsiveness to Males (0. 9741), Emotional Attachment to Females (0. 8403) and Emotional Attachment to Males (0. 8372). These factors were further statistically analysed to ascertain how they relate to one another and to the demographics of gender, age, relational status and sexual orientation identity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the gum arabic yield from A. senegal by looking into the different management factors and its impacts on gum yield. Data collected included gum gardens survey and questionnaire of stakeholders and key informations. The investigation on the effect of tapping date on gum yield was carried for gum gardens at Elhimaira and Um habilla sites in North Kordofan while the questionnaire was carried at Elhimaira, Abokhrais, Um habilla and Elbragit villages in North Kordofan. For the effect of tapping date, the results show that, total yield of 240 g/tree was obtained at Um habilla and 140 g/tree at Elhimaira for tapping date done at the first of October being significantly better than later dates. The results of intercropping on the other hand, for the two sites of Um habilla and Elhimaira show that the total average yield per tree was highest for the pure stands being 267 g/tree and 252 g/tree respectively for the first of October tapping. At Um habilla, generally, the highest gum yield was recorded in pure A. senegal sites and the lowest gum yield was obtained for Roselle intercropping sites. The results of combination of tapping date and intercropping show that, at Elhimaira, November gave the highest yield (477. 39 g/tree) for A. senegal pure stands, followed by yield in relation to first October and first December respectively. These results indicate that pure stands have highest yield for first of October tapping dates for pure stands. The results show that, hashab tree is usually tapped in October at the age of 5 years in both of the two localities. The majority of farmers tapped between 4 - 8 branches for old hashab trees and few farmers tapped more than 8 branches in the two localities. For middle aged medium sized hashab trees most of the farmers tapped 4 - 8 branches in the two localities. For small trees most of farmers tapped less than 4 branches in the two localities. These results indicate that farmers understand the effect of <b>tapping</b> <b>intensity</b> on trees and tend to decrease the intensity of tapping with decreasing age or size of trees. The spacing commonly used for hashab planting is 4 × 4 meters for gum gardens establishment by seeds or seedlings.

40|$|The {{processing}} of auditory stimuli {{is essential for}} the correct perception of language and deficits in this ability are often related to the presence or development of language disorders. The motor imitation (e. g. tapping or beating) of rhythmic sequences can be a very sensitive correlate of deficits in auditory processing. Thus, the study of the tapping performance, with the investigation of both temporal and intensity information, might be very useful. The present work is aimed at the development and preliminary testing of a tapping device to be used for the imitation and/or the production of rhythmic sequences, allowing the recording of both <b>tapping</b> duration and <b>intensity.</b> The device is essentially made up of a Force Sensing Resistor and an Arduino UNO board. It was validated using different sampling frequencies (fs) in a group of 10 young healthy adults investigating its efficacy in terms of touch and intensity detection by means of two testing procedures. Results demonstrated a good performance of the device when programmed with fs equal to 50 and 100 Hz. Moreover, both temporal and intensity parameters were extracted, thus supporting the potential use of the device for the analysis of the imitation or production of rhythmic sequences. This work represents a first step {{for the development of a}} useful, low cost tool to support the diagnosis, training and rehabilitation of language disorders...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Episodes of Emergency Department (ED) service {{use among}} older adults {{previously}} {{have not been}} constructed, or evaluated as multi-dimensional phenomena. In this study, we constructed episodes of ED service use among a cohort of older adults over a 15 -year observation period, measured the episodes by severity and intensity, and compared these measures in predicting subsequent hospitalization. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of the prospective cohort study entitled the Survey on Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD). Baseline (1993) data on 5, 511 self-respondents ≥ 70 years old were linked to their Medicare claims for 1991 - 2005. Claims then were organized into episodes of ED care according to Medicare guidelines. The severity of ED episodes was measured with a modified-NYU algorithm using ICD 9 -CM diagnoses, {{and the intensity of}} the episodes was measured using CPT codes. Measures were evaluated against subsequent hospitalization to estimate comparative predictive validity. Results Over 15 years, three-fourths (4, 171) of the 5, 511 AHEAD participants had at least 1 ED episode, with a mean of 4. 5 episodes. Cross-classification indicated the modified-NYU severity measure and the CPT-based intensity measure captured different aspects of ED episodes (kappa = 0. 18). While both measures were significant independent predictors of hospital admission from ED episodes, the CPT measure had substantially higher predictive validity than the modified-NYU measure (AORs 5. 70 vs. 3. 31; p Conclusions We demonstrated an innovative approach for how claims data can be used to construct episodes of ED care among a sample of older adults. We also determined that the modified-NYU measure of severity and the CPT measure of <b>intensity</b> <b>tap</b> different aspects of ED episodes, and that both measures were predictive of subsequent hospitalization. </p...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction: In 2013, Madison Water Utility (MWU) {{consumed}} 19, 660, 250 kWh {{of energy}} to pump just over 10 {{million gallons of water}} (PSC 2013). Numerous benefits are observed by a utility when energy savings measures are implemented, with benefits being economic, environmental, operational, and customer relations in nature. Research performed for this project was aimed at identifying energy conserving practices, and applying them to Madison Water Utility?s system to observe the greatest energy savings. The objectives of the research are: 1. A system-wide variable frequency drive (VFD) study aimed at determining which wells in MWU?s system have characteristics that are ideal for future VFD installations 2. A system demand study in Pressure Zone 4, to characterize the impacts of peak demand periods on annual energy use 3. A hydraulic modeling study of Pressure Zone 4, aimed at estimating the energy savings produced by capital improvements and modifications to hydraulic operations within the zone. Background: On average, drinking water utilities are allocating 30 - 40 % of their total annual operating budget to energy use, of which 94 % or more can be attributed to pumping (Hamilton et al. 2009 and Elliot et al. 2003). Energy intensity can be defined as the amount of energy required to pump, treat, and deliver water to the customer?s <b>tap.</b> Energy <b>intensity</b> is a metric used to benchmark utilities on, and is reported as kilowatt-hours per thousand gallons pumped (kWh/kgal). In 2013, Madison Water Utility consumed 1. 95 kWh/kgal, close to the Wisconsin groundwater utility average of 1. 94 kWh/kgal (PSC 2013). However, energy savings are attainable, with estimates by the Water Research Foundation (WRF) predicting 10 - 30 % savings by all water utilities (WRF 2011). Energy consumption by pumping systems can be divided into two categories: energy consumed by components that are lifting water, and excess energy consumed due to inefficiencies. Deep well pumps and booster pumps lift water from the ground to the distribution system where it can flow into customer?s taps, consuming large amounts {{of energy to}} complete this process. Along the way, energy inefficiencies accumulate, requiring more energy to deliver water than would otherwise be needed. Inefficiencies may include friction, an improperly sized pump, elevated water pressure at a tap, or an aging motor that is no longer operating at its maximum efficiency. To combat high energy use, energy conservation practices including variable frequency drive (VFD) installation, hydraulic grade line management, and flow distribution analyses were tested. Furthermore, pipe modification to reduce headloss, demand reductions to conserve water, and well refurbishment to improve efficiency were examined. Finally, off-peak pumping was tested to determine feasibility and potential energy savings of running pumps at night when energy rates are lowest. Methods: Three studies were performed with the goal of minimizing energy use in as many ways as possible. Much of the analysis revolved around Pressure Zone 4 (PZ 4), while the remaining analysis was performed on previously tested wells. The VFD study used previously collected data by Baniel (2013) to group wells according to specific capacity, a well property that defines the amount of drawdown for a given flow rate. Wells were grouped into low, medium, and high specific capacities, and a representative from each group was analyzed for energy savings and payback. This study allowed for the selection of a group of wells with which to implement VFDs in the future. The energy use characterization of various system demands study utilized MWU?s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and Madison Gas and Electric (MG&E) as data sources. Analysis of SCADA data was performed to identify flow ranges, or flow bins, where energy use was high. The hydraulic modeling software H 2 OMAP Water GIS was then used to test the energy use in each flow bin in Pressure Zone 4, attempting to identify flow bins which were consuming large quantities of energy. The study allowed for energy conservation measures to be specifically applied and optimized in flow bins of interest. The final study revolved around PZ 4, specifically Unit Wells 9 and 31. Again, the hydraulic modeling software H 2 OMAP Water GIS was used to test (1) the optimal VFD speed of the UW 31 deep well pump, (2) off-peak pumping feasibility, (3) optimal flow distribution between the two wells, and (4) optimal hydraulic grade line. Significant input data was required to test the various scenarios including pump curves, MG&E rates, PZ 4 demands, and information about the proposed well (UW 31). Energy use and predicted savings were identified for each model variable, then payback of the option was determined to identify the economic feasibility. This study provided estimates of how to operate PZ 4 in the most energy efficient manner. Results: Results of the VFD study outlined the projected energy savings of high, medium, and low specific capacity site of Madison Water Utility. It was found that high specific capacity sites (> 21. 1 gpm/ft) generally had low energy use, low head savings, and low cost savings. Medium specific capacity sites (13. 8 ? 21. 1 gpm/ft) were found to have higher energy use than high specific capacity sites, on average, with greater potential for head savings. Large energy savings were found to be possible in some cases, with payback periods between 5 and 10 years being possible. Low specific capacity well sites ( 2. 1 MGD); Pressure Zones 7, 8, 9, and 10 all have similar characteristics and off-peak pumping should be tested in these zones. ? Operate UW 9 and UW 31 between a 60 / 40 operation and 75 / 25 operation to combat seasonal demand fluctuations, to maintain hydraulic residence time, and energy conservation guidelines by MWU. A 60 / 40 operation works during all seasons. ? Do not perform hydraulic grade line reductions in PZ 4 due to pressure concerns. ? Do not perform pipe modifications in PZ 4 to save energy, but only for operational reasons such as improved flow conditions. ? Continue flow reduction efforts as they have been found to conserve energy and water. ? Continue use of the hydraulic modeling software due to the benefits of energy analyses it can perform prior to implementing options, especially on small pressure zones and preliminary testing of alternatives...|$|R
