Using a sample of 25 developing countries observed over 15 years, we estimate {{the impact of}} reforms aimed at opening these countries through trade and financial channels {{to the rest of the}} world. The estimation of time-varying cross-country correlations allows the econometric investigation to be performed using a panel data framework, thus raising the quality of the statistical inference.

40|$|Many <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisations</b> {{and other}} {{economic}} reforms in developing countries, particularly in Africa, have been reversed. In addition {{to the loss of}} benefits from reform as such this tendency has led to concern that the response to reform, particularly from investment, may be weakened by the perception that it may be reversed and in turn that weak investment may itself lessen the chances of successful reform. These themes have been discussed extensively in the literature, the current paper's contribution being to develop a much more complete model of the investment response than previously available and to use it to partially endogenise the probability of reform reversal so the two are simultaneously determined. With respect to the reversal probability the argument presented is that a strong investment response in the favoured sector will of itself tend to discourage reversal of the reform (through a lobbying mechanism or simply by the existence of a larger constituency opposed to reversal) while the gradual depreciation of capital in the nonfavoured sector will weaken opposition to reform continuation.

25|$|The {{export markets}} have been {{severely}} damaged by competition from cheaper Caribbean and Latin American competitors. But domestic manufacturing also faces serious potential problems, as <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisation</b> {{means that the}} government can no longer protect national industries by imposing high tariffs on imported goods. Thus, Barbadian manufacturers must compete with those from other regional economies, whose wage costs and other overheads are usually much lower. The other significant industrial employer is the petroleum sector, where oil deposits are located in the southern parishes but oil has not been produced in commercial quantities; although the island's small oil refinery was closed in 1998 and refining moved to Trinidad and Tobago, where labour and other costs are cheaper.|$|E
25|$|Since TRIPS {{came into}} force, {{it has been}} subject to {{criticism}} from developing countries, academics, and non-governmental organizations. Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisation</b> also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of artificial scarcity on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism {{has focused on the}} failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries. Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market. In particular, the illegality of pre-clinical trials or submission of samples for approval until a patent expires have been blamed for driving the growth of a few multinationals, rather than developing country producers.|$|E
40|$|Internationalisation of German {{agribusiness}} firms {{after the}} EU enlargement: strategies, challenges and success Abstract. In recent years, the internationalisation of firm activities {{has been a}} significant trend in the agribusiness sector. To a great degree, this development has been fuelled by <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisations</b> and the EU enlargement, but also by the strong economic growth in many transforming and developing economies. Against this background, this paper identifies the strategies and instruments that agribusiness companies currently use when internationalising their business. The paper presents the empirical results of a survey that was undertaken between April and August 2010 with the participation of 113 German agribusiness firms. The majority of respondents expect that the globalisation of agricultural markets will increase remarkably in the future. For developing international business activities, comparatively simple strategies, such as direct and indirect exports, are most widely used. Agribusiness firms face various challenges in international markets, including problems with quality control, corruption, tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, as well as low availability of qualified workers and managers and a lack of legal security. Despite these difficulties and challenges, three-fourths of those interviewed indicated that they had either reached or exceeded the goals set for their international expansion.

25|$|Trade {{liberalization}} may shift economic inequality from {{a global}} to a domestic scale. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled {{workers in the}} rich countries may see reduced wages {{as a result of}} the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisation</b> has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.|$|E

The idea was controversial, as it pitted proponents of imperial trade with those who sought a general policy of <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisation</b> with all nations. The Dominions, particularly Canada, were also adamantly against dispensing with their import tariffs, which [...] "dispelled any romantic notions of a 'United Empire'."

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} trade and domestic agricultural policy reforms {{on the distribution of}} incomes in six developing countries: Brazil, China, India, Malawi, Mexico and South Africa. The aggregate results from a global trade model are fed into separate national models. The insights available from alternative model types are evaluated. The distributional impacts of reform are found to be complex and to vary between countries. Given that it is typically impossible to reform (or equally not reform) without hurting some households with lower incomes, the conclusion is that it makes sense to help these households with targeted policies. <b>trade</b> reform, <b>liberalisation,</b> agriculture, income distribution, poverty, general equilibrium, Financial Economics, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written on {{jurisdictional}} problems arising out of the transnationality of the internet in various legal fields. This article approaches this jurisprudence from an angle that emphasises the underlying substance of the concerns - by joining it with the quite separate discourse on ?cultural diversity? {{in the age of}} globalisation. The discussion comes partly as a response to those who believe that legal harmonisation is, or would be, impracticalities aside, the Holy Grail to many online regulatory problems. It is not. At the same time, the retention of ?cultural diversity? and its implicit endorsement by States in face of the ?threat? of online globality is not unproblematic either. The article outlines pre-internet incidents of globalisation (i. e. <b>trade</b> <b>liberalisations</b> in the EU and under the WTO as well as the creation of universal human rights) that triggered the emergence of ?cultural diversity? as a distinct value protected by various legal concepts and regimes. Yet, it is argues, these trends are both continued and discontinued by the full-on online confrontation with Otherness. As this all-pervasive Otherness cannot be contained where ?it belongs?, it becomes a threat to cultural identity, including its legal manifestations. Using child protection as a case study - because it brings to the fore substantial cultural and legal divergence even amongst European States - the article explores how States may respond to that perceived threat and what this response means for our substantive rules, regulatory mechanisms and the ?national? legal/cultural space. These arguments are applicable to any legal subject-matter challenged by online transnationality (e. g. data protection, defamation law and even commercial areas such as copyright law) ...|$|R

This paper empirically investigates the impacts of four different measures of trade openness and globalisation on the unemployment rate in an unbalanced panel framework. The analysis focuses on the G 7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Robust empirical findings from panel data estimates demonstrate that, along with macroeconomic indicators and market size, all the measures of trade openness and globalisation are significantly and negatively associated with the unemployment rate. Therefore, we conclude that the continuation of the globalisation process instead of protectionism is of great importance in reducing the unemployment rate in developed economies...|$|R

40|$|<b>Trade</b> policy <b>liberalisation</b> {{requires}} institutional change, in {{the sense}} of a change in the rules of the game. The question is whether these changes produce "superior institutions" judged in terms of a reduction of transactions costs; improved coordination; stronger strategic commitment to investing in needed specific assets; and allocative efficiency. In conventional approaches to the analysis of liberalisation, changed institutional arrangements are studied, but they tend to be considered in the category of "practical details": important but not especially intellectually interesting. In contrast, this paper argues for a parallel approach to the study of the effects of liberalisation on the rural poor, in which institutional matters are central. A broad range of institutional issues is considered, informed by a theoretical framework provided by the various strands within institutional economics. The framework set out and discussed leads to the contention that smallholder agriculture in poor countries needs coordinated market economy (CME) type institutions if it is to develop, at least at the earlier stages. Ideally, these would be based on deliberative institutions, working horizontally inside a sector, and also vertically along the supply chain. It is argued that the way forward is likely to involve a rethinking of the role of the state (at sub-national, national and international - aid donor - levels) and of the roles of producer organisations and other stakeholder (including trader) associations. The aim must be to find a way in which the state and other powerful actors can initiate deliberative processes and take a lead in encouraging appropriate asset specific investments, while at the same time planning to fade into the background as initial success is achieved. These conclusions challenge conventional analysis of <b>trade</b> policy <b>liberalisation</b> in poor countries and also challenge institutional specialists to provide insights, ideally quantifiable, into the consequences of those liberalisation policies which drive changes in such features as "non-standard institutional arrangements"; non-market coordination; and the roles of government.
