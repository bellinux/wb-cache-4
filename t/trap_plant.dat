Samples of infested stems can be cut open to find caterpillars and pupae, however {{it is a good idea}} to rear these until adulthood to be certain that they are C. partellus pests.Cultural practicesIntercropping or mixing maize with non-host crops like cassava can reduce the population of C. partellus. Trap plants such as Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) may also be used. These plants draw the adult female away from the crop and more eggs are laid on the <b>trap</b> <b>plant</b> than on the host plant crop, and this leads to poor development of larvae. This method is also known as [...] "push-pull".Also, marking sure to destroy all residue of infested maize to ensure the death of all larvae would decrease the chances of reinfestation.|$|E
5000|$|Trap crops can {{be planted}} around the {{circumference}} of the field to be protected, which is assumed {{to act as a}} barrier for entry by pests, or they can be interspersed among the focul crop, for example being planted every ninth row. Planting crops in rows helps facilitate supplemental management practices that prevent insect pest dispersal back into the main field, [...] such as driving a vehicle above the trap crop which then removes insect pests by vacuuming them off of the trap crop row [...] or targeted insecticides, which are only deployed on the trap crop. Even if pesticides are used to control insects on the trap crop, total pesticides are greatly reduced in this scenario over conventional agricultural pesticide applications because they are only deployed on {{a small portion of the}} farm (the trap crop). Other strategies that prevent dispersal of insect pests back into the main crop include cutting the trap plants, applying predators to the <b>trap</b> <b>plant</b> that eat the pest, and planting a high ratio of trap plants to other plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{push-pull}} technology involves use of behaviour-modifying stimuli {{to manipulate the}} distribution and abundance of stemborers and beneficial insects for management of stemborer pests. It is based on in-depth understanding of chemical ecology, agrobiodiversity, plant-plant and insect-plant interactions, and involves intercropping a cereal crop with a repellent intercrop such as Desmodium uncinatum (silverleaf) (push), with an attractive <b>trap</b> <b>plant</b> such as Napier grass (pull) planted as a border crop around this intercrop. Gravid stemborer females are repelled from the main crop and are simultaneously attracted to the trap crop. Napier grass produces {{significantly higher levels of}} attractive volatile compounds (green leaf volatiles), cues used by gravid stemborer females to locate host plants, than maize or sorghum. There is also an increase of approximately 100-fold in the total amounts of these compounds produced in the first hour of nightfall by Napier grass (scotophase), the period at which stemborer moths seek host plants for laying eggs, causing the differential oviposition preference. However, many of the stemborer larvae, about 80%, do not survive, as Napier grass tissues produce sticky sap in response to feeding by the larvae, which traps them, causing their mortality. Legumes in the Desmodium genus (silverleaf, D. uncinatum and greenleaf, D. intortum), on the other hand, produce repellent volatile chemicals that push away the stemborer moths. These include (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene, semiochemicals produced during damage to plants by herbivorous insects and are responsible for the repellence of Desmodium to stemborers.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{evolutionary}} {{relationship between}} Frankia and actinorhizal plants was evaluated by reconstructing molecular phylogenetic trees from nifH, 16 S rDNA, and rbcL nucleotide sequences. Subgroupings in Frankia phylogenetic trees reconstructed from nifH and from 16 S rDNA sequences were consistent {{in terms of}} plant origins of Frankia strains. Although the branching order of Frankia 16 S rDNA and plant rbcL trees were different, subgroupings of Frankia and of plants correlated well in terms of symbiotic partnership. Tree matching, estimated divergence times, and molecular clock hypothesis tests indicated that Frankia clades diverged more recently than plant clades and that actinorhizal symbioses originated {{more than three times}} after the plant clades diverged. A phylogenetic tree of Ceanothus species, which are symbiotic partners of Frankia, was reconstructed using ndhF gene sequences. The analysis identified two main clades corresponding to two subgenera: Ceanothus and Cerastes. The analysis also suggested that three monophyletic clades within the subgenus ceanothus can be delimited on the basis of vegetative characters. Based on rbcL sequences, the two subgenera diverged 18 - 39 million years ago whereas species within each subgenus diverged more recently. These results support the current division of Ceanothus into two monophyletic subgenera and agree with the postulated recent divergence of many species within each subgenus. Specificity between Ceanothus species and their Frankia microsymbionts was evaluated by analysis of DNA in nodules collected from three copopulations of Ceanothus species. Sequencing of the intergenic spacer region between 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes suggested that Ceanothus-microsymbiont Frankia are closely related. Nodules were further analyzed by genomic fingerprinting using repetitive sequences and PCR (rep-PCR). A newly designed, direct repeat sequence and a BOX sequence showed that Ceanothus-microsymbiont Frankia exhibited less diversity within each copopulation than among copopulations. Furthermore, geographic separation was a more important factor for divergence of Ceanothus-microsymbiont Frankia than host plant. The population of Ceanothus-infective Frankia in soils under stands of Ceanothus velutinus and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), a non-host plant, were compared. The population sizes were measured using plant bioassay methods with C. velutinus, C. sanguineus, and C. integerrimus as <b>trap</b> <b>plants.</b> Population size in soil under C. velutinus was about 10 times higher than that under the Douglas-fir.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization was higher in seedling roots in soil taken from sites with healthy canopies, whereas colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi dominated in roots in soil taken from sites with declining canopies. Furthermore, several soil chemical properties predicted canopy condition and the type of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots.

40|$|Abstract Trap {{cropping}} {{and biological}} control {{can provide a}} sustainable means of controlling insect pests. Insects in the genus Lygus (Hemiptera: Miridae) are major pests on cotton and hor-ticultural crops throughout the United States, and pesticide resis-tance within Lygus populations necessitates more sustainable long-term management techniques. Here, we explore behavioral responses of Lygus bugs (L. rubrosignatus Knight) and an introduced parasitoid, Peristenus relictus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), to a common field edge plant, Erigeron annuus, which {{has the potential to}} serve as a trap host. Erigeron annuus is attractive to Lygus in the field, with Lygus preferentially moving to Erigeron patches compared to more abundant cotton plants. To determine the role of odor cues in mediating this attraction, we collected volatiles from E. annuus with and without Lygus damage, and then tested the attractiveness of these volatiles vs. those of cotton to Lygus females and female P. relictus wasps using Y-tube and wind tunnel bioassays. We found that undamaged E. annuus emits high concentrations of a complex volatile blend (60 + compounds), with novel compounds induced and constitutive compounds up-regulated in response to damage. Additionally, both female Lygus bugs and female P. relictus wasps are highly attracted to E. annuus volatiles over those of cotton in almost every combination of damage treatments. Our results suggest that Erigeron annuus would be an effective <b>trap</b> <b>plant</b> to control Lygus in cotton, since it is highly attractive to both the pest and its natural enemy...|$|E

We hypothesized that, in addition to more favorable edaphic factors, the inoculum potential of beneficial vesicular–arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi was higher, and therefore, more favorable for cactus seedling establishment under the mesquite tree canopy (UC) compared to adjacent barren areas (BAs) away from the trees. In the greenhouse inoculum potential assays, VAM fungi were detected in onion (Allium cepa) trap plants from all soil samples regardless of collection site, but cardon cactus (P. pringlei) trap seedlings formed no VAM even after 6. 5 months. Test soils were further used to preinoculate new onion seedlings transplanted into pots, to serve as nurse plants to inoculate adjacent cardon seedlings by vegetative transfer. After 15 months, cardon seedlings did develop slight VAM colonization, confined exclusively to the outermost cortical layers.

DNA was extracted directly from plant roots, soil or isolated AMF spores, and prominent bands resulting from AMF-specific DGGE profiles were excised for sequence analysis. This strategy provided a robust means of detecting and identifying AMF-like species without the use of <b>trap</b> <b>plant</b> cultivation methods.

In addition, there were discrepancies observed between the AMF-like groups detected in spore populations vs. direct 18 S rDNA analysis of root material, corroborating previous suggestions that spore inspection alone may poorly represent actual AMF population structure [KEYWORDS: AMF, Glomeromycota, Glomus, PCR-DGGE, Scutellospora, zygomycetes...|$|E
40|$|Lepidopterous stemborers, and {{parasitic}} striga weeds {{belonging to}} the family Orobanchaceae, attack cereal crops in sub-Saharan Africa causing severe yield losses. The smallholder farmers are resource constrained and unable to afford expensive chemicals for crop protection. The push–pull technology, a chemical ecology- based cropping system, is developed for integrated pest and weed management in cereal–livestock farming systems. Appropriate plants were selected that naturally emit signaling chemicals (semiochemicals). Plants highly attractive for stemborer egg laying were selected and employed as trap crops (pull), to draw pests away from the main crop. Plants that repelled stemborer females were selected as intercrops (push). The stemborers are attracted to the <b>trap</b> <b>plant,</b> and are repelled from the main cereal crop using a repellent intercrop (push). Root exudates of leguminous repellent intercrops also effectively control the parasitic striga weed through an allelopathic mechanism.

This involves intercropping cereal crops, the main staple and cash crops for millions of smallholder farmers in the continent, with forage legumes in the genus Desmodium and planting Napier grass as a <b>trap</b> <b>plant</b> around this intercrop. Stemborer pests are attracted to Napier grass (pull) and are repelled from the main cereal crop by the repellent desmodium (push).

A complete list of plants named by him {{can be found on the}} IPNI.|$|R
40|$|The work {{attempts}} {{to determine the}} impact of small hydrotechnical structures on channel hydromorphology {{as a measure of}} river restoration. The experiment was set up in Flinta River in Polish lowland where extensive hydromorphological survey was competed. At the first stage of restoration project containers filled with plant clumps working as sediment <b>traps</b> (<b>plant</b> basket hydraulic structures – PBHS) were introduced. Those structures were relatively small but at the same time, large enough to change the river flow efficiently – working like low crested weirs. Two year monitoring program provided information about the impact of introducing such structures on river morphology and explained the PBHS impact on flow pattern of the river...|$|R
