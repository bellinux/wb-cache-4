5|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2011, several renovations took place, {{affecting}} primarily the high school. All front-facing windows of the high school were replaced with energy-efficient windows, and a permanent-storage building was constructed on the northeast side to store auditorium and maintenance supplies. In addition, many of the computers in the school were replaced with <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> computers. In 2013, the school's cardiovascular and weight lifting center was improved with more machines and equipment, increased space, new flat screen televisions, and other additions. In 2013 and 2014, the school's fields on the property were remediated due to the use of contaminated fill. The football field was completed with artificial turf, as well as the track and artificial turf baseball field; an artificial turf hockey field was to be completed by Labor Day. The lower soccer field will be reconstructed after the fall 2014 soccer season. Work on the softball field was finished in fall 2013. A security plan is to be submitted to the New York State Education Department; it includes plans to upgrade the main entrance doors and construct vestibules and greeter stations.|$|E

50|$|One {{common use}} of AnywhereTS is {{recycling}} old computers into <b>thin</b> <b>clients.</b> The modest hardware requirements (Pentium II with 32 MB RAM) {{have made it}} possible even for many organizations in developing countries to convert PCs to <b>thin</b> <b>clients.</b>|$|R

25|$|An X {{terminal}} is a <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> {{that only}} runs an X server.

This use is very much aligned with the original intention of the MIT project.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the rise}} of <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> {{computing}} using HTML as an intermediate format has reduced the need for ODBC.

In these scenarios, {{there is no direct}} client-side access nor multiple client software systems to support; everything goes through the programmer-supplied HTML application. The virtualization that ODBC offers is no longer a strong requirement, and development of ODBC is no longer as active as it once was.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thin</b> <b>clients</b> {{have their}} roots in {{multi-user}} systems, traditionally mainframes accessed by some sort of terminal computer. As computer graphics matured, these terminals transitioned from providing a command-line interface to a full graphical user interface, as is common on modern advanced <b>thin</b> <b>clients.</b> The prototypical multiuser environment along these lines, Unix, began to support fully graphical X terminals, i.e., devices running display server software, from about 1984. X terminals remained relatively popular even after the arrival of other <b>thin</b> <b>clients</b> in the mid-late 1990s. Modern Unix derivatives like BSD and Linux continue {{the tradition of the}} multi-user, remote display/input session. Typically, X software is not made available on non-X-based <b>thin</b> <b>clients,</b> although no technical reason for this exclusion would prevent it.|$|R

25|$|Remote Desktop Services (RDS), {{known as}} Terminal Services in Windows Server 2008 and earlier, {{is one of}} the {{components}} of Microsoft Windows that allows a user to take control of a remote computer or virtual machine over a network connection. RDS is Microsoft's implementation of <b>thin</b> <b>client,</b> where Windows software, and the entire desktop of the computer running RDS, are made accessible to a remote client machine that supports Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). With RDS, only software user interfaces are transferred to the client system. All input from the client system is transmitted to the server, where software execution takes place. This is in contrast to application streaming systems, like Microsoft App-V, in which computer programs are streamed to the client on-demand and executed on the client machine.|$|E

This means the computer running the <b>thin</b> <b>client</b> {{does not have to be}} a very powerful computer, and it does not require a fast network connection as it is not loading data from the database - JADE thin clients are often run over a dial-up connection. This is the reason they are called thin clients, as there is not a heavy requirement on computational power to run these clients.|$|E
