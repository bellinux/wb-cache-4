Contracts included flying pilgrims from Morocco to Mecca and Scandinavians to North America. After having lost 100 million Danish krone (DKK) by 1979, Unison was sold to Tjæreborg in 1980.

25|$|If The Age of Innocence alienated and {{confused}} some fans, then Kundun (1997) went several steps further, offering {{an account of}} the early life of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, the People's Liberation Army's entering of Tibet, and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not least a departure in subject matter, Kundun also saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate tableau of colorful visual images. The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Buena Vista Pictures, which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting Kundun’s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it generally appears Kundun has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. Kundun was the director's second attempt <b>to</b> <b>profile</b> the life of a great religious leader, following The Last Temptation of Christ.|$|E

The book is most commonly described, and marketed, as a [...] "biography". One reviewer grouped it with the 2005 book The Golden Spruce {{as part of a}} new genre: an [...] "arbobiography".|$|E

She noted the [...] "abundance of materials for the [...] history of action" [...] and attempted to add balance by telling the feminine side, referring to the founding [...] "mothers" [...] as giving [...] "nurture in the domestic sanctuary of that love of civil liberty which afterwards kindled into a flame and {{shed light on the}} world".|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the sequel}} was {{conceived}} at one of Marvel's semi-annual editorial retreats. Axel Alonso, editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics, stated that unlike other major comic book storylines which take years of planning, he only had {{three to four months}} to plan [...] "Civil War II". This abbreviated timetable was necessary in order to capitalize on the release of the feature film , which was released in May 2016. According to the official synopsis, a strange new character with the power to accurately predict the outcome of future events comes {{to the attention of the}} world. This power divides the heroes on how best to utilize the information, with Captain Marvel wanting <b>to</b> <b>profile</b> future crimes before they occur, and Iron Man believing that [...] "the punishment cannot come before the crime." [...] The situation reaches a turning point when it is predicted that one of the heroes will be the cause of major destruction, forcing the others to make a difficult decision. Bendis said, [...] "People's personal accountability is the theme of this one... from the way cops are acting on camera, to the way people talk to each other online." [...] The plot for [...] "Civil War II" [...] began to develop in the second volume of The Invincible Iron Man, which is also written by Bendis and drawn by Marquez.|$|E
