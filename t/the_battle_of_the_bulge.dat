5|$|All {{who were}} wounded and {{captured}} recovered {{to return home}} after the war. In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, including one on The Ardennes: <b>The</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge.</b> Author Hugh M. Cole only briefly mentioned Bouck's platoon, which upset former platoon member William James (who had changed his name from Tsakanikas). James contacted Bouck and encouraged him to get his men proper recognition.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, the 6th Airborne Division {{was one of}} {{only two}} {{airborne}} divisions raised by the British Army during the Second World War. Before being deployed to Palestine, the division had served only in Europe. It had participated in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> in December. After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern shoulder of <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> was a sticking point for the entire offensive operation. Had the Americans given way, the German advance would have overrun the vast supply depots around Liège and Spa and possibly have changed {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Bulge.|$|E
5|$|In August 1944, it was {{the first}} Allied unit to enter Belgium when it was {{deployed}} to the Ardennes and Limburg. The small team, mounted in armed Jeeps, managed to kill more than 300 German soldiers and destroy over 100 vehicles during the mission. Later, the unit fought in the Netherlands and also served as a reconnaissance unit in the Ardennes during <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> in the winter of 1944.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the war, {{large numbers of}} public memorials were erected {{around the country in}} memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict. There are numerous monuments and streets dedicated to Allied politicians and generals, including Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels. The large numbers of British and American cemeteries and memorials, particularly in the Ardennes region associated with <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> meant that the legacy of the war was very visible.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Troy Houston Middleton (12 October 1889 – 9 October 1976) was a {{distinguished}} educator and senior {{officer of the}} United States Army {{who served as a}} corps commander in the European Theatre during World War II and later as president of Louisiana State University (LSU). He {{is best known for his}} decision to hold Bastogne during <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> contrary to the recommendation of Lieutenant General George S.

5|$|Model {{first came}} to Hitler's {{attention}} before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942. His tenacious style of fighting and dedication to the Nazi cause won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him {{one of his best}} field commanders and repeatedly tasked him with retrieving desperate situations. However, their relationship had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge.</b> In April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather than be captured and stand trial for war crimes.|$|E

5|$|Operation Bodenplatte (Baseplate), {{launched}} on 1 January 1945, {{was an attempt}} by the Luftwaffe to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries during the Second World War. The goal of Bodenplatte was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge</b> so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. The operation was planned for 16 December 1944, but was delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year’s Day, the first day that happened to be suitable.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> a German counteroffensive during World War II, {{starting}} December 16, 1944, {{was marked}} by heavy snowstorms that hampered allied air support for ground troops, but also impaired German attempts to supply their front lines. On the Eastern Front with the Nazi invasion of Russia in 1941, Operation Barbarossa, both Russian and German soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the Russian winter. While use of ski infantry was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only one division for movement on skis.|$|E
5|$|The M21 {{served on}} the Western Front, seeing action in Normandy and in {{southern}} France, before later being used during <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bulge,</b> the Battle of Belgium, Operation Market Garden, and the invasion of Germany from the west. The M21 served with the US 3rd, 1st, and 7th Armies during the campaign in France, and the 2nd Armored Division, which developed it. In addition, 57 examples were leased to Free French forces. By 1945, it was declared obsolete, due to the insufficient power of the 81mm mortar as an artillery piece.|$|E
