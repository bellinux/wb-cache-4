500|$|Robert California (James Spader) confronts Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{about the}} number of mishaps and blunders made in the office, and gives him a firm {{directive}} to bring them to a stop. With no ideas on how to make <b>this</b> <b>come</b> about, Andy puts it in the hands of Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who devises a system to find mistakes made by employees in the office. He programs an [...] "efficiency motivator" [...] that will forward incriminating emails to California if they make five mistakes in one day, effectively causing them to lose their jobs. The rest of the office are unhappy with Dwight's system, and call it a doomsday device. Despite their best efforts, the group manages to make five mistakes barely halfway through the first day with the system, and Dwight reveals that the emails will be automatically sent to California at 5:00 pm. Andy pleads with Dwight to deactivate the system, but Dwight refuses, belittles the rest of the office staff for being so careless, and retreats to Schrute Farms.|$|E
500|$|Innovation in 18th-century Birmingham {{often took}} the form of {{incremental}} series of small-scale improvements to existing products or processes, but also included major developments that lay {{at the heart of the}} emergence of industrial society. In 1709 the Birmingham-trained Abraham Darby I moved to Coalbrookdale in Shropshire and built the first blast furnace to successfully smelt iron ore with coke, transforming the quality, volume and scale on which it was possible to produce cast iron. In 1732 Lewis Paul and John Wyatt invented roller spinning, the [...] "one novel idea of the first importance" [...] in the development of the mechanised cotton industry. In 1741 they opened the world's first cotton mill in Birmingham's Upper Priory. In 1746 John Roebuck invented the lead chamber process, enabling the large-scale manufacture of sulphuric acid, and in 1780 James Keir developed a process for the bulk manufacture of alkali, together marking the birth of the modern chemical industry. In 1765 Matthew Boulton opened the Soho Manufactory, pioneering the combination and mechanisation under one roof of previously separate manufacturing activities through a system known as [...] "rational manufacture". As the largest manufacturing unit in Europe <b>this</b> <b>come</b> to symbolise the emergence of the factory system.|$|E

500|$|King Henry {{took part}} in the jousting, {{sporting}} Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young Gabriel, comte de Montgomery, knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face. Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters [...] "of a good bigness" [...] sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Château de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, [...] "for fear", {{in the words of a}} chronicler, [...] "of being expelled by the Queen". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words [...] "lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor" [...] ("from <b>this</b> <b>come</b> my tears and my pain"), and wore black mourning in memory of Henry.|$|E

2500|$|Media {{response}} to Odd Blood was generally favorable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalized rating of 78 out of 100 based on 36 critical reviews. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described Yeasayer's new material as a {{consolidation of the}} work on All Hour Cymbals into [...] "a series of shapely pop songs"; he stated, [...] "The album aims for pleasure rather than introspection, {{and most of the}} time, it hits the mark." [...] Summing it up as [...] "both odd and bloody marvelous", Will Dean of The Guardian labeled Odd Blood [...] "a masterclass in modern, multicultural, weirdo pop music". Will Hermes of Rolling Stone commented that, like fellow Brooklyn bands Dirty Projectors and Animal Collective, Yeasayer are [...] "pioneers of a scene that refuses to choose between a sense of experimental adventure and pure pop pleasure", while Allmusic's Andrew Leahey noted that the record is [...] "a thinking man's album, one that requires its listeners to put on their thinking caps as well as their dancing shoes". Zach Schonfeld of PopMatters praised the album's [...] "jungle-dense beats and rainbow synths" [...] and wrote that Yeasayer [...] "avoided the sophomore slump the only way they know how: by fearlessly dismantling everything that made their debut a safe bet." [...] Josh Modell of Spin concluded, [...] "So, two exciting questions: Where did <b>this</b> <b>come</b> from, and what's coming next?" ...|$|E
