5000|$|Particle and {{gas removal}} {{occur in the}} <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> as the inlet gas stream mixes with the fog of tiny liquid droplets. The inlet stream then exits through the <b>diverging</b> <b>section,</b> where it is forced to slow down.|$|R
40|$|A {{segmented}} anode/nozzle for a low-power (1 kW) arc jet thruster was fabricated {{to investigate}} the effect of electrode configuration on the arc jet performance. The five segments of the nozzle, which could be isolated individually or in groups {{made it possible to}} observe current distribution from the constrictor through the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> of the nozzle; measurements of the potential difference between the cathode and any of the individual segments were possible. Results showed that the discharge initiates in the high pressure region of the nozzle upstream of the <b>diverging</b> <b>section,</b> and then rapidly moves to the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> of the nozzle. When the arc was allowed to seat in the <b>diverging</b> <b>section,</b> the anode fall voltage was between 10 to 20 volts. When the current was forced to the high-pressure section of the constrictor, the anode fall voltage increased to more than 40 volts...|$|R

40|$|Minimum {{length of}} the {{supersonic}} nozzle has been calculated for the optimum Mach number at the nozzle exit with uniform flow at both converging and <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> of the nozzle. The calculation {{has been carried out}} based on the method of characteristics. Numerical solution is established for the two-dimensional, steady, in viscid, irrotational and supersonic flow. It is rational to assume the flow holds the consistency in the converging section and, thereby, an arbitrary shape is assumed for the converging section of the converging-diverging nozzle. The design considerations are concentrated at the <b>diverging</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R
50|$|As pb {{is lowered}} below {{that needed to}} just choke the flow, a region of {{supersonic}} flow forms just downstream of the throat. Unlike in subsonic flow, the supersonic flow accelerates as it {{moves away from the}} throat. This region of supersonic acceleration is terminated by a normal shock wave. The shock wave produces a near-instantaneous deceleration of the flow to subsonic speed. This subsonic flow then decelerates through the remainder of the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> and exhausts as a subsonic jet. In this regime if you lower or raise the back pressure you move the shock wave away from (increase the length of supersonic flow in the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> before the shock wave) the throat.|$|R
50|$|Converging-Diverging Nozzle (C-D) Generally used on {{supersonic}} {{jet aircraft}} where nozzle pressure ratio (npr) >3. The engine exhaust is expanded through a converging section to achieve Mach 1 and then expanded through a <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> to achieve supersonic speed {{at the exit}} plane, or less at low npr.|$|R
5000|$|A venturi {{scrubber}} {{consists of three}} sections: a converging section, a throat <b>section,</b> and a <b>diverging</b> <b>section.</b> The inlet gas stream enters the converging section and, as the area decreases, gas velocity increases (in accordance with the Bernoulli equation). Liquid is introduced either at the throat or {{at the entrance to}} the converging section.|$|R
2500|$|The obvious {{result is}} {{that in order to}} {{accelerate}} a flow to supersonic, one needs a convergent-divergent nozzle, where the converging section accelerates the flow to sonic speeds, and the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> continues the acceleration. Such nozzles are called de Laval nozzles and in extreme cases they are able to reach hypersonic speeds ( [...] at 20nbsp&°C).|$|R
25|$|Turnouts, {{also known}} as points and switches, are the means of {{directing}} a train onto a <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> of track. Laid similar to normal track, a point typically consists of a frog (common crossing), check rails and two switch rails. The switch rails may be moved left or right, {{under the control of}} the signalling system, to determine which path the train will follow.|$|R

There are several errors in this animation: The exhaust would not {{go all the way}} through the pipe in 1 cycle. Neither does it show the suction wave generated by the <b>diverging</b> <b>section.</b> The fresh mixture drawn into the header pipe cannot go all the way down the header pipe.|$|R
50|$|Figure 1a {{shows the}} {{flow through the}} nozzle when it is {{completely}} subsonic (i.e. the nozzle is not choked). The flow in the chamber accelerates as it converges toward the throat, where it reaches its maximum (subsonic) speed at the throat. The flow then decelerates through the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> and exhausts into the ambient as a subsonic jet. Lowering the back pressure, in this state, will increase the flow speed everywhere in the nozzle.|$|R
50|$|The path of ions and {{electrons}} {{through the}} engine approximates lines {{parallel to the}} engine walls; however, the particles actually orbit those lines while traveling linearly through the engine. The final, <b>diverging,</b> <b>section</b> of the engine contains an expanding magnetic field that drives the ions and electrons in steadily expanding spirals and ejects them from the engine, parallel and opposite to the direction of motion at velocities as great as 50,000 m/s.|$|R
50|$|Orifices and venturi are {{reported}} to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and <b>diverging</b> <b>sections,</b> such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate {{a greater number of}} holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.|$|R
50|$|When {{the back}} pressure, pb, is lowered enough, the flow speed is Mach 1 at the throat, as in figure 1b. The flow pattern {{is exactly the}} same as in subsonic flow, except that the flow speed at the throat has just reached Mach 1. Flow through the nozzle is now choked since further {{reductions}} in the back pressure can't move the point of M=1 away from the throat. However, the flow pattern in the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> does change as you lower the back pressure further.|$|R
50|$|Venturi {{scrubbers}} {{consist of}} a venturi-shaped inlet and separator. The dust-laden gases venturi scrubber enter through the venturi and are accelerated to speeds between 12,000 and 36,000 ft/min (60.97-182.83 m/s). These high-gas velocities immediately atomize the coarse water spray, which is injected radially into the venturi throat, into fine droplets. High energy and extreme turbulence promote collision between water droplets and dust particulates in the throat. The agglomeration process between particle and droplet continues in the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> of the venturi. The large agglomerates formed in the venturi are then removed by an inertial separator.|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringB. Terry BeckMohammad H. HosniCavitation is {{the change}} of a liquid to a {{two-phase}} mixture of liquid and vapor, similar to boiling. However, boiling generates a vapor by increasing the liquid temperature while cavitation generates vapor through a decrease in pressure. Both processes are endothermic, removing heat from the surroundings. Both the phase change and heat absorption associated with cavitation provide many engineering applications, including contributing to {{a new type of}} refrigeration cycle under development. Cavitation can occur at or below the vapor pressure; conditions that delay cavitation and allow for a metastable liquid are not well understood. A converging-diverging nozzle was designed and fabricated to create a low pressure region at the nozzle throat. The converging section of the nozzle increased the water velocity and decreased the pressure, according to Bernoulli’s principle. A cavitation front was formed slightly past the nozzle throat. The cavitation location suggested that the water was metastable near the nozzle throat. Flow through the system was controlled by changing the nozzle inlet and outlet pressures. The flowrate of water was measured while the outlet pressure was lowered. The flowrate increased as the outlet pressure dropped until cavitation occurred. Once cavitation initiated, the flow became choked and remained constant and independent of the nozzle outlet pressure. High-speed imagery was used to visualize the flow throughout the nozzle and the formation and collapse of cavitation in the nozzle’s <b>diverging</b> <b>section.</b> High-speed video taken from 1, 000 to 35, 000 frames per second captured the formation of the cavitation front and revealed regions of recirculating flow near the nozzle wall in the <b>diverging</b> <b>section.</b> Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the velocity vector field throughout the nozzle to characterize flow patterns within the nozzle. PIV showed that the velocity profile in the converging section and throat region were nearly uniform at each axial position in the nozzle. In the <b>diverging</b> <b>section,</b> PIV showed a transient, high-velocity central jet surrounded by large areas of recirculation and eddy formation. The single-phase experimental results, prior to cavitation onset, were supplemented by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the velocity distribution using Fluent software...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a thermal bubble-driven loop actuator for microfluidic applications. The working principle {{is similar to}} that of human being's heart. The actuator consists of a <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> and a circular chamber. A slim microheater was deposited on the back surface of the glass cover, facing the <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> of the bottom substrate. The Marangoni effect switches the states of a "long" bubble during the pulse duration stage and a sphere or a circular bubble during the pulse off stage, exporting the pulse pressure and yielding a large convection heat transfer at the vapor-liquid interface. Besides, the loop configuration pumps the bulk fluid movement around the loop. The above features protect the microheater from burnout and dissipate the Joule heat generated by the pulse heating to the supporting structure of the chip substrate, keeping the chip at the room temperature level. The newly designed loop actuator can be integrated with microfluidic systems. The loop actuator has no moving parts thus it has high reliability. Because the thermal bubble never comes out of the loop actuator, the actuator is attractive for biology applications. We demonstrate the loop actuator used for mixing enhancement. The low pulse frequency such as 10 Hz yields a wavy mixing interface, but the high pulse frequencies result in a set of mixing clouds in the mixing channel. The mixing degrees are increased with increases in pulse frequencies. The fluid samples are uniformly distributed across the channel width direction for the pulse frequency of 100 Hz. The mixing degree can reach 0. 94 for a short mixing length of about a couple of millimeter at the pulse frequency of 100 Hz. The fluid Reynolds number does not influence the mixing degrees in the mixing channel. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of an {{experimental}} study established to optimize the design of microfabricated flow distributors for use in pressure-driven separations and reactions in flat-rectangular channels. For this purpose, the performance {{of a wide variety of}} possible flow distributor designs etched in glass/silicon wafers was compared, using CCD camera detection to study the shape and variance of the bands eluting from them. The best performance was obtained with radially interconnected distributors with a <b>diverging</b> inlet <b>section</b> and filled with diamond-shaped pillars, oriented perpendicular to the main flow direction and with a high transversal over axial aspect ratio. It was found that the best distributor designs start with a <b>diverging</b> <b>section</b> containing some 10 − 12 subsequent rows of high aspect ratio pillars (with a transversal width making up 10 − 15 % of the final channel width) and with a divergence angle selected such that the sloped side-walls run parallel with the sides of the diamond-shaped pillars. After this zone, one or more regions with pillars with a smaller aspect ratio should be provided to increase the number of exit points. To prevent the formation of dead zones in these subsequent zones, so-called distributor wedges can be used to prevent the formation of any dead zones in the wake of the large aspect ratio pillars of the preceding sectio...|$|R

40|$|The Micro Plasma Thruster (MPT) concept {{consists}} of a direct-current microdischarge in a geometry comprising a constant area flow section followed by a diverging exit nozzle. A {{detailed description of the}} plasma dynamics inside the MPT including power deposition, ionization, coupling of the plasma phenomena with high-speed flow, and propulsion system performance is reported in this paper.

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{continued}} research project for the Utah Water Research Laboratory and the State of Utah, a study of flow measurement devices is being conducted throughout the state. Initially the project included only measurement devices associated with high-risk dams, but has since been broadened to any measurement structure of interest for water users in the state. The physical dimensions, relative elevations, and flow accuracy were documented for each included device. After visiting sixteen sites, {{it was found that}} fourteen of the measuring devices had incorrect geometries. Of these fourteen, thirteen of them were originally Parshall flumes. A large percentage of Parshall flumes with geometry inaccuracies was also found from previous data collected for this project. One reoccurring issue was that the flumes had not been well maintained and had damage to the walls or floor. Some of these Parshall flumes did not have a <b>diverging</b> downstream <b>section</b> and are referred to as Montana flumes. In these cases, a standard Parshall rating curve was used to determine flow where it did not apply. Some of the flumes that were tested operated regularly under submerged conditions, and no adjustments were made for submergence. The objective of this research is to determine if Montana flumes (Parshall flumes without a <b>diverging</b> <b>section)</b> operate similarly to fully constructed Parshall flumes under both free-flow and submerged conditions. Laboratory tests were performed in the Utah Water Research Laboratory to determine corrections for submergence. Flow 3 D, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software program, was also used to develop corrections for a submerged Montana flume.

40|$|Introduction: Procedures {{and methods}} for more {{accurate}} measurement and improved management of water are continually being {{sought to make}} better use of our water resources. Of all the devices and structures developed for measuring water, measuring flumes {{are among the most}} widely accepted and used. The most common measuring flume is the Parshall flume developed by Ralph Parshall at Colorado State University. Common to most flumes is the basic geometry consisting of a converging inlet section, a throat, and a <b>diverging</b> outlet <b>section.</b> Occasionally, the <b>diverging</b> outlet <b>section</b> is removed under free flow conditions, and the water is allowed to jet directly from the throat section into the downstream channel. This is not always permissible, however, in unlined channels because of possible erosion problems. In flat gradient channels, a flume may be installed to operate under conditions of submerged flow rather then free flow in order to (1) reduce energy losses, and (2) allow placement of the flume on the channel bed to minimize the increase in water surface elevation upstream from the flume. The purpose of the research effort reported herein was to develop a flume which would operate satisfactorily under both free flow and submerged flow conditions...|$|R
40|$|Institutional {{variables}} {{are the most}} important factor explaining real convergence. But what are institutions? This paper examines the relationship between institutions and policies, institutions and organisations, and formal and informal institutions. The concept of propelling and stabilizing institutions is introduced and used to explain differences in real convergence. Finally, issues of institutional changes are analysed based on an analytical framework which consists of initial conditions and two types of forces: collectivist and liberal. I first briefly present some basic facts about economic convergence and divergence over the last 200 years. I then discuss how the problem of long-run growth has been treated in the economic literature. Section 3 attempts to classify the concept of institutions – the key explanatory variable in the deeper analysis of the relative pace of development. In Section 4 I describe two types of institutions, propelling and stabilizing, and their relationship to economic growth. Based on previous sections and the empirical literature on convergence, I then formulate some broad propositions concerning why countries converge or <b>diverge</b> (<b>Section</b> 5). The explanation runs in terms of institutional variables.
