40|$|As {{the most}} {{prominent}} feature of the <b>polar</b> stratosphere, <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> results in widespread changes in the climate system, especially in the ozone variation. In this study, the linkage between <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> and ozone depletion in Antarctic stratosphere during the period 1979 – 2016 is investigated; we calculated the averaged total column ozone within the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> based on the vortex edge (− 28. 8 [*]PVU PV contour) instead of the geographical region defined by latitude and longitude. Results from the spatial patterns of ozone and <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> suggest that the morphological changes of <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> can impact the {{horizontal distribution of ozone}} and the ozone within the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> experiences a severe depletion in spring. The negative relationship between ozone and <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in terms of vortex area, strength, and breakup time is significant with the correlation coefficients of − 0. 57, − 0. 68, and − 0. 76, respectively.

The simulation includes two contrasting winter situations, characterized by an instable and warm stratospheric <b>polar</b> <b>vortex,</b> the other by a stable and cold <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> Ozone destruction induced by heterogeneous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds are found inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in both winter situations. Outside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> no heterogeneous reactions occur. Nevertheless a total ozone decrease is evident, as parts of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> are cut off and transport ozone reduced airmasses out of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> A blocking situation and an ozone minihole simulated by the model were also analyzed. In both cases large scale lifting yields large total ozone decrease and stratospheric chlorine activation. Chemical ozone destruction results downstream of this local activation. (orig.) 122 refs.

The situation is discussed in relation to the relative location of Eureka with respect to the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> boundary and the chemical ozone loss inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> In 1997 / 98,Eureka was inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in the lower stratosphere (475 K potential temperature level) only in the middle of December, early to mid-February and early to mid-March. The period was shorter than in the former 3 years. Moreover, daily T_ values when the lower stratosphere over Eureka was inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> were not so low compared with those in the former 3 years, and PSCs were not observed over Eureka. The year to year variation of the temperatures in the lower stratosphere (T_) over Eureka inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> was generally consistent with the variation of the one within the entire <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> A positive correlation between intravortex potential vorticity (PV) and ozone mixing ratio is expected in the lower stratosphere in the absence of strong chemical ozone loss.

Also, the total ozone in 1997 / 98 over Eureka when Eureka was inside the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in the lower stratosphere was higher than in the former 3 years.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> in winter and spring {{play an important role}} in explaining observed low ozone values. A quantification of physical and chemical processes is necessary to obtain information about natural and anthropogenic causes of fluctuations of ozone. This paper aims to contribute to answering the question of how permeable the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is. The transport into and out of the vortex (&quot;degree of isolation&quot;) remains the subject of considerable debate. Based on the results of a three-dimensional mechanistic model of the middle atmosphere, the possibility of exchange of air masses across the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> edge is investigated. Additionally the horizontal and vertical structure of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is examined. The model simulation used for this study is related to the major stratospheric warming observed in February 1989. The model results show fair agreement with observed features of the major warming of 1989. Complex structures of the simulated <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> are illustrated by horizontal and vertical cross sections of potential vorticity and inert tracer. A three-dimensional view of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> enables a description of the vortex as a whole. During the simulation two vortices and an anticyclone, grouped together in a very stable tripolar structure, and a weaker, more amorphous anticyclone are formed. This leads to the generation of small-scale features.

The analysis reveals that samples of strong <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> nearly exclusively occur during cold ENSO states, while a weak <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> is observed for both cold and warm ENSO. The strongest tropospheric and near-surface anomalies are found for warm ENSO and weak <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> conditions, suggesting that internal tropospheric circulation anomalies related to warm ENSO constructively superpose on dynamical effects from the stratosphere.

This warming of stratospheric air can reverse the circulation in the Arctic <b>Polar</b> <b>Vortex</b> from counter-clockwise to clockwise. These changes aloft force changes in the troposphere below. An example of {{an effect on the}} troposphere is the change in speed of the Atlantic Ocean circulation pattern. A soft spot just south of Greenland is where the initial step of downwelling occurs, nicknamed the [...] "Achilles Heel of the North Atlantic". Small amounts of heating or cooling traveling from the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> can trigger or delay downwelling, altering the Gulf Stream Current of the Atlantic, and the speed of other ocean currents. Since all other oceans depend on the Atlantic Ocean's movement of heat energy, climates across the planet can be dramatically affected. The weakening or strengthening of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> can alter the sea circulation more than a mile beneath the waves. Strengthening storm systems within the troposphere that cool the poles, intensify the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> La Niña-related climate anomalies significantly strengthen the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> [...] Intensification of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex</b> produces changes in relative humidity as downward intrusions of dry, stratospheric air enter the vortex core. With a strengthening of the vortex comes a longwave cooling due to a decrease in water vapor concentration near the vortex. The decreased water content is a result of a lower tropopause within the vortex, which places dry stratospheric air above moist tropospheric air. Instability is caused when the vortex tube, the line of concentrated vorticity, is displaced. When this occurs, the vortex rings become more unstable and prone to shifting by planetary waves.The planetary wave activity in both hemispheres varies year-to-year, producing a corresponding response in the strength and temperature of the <b>polar</b> <b>vortex.</b> The number of waves {{around the perimeter of the}} vortex are related to the core size; as the vortex core decreases, the number of waves increase.|$|R

This relationship need not be specific to QBO-W/Smax conditions but may just require strengthened vortex in December, which is more likely under QBO-W/Smax.
