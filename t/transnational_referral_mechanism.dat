40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{establish}} {{the extent to which}} organisations in Botswana are trying to promote the utilisation of government provided ARV service within their workplace, by referring their employees to it. To determine the degree of association between the dependent and predictor variables, Chi square and logit regressions are used. The Botswana AIDS Impact Survey Two (BAIS II) data for workplaces has been used. The degree of referral is quite low amongst both the pubic and private/ parastatal sector organisations. Overall there were 23. 7 percent of organisations with <b>referral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for antiretroviral therapy within the workplace, of which the majority of them had educational programmes of some kind. There is a significant positive relationship between the availability of ARV <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> as the dependent variable and the following predictor variables, namely policy availability and a combination of programmes (ProgIndex). Large organisations have a negatively significant relationship with the dependent variable. There is a need for programmes such as peer educators and HIV/AIDS coordinators and HIV policies to be put in place within workplaces in an effort geared towards minimising losses within organisations. 1...|$|R

50|$|NGOs {{expressed}} concern that the national <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> was disproportionately focused on prosecuting trafficking offenders rather than assisting victims. The government significantly increased the number of identified victims during the reporting period: law enforcement officials identified 60 victims in 2009 and referred 22 of them to NGOs for assistance, compared with 34 victims identified and 20 referred for assistance in 2008. Foreign-funded NGOs assisted 26 victims in 2009, compared with 24 victims in 2008. Victims were encouraged to cooperate with law enforcement bodies; in 2009, all 60 victims assisted police with trafficking investigations.|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of businesses and organisations rely on existing users for finding new users or spreading a message. One of the widely used "refer-a-friend" mechanisms offers an equal reward to both the referrer and the invitee. This mechanism provides incentives for direct referrals and is fair to the invitee. On the other hand, multi-level marketing and recent social mobilisation experiments focus on mechanisms that incentivise both direct and indirect <b>referrals.</b> Such <b>mechanisms</b> share the reward for inviting a new member among the ancestors, usually in geometrically decreasing shares. A new member receives nothing {{at the time of}} joining. We study fairness in multi-level marketing mechanisms.

40|$|Under article 13 (b) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the United Nations Security Council (SC) may {{refer to}} the International Criminal Court (ICC) a {{situation}} in which one or more crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction appear to have been committed. Since the entry into force of the Rome Statute, the SC has referred two situations to the Court: the situation in Darfur in 2005, and the situation in Libya in 2011. The SC <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> allows the ICC to consider situations in non-party States, such as Sudan and Libya. Even though the adoption of the SC referrals was praised at first, the <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> has proven problematic in many regards. Both SC Resolution 1593 (2005) on Darfur and SC Resolution 1970 (2011) on Libya have been subject to criticism because of their weaknesses. The greatest points of criticism relate to the financing of the Court’s activities and State cooperation. Following the referrals, the ICC initiated investigations on the situations in Darfur and Libya, and subsequently issued arrest warrants for persons considered to be responsible for the crimes committed. Despite the arrest warrants issued, none of the suspects have been arrested and surrendered to the ICC. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the SC <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> in light of the two existing referrals and to identify and examine problems concerning said mechanism. In order to understand the problems related to the SC <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the complex relationship between the ICC and the SC is examined in Chapter 2. The ICC is an independent institution established by a treaty between States. However, as the two organizations have overlapping mandates, coordination between the activities of the ICC and the SC is necessary. Therefore, the Rome Statute creates a link between the organizations by allowing the SC to trigger the juris- diction of the Court. In this context, the legal framework governing the relationship between the two institutions and the nature of SC referrals are examined. In addition, Chapter 2 assesses the funding of the Court’s activities following a SC referral. Chapter 3 considers the jurisdiction of the Court and the mechanisms available to initiate proceedings in the ICC. As the jurisdic- tion of the ICC with respect to a certain situation is not pre-determined, it can be triggered by State Parties, the SC or the Prosecu- tor. Emphasis is placed on the SC <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> and its differences with the other trigger mechanisms. In addition, issues of admissibility are considered. Particular attention is paid to the principle of complementarity, because as the underlying principle of the Rome Statute, it affects the different stages of the ICC proceedings. In light of the existing referrals, Chapter 4 analyses State cooperation with the Court, and how it has proven one of the main prob- lems for the Court. The ICC does not have its own enforcement mechanisms, which is why it is dependent on the assistance of States in the arrest of suspects and the gathering of evidence. Yet, States have been reluctant to cooperate with the Court follow- ing the SC referrals. In order to explain the lack of cooperation, the study examines and compares the cooperation regimes pursu- ant to the Rome Statute and the relevant SC resolutions. In particular, it attempts to identify the content of the cooperation obliga- tions of Sudan and Libya, State Parties, and non-party States to the Rome Statute. As the ICC’s jurisdiction is complementary to national jurisdictions, the effect of the principle of complementarity on cooperation is also assessed. Under certain grounds, States may refuse or postpone their cooperation obligations with the Court. As examples of exemptions from the cooperation obligation, the effect of national proceedings and head of state immunity are considered. Chapter 4 concludes with an assessment of the enforcement mechanisms available in case the ICC makes a finding of non-compliance...|$|R

When dealing with large amounts of users and many IMAP 4 [RFC- 2060] servers, it is often necessary to move users from one IMAP 4 server to another.

A <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> can provide efficiencies over the alternative ’proxy method’, in which the local IMAP 4 server contacts the remote server {{on behalf of the}} client, and then transfers the data from the remote server to itself, and then on to the client.

The UK, as a signatory to the recent trafficking protocols, is required to implement measures to identify and support potential victims of trafficking - via the National <b>Referral</b> <b>Mechanism.</b> Effective support for child victims is reliant on cooperation between agencies. Our regional case-study contends that fragmented agency understandings of protocols and disjointed partnership approaches in service delivery means the trafficking of vulnerable children continues across the region.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} a formal framework where agents use referrals from other agents to locate high-quality service providers. Agents have common knowledge about providers which {{are able to}} provide these services. The performance of providers {{is measured by the}} satisfaction obtained by agents from using their services. Provider performance varies with their current load. We assume that agents are truthful in reporting interaction experiences with providers and refer the highest quality provider known for a given task. The <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> is based of the exchange value theory. Agents exchange both the name of the provider to use and the satisfaction obtained by using a referred provider. We present an algorithm for selecting a service provider for a given task which includes mechanisms for deciding when and who to ask for a <b>referral.</b> This <b>mechanism</b> requires learning, over interactions, both the performance levels of different service providers, as well as the quality of referrals provided by other agents. We use a satisficing rather than an optimizing framework, where agents are content to receive service quality above a threshold. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in producing stable system configurations where reasonable satisfaction expectations of all agents are met. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The co-existence of Community Health Fund (CHF) and {{user fees}} in Tanzania as health {{financial}} mechanisms have affected to CHF enrolment. However, {{little is known}} about the effect of user fees on CHF enrolment, non-enrollment and drop-out. Objectives: The study aimed at exploring the effects of coexistence of user fees and Community Health Fund scheme, quality of care and utilization of health services on CHF enrolment, non-enrollment and drop out in Bagamoyo District, Coast Region, Tanzania. Methods: An exploratory cross sectional community and health facility study was conducted in Bagamoyo District between April and May 2012. The study involved heads of households who were categorized in four groups; CHF members from community (63), non CHF members from the community (60), CHF members from health facilities (145) and non CHF members from health facilities (144). The study participants were interviewed using a semistructured questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to find factors associated CHF enrollment, non-enrollment and drop-out. Results: Although user fee was not pointed as the reason for not joining CHF, CHF members were significantly more likely to pay higher amount of user fee than non CHF members (p < 0. 01). Being a CHF member was associated with non- payment of user fees and higher expenditure on health services. Furthermore, health services utilization, although slightly lower among non CHF members, was not statistically different between CHF and non CHF members (p = 0. 09). Poor quality of health services at health services and poor <b>referral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were the main reasons for dropping out from CHF. Recommendations: The co-existence of user fees and CHF should be re-visited. Efforts should be taken to improve quality of health services and <b>referral</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in the public health facilities in Bagamoyo in order to reduce unnecessary distress to the CHF members, decrease drop out and improve the performance of CHF in Bagamoyo...|$|R

When dealing with large amounts of users, messages and geographically dispersed IMAP 4 [RFC- 2060] servers, it is often desirable to distribute messages amongst different servers within an organization. For example an administrator may choose to store user’s personal mailboxes on a local IMAP 4 server, while storing shared mailboxes remotely on another server. This type of configuration is common when it is uneconomical to store all data centrally due to limited bandwidth or disk resources. Mailbox referrals allow clients to seamlessly access mailboxes that are distributed across several IMAP 4 servers. A <b>referral</b> <b>mechanism</b> can provide efficiencies over the alternative "proxy method", in which the local IMAP 4 server contacts the remote server {{on behalf of the}} client, and then transfers the data from the remote server to itself, and then on to the client.
