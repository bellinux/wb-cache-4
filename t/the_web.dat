5|$|Like other theridiid spiders, <b>the</b> <b>web</b> is a disorganised, {{irregular}} {{tangle of}} fine textured silk. It is hammock-shaped and {{is made up}} of opaque yellowish-white silk. <b>The</b> <b>web</b> consists of a broad base with many supporting threads above and below, including a number of sticky guy lines anchored to debris in the sand. A cone-shaped retreat is built in the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>web,</b> although the katipo can normally be found near the main body of <b>the</b> <b>web.</b> The plants it builds its web in provide support and shelter for the nest.|$|E
5|$|Absolute, relative, {{and fixed}} CSS {{positioning}}: Absolute positioning means that <b>the</b> <b>web</b> developer specifies the exact X and Y coordinates where an element {{is to be}} placed into the page. Relative positioning means that <b>the</b> <b>web</b> developer specifies an X and Y offset from the usual position of the element. Fixed positioning means that the element is placed relative to the browser window, and scrolls with the window rather than {{with the rest of}} the page.|$|E

40|$|The goal of Semantic Web {{initiative}} {{is to make}} <b>the</b> semantics of <b>Web</b> content accessible to machines. <b>The</b> Semantic <b>Web</b> has been evolving into a web of data separate from <b>the</b> existing HTML <b>web.</b> Our work focuses on establishing and exploiting connections between <b>the</b> two <b>webs,</b> especially hyperlink connections from <b>the</b> HTML <b>web</b> pages to <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web</b> nodes, so as to enhance both data and document retrieval. We propose <b>the</b> Unified <b>Web</b> model to integrate <b>the</b> two <b>webs,</b> and a hybrid query language to retrieve data and documents from <b>the</b> Unified <b>Web.</b> Specifically, <b>the</b> query language amalgamates graph-based reasoning over RDF with keyword-based search...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> socio-{{semantic}} <b>web</b> {{differs from}} <b>the</b> semantic <b>web</b> in that <b>the</b> semantic <b>web</b> often {{is regarded as}} a system that will solve the epistemic interoperability issues we have to day.

40|$|Abstract. Today, {{we observe}} the {{amalgamation}} of <b>the</b> Social <b>Web</b> and <b>the</b> Mobile <b>Web,</b> which will {{ultimately lead to}} a Ubiquitous <b>Web.</b> <b>The</b> integration and aggregation of {{the different kinds of}} available data, and the extraction of useful knowledge and its representation has become an important challenge for researchers from <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web,</b> Web 2. 0, social network analysis and machine learning communities. We discuss <b>the</b> Ubiquitous <b>Web</b> vision, by addressing the challenge of bridging <b>the</b> gap between <b>Web</b> 2. 0 and <b>the</b> Semantic <b>Web,</b> before widening <b>the</b> scope to mobile applications...|$|R

5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia does not usually take the insect, but waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly stuck. When an insect stuck in a web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, <b>the</b> <b>web</b> spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches <b>the</b> <b>web</b> spider.|$|E
50|$|The {{crankshaft}} is {{a balanced}} built-up type running in three ball bearings.

40|$|Structural ribs for {{providing}} structural {{support for a}} structure, such as the pressure cabin of a blended-wing body aircraft. In a first embodiment, the ribs are generally Y-shaped, being comprised of a vertical web {{and a pair of}} inclined <b>webs</b> attached to <b>the</b> vertical <b>web</b> to extend upwardly and outwardly from <b>the</b> vertical <b>web</b> in different directions, with only the upper edges of <b>the</b> inclined <b>webs</b> being attached to a structural element. In a second embodiment, the ribs are generally trident-shaped, whereby <b>the</b> vertical <b>web</b> extends upwardly beyond the intersection of <b>the</b> inclined <b>webs</b> with <b>the</b> vertical <b>web,</b> with <b>the</b> upper edge of <b>the</b> vertical <b>web</b> as well as the upper edges of <b>the</b> inclined <b>webs</b> being attached to the same structural element...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>webs</b> are permanent. Over time, {{they will}} begin {{gathering}} leaves and other debris.

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When <b>the</b> <b>web</b> spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach <b>the</b> <b>web</b> spider.|$|E
