5|$|During {{their time}} in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West, the Panthers began {{developing}} a rivalry with the San Francisco 49ers. This rivalry faded after the NFL moved the Panthers out of <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they began}} playing {{football}} in 1995, the Panthers {{have been to}} four NFC Championship Games; they lost two (1996 and 2005) and won two (2003 and 2015). The Panthers have won six division championships: <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West championship in 1996 and <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South championship in 2003, 2008, 2013, 2014, and 2015. They are {{the first and only}} team to win <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South back to back and have won <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South more times than any other team in the division. They have finished as runners-up in their division six times, finishing second-place in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West in 1997 and 1999 and finishing second-place in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2012. They have qualified for the playoffs 7 times, most recently in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Panthers {{were moved}} to <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South after the NFL realigned their {{divisions}} due to the Houston Texans joining the league as an expansion team. Over their 20 seasons in the NFL, the Panthers have played in over 300 games, winning 6 division titles (one in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West and five in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South) and reaching the NFL playoffs 7 times. The Panthers have never had back-to-back winning seasons, but recorded their first back-to-back-to-back playoff seasons in 2013 and 2014, becoming the first team {{in the history of}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South to win consecutive division titles in the process. They won a third consecutive division title in 2015, finishing with a league-best 15–1 record and securing homefield advantage in the playoffs {{for the first time in}} team history.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{clinched}} {{a playoff}} berth after defeating the Minnesota Vikings during week thirteen. They obtained a first round bye the following week, and later secured <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> first playoff seed. This ensured the Bears home field advantage for <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> Divisional and Conference games.|$|R
50|$|With the win, the Falcons {{finished}} the season at 10-6 and captured <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> #5 seed.|$|R
50|$|The AFC was {{coached by}} Baltimore's John Harbaugh, while <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> coach was Philadelphia's Andy Reid.|$|R
5|$|In the 2016 season, the Panthers regressed {{on their}} 15-1 record from 2015, posting a 6-10 record, missing {{the playoffs for}} the first time since 2012, and a last-place finish in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South, losing the {{division}} title to the second-seeded Falcons, who went on to represent <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> in Super Bowl LI.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers' only Super Bowl {{championship}} was won in Super Bowl XXXVII, at {{the conclusion}} of the 2002 season. This was the teams' only Super Bowl appearance, having reached <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> conference championship on two other occasions. The Buccaneers have been divisional champions six times, three of them in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Central and the other three in NFC South. They were the first team to win <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South after the NFL restructure in 2002. In their 41-year history, the Buccaneers have played over 500 regular and post-season games and have appeared in the post-season ten times.|$|E
5|$|Favre's {{milestone}} 2007 season culminated {{with his}} selection to the 2008 Pro Bowl {{as the starting}} quarterback for <b>the</b> <b>NFC,</b> but an ankle injury forced him {{to withdraw from the}} game.|$|E
50|$|Due to his regular-season performance, Rodgers {{earned a}} trip to his first Pro Bowl as <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> third quarterback, behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was {{replaced}} due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> starter. He finished the day with 15 of 19 passing, 197 yards and two touchdowns.|$|R
25|$|Charles Woodson {{was named}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> Defensive Player of the Week for games played on Week 6.|$|R
50|$|With the loss, the Cowboys {{ended the}} regular season at 13-3, along with <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> #1 seed.|$|R
5|$|In 1995, Favre won {{the first}} of his three AP MVP awards. Favre led the Packers to an 11–5 record, Green Bay's best record in nearly thirty years. Favre passed for a career-high of 4,413yards, 38 touchdowns, and {{recorded}} a quarterback rating of 99.5, which was the highest of his career until he recorded a rating of 107.2 during the 2009 season. Favre also tied an NFL record by passing for at least two touchdowns in twelve consecutive games, a feat he accomplished over the 1994–1995 seasons. The Packers advanced to <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Championship Game after upsetting the San Francisco 49ers in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Divisional Game. The Packers lost <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Championship game to the Dallas Cowboys, marking the third year in a row the Packers season was ended by the Cowboys in the playoffs. Favre helped the Packers advance farther in the playoffs than any other Packer team since 1967, which was the season the Packers last won the championship in Super Bowl II.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the home}} {{teams in the}} playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation. From 1970 to 1974, the {{division}}al playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage, with the wild-card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West champions playing their games on the road. Then in 1971 it rotated to the AFC East champions and <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> East champions playing their games on the road. In the 1972 divisional playoff games, the AFC West champions and <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Central champions were the visiting teams. And 1973 it would start all over with the AFC Central and NFC West again, and so on.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} San Francisco 49–3 in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Divisional Playoffs, then Washington 17–0 in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Championship Game. The Giants {{advanced to}} play the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXI in front of 101,063 fans at the Rose Bowl. After falling behind 10–9 at halftime, they came back to beat the Broncos 39–20. Simms was named the game's MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record.|$|E
5000|$|The 2011 Giants are {{the only}} team to win the Super Bowl as <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> 4th Seed.|$|R
50|$|Snee's strong play in 2008 {{earned him}} his first Pro Bowl {{selection}} as one of <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> starting guards.|$|R
2500|$|Tampa Bay {{clinched}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> #3 seed {{instead of}} the N.Y. Giants based on better conference record (9–3 to 8–4).|$|R
5|$|The Giants' {{victory over}} the Bears in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Divisional game was their first over the Bears in the playoffs since 1956.|$|E
5|$|The Panthers have {{developed}} heated rivalries {{with the three}} fellow members of <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> South (the Atlanta Falcons, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and New Orleans Saints). The team's fiercest rivals are the Falcons and Buccaneers.|$|E
5|$|After scoring five {{touchdowns in}} week {{fourteen}} against the Cowboys, the most by a Bears quarterback since Jack Concannon in 1972, Josh McCown was named <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Offensive Player of the Week on December 11.|$|E
50|$|The talent {{level at}} running back, relegated him to {{returning}} kickoffs. He was <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> third leading kickoff returner in 1988.|$|R
50|$|The Falcons loss {{marked the}} third time in the last four seasons that <b>the</b> <b>NFCs</b> top seed would not advance past its first playoff game.|$|R
50|$|With the win, the Falcons {{closed out}} {{the regular season}} at 11-5 and due to Carolina's victory over New Orleans, earned <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> #5 seed.|$|R
5|$|Favre led the Packers to a 13–3 {{regular season}} record, <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> North championship, {{and the second}} seed in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> playoffs. Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Favre stated his desire to {{continue}} playing football for another season. In the Divisional Playoffs, Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42–20 victory over the Seahawks at a snowy Lambeau Field. The Packers' season ended the following week when they suffered a 23–20 overtime loss in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New York Giants. Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that set up the Giants' game-winning field goal. Favre's 90-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver {{in the second quarter}} was the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18. Favre stated after the game that he would make a decision more quickly than he has in the past regarding whether he would return for another season.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010–11 season, the {{aforementioned}} 2010 Seahawks won <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> West with a 7–9 record, hosting and defeating the 11–5 New Orleans Saints. Failing {{to make the}} playoffs were the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, both with 10–6 records, due to losing tiebreakers for the sixth seed to the Green Bay Packers, who {{went on to become the}} first sixth-seeded team from <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> to win the Super Bowl. The 2010 Seahawks were the first team in NFL history to win both a division championship and a playoff game with a losing regular season record. They currently have the lowest win percentage of any team to ever make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's most {{significant}} play, according to Philadelphia media and fans, came on January 11, 2004, in <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Divisional Playoff Game against the Packers. Late in the game, with the Eagles losing by three points and facing a 4th and 26 situation, Mitchell caught a 28-yard {{pass for a}} first down. The Eagles tied the score on the same drive and won the game in overtime. Mitchell had another catch for nineyards in the game. In <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Championship Game on January 18 against the Carolina Panthers, he caught four passes for 38yards in the loss. Mitchell had 35 catches for 498yards and two touchdowns in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Chicago {{clinched}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> #2 seed {{instead of}} Tampa Bay or the N.Y. Giants based on better conference record (10–2 to Buccaneers' 9–3 and Giants' 8–4).|$|R
50|$|After {{losing to}} <b>the</b> 2007 <b>NFC</b> East Champion Dallas Cowboys the week before, The Packers headed down south to play <b>the</b> 2007 <b>NFC</b> South Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.|$|R
50|$|With the win, the 49ers {{finished}} their season at 13-3 as they swept the Rams {{for the first}} time since 2009 and captured <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> #2 playoff seed.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} night, the Bears {{would jump}} to first place of <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> North after the Lions were {{defeated by the}} Ravens. The Bears {{had the opportunity to}} clinch the division in week sixteen by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles, in addition to losses by the Packers and Lions.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, the Bears’ 2001 {{winning season}} would be {{followed}} by three years of mediocrity. Before the 2004 NFL season, the Bears’ organization fired coach Dick Jauron and then hired Lovie Smith. After starting the season on the lower rungs of <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> North, Urlacher suffered several injuries that sidelined him {{for a majority of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Vikings placekicker Gary Anderson {{had joined}} the team that {{off-season}} after playing for three different teams in his 16-year NFL career. In 1998, {{he became the first}} placekicker in NFL history to convert every field goal and extra point attempted. He finished the regular season 35/35 on field goals, with a long of 53 yards, and 59/59 on extra points. As a result, he was voted to the 1998 NFC Pro Bowl team, the fourth Pro Bowl invitation of his career, and was voted to the AP All-Pro team for the first time. He also converted every field goal and extra point attempt in a Divisional playoff round victory against the Arizona Cardinals the week before <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Championship. Entering <b>the</b> <b>NFC</b> Championship Game, his last miss was on December 15, 1997, against the Denver Broncos, when {{he was a member of}} the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E
25|$|Even {{while playing}} on a {{struggling}} Redskins defensive unit, Taylor's impact on the field was recognized when he was named a first alternate to <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> 2007 Pro Bowl team. When <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> first choice for safety, Brian Dawkins of the Philadelphia Eagles, chose not {{to play in the}} Pro Bowl due to an injury, Taylor was named to the vacated spot, marking his first and only Pro Bowl appearance. A crushing hit by Taylor on Buffalo Bills punter Brian Moorman in the Pro Bowl created much fan and media discussion.|$|R
50|$|Entering {{the playoffs}} at <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> fourth seed, <b>the</b> Cardinals began their playoff run {{at home against}} the #5 Atlanta Falcons, in their first home playoff game since 1947.|$|R
50|$|With the win, {{not only}} did the Redskins close out the regular season at 9-7, but they also {{clinched}} <b>the</b> <b>NFC's</b> #6 seed and/or 2nd wild card playoff spot.|$|R
