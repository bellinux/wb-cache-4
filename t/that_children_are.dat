25|$|From {{his studies}} into child development, Jean Piaget {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>were</b> born with an innate animist worldview {{in which they}} anthropomorphized inanimate objects, {{and that it was}} only later that they grew out of this belief.

25|$|It {{is crucial}} <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> allowed to {{socially}} {{interact with other}} people who can vocalize and respond to questions.

Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.|$|E

25|$|In Panayiotopoulos {{syndrome}} {{there is}} a diffuse multifocal cortical hyperexcitability, which is age (maturation)-related. This diffuse epileptogenicity may be unequally distributed, predominating in one area, which is often posterior. Epileptic discharges in Panayiotopoulos syndrome, irrespective of their location at onset, activate emetic and autonomic centers prior to any other conventional neocortical seizure manifestations. An explanation for this is <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to autonomic disorders {{as illustrated by the}} cyclic vomiting syndrome, which is a nonepileptic condition specific to childhood.|$|E
25|$|Scientists do {{not agree}} on how much sleep debt it is {{possible}} to accumulate; whether it is accumulated against an individual's average sleep or some other benchmark; nor on whether the prevalence of sleep debt among adults has changed appreciably in the industrialized world in recent decades.

It is likely <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> sleeping less than previously in Western societies.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{a series}} of four {{experiments}} conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located {{in the middle of the}} sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.|$|E

40|$|It <b>is</b> often argued <b>that</b> <b>child</b> labour <b>is</b> {{caused by}} poverty. However, much child labour {{takes place in}} rural areas {{characterized}} by substantial labour market imperfections. A model of rural household labour supply is developed that provides testable implications for {{two versions of the}} poverty hypothesis: <b>that</b> <b>child</b> labour <b>is</b> due to a binding subsistence constraint and <b>that</b> <b>child</b> leisure <b>is</b> a luxury good. We find that in rural Burkina Faso children do not provide labour to meet households' subsistence needs and <b>that</b> <b>child</b> leisure <b>is</b> a normal good. The evidence suggests that labour market imperfections are a main reason for using child labour. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
25|$|A Lancet review {{identified}} 201 chemicals {{with the}} ability to cause clinical neurotoxic effects in human adults, as described in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Most of them are commonly used. Many additional chemicals {{have been shown to be}} neurotoxic in laboratory models. The article notes <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> more vulnerable and argues that new, precautionary approaches that recognise the unique vulnerability of the developing brain are needed for testing and control of chemicals in order to avoid the previous substantial before starting restrictions on usage. An appendix listed further industrial chemicals considered to be neurotoxic.|$|E
25|$|Liberman et al. {{found that}} no 4-year-olds and only 17% of 5-year-olds {{were able to}} tap out the number of phonemes (individual sounds) in a word. 70% of 6-year-olds {{were able to do}} so. This might mean <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> aware of syllables as units of speech early on, while they don’t show {{awareness}} of individual phonemes until school age. Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes a much more difficult task than clapping syllables. One reason why phoneme awareness gets much better once children start school is because learning to read provides a visual aid as how to break up words into their smaller constituents.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{educational}} {{psychologists have}} conducted {{research on the}} instructional applicability of Jean Piaget's theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children {{need to be taught}} using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur {{at the same time in}} all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.|$|E

25|$|Galton {{states that}} the {{measurements}} of human characteristics are useful for two reasons. First, he states that measuring physical characteristics is useful in order to ensure, on a more domestic level, <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> developing properly. A useful example he gives for the practicality of these domestic measurements is regularly checking a child’s eyesight, in order to correct any deficiencies early on. The second use for the data from his anthropometric laboratory is for statistical studies. He comments on {{the usefulness of the}} collected data to compare attributes across occupations, residences, races, etc. The exhibit at the health exhibition allowed Galton to collect a large amount of raw data from which to conduct further comparative studies. He had 9,337 respondents, each measured in 17 categories, creating a rather comprehensive statistical database.|$|E
25|$|Peace First, a {{non-profit}} organisation {{based in the}} United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum {{that can be used}} in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view <b>that</b> <b>children</b> <b>are</b> very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E
