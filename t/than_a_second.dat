5|$|Despite several {{problems}} {{during the third}} session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, setting a time of 1:12.070, just over {{a tenth of a}} second in front of his teammate. Earlier in the session, he needed to return to pit lane due to a gear-selection problem which had caused him to temporarily stop on track and later spun at turn eleven. Vettel was again third fastest, more than six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. He was followed by teammate Räikkönen, Valtteri Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg in the Force India, all more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> slower than Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but it seems unlikely {{to be able to}} cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In Q3, Nico Rosberg ran wide at turn 15 on {{his first}} flying lap and lost the chance to seek areas of {{improvement}} for his second run. Lewis Hamilton, who was fastest in all three sessions, capitalized on his teammate's problem and took pole position by over half a second. It was his 39th pole position and his 4th at Albert Park. The {{rest of the field}} was more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> behind Hamilton's time, with Felipe Massa in the Williams best of the rest in third position. The two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen proved their regained competitiveness by taking fourth and fifth on the grid respectively.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} {{practice}} session on Saturday evening, the two Ferraris were in front, with Vettel fastest at 1:45.682, while Räikkönen was {{almost half a}} second off his teammate's pace. The two Red Bull cars of Kvyat and Ricciardo were behind, followed by both Mercedes cars, who trailed Vettel by more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso continued McLaren's good form and finished seventh fastest. Lewis Hamilton had several problems during the session; an early run was interrupted by him leaving the track and he was later called to drive through the pit lane to cool down his overheating car. Valtteri Bottas was the fastest Williams driver in eleventh, {{just in front of}} Nico Hülkenberg, who drove a revised version of his Force India. The two Manor Marussia cars were again last, with Rossi almost three seconds ahead of Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2015 season, three practice sessions were held, two 1.5-hour sessions on Friday and another one-hour session before qualifying on Saturday. World champion Lewis Hamilton took a clean sweep and topped the time sheets {{in all three}} sessions by a considerable margin. The first session saw Lotus test driver Jolyon Palmer participate in place of regular Romain Grosjean. He finished six-tenths of a second behind his teammate Pastor Maldonado {{and was one of}} several drivers to have off track experiences during the session. Both Mercedes drivers ran wide on different parts of the track, as did Felipe Massa, who spun his Williams in turn 14 {{towards the end of the}} session. Hamilton was over half a second clear of his teammate Nico Rosberg on Friday morning, with the Ferraris more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> behind.|$|E
5|$|The Raptor {{has three}} {{internal}} weapons bays: a large bay {{on the bottom}} of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes. The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each side bay has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000lb (450kg) or four 250lb (110kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and minimizes additional drag. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> during which hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight.|$|E

5|$|Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, {{almost two}} seconds faster than his {{previous}} best over the distance. He {{began to lose}} ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind Seredin until a late surge brought him to within a metre {{by the time the}} swimmers touched the wall. If Tonelli had replicated his relay leg in the individual event, he would have claimed the silver medal. Although he lost 0.36s to Seredin, he had minimised his loss and Australia were within 0.81s going into the final leg. Furthermore, the Australians were now more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> clear of the third-placed Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Two free {{practice}} sessions were held before qualifying, running for 45 and 30 minutes respectively. The first session started at 08:15 local time, with Sébastien Buemi topping the timesheets for e.dams-Renault {{in a time}} of 1:23.158. The track got faster as the temperatures rose and more cars drove around the circuit; lap times improved by more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> in the second session, which started at 10:30.

5|$|As per the {{regulations}} for , three practice sessions were held, two {{one and a}} half-hour sessions on Thursday and another one-hour session on Saturday morning. After a thunderstorm on Wednesday night, {{the first of the}} two free practice sessions held on Thursday morning, started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres. The track soon dried up, and the cars changed to slick tyres. Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the Tabac corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car. The two Mercedes drivers swapped places {{at the top of the}} time sheets for most of the session, until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth, more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rookie Max Verstappen surprised the paddock by finishing second, two-tenths of a second down on Hamilton. The Renault-powered cars all finished within the top seven, while the Williams team ended the session in tenth and seventeenth, owing to the car not being well suited for wet and low-temperature conditions.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{previously}} won {{medals in the}} event, but was not {{regarded as one of}} the favourites for the gold, as the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and Sweden all fielded more decorated swimmers over the component legs of the relay. After the backstroke leg, Australia was in fourth place and more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> in arrears of the Soviet leaders. However, Evans was the fastest among the breaststrokers and moved the team into second position at the halfway point in the race; and Tonelli, a makeshift butterflyer, completed his leg in a time much faster than his previous best, allowing Australia to keep the Soviet lead reasonable. Australia's anchor swimmer Brooks overtook his more credentialled Soviet counterpart Sergey Koplyakov in the latter half of the final leg to secure a narrow victory. The quartet disbanded after the Olympics due to Tonelli's retirement, although some of the members continued to be present in the relay team at various times alongside new swimmers. By 1986, all four members of the 1980 team had retired from international competition.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton began lapping fastest, {{recording}} a 1:32.869 on lap38, more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> faster than first-placed Vettel. Lap45 saw three drivers set consecutive new fastest laps; Kubica's 1:32.366 was beaten by Webber with a 1:32.014s. They were then superseded by Räikkönen, who set a 1:31.691. On lap49 Webber attempted to pass Hamilton {{at the first}} chicane, but the two cars touched wheels. Webber was forced down the escape road, and when he emerged in front of Hamilton, he returned the position. Räikkönen continued {{to move through the}} field; he passed Coulthard and Piquet in separate manoeuvres to take ninthposition. Nakajima attempted to pass Coulthard into turnnine, but succeeded only in turning into the Red Bull RB4, sending it into the gravel trap. Coulthard pitted for a new front wing, which dropped him to 17th. Vettel crossed the finish line on lap53 by 12.5seconds over Kovalainen, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history to win a Grand Prix. The one-stop strategies used by Kubica and Alonso paid off as they finished in third and fourth, respectively. Heidfeld, Massa, Hamilton and Webber rounded out the top eight. Räikkönen finished in ninthposition, setting the fastest laptime of 1:28.047 on the final lap.|$|E
5|$|In LMP2, Bird and Julien Canal {{took the}} fastest two-lap average time of 2:07.761; Canal pushed hard on new tyres during his second timed run having disliked his {{previous}} attempt. The pair were two-tenths {{of a second}} faster than the second-place qualifiers, Howson and Lapierre, and held the class pole position until Canal's lap. Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car took third in the category, while the second G-Drive Racing entry was fourth, with fifth-placed qualifier Tincknell recording the session's best class individual lap time. Richie Stanaway and Rees, competing in the No. 99 Aston Martin, were the fastest LMGTE Pro qualifiers with a two-lap average time of 2:16.840. Gianmaria Bruni was 0.070 seconds off the Aston Martin's pace, and started from {{second place in the}} category, displacing Turner and Mücke from the position. Turner's fastest lap was invalidated after he went off the track and was required to set another time. James Calado and Davide Rigon secured fourth in AF Corse's No. 71 Ferrari with Sørensen and Nygaard rounding out the top five. Aston Martin's No. 98 entry driven by Paul Dalla Lana and Lamy took pole position in LMGTE Am, more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> faster than the No. 50 Larbre Compétition Corvette of Paolo Ruberti and Gianluca Roda.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, {{during a}} {{pre-season}} friendly representing Maccabi against the Toronto Raptors organized by then Israeli Consul-General Cobie Brosh, Parker hit the game-winning shot with less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> remaining to lead Maccabi to a 105–103 win at the Air Canada Centre. This gave the Raptors fans and management {{a glimpse of}} his abilities and in July 2006, Parker was officially signed by Raptors General Manager Bryan Colangelo {{as a free agent}} as part of a massive revamp of the 2006–07 Toronto team. He was signed for approximately $12million (USD) over three years, joining recent European veteran acquisitions Jorge Garbajosa and José Calderón on the team. Adopting a #18 jersey, Parker quickly established himself as the starting shooting guard for Toronto and a well-respected three-point shooter in the NBA, ranking fourth in the league for three point field goal percentage {{by the end of the}} regular season. Overall, in his first season with Toronto, he averaged 12.4 ppg, 3.9 rpg, and 2.1 apg, leading his team in three-point field goal percentage and free throw percentage. Parker's defensive and offensive versatility were credited as instrumental in helping the Raptors clinch their first-ever division title, first NBA Playoffs berth in five years, as well as best regular-season record in franchise history.|$|E
