25|$|The {{cookbook}} {{method of}} teaching introductory statistics leaves {{no time for}} history, philosophy or controversy. Hypothesis testing has been taught as received unified method. Surveys showed that graduates of the class were filled with philosophical misconceptions (on all aspects of statistical inference) that persisted among instructors. While the problem was addressed more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> and calls for educational reform continue, students still graduate from statistics classes holding fundamental misconceptions about hypothesis testing. Ideas for improving the teaching of hypothesis testing include encouraging students to search for statistical errors in published papers, teaching the history of statistics and emphasizing the controversy in a generally dry subject.|$|E

Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times wrote that the album [...] "sounds {{as if it were}} scientifically engineered to deliver hits". Peter Robinson of The Observer commended her collaborators for [...] "masking her own shortcomings" [...] and commented that, [...] "While Rihanna lacks her peers' charisma, she's a great vessel for exhilarating mainstream pop." [...] Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan found the album varied and satisfying.
