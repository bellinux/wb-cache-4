40|$|Publicâ€“private {{partnerships}} (PPPs) {{have been}} widely used to deliver infrastructure projects. However, PPPs are being plagued with controversy as some of them were subjected to project overruns and/or poor operations. An underlying issue contributing to unsatisfactory performance of PPPs was a result of an ambiguous <b>accountability</b> of <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> Despite this, limited empirical research has been undertaken to identify <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> <b>accountability</b> within PPPs. Thus, a conceptual framework of <b>the</b> <b>accountability</b> of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of PPPs is developed in this paper and then examined by conducting a case study of a Chinese PPP project. The findings indicate that <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> <b>accountability</b> in PPPs should shift to enhance the effectiveness of quality services and the efficiency of use of public resources for asset end-users and general population. This paper provides <b>the</b> <b>governments</b> embarking on PPPs with an insight into their accountability, ensuring Value for Money is delivered. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>Accountability</b> Office and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year.

5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>Accountability</b> Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E
