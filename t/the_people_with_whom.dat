5|$|The series {{consists}} of twelve historical fiction books {{written by the}} journalist, author and screenwriter George MacDonald Fraser, that were published between 1969 and 2005. The series {{consists of}} eleven novels and one collection of short stories, spanning from 1839 to 1894; they are the memoirs of the fictional character General Sir Harry Paget Flashman, VC, KCB, KCIE. Although Flashman is fictional, the settings {{and history of the}} events, and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> he interacts are all largely based around historical events and individuals, although three contain elements of other novels. Flashman first appeared in the 1857 semi-autobiographical novel Tom Brown's School Days by Thomas Hughes as a bully at Rugby School, who persecutes Tom Brown, and who is expelled for drunkenness: Fraser's series of novels starts with Flashman's expulsion from school. Based on a literary conceit, an explanatory note—itself also fictional—at the start of Flashman sets the context and explains that the memoirs had been found in an auction house in Ashby, Leicestershire and had subsequently come into the possession of Fraser, who has acted in the role of editor. Fraser also included pages of notes and appendices {{at the end of each}} volume, providing the factual background for Flashman's endeavours.|$|E

25|$|As an Ursuline nun, Sister Esther Marie-Joseph Wheelwright de l'Enfant Jésus, had {{no contact}} with her family, and over time lost her {{connections}} with most people from her previous life. Those who had been instrumental in her joining the Ursulines, including the Marquise de Vaudreuil and Father Bigot, died in the succeeding years.

25|$|On {{the level}} of {{developmental}} psychology the Gestaltkreis teachings correspond to Jean Piaget's observances {{on the development of}} the early childhood structures of perception, attitude and thought. In continual assimilation and accommodation processes, the motor cognitive and the emotional development work together and determine each other. The development of the senses, the continually differentiating thought and comportment structures, and the experience of space and time are, for Piaget, the prerequisites for developing the ability to symbolize. Compatible with this are the theories of development in depth psychology, where the main emphasis is on early childhood experience with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> one has relationships and where the condition for a healthy development is a happy relationship with the person to whom one relates most closely (Balint, Mahler, Ericson, Winnicott, Kohut and Kernberg).|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with StarTrek.com, Layla Sarakalo, the extra who said, [...] "I don't know if I {{know the answer to}} that... I think it's across the bay, in Alameda," [...] stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.|$|E

He clarified with MTV News that he had [...] "always {{wanted to work with}} pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So when I had the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled." [...] Madeon was associated with co-writing and co-producing three songs on Artpop, [...] "Venus", [...] "Mary Jane Holland" [...] and [...] "Gypsy". In August 2013, while being interviewed by French radio station, Fun Radio, Gaga confirmed that she had recorded [...] "Gypsy" [...] with Madeon and RedOne, as well as White Shadow. Having mutual respect for each others' work, Gaga praised Madeon's production skills saying, [...] "He is so amazing. He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. He reminds me of myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." [...] "Gypsy" [...] was described as Artpops most personal song, about travelling the world and the loneliness associated with it.

2500|$|A kobold {{can bring}} wealth to his {{household}} {{in the form}} of grain and gold. A legend from Saterland and East Friesland, recorded by Thorpe in 1852, tells of a kobold called the Alrûn. Despite standing only about a foot tall, the creature could carry a load of rye in his mouth for <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> he lived and did so daily as long as he received a meal of biscuits and milk. The saying to have an Alrûn in one's pocket means [...] "to have luck at play". However, kobold gifts may be stolen from the neighbours; accordingly, some legends say that gifts from a kobold are demonic or evil. Nevertheless, peasants often welcome this trickery and feed their kobold in the hopes that it continue bringing its gifts. A family coming into unexplained wealth was often attributed to a new kobold moving into the house.|$|E

However, Barât became increasingly exasperated with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> Doherty was associating and the drugs they brought.

2500|$|Sothern came to England for {{a six-week}} holiday in June 1880, still {{planning}} to produce Foggerty's Fairy in New York. After one illness {{and a short}} European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the autumn. His health declined until he died in January 1881 never having performed the play but leaving behind a heavily-annotated copy. Sothern's sister, Mary Cowan, was the beneficiary of Sothern's will. Sothern's widow contested the will, and it took Cowan until 31 May to probate it. Gilbert contacted Cowan soon after Sothern's death and offered her his help. He suggested that she [...] "underlet" [...] Foggerty's Fairy to him for £525 and half of whatever he received for it until she had been paid 1,500 guineas. The play was first offered to comic actor J. L. Toole, but the deal fell through, and Gilbert next offered the play to actor Charles Wyndham, who was then manager of the Criterion Theatre. After Gilbert had settled these financial dealings with Mrs. Cowan, she wrote to him: [...] "Allow {{me to say that}} of all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness & fairness & I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety." ...|$|E
