In the letter, which also mentions that a messenger from Oswiu had {{been among the}} companions of the archbishop-elect, the pope apologises {{that he has been}} unable to find a successor to Wighard yet. Wighard's death in Rome allowed Vitalian the opportunity to choose his successor, and Vitalian chose his friend Theodore of Tarsus to become the next archbishop.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom {{appears to}} be a {{powerful}} and prosperous political center, kings held the title of Lugal, and many are attested in the city, but the most important source is the letter of king Enna-Dagan c. 2350 BC, which was sent to Irkab-Damu of Ebla, and in it, the Mariote king mentions his predecessors and their military achievements. However, the reading of <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> still problematic and many interpretations have been presented by scholars.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> seen as {{the final}} salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a {{possible}} agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift {{found it necessary to}} publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.|$|E

5|$|A {{letter from}} Pope Adrian to Charlemagne survives which makes {{reference}} to Offa, but the date is uncertain; {{it may be}} as early as 784 or as late as 791. In it Adrian recounts a rumour that had reached him: Offa had reportedly proposed to Charlemagne that Adrian should be deposed, and replaced by a Frankish pope. Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, {{but it is clear}} it had been a concern to him. The enemies of Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one of reconciliation, but the letter might well have been written after the mission.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, Morton Smith {{published}} a book on a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria. He stated that, while cataloging documents at the ancient Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba {{in the summer of}} 1958, he discovered the text of the letter handwritten into the endpapers of Isaac Vossius' 1646 printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. It presented a letter of Clement of Alexandria to one Theodore, whom he seeks to warn against a Gospel of Mark falsified by the gnostic sect of Carpocratians. Clement concedes that it gives a 'more spiritual' version of Mark and quotes from it. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> consequently referred to as the Mar Saba letter. In his book, Smith {{published a}} set of black-and-white photographs of the text. He published a second book for the popular audience in 1974.|$|E
25|$|Later, while {{returning}} from the crusade in disguise, King Richard was first recognized by Meinhard II of Görz and then imprisoned by Conrad's cousin, Leopold V of Austria. Conrad's murder {{was one of the}} charges against him. Richard requested that the Hashshashin vindicate him, and in a letter allegedly from their leader, Rashid al-Din Sinan, they appeared to do so. The letter claimed that in 1191, Conrad had captured a Hashshashin ship that had sought refuge in Tyre during a storm. He killed the captain, imprisoned the crew, and stripped the ship of its treasure. When Rashid al-Din Sinan requested that the ship's crew and treasure be returned, he was rebuffed, and so a death sentence was issued for Conrad of Montferrat. However, <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> believed to have been forged: Sinan was already dead, and apart from this letter and the chronicle entries based upon it, there is no other evidence for the Hashashin being involved in shipping. The timing of the murder, and its consequences — the pregnant Isabella was married off to Henry of Champagne only seven days later, much to the disgust of Muslim commentators — suggest that the chief motive may be sought in Frankish politics.|$|E

500|$|The Drapier {{alludes to}} the {{involvement}} of the Duchess of Kendall in his first letter; in the second, the Drapier de-emphasises her involvement and shifts his focus to blame the Whig party. According to the Drapier, the Whigs are the ones who Wood bribed in securing his patent. The central target for <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> the Privy Council's report produced under the authority of Walpole. It was necessary for the Drapier to attack the report to ensure that the people would be willing to resist the coin and deny the [...] "truth" [...] that Wood's supporters issued. Therefore, the Drapier describes them as [...] "only a few Betrayers of their Country, Confederates with Woods".|$|E
500|$|Much of what {{is known}} of the design process for the three-dollar piece is from an August21, 1858, letter from the Mint's chief engraver, James B.Longacre, the coin's designer, to the then-Mint director, James Ross Snowden. [...] <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> {{apparently}} in response to some criticism, and in it, Longacre discussed his views on coin design, especially regarding the three-dollar piece. He noted that he was initially perplexed as to what to put on the coin; the three-dollar piece {{was the first time he}} had been allowed to choose a design. [...] Although he had designed the three-cent piece and other issues before Snowden's directorship, he had been told what to put on those pieces. [...] The coin weighed 64.5 grams, and had a fineness of 900.|$|E
500|$|The letter serves {{one other}} purpose: to {{delight in the}} Drapier's lack of being {{captured}} and his victory over Whitshed. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, {{was the one who}} actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials. A letter written anonymously by Swift, [...] "Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury", motivated the Irish jury to stand up against Whitshed and release the printer. The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as he could just be flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> [...] "in some ways the best written of all the Letters".|$|E

500|$|Enquiries {{continued}} for many months. The bishop was initially reluctant {{to pursue the}} case—Davidson {{thought he might be}} prepared to replace the charges with a lesser one of indiscipline. In February 1932 Dashwood advised Pollock that the matter could not be suppressed in this way; allegations had been printed in the Evening News on 1 February, and the story had been picked up by other papers whose lurid headlines had created much public interest. On 7 February the bishop received a letter from a 17-year-old girl, Barbara Harris, which contained specific allegations of immoral conduct against Davidson and promised more: [...] "I know lots of things against him that might help you... He has the keys of a lot of girls' flats and front doors." [...] <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> described by Matthew Parris in his account of the case as [...] "a masterpiece of vituperation"; [...] Davidson's lawyers failed to identify some obvious differences between the handwriting in the letter and other examples of Harris's writing, a factor which might have affected the impact of her subsequent testimony to the court.|$|E
500|$|When {{the letter}} was tabled at the Shaw Commission in 1929, Rustam Haidar spoke to Faisal in Baghdad and cabled that Faisal had [...] "no {{recollection}} that he wrote anything of the sort". In January 1930, Haidar wrote to a newspaper in Baghdad that Faisal: [...] "finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed {{to him as he}} at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an Arab country". Awni Abd al-Hadi, Faisal's secretary, wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between Frankfurter and Faisal took place and that: [...] "I believe that this letter, assuming that it is authentic, was written by Lawrence, and that Lawrence signed it in English on behalf of Faisal. I believe <b>this</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> part of the false claims made by Chaim Weizmann and Lawrence to lead astray public opinion." [...] According to Allawi, the most likely explanation for the Frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place, a letter was drafted in English by Lawrence, but that its [...] "contents were not entirely made clear to Faisal. He then {{may or may not have}} been induced to sign it", since it ran counter to Faisal's other public and private statements at the time.A 1 March interview by Le Matin quoted Faisal as saying: ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given {{time to get back}} into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, but this was a knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. <b>This</b> <b>letter</b> <b>is</b> widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E
