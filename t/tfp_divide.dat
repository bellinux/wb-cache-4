40|$|There is a {{substantial}} heterogeneity in productivity when comparing individual firms. However, even when heterogeneity is found, some questions still remain unaddressed. For instance, when focusing on EU nothing {{is known about the}} importance of firms' heterogeneity compared with that of location. This is a point to be addressed on empirical grounds: location is expected to affect firms, but there is no evidence quantifying the magnitude of these two effects across Europe. How much the difference is due to individual heterogeneity and how much it is a result of territorial influences? We depart from these arguments and contributes to the issue of EU <b>TFP</b> <b>divide</b> by questioning if differences in TFP levels depend on firms and regional specific effects. In other words, does location matter in understanding TFP regional disparities across Europe? If it does, how much of TFP variability is the result of being located in a region instead of in another. And, what about country-effects? In order to answer to these questions, we proceed by using data of firms operating in the seven European countries comprised in the EFIGE dataset (Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, henceforth, EU 7 -EFIGE countries). In this respect, when focusing on these countries, the role of being located in different regions will be investigated, net of the country-effect. Furthermore, a deep-analysis on the impact of regionalism within a given country, will be made by focusing on France, Italy and Spain. The key variable of the study is the TFP, which has been calculated at firm level by Bruegel for 2008 by employing the Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) approach. The empirical setting we propose is consistent with the type of analysis we carry out. Indeed, in order to explain the role of different factor in explaining firms' TFP, we consider the multilevel approach. This model allows us to evaluate whether and to what extent space matters in determining firms' performance. In fact, multilevel regressions combine different levels of data aggregation and relate them in ways that render the simultaneous existence of distinct level-one and level-two equations explicit. After having found high TFP heterogeneity across firms and regions, we confirm that firm-specific characteristics greatly affect individual TFP. They dominate to location. Another evidence regards the regional effect. It is high when estimations disregard the country-effects: in such a case, location across EU regions explains about 15. 2 % of the firms differences in TFP. After controlling for country-effects, we find that about 95. 3 % of the variance in European firms' TFP is due to firms' characteristics and 4. 7 % is ascribable to regionalism. These proportions slightly differ when considering the case of France, Italy and Spain and when regressions attempt to capture the role of sectoral membership...|$|E
30|$|Labor {{productivity}} growth rate {{is the main}} element of the macroeconomic scenario. In the long run, the growth in labor productivity (output per hour worked) broadly coincides with <b>TFP</b> growth <b>divided</b> by the labor share (set at 0.65). In particular, the EPC assumptions establish that TFP growth rates (for each country) will converge to a long-term historical average TFP growth rate recorded in the EU, of 1.1 %. However, as a sensitivity exercise, {{we are going to}} consider a new scenario for the {{productivity growth}} rate where the growth rate is 50 % lower in the short run and 12 % lower in the long run. 16 As we will see along the paper, the effects of the ‘silent reform’ would be minor when we consider this alternative scenario with a lower productivity growth rate.|$|R
40|$|In Malaysia, {{small and}} medium-scale {{industries}} (SMls) comprise about 90 per {{cent of the}} total manufacturing establishments. However contribution of SMIs to the manufacturing value added is quite low at about 26 per cent. This is partly attributed to low level of productivity and effciency and less capability of SMIs to gain economies of scale. In this respect, SMIs cannot merely rely on physical inputs like capital and labour in the course to raise their value added but must enhance the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP). TFP refers to a gain in additional output {{as a result of}} enhncement in firms' eficiency. An increase in the contribution of TFP will lead a decrease in cost of production and hence, firm will be more competitive. This article attempts to analyse to what extent TFP growth contributes to SMIs' output growth. Analysis in this article separates SMls by size, namely, small-scale industry (SSIs) and medium- scale industries (MSIs). In each industrial size, the analysis will compare TFP contribution by sub-industries. Analysis is based on the six selected sub-industries, namely, food, beverage, wood-based, chemical, rubber-based and non-metallic mineral products. The data for the analysis is obtained from the Manufacturing Industrial Survey, Department of Statistics, Malaysia for the period of 1981 - 1994. Analysis is based on the estimation results of the production function using stochastic frontier approach, whereby <b>TFP</b> is <b>divided</b> into two parts, namely, technical eficiency and technological progress...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is total factor {{productivity}} (TFP) analysis in Poland and identification of its determinants. In the first part, TFP growth in Poland is calculated. Following the growth literature, TFP is frequently interpreted {{as the level of}} technology and effectiveness of its use. In the remaining sections, the authors try to identify the factors determining TFP growth in Poland. The analysis is carried out on a panel of manufacturing industries over the period of 1994 - 2001. The determinants of <b>TFP</b> can be <b>divided</b> into four groups. First of all, TFP in Poland grows as a result of convergence, which {{can be explained by the}} transfer of technology from more technologically developed countries. Another factor accelerating TFP growth is the innovativeness of domestic enterprises, which can be approximated by expenditures on R&D. Transition reforms had also a positive impact on TFP growth in Poland in the analysed period, by increasing the effectiveness of the production factors use. Finally, ICT investment is found to contribute positively to TFP growth as well...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{carries out}} a growth {{accounting}} exercise for the 10 Central and Eastern European (CEE) {{countries that are}} part of the European Union over the period 1993 - 2008. We estimate the capital share (α) from a Cobb-Douglas production function in an intensive form, by employing panel data techniques. The Hausman and Chi-Square tests indicate that a Cross- Section Random Effects with Period Fixed Effects model best suits our data. Based on this model, we find a capital share between 0. 45 and 0. 83, higher than the usual 0. 3 - 0. 4 used in growth accounting literature. When we take into consideration the quality of labour force the estimated capital share slightly decreases, but still remains high, in a range between 0. 39 and 0. 79. Our growth accounting results reveal that, on average, capital per worker accumulation is the main engine of growth in CEE, followed by the contribution of total factor productivity (<b>TFP).</b> However, when <b>dividing</b> by sub-periods, we found that the contribution of TFP cannot be neglected since during 1997 - 2004 it proved to be the main engine of growth in some CEE countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania and Romania). Some policy implications are offered based on our results...|$|R
