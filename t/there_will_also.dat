5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not only will there be injustice to the defendant, but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E

In virtually all modern mixes <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> be various admixtures added to increase workability, reduce the required amount of water, mitigate harmful chemical reactions {{and for other}} beneficial purposes. In many cases <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> be Portland cement substitutes added, such as fly ash. This can {{reduce the cost of}} the concrete and improve its physical properties. The material is applied in a freshly mixed slurry, and worked mechanically to compact the interior and force some of the cement slurry to the surface to produce a smoother, denser surface free from honeycombing. The water allows the mix to combine molecularly in a chemical reaction called hydration.|$|E
