5|$|While the Ottawa Auditorium {{owned the}} hockey club, it was heavily indebted to Frank Ahearn and his father, {{and tried to}} clear its debt.

The best local bid was $100,000, while a bid to move the club to Chicago was made for $300,000, ultimately denied by the Chicago Blackhawks ownership. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Auditorium</b> tried to relocate the team to Baltimore under the ownership of former player Harvey Pulford.

5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. <b>The</b> <b>auditorium</b> had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
