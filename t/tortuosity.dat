25|$|The GDL {{electrically}} {{connects the}} catalyst and current collector. It must be porous, electrically conductive, and thin. The reactants {{must be able}} to reach the catalyst, but conductivity and porosity can act as opposing forces. Optimally, the GDL should be composed of about one third Nafion or 15% PTFE. The carbon particles used in the GDL can be larger than those employed in the catalyst because surface area is not the most important variable in this layer. GDL should be around 15-35µm thick to balance needed porosity with mechanical strength. Often, an intermediate porous layer is added between the GDL and catalyst layer to ease the transitions between the large pores in the GDL and small porosity in the catalyst layer. Since a primary function of the GDL is to help remove water, a product, flooding can occur when water effectively blocks the GDL. This limits the reactants ability to access the catalyst and significantly decreases performance. Teflon can be coated onto the GDL to limit the possibility of flooding. Several microscopic variables are analyzed in the GDLS such as: porosity, <b>tortuosity</b> and permeability. These variables have incidence over the behavior of the fuel cells. Two major GDL substrates, carbon cloth and paper, were compared, indicative of different cell performances.|$|E

The two- and three-dimensional <b>tortuosities</b> vary from 1. 5 to 2. 2 and from 1. 4 to 3. 25, respectively, when connectedness decreases from unity to zero. A method proposed for processing two-dimensional images of crack networks enabled the estimation of two- and three-dimensional <b>tortuosities</b> of an assumed isotropic crack network.

40|$|Complexity of {{the spatial}} {{configuration}} of an aortic implant with bifurcation in the distal part {{is related to}} changes in blood hemodynamic {{in the area of}} bifurcation which may disturb blood flow and lead to thrombus formation. This study was designed to characterize parameters which define spatial configuration of an aortic implant for which the risk of thrombus formation is the smallest. We used AngioCT data from 74 patients, aged 55 ± 10 years, after endovascular procedure to prepare 3 D geometries of stent-grafts. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to reconstruct blood hemodynamic and simulate thrombus formation. Next, geometric parameters of stent-grafts included the ratio of volume of upper part to the bifurcations, the relation of inlet and outlet diameters of a stent-graft and deformations in the iliac part of the stent-graft were analyzed. We also analyzed <b>tortuosities</b> (spiral twisting of the flow around the flow direction) and bends (the largest angulation in distal part of a stent-graft). The CFD results were confronted with AngioCT data to verify if computer generated thrombus appeared in particular patient. Additionally, geometric parameters of analyzed stent-grafts were used to propose a mathematical tool for prediction of thrombus appearance. The results showed that <b>tortuosities</b> and bends of a stent-graft had the highest impact on thrombus formation. Formation of thrombi was observed in 22 % to 31 % of cases (at blood hematocrit Hct = 40 %) even for small values of <b>tortuosities</b> and bends indicating that these parameters are dominant in determining blood clotting. Our calculated results overlapped with clinical data in 80 % to 91 %. Therefore, we conclude that <b>tortuosities</b> and bends have high impact on thrombus formation and should be under special attention during stent-graft recommendation and patients' follow-ups...|$|R

In this paper, the REV of cement pastes with supplementary cementitious materials (GGBS, PFA, SF) was determined by analysing the three-dimensional pore structure (> 0. 2 μm) using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The effect of axial distortion inherent to LSCM on 3 D pore structure was also investigated. A range of 3 D pore parameters was measured using skeletonisation, maximal ball and random walker algorithms. Results show that axial distortion has insignificant effects on most parameters except Euler connectivity, average pore and throat volumes and directional diffusion <b>tortuosities.</b> Most pore parameters become independent of sampling volume at ≈ 603 μm 3 except diffusion <b>tortuosities</b> and formation factor.
