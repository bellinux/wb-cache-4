40|$|Sediment {{accretion}} and elevation {{change in}} <b>tidal</b> <b>forests,</b> {{and the corresponding}} ability of these wetlands {{to keep pace with}} sea-level rise (SLR), represent data gaps in our understanding of wetland sustainability. Surface Elevation Tables and marker horizons were installed in three mature <b>tidal</b> <b>forests</b> and a restored tidal marsh, allowing us to measure elevation change, accretion, and subsidence. Additionally, we measured predictor variables to test for their significance in explaining accretion and elevation change rates. Mean accretion at our sites was 11. 67 +/- 3. 01 mm yr- 1 and mean elevation change was - 20. 22 +/- 8. 10 mm yr- 1, suggesting subsidence occurring beneath the sites. Processes contributing to accretion and elevation change at our sites may be driven by hydrologic patterns. Comparing our elevation trends with SLR trends suggests that our study sites may not keep pace with SLR. However, we may be observing short-term oscillations that do not indicate true long-term trends...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTidal {{wetlands}} play {{a significant}} role in the coastal carbon cycle and exchange material with the atmosphere and coastal ocean. Here, we report on changes in dissolved inorganic carbon speciation and isotopic composition throughout a 24 h cycle (2 tidal cycles) in Feb. 2007 in a channel connecting the Amazon estuary to the basin of a <b>tidal</b> <b>forest.</b> At this site, tropical forest soils are inundated at high tide by estuarine freshwater, and temporal concentration changes in the channel reflect exchanges between the forest and estuary. Our data show an export of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the form of excess CO 2 and, to a much lesser extent, CH 4. However, the <b>tidal</b> <b>forest</b> traps suspended sediments. Mixing plots of DIC versus conductivity showed that the DIC originated from the <b>tidal</b> <b>forest</b> soil, with a negligible contribution from the local watershed. Evolution of the isotopic signature of DIC reveals a 13 C-depleted source (− 56. 9 ± 3. 3 ‰), presumably originating from a dominant methanogenic pathway of carbon mineralization followed by almost complete CH 4 oxidation in the organic clay-rich freshwater soil...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Sediment {{accretion}} {{was measured}} at four sites in varying stages of forest-to-marsh succession along a fresh-to-oligohaline gradient on the Waccamaw River and its tributary Turkey Creek (Coastal Plain watersheds, South Carolina) and the Savannah River (Piedmont watershed, South Carolina and Georgia). Sites included <b>tidal</b> freshwater <b>forests,</b> moderately salt-impacted forests at the freshwater–oligohaline transition, highly salt-impacted forests, and oligohaline marshes. Sediment accretion {{was measured by}} use of feldspar marker pads for 2. 5 year; accessory information on wetland inunda-tion, canopy litterfall, herbaceous production, and soil char-acteristics were also collected. Sediment accretion ranged from 4. 5 mm year− 1 at moderately salt-impacted forest on the Savannah River to 19. 1 mm year− 1 at its relict, highly salt-impacted forest downstream. Oligohaline marsh sediment accretion was 1. 5 – 2. 5 times greater than in <b>tidal</b> freshwater <b>forests.</b> Overall, {{there was no significant}} difference in accre-tion rate between rivers with contrasting sediment loads. Accretion was significantly higher in hollows than on hum-mocks in <b>tidal</b> freshwater <b>forests.</b> Organic sediment accretion was similar to autochthonous litter production at all sites, but inorganic sediment constituted the majority of accretion at both marshes and the Savannah River highly salt-impacted forest. A strong correlation between inorganic sediment accumulation and autochthonous litter production indicated a positive feedback between herbaceous plant production and allochthonous sediment deposition. The similarity in rates of sediment accretion and sea level rise in <b>tidal</b> freshwater <b>forests</b> indicates that these habitats may become permanently inun-dated if the rate of sea level rise increases.

40|$|Diurnal {{flooding}} can {{be observed}} in the upper end of tidal estuaries, where flooding water originating from the river is constantly fresh. Here, the input from the river is confronted with a tidal wave, so that the sand banks, mud flats, low and high marshes and <b>tidal</b> <b>forests</b> are flooded mostly twice a day. A sequence of processes is linked to these flooding conditions. First, the physical processes organize new locations with sedimentation where succession can start, or they start sedimentation or erosion in existing types of vegetation. Second, the mixing of river water with the estuarine water starts chemical processes with cycling of nutrients and metals and the precipitation of suspended matter.
