5|$|From {{the early}} 12th century, {{and after the}} decay of the native Croatian royal family of Trpimirović, the castle of Klis was mainly governed by Croatian nobility, under <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Hungarian kings.

25|$|Several crusades {{were called}} against Bosnia, a country long deemed infested with heresy {{by both the}} rest of Catholic Europe and its Eastern Orthodox neighbours.

Kulin also reaffirmed <b>the</b> secular <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kings of Hungary over Bosnia.

5|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his position}} in 1240, Haakon focused on displaying <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the kingship, influenced by the increasingly closer contact with European culture. He started constructing several monumental royal buildings, primarily in the royal estate in Bergen where he built a European-style stone palace. He used a grand fleet with stately royal ships when meeting with other Scandinavian rulers, and actively sent letters and gifts to other European rulers; his most far-reaching contact was achieved when he sent gyrfalcons with an embassy to the Sultan of Tunis.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{broke from}} communion with the Catholic Church, over issues {{relating}} to his divorce, under the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 which proclaimed the monarch head of the Church of England. In contrast with much of European Protestantism, {{the roots of the}} split were more political than theological. He also legally incorporated his ancestral land Wales into the Kingdom of England with the 1535–1542 acts. There were internal religious conflicts during the reigns of Henry's daughters, Mary I and Elizabeth I. The former took the country back to Catholicism while the latter broke from it again, forcefully asserting <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Anglicanism.|$|E

5|$|Rowan {{identified}} with the Democratic-Republican Party and espoused the Jeffersonian principles of limited government and individual liberty. He was chosen to represent Nelson County at the constitutional convention held at Frankfort, Kentucky in 1799 to draft the second Kentucky Constitution. As a delegate, he advocated <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the legislative branch over the executive and judicial branches, which he believed provided ordinary citizens {{a greater role in}} state government. The constitution adopted by the convention abolished the use of electors to choose the governor and state senators, providing for the direct election of these officers instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the 1990s was marked by <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the Chicago Bulls, which saw them appear in six Finals. Coached by Phil Jackson and led by NBA superstar Michael Jordan, the Bulls won a title in every single appearance to the Finals from 1991 to 1998. Jordan was also the Finals MVP every time. The only other team to win championships during this period was the Houston Rockets, who went back-to-back in 1994 and 1995 during Jordan's initial retirement from professional basketball.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|For the {{following}} match against Gloucestershire before the Third Test, Brown did not play. Harvey {{came to the}} crease at 3/304 and put on 164 for the fourth wicket before his partner Morris was out for 294. He put on another 63 with Loxton before falling for 95. During his innings, Harvey repeatedly advanced out of the crease to attack the spinners. Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7/774 declared, their highest score of the tour, which underpinned a dominant innings victory. Harvey and the other Australian batsmen repeatedly left their crease to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard, who ended with 0/186. Goddard had been touted as a possible England selection because the bowlers used {{in the first two}} Tests had failed to challenge <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Australia’s batsmen, but the tourists’ attack ended his prospects. Loxton's innings earned him Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford, which was a rain-affected draw.|$|E
5|$|His reign saw {{the rise}} of socialism, communism, fascism, Irish republicanism, and the Indian {{independence}} movement, all of which radically changed the political landscape. The Parliament Act 1911 established <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the elected British House of Commons over the unelected House of Lords. As {{a result of the}} First World War (1914–1918), the empires of his first cousins Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany fell, while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the House of Windsor, which he renamed from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as a result of anti-German public sentiment. In 1924 he appointed the first Labour ministry and in 1931 the Statute of Westminster recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the Commonwealth of Nations. He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward VIII.|$|E
5|$|Intent on {{restoring}} <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Saladin's direct descendants {{within the}} Ayyubid family, an-Nasir Yusuf was eventually able {{to enlist the}} backing {{of all of the}} Syria-based Ayyubid emirs in a common cause against Mamluk-dominated Egypt. By 1250, he took Damascus with relative ease and except for Hama and Transjordan, an-Nasir Yusuf's direct authority stood unbroken from the Khabur River in northern Mesopotamia to the Sinai Peninsula. In December 1250, he attacked Egypt after hearing of al-Mu'azzam Turan-Shah's death and the ascension of Shajar al-Durr. An-Nasir Yusuf's army was much larger and better-equipped than that of the Egyptian army, consisting of the forces of Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and those of Saladin's only surviving sons, Nusrat ad-Din and Turan-Shah ibn Salah ad-Din. Nonetheless, it suffered a major defeat at the hands of Aybak's forces. An-Nasir Yusuf subsequently returned to Syria, which was slowly slipping out of his control.|$|E

5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were not nearly so great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Parliament holds {{legislative}} power {{and consists of}} the Queen and the House of Representatives. It also included an upper house, the Legislative Council, until this was abolished in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> Parliament, over the Crown and other government institutions, was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand. The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition {{with the majority of}} seats. If no majority is formed, a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured. The Governor-General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister, who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. Cabinet, formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister, is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions. Members of Cabinet make major decisions collectively, and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Stalin {{increasingly}} {{withdrew from}} Secretariat business, leaving {{the supervision of}} the body to Georgy Malenkov, possibly to test him as a potential successor. In October 1952, at the 19th Party Congress, Stalin restructured the party's leadership. His request, voiced through Malenkov, to be relieved of his duties in the party secretariat due to his age, was rejected by the party congress, as delegates were unsure about Stalin's intentions. In the end, the congress formally abolished Stalin's office of General Secretary, though Stalin remained one of the party secretaries and maintained ultimate control of the Party. When Stalin died on 5 March 1953, Malenkov was the most important member of the Secretariat, which also included Nikita Khrushchev, among others. Under a short-lived troika of Malenkov, Beria, and Molotov, Malenkov became Chairman of the Council of Ministers but was forced to resign from the Secretariat nine days later on 14 March, leaving Khrushchev in effective control of the body. Khrushchev was elected to the new office of First Secretary at the Central Committee plenum on 14 September of the same year. Originally conceived as a collective leadership, Khrushchev removed his rivals from power in both 1955 and (especially) 1957 and reinforced <b>the</b> <b>supremacy</b> <b>of</b> the First Secretary.|$|E
