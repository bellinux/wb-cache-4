5|$|Later {{studies showed}} that 5–10% of the viewers had mild {{symptoms}} that did not need hospital treatment. Twelve thousand children who did not get sent to hospital by ambulance reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure. A study following 103 patients over {{three years after the}} event found that most of them had no further seizures. Scientists believe that <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness. Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by this Pokémon episode was unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|The {{control pad}} {{may be used}} to move the hero in any {{direction}} and to move <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> cursor in menu displays. Additional buttons confirm and cancel commands. In the English version, players use menu commands to talk to people, check their status, search beneath their feet, use items, take treasure chests, open doors, and go up or down stairs. However, in some of the game's later remakes, certain commands were assigned to buttons, navigating stairs became automatic, and the hero's speed was increased. In the Japanese version, characters always face forward, so players must choose a command and then a direction in which to perform that action. In the North American version, the hero turns to face the direction he is moving, making direction selection unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use to achieve <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> effect. These include flashing {{a light bulb}} or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher {{flickering}} {{on a television}} in a room, before we see him in a scene dancing with blue flashing lights, and will.i.am. is shown in a similar room with red flashing lights. Usher is then shown with female background dancers in a white room. In the scene he dons a pair of glasses which show the dancers performing through the lens. Usher then dances outside {{in front of a}} concrete wall, with male background dancers appearing as shadows. As will.i.am. performs his verse, he and Usher are seen in their corresponding rooms with flashing lights. After this, Usher puffs a cigar and dances with male background dancers in an arena-like area, whilst he is also joined by female dancers with flashing lights on the floor, with the video ending with Usher shown on <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> television.|$|E

25|$|Building {{evidence}} suggests that the exterior surfaces of the arches were originally fitted with copper flashing. <b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> was secured onto the arches and covered by the wood caps. In most locations that were inspected, <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> had been removed, leaving only short remnants at random locations. <b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> was rolled up and taken away during the 1982 restoration effort. <b>The</b> <b>flashing</b> was an effective method of preventing moisture from entering the joints in the arch assembly, and its removal hastened deterioration. During this restoration as well, various deteriorated wood elements were replaced with pressure-treated, glue-laminated members.|$|E

25|$|Some LCDs mimic needle tuners with {{a needle}} graphic that moves {{in the same way}} as a genuine needle tuner.

However, these are all just display options. The way a regular tuner 'hears' and compares the input note to a desired pitch is exactly the same, with no change in accuracy.

Lightning is {{sometimes}} smoky, and is then called 'smoldering lightning"; sometimes it darts quickly along, and is then said to be vivid.

25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} head mounted {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim <b>the</b> <b>flashing</b> from a molded part to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|E
