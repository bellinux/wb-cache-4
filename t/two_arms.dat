As the consort of Khandoba, her chief temple - the Mohiniraj temple - {{is located at}} Nevasa, where she is worshiped as a four-armed goddess and identified with Mohini. Mhalsa is often depicted with <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> and accompanying Khandoba on his horse or standing besides him.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the Columbia Slough basin are the {{watersheds}} of the Sandy River to the east, Johnson Creek to {{the south}}, the Willamette {{to the south}} and west, and the Columbia to the north. Lying slightly north of the watershed, large islands in the Columbia River include, from east to west, McGuire Island, Government Island, Lemon Island, and Tomahawk Island, which is connected to Hayden Island. Bordered by the Columbia and <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> of the Willamette, Sauvie Island lies just west of the mouth of the slough.|$|E
5|$|Some {{have noted}} the roots of Ganesha worship, dating back to 3,000 BCE since the times of Indus Valley Civilization. In 1993, a metal plate {{depiction}} of an elephant-headed figure, interpreted as Ganesha, was discovered in Lorestan Province, Iran, dating back to 1,200 BCE. First terracotta images of Ganesha are from 1st century CE found in Ter, Pal, Verrapuram, and Chandraketugarh. These figures are small, with elephant head, <b>two</b> <b>arms,</b> and chubby physique. The earliest Ganesha icons in stone were carved in Mathura during Kushan times (2nd-3rd centuries CE).|$|E

5|$|The harbour from Church Point, {{where the}} <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> meet, to the Atlantic Ocean is {{referred}} to as Sheet Harbour. It is wider than either arm. It is approximately 11-15 metres (36-49 ft) deep at low tide. It gradually widens as it flows southward the Atlantic Ocean. After Church Point, it flows southeast-ward past the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port and west of the small community of Watt Section. It then curves and flows southwest-ward to southward toward the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> of the {{cruciform}} plan contains different thrones for use {{in different}} royal functions; these included the Mother-of-Pearl Throne (พระแท่นราชบัลลังก์ประดับมุก) which stands almost at {{the centre of the}} hall between the intersecting points of the four arms. The square-shaped throne is entirely inlaid with mother-of-pearl, dating from the reign of King Rama I. It was saved from the Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat, when the throne hall burnt down in 1789. The throne is topped by the Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella.|$|E
5|$|Deivanai is {{generally}} depicted with her husband, particularly in an iconographic form called Senapati. She {{sits on the}} left thigh of the six-headed and twelve-armed Kartikeya. One of his arms holds her waist. Numerous depictions of the two exist at Tirupparankunram, the location of their marriage. However, in many south-Indian representations, when Murugan is depicted only with one consort, Valli is favoured over Devasena. In most South-Indian depictions, Murugan is depicted with both his consorts standing besides him; Devasena is on his left-hand side. Her complexion is yellow; she is often depicted adorned with a crown, earrings, necklaces and ornaments. She wears a traditional sari and has <b>two</b> <b>arms.</b> She holds a lotus in her left arm, while his right hand hangs down.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only <b>two</b> <b>arms,</b> and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E
5|$|Heavier {{suburban}} {{traffic on the}} Melbourne network saw a greater strain on the block working then used, which required {{a large number of}} manned signal boxes to enable trains to run close together. As a result, it was decided to adopt power signalling under the Automatic Block System (ABS) of safeworking, where the presence of trains automatically control the signals after them, providing a safe distance between trains. Introduced from 1915, the system was based on American speed signalling practice with GRS2A upper quadrant mechanical signals with <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> able to indicate up to 5 different speed aspects to train drivers. These signals were later replaced by colour light signals which are the standard today, but the old mechanical style remained until 2001.|$|E
5|$|In Kushan era {{representations}} {{between the}} first and third centuries CE, she is depicted as two-armed and six-headed like Skanda. A significant number of Kushan and Yaudheya coins, sculptures and inscriptions produced from 500 BCE to 1200 CE picture the six-headed Shashthi, often on the reverse of the coin, with the six-headed Skanda on the observe. Shashthi is also pictured in a Kushan-era Vrishni triad from the Mathura region, surrounded by Skanda and Vishakha. In Yaudheya images, she is shown to have <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> and six heads that are arranged in two tiers of three heads each, while in Kushan images, the central head is surrounded by five female heads, sometimes attached to female torsos. Terracotta Gupta era (320–550 CE) figures from Ahichchhatra show the goddess with three heads on the front and three on the back.|$|E

5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with <b>two</b> <b>arms,</b> manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconographic}} 16th century work Shilparatna, the Matsya Purana and Agamic texts like Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama and Karanagama – {{most of them}} of South Indian origin – {{describe the}} iconography of Ardhanarishvara. The right superior {{side of the body}} usually is the male Shiva and the left is the female Parvati; in rare depictions belonging to the Shaktism school, the feminine holds the dominant right side. The icon usually is prescribed to have four, three or <b>two</b> <b>arms,</b> but rarely is depicted with eight arms. In the case of three arms, the Parvati side has only one arm, suggesting a lesser role in the icon.|$|E
5|$|The {{western and}} the wider arm is {{referred}} to as the Northwest Arm, while the eastern arm is known as the Northeast Arm. The <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> connect just below Church Point, southeast of where West River meets the Northwest Arm. The harbour continues southeast-ward, then southward toward the Atlantic Ocean. The Northwest Arm extends northwest until it meets the mouth of West River at the West River Falls. The Northeast Arm extends north, then curves northeast under the East River Bridge, until it meets the mouth of the East River. There is a very small island in the arm, named Hen Island. Moorings were installed in the arm in Spring 2017.|$|E

5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of dentine surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends {{all the way through}} the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The enamel is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, in {{conjunction}} with American movements northward to Chambois, Canadian forces launched Operation Tractable; the Allied intention was to trap and destroy the German 7th Army and 5th Panzer Army {{near the town of}} Falaise. Five days later, the <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> of the encirclement were almost complete; the advancing U.S. 90th Infantry Division had made contact with the Polish 1st Armored Division and the first Allied units crossed the Seine at Mantes Gassicourt, while German units were fleeing eastward by any means they could find. By 22 August, the Falaise Pocket — which the Germans had been fighting desperately to keep open to allow their trapped forces to escape — was finally sealed, ending the Battle of Normandy with a major Allied victory. All German forces west of the Allied lines were now dead or in captivity and although perhaps 100,000 German troops escaped they left behind 40,000–50,000 prisoners and over 10,000 dead. A total of 344 tanks and self-propelled guns, 2,447 soft-skinned vehicles and 252 artillery pieces were found abandoned or destroyed in the northern sector of the pocket. The Allies were able to advance freely through undefended territory and by 25 August all four Allied armies (First Canadian, Second British, First U.S., and Third U.S.) involved in the Normandy campaign were on the river Seine.|$|E
5|$|The video shifts {{again to}} Björk {{buried in the}} sand under the rain of ashes. The two pieces of rock appear again, this time each one with a Björk-shaped strata. The strata also sing parts of the song, and <b>two</b> <b>arms</b> come out from the {{floating}} rocks and their hands barely brush against each other. The rocks unite once again as the chorus begins for the second time. During {{this part of the}} video, images of Björk singing in a smoky setting alternate with more rocks uniting to the main two, while their Björk-shaped strata secrete a substance similar to lava from their mouth. All the rocks are now united, forming a big volcano, whose crater is shaped like two opposite Björk-shaped rocks. The volcano finally erupts in an explosion of magma, while a thunderstorm occurs in the background. The video ends as the volcano fades out and all that remains visible is ash and smoke.|$|E
