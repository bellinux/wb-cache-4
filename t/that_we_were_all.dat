2500|$|Healy died on December 21, 1937 {{at the age}} of 41, {{after an}} evening of celebration at the Trocadero nightclub on the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. [...] He was {{reportedly}} celebrating the birth of his son, an event he had eagerly anticipated, according to Moe Howard. [...] "He was nuts about kids," [...] wrote Howard. [...] "He used to visit our homes and envied the fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> married and had children. Healy always loved kids and often gave Christmas parties for underprivileged youngsters and spent hundreds of dollars on toys." ...|$|E
2500|$|After he was {{reported}} in the press as saying homosexuals should [...] "repent and be changed", he made further comments in which he clarified his remarks. He stated that he had initially said to the journalist from the Telegraph {{that he was going to}} say in his sermon that all people, particularly churches and Christians, should repent, because there was a need [...] "to refocus on the faith of the church from down the ages and an authentic mission to the nations." [...] When asked specifically about whether this included homosexuals, he had said that yes, it included everybody and went on to give his interpretation of the Christian view of human sexuality, marriage and the family, saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> sinners and in continual need of repentance for our shortcomings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Susan Lucci {{responded to}} a casting call for All My Children. She {{initially}} auditioned {{for the role of}} Tara Martin. The [...] "character <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> interested in was not Erica, but Tara," [...] said Doris Quinlan, the show's former executive producer. [...] "She was the sweet young ingenue — the one with all the problems that everyone was supposed to care about... I certainly couldn't cast [...] as a young, innocent, sweet little Irish girl. That's not what comes out. She's much more sophisticated – at least she gives that appearance. She was perfect to play Erica." [...] After a meeting with a casting director, they promised to call her back in six months. One of hundreds of people they called back in, Lucci progressed on from each reading of the part until she received the role. [...] "I saw the audition tapes, and she just stood out," [...] said Agnes Nixon. [...] "There was never a question, ever." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing for {{the record}} began in September 2003, soon after Isis had {{relocated}} from Boston to Los Angeles. According to guitarist Mike Gallagher, “we started working on ideas for songs and sounds as individuals, in pairs or as a whole group until {{we were able to}} shape the ideas into songs <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> happy with and could stand behind”. Whilst some tracks originated from [...] "little jams" [...] the band would do at sound check, the majority of the album was created in time dedicated to writing new material. Gallagher adds that “usically speaking, Panopticon came out a couple of ideas that had been kicking around in our heads for some time, but the bulk of it was composed after we decided {{that it was time to}} do a new record. The writing process consisted mostly of an individual starting the core of an idea for a song at home then either pairing off with someone else or bringing it to everyone where it was worked on and refined until everyone was satisfied”. According to Jeff Caxide, this process was significantly different from that of previous Isis albums, as “everyone wrote a lot on this record. There is not one song that could be credited to one person”.|$|E
2500|$|For example, when Henry is {{urged by}} Clifford, Northumberland and Westmorland {{to engage the}} Yorkists in combat in the {{parliamentary}} chambers, he is reluctant, arguing that the Yorkists have greater support in London than the Lancastrians; [...] "Know you not the city favours them,/And they have troops of soldiers at their beck" [...] (1.1.67–68). Both Hall and Holinshed report that the Yorkists invaded the parliament house, but only Hall reports that Henry chose not to engage them {{because the majority of}} the people supported York's claim to the throne. Rutland's death scene (1.3) is also based on Hall rather than Holinshed. Although Clifford is reported as having murdered Rutland in both Hall and Holinshed, only in Hall is Rutland's tutor present, and only in Hall do Rutland and Clifford engage in a debate about revenge prior to the murder. The depiction of Edward's initial meeting with Lady Grey (3.2) is also based on Hall rather than Holinshed. For example, Hall is alone in reporting that Edward seemingly offered to make her his queen merely from motives of lust; Edward [...] "affirming farther that if she would thereunto condescend , she might so fortune of his paramour and concubine to be changed to his wife and lawful bedfellow.") Later, Holinshed does not mention any instance in which George and Richard express their dissatisfaction with Edward's decision (depicted in the play in 4.1), or their questioning of Edward as to why he is favouring the relations of his wife over his own brothers. Such a scene occurs only in Hall, who writes that Clarence declared to Gloucester that, [...] "We would make him know <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> three one man's sons, of one mother and one lineage descended, which should be more preferred and promoted than strangers of his wife's blood [...] He will exalt or promote his cousin or ally, which little careth for the fall or confusion of his own line and lineage.") A more general aspect unique to Hall is the prominence of revenge as a motive for much of the cruelty in the play. Revenge is cited many times by different characters as a guiding force behind their actions; Northumberland, Westmorland, Clifford, Richard, Edward and Warwick all declare at some point in the play that they are acting out of a desire for vengeance on their enemies. Revenge, however, plays little part in Holinshed, who hardly mentions the word, and never offers it as a major theme of the war.|$|E
