25|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> for Jamaican dissatisfaction was the Federation's {{continuing}} colonial status. Jamaica {{had joined}} the Federation because its leaders had believed that the West Indies would quickly be granted independence.

Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island could and should seek independence in its own right.|$|E

25|$|Although {{diamonds}} were {{a significant}} motivating and sustaining factor, {{there were other}} means of profiting from the Sierra Leone Civil War. For instance, gold mining was prominent in some regions. Even more common was cash crop farming {{through the use of}} forced labor. Looting during the Sierra Leone Civil War did not just center on diamonds, but also included that of currency, household items, food, livestock, cars, and international aid shipments. For Sierra Leoneans who did not have access to arable land, joining the rebel cause was an opportunity to seize property through the use of deadly force. But <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> why the civil war should not be entirely attributed to conflict over the economic benefits incurred from the alluvial diamond mines is that the pre-war frustrations and grievances did not just concern that of the diamond sector. More than twenty years of poor governance, poverty, corruption and oppression created the circumstances for the rise of the RUF, as ordinary people yearned for change.|$|E
25|$|Although the Qajars were victorious and Agha Mohammad Khan {{kept his}} promise to Heraclius (Erekle) that if he would not drop the {{alliance}} with Russia and voluntarily reaccept Iranian suzerainty they would invade his kingdom, it also showed that Russia's own ambitions and agenda were set as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> for Russia not to intervene at Krtsanisi, even though the latter had officially declared in the Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783 that it would protect Erekle's kingdom against any new Iranian ambitions to re-subjugate Georgia. Subsequently, in order to restore Russian prestige, Catherine would launch a punitive campaign against Iran the next year, but it was shortly recalled after her death. The following years remained turbulent and were known as a time of muddle and confusion. Reestablishment of Iranian rule over Georgia did not last long, for the shah was assassinated in 1797 in Shusha, and the Georgian king had died the year after. With Georgia laying in ruins and the central rule in Iran being concerned with the next heir to the throne, it {{opened the way for}} Georgia's annexation by Russia several years later by Tsar Paul.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> for the precipitous {{decline of}} President Johnson's {{popularity}} was the Vietnam War, which he greatly escalated {{during his time}} in office.

[...] Draftees made up 42 percent {{of the military in}} Vietnam, but suffered 58% of the casualties as nearly 1000 Americans a month were killed and many more were injured.

2500|$|The {{accordion}} only {{arrived in}} large numbers {{in the country in}} about 1875, but its popularity grew quickly. [...] Among the reasons for this were the instrument's cheapness and durability, and could be played solo, and was easier to learn. [...] Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason,</b> though, was the instrument's association with 'kof ha kof' couples dancing like waltzes and mazurkas, which stood {{in stark contrast to the}} line and round dances familiar in Breton folk; the perceived sexuality of the instrument's common dances may have made it more attractive. [...] By the 1920s, the instrument was more popular than any other. In the 1930s, chromatic accordions arrived in Brittany and jazz-influenced bands with saxophones, drum kits and banjos were formed.|$|E

[...] The safety bonus of engines that could be adjusted and mended in the air, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> behind the layout was achieved.

2500|$|A crisis arose when Christensen {{was going}} through a palette of emotions, but he could not share them with the other band members as they neither shared Christensen's enthusiasm, nor could {{appreciate}} the unique symbolism of recording in these legendary studios as much as Christensen did. This caused Christensen to turn to his long-time girlfriend Pernille Rosendahl {{in and out of the}} studio, while becoming increasingly estranged from the band. Nielsen and Friis even went as far as labeling the couple as [...] "John and Yoko", referring to the supposed detrimental influence of Yoko Ono on John Lennon, which is said to have contributed to the break-up of the Beatles. This period also showed the first signs of the band members heading in different musical directions, about which Christensen explained in 2000: [...] "I needed change while the others wanted to continue in the same style, and that was actually <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> we split up." [...] This is especially evident from the song [...] "Rise and Fall"; although songs were usually a collaborative effort by the band, Christensen requested Nielsen and Friis to allow him to be in full control over this song, and as a result it is distinctly different from all other songs on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired to a {{large extent}} by the stories of the {{soldiers}} at trial, mutiny broke out in the Royal Indian Navy, and received widespread public support. While the troops who fought for the Allies were being demobilised, the Navy mutiny was followed up by smaller mutinies in the Royal Indian Air Force, and a mutiny in the Indian Army that was suppressed by force. In the aftermath of the mutinies, the weekly intelligence summary issued on 25 March 1946 admitted that the Indian military was no longer trustworthy, and for the Army, [...] "only day to day estimates of steadiness could be made". The armed forces could not be relied upon to suppress unrest as they had been before, and drawing from experiences of the Free India Legion and INA, their actions could not be predicted from their oath to the King-Emperor. Reflecting on the factors that guided the British decision to relinquish their rule in India, Clement Attlee, then the British Prime Minister, cited as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> the realisation that the Indian armed forces might not prop up the Raj. Although the British government had promised to grant dominion status to India {{at the end of the}} war, the views held by British officials after the war show that although militarily a failure the Indians who fought for the Axis likely accelerated Indian independence. This is contrary to the usual narrative of India's independence struggle, which focuses only on the INC and Mahatma Gandhi.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 August 1939, Ribbentrop's {{influence}} with Hitler wavered {{for a moment}} when the news reached Berlin of the ratification of the Anglo-Polish military alliance and a personal message from Mussolini telling Hitler that Italy would dishonour the Pact of Steel if Germany attacked Poland. This was especially damaging to Ribbentrop, as he always assured Hitler that [...] "Italy's attitude is determined by the Rome-Berlin Axis". As a result of the message from Rome and the ratification of the Anglo-Polish treaty, Hitler cancelled the invasion of Poland planned for 26 August, and instead ordered it held back until 1 September in order to give Germany some time to break up the unfavourable international alignment. Though Ribbentrop continued to argue that Britain and France were bluffing, both he and Hitler were prepared as a last resort to risk a general war by invading Poland. Because of Ribbentrop's firmly held views that Britain was Germany's most dangerous enemy and that an Anglo-German war was thus inevitable, it scarcely mattered to him when his much desired war with Britain came. The Greek historian Aristotle Kaillis wrote that it was Ribbentrop's {{influence with}} Hitler together with his insistence that the Western powers would in the end not go to war for Poland that was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>reason</b> why Hitler did not cancel Fall Weiß (the German invasion of Poland) altogether instead of postponing [...] "X-day" [...] for six days. Ribbentrop told Hitler that his sources showed that Britain would only be militarily prepared to take on Germany at the earliest in 1940 or more probably 1941, so this could only mean that the British were bluffing. Even if the British were serious in their warnings of war, Ribbentrop took the view that since a war with Britain was inevitable, the risk of a war with Britain was an acceptable one and accordingly he argued that Germany should not shy away from such challenges.|$|E
