25|$|The Art of Visual Thinking (October 2, 1966) – A {{remake of}} the skit {{of the same name}} from Sam and Friends. Kermit (performed by Jim Henson) teaches Grump (performed by Frank Oz and voiced by Jerry Juhl) about the concept of {{visualizing}} thoughts through drawings shown on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen.</b> This sketch was reprised on June 4, 1967.|$|E
25|$|From 1961–1966, the American TV network NBC {{carried a}} karaoke-like series, Sing Along with Mitch, {{featuring}} host Mitch Miller and a chorus, which superimposed {{the lyrics to}} their songs {{near the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> for home audience participation. The primary difference between Karaoke and sing-along songs is the absence of the lead vocalist.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 {{no public}} votes were presented: a closed jury simply {{announced}} that Switzerland had won. From 1957 to 1987, the points were {{displayed on a}} physical scoreboard {{to the side of}} the stage. As digital graphic technology progressed, the physical scoreboards were superseded in 1988 by an electronic representation which could be displayed on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> at the will of the programme's director.|$|E

50|$|After 2 years, Starmania {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screens.</b> Everything was modernised and more professional.The winner was Nadine Beiler, {{who is a}} Tyrolian. 1.153 million people watched the final, {{which is more than}} the second season, but less than in the first season.|$|R
50|$|All {{traces of}} its elegant past, {{including}} the gold leaf and faux marble balustrades, were painted over with bold colours of yellow, red, blue, black, and silver, with the walls carpeted {{in red and}} blue. The entrance at Yonge Street was a modern-looking, aluminum-paneled front, with no canopy or vertical, featuring a large circle opening above the entrance into a brightly lit open outdoor square with bright modern marquee panels above on 3 sides, and 6 television screens {{on each side of}} the approach to the entrance doors showing movie trailers of features and coming attractions. <b>The</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> were later replaced by poster cases due to visibility problems with sunlight washing out <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> and technical problems with the early 1-inch video tape machines (12 in total, a separate machine for each screen).|$|R
25|$|The Sensor Bar is {{required}} when the Wii Remote is controlling up-down, left-right motion of a cursor or reticle on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> {{to point to}} menu options or objects such as enemies in first-person shooters. Because the Sensor Bar also allows the Wii Remote to calculate {{the distance between the}} Wii Remote and the Sensor Bar, the Wii Remote can also control slow forward-backward motion of an object in a 3-dimensional game. Rapid forward-backward motion, such as punching in a boxing game, is controlled by the acceleration sensors. Using these acceleration sensors (acting as tilt sensors), the Wii Remote can also control rotation of a cursor or other objects.|$|E
25|$|The Wii U GamePad was {{described}} as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface.|$|E
500|$|... "Tabloid Junkie" [...] is {{credited}} as a pop—funk song, {{that is similar}} to New Jack Swing. Throughout the song, Jackson sings in a quick-voice, which some music critics viewed as Jackson [...] "not singing" [...] but [...] "harrumphing". [...] It is a plea to the public to not believe everything in the tabloids; and the lyrics are about media bias and sensational journalism about Jackson and in general. This can be heard in lyrics such as, [...] "Just because you read it in the magazine or see it on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> don't make it factual".|$|E
50|$|The show also {{aired on}} {{regional}} sports networks around the country, on Rogers Sportsnet in Canada, {{and was also}} often played {{as part of the}} pre-game entertainment on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screens</b> of major league stadiums. From 2004-2005, segments of the show were hosted by U.S. fast-pitch softball sensation Jennie Finch.|$|R

Krusty then appears on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> in the loading room and remarks [...] "Well, that's our ride. Hey! What does THIS do?!". For the Orlando attraction, Krusty is sitting in a control room and pushes an emergency button on a control panel, causing the vehicle to vibrate, ending the ride. In the Hollywood version, Krusty is sitting in a control room and takes a picture of the guests (The on-ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction). After the gullwing doors on the car lift up, guests exit the ride.|$|E
500|$|David Browne, of Entertainment Weekly, {{noted that}} [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] comes as [...] "close to {{transcendence}} as {{anywhere on the}} album" [...] and described the chorus, [...] "Just because you {{read it in the}} magazine or see it on <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> don't make it factual" [...] as Jackson's [...] "grabbiest, most driven refrain in years." [...] Although Browne praised the song, he commented, [...] "The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics are all but obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws it all away — but then, it wouldn't be the first time." [...] Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the [...] "rust in songs" [...] like [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] as having a [...] "raw aspect" [...] that Jackson [...] "hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'." [...] Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] was a [...] "disingenuous attack on sensational news stories" [...] about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were [...] "planted" [...] by Jackson himself.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Mina's TV {{and radio}} career was {{interrupted}} by RAI, the Italian public broadcasting service, as she refused to cover up her relationship (and resulting pregnancy) with the married actor Corrado Pani. Mina's record sales were unaffected and due to public demand, RAI ended the ban. On 10 January 1964 she returned to <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> on the program La fiera dei sogni, and performed the song [...] "Città vuota", a cover of Gene McDaniels' [...] "It's a Lonely Town (Lonely Without You)", which was her first release on the RiFi label. Her next single, [...] "È l'uomo per me", a cover of Jody Miller's [...] "He Walks Like a Man", became the biggest selling record {{of the year in}} Italy. Her new melodic manner was demonstrated again on 11 December 1964 TV program Il macchiettario, where she performed [...] "Io sono quel che sono" [...] ("I Am What I Am"). A reminder of her previous adolescent image, her single [...] "Suna ni kieta namida" [...] ("Tears Disappear in the Sand"), sung in Japanese, peaked at #1 on the Japanese singles chart and earned Mina the title of Best International Artist in Japan.|$|E

500|$|Braeden's {{biography}} at Yahoo! {{notes that}} upon his casting as the ruthless businessman Victor, he [...] "clicked {{with both the}} audience and the creative powers, and {{has been one of}} the series leading men for close to two decades". Kim Muraro of LimeLife stated that instead of his originally planned three-month stay at the series, he [...] "has become one of the most iconic characters in daytime TV". Garrett, writing from Canyon News, wrote: [...] " [...] plays the mastermind mogul with real gusto. His innate acting skills are as legendary as his distinguished career. This week, we saw Braeden play ruthless, conniving and ultimately a loving father." [...] Good News Weekly wrote: [...] "There are some men that are larger than life. There are some men that transcend <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen.</b> There are some men that touch the lives of millions of viewers. Victor Newman is one of those men." [...] In 2005, Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Braeden has transformed the character into a [...] "global phenom". BuddyTV noted the storyline where Victor locked his wife Julia's lover in a bomb shelter as [...] "the turning point" [...] in the character's life, making him a villain.|$|E
500|$|A few modern video gaming {{websites}} reviewed Ninja GaidenIII {{upon its}} release to the Virtual Console in 2008. Nintendo Life's Damien McFerran gave lackluster ratings, {{saying that the}} game [...] "passed under the radar of many a videogame enthusiast". He added that while the presentation was great, he pointed out flaws in the [...] "silly" [...] plot, the inconsistently laid-out level designs, and frustrating difficulty {{in addition to the}} five-continue limit. He said that many gamers would prefer the previous two Ninja Gaiden titles over this one. IGN's Lucas Thomas appreciated the improvement in Ryu's ability to scale and climb on top of walls, his ability to hang overhead, good storyline, and the new items such as the Dragon Sword power-up and the Vacuum Wave. His chief criticism was the game's difficulty, saying that it's not the [...] "rewarding kind of difficult" [...] but instead [...] "the cheap, annoying kind of difficult that makes you want to throw your controller at <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> and just go read a book". As with the Nintendo Life review, Thomas similarly criticized the inconsistent level design as well as a storyline which becomes progressively more bizarre, including [...] "weird science-fiction themes about bionics and clones".|$|E

2500|$|Nick Bryan of Dork Adore {{found that}} the tension was built well enough, but found himself [...] "wishing for more scale and heart-stopping drama in the finale." [...] Furthermore, Bryan {{believed}} that the series nine finale {{would have made a}} more fitting end to the series. Christopher Hootan stated [...] "it was with great trepidation that I sat down to watch the show's finale, which promised to put you so far on the edge of your seat as to find your nose touching <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen.</b> And it did not disappoint." [...] Hootan added [...] "as ever this was suitably peril-ridden with plenty of last minute airstrikes and time-sensitive interrogations, but the real tension lay with the fate of everyone's favourite po-faced head of operations, Harry Pearce." [...] With the Harry and Ruth storyline, the reviewer noted that the non-happy ending [...] "will annoy some," [...] but found Ruth's death [...] "a captivating bit of TV as Harry was left with the deaths of two past loves on his conscience." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 1973 Split Ends {{entered the}} New Faces {{television}} talent contest, and {{in preparation for}} their performance they recorded two new Judd-Finn songs: [...] "129" [...] and [...] "Home Sweet Home". Soon after, they also recorded [...] "Sweet Talking Spoon Song", which would become the second single. In the event - and much {{to the dismay of}} the Finn family watching at home - Split Ends finished second-last in the contest. Although this first television appearance was not recorded by TVNZ, the Finn family still have the shaky, silent 8mm b/w home movie footage they shot directly off <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>screen</b> and a portion of that was later included in the Split Enz documentary Spellbound. Despite their loss on New Faces, the group made a sufficiently strong impression to secure them a 30-minute concert special for Television New Zealand, which was recorded soon after. Typical of the time, the performances were mimed to pre-recorded backing tracks, so the band put down four more songs including [...] "No Bother To Me", [...] "Malmsbury Villa" [...] and [...] "Spellbound". It was around this time that their group altered its name to the punningly patriotic Split Enz. In November 1973, EMI NZ issued the band's second single, [...] "129" [...] / [...] "Sweet Talking Spoon Song".|$|E
