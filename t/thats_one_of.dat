Prospero didnt even tempt Providence: he was Providence. <b>Thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Tarleton's ideas; and dont you forget it.|$|E

Doby said in an {{interview}} later, [...] "One {{of the things that was}} disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken." ...|$|E

As soon as I got it I literally sat down and started writing, hence the first line, “Im writing this whole thing tonight.” We actually had this long ending where I was singing but we changed it up at the last minute in favour of the part where I say, “Fucking my old girls like its going to make you me, but its more than that.” Im so glad we made that change because <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my favourite lines on the album." ...|$|E
5000|$|Having worked {{together}} in the MBC omnibus drama Beating Heart (2005), actress Bae Doona recommended Go to director Bong Joon-ho when he was casting for his much-anticipated monster film. After an extensive audition process, Go made her film debut in 2006 with a starring role in The Host. Bong praised her work, saying that she [...] "showed really mature acting for her age, and <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her defining charms as an actress." [...] Go was also applauded by film critics, with Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post complimenting her [...] "exquisite performance," [...] and Megan Ratner of the Bright Lights Film Journal noting her [...] "unforced naturalness, reminiscent not only of Ana Torrent but of Zazies Catherine Demongeot." [...] Go received several acting nominations, and won Best New Actress at the 2006 Blue Dragon Film Awards.|$|E
5000|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think its timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically its heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the albums 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the bands thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping {{some of the biggest}} hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

5000|$|The Blackhawks {{have worked}} with the American Indian Center to help educate their {{community}} and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, {{the executive director of}} the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, [...] "Hawks are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking. What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) want nothing to do with native people but yet theyre trying to say they respect us." [...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfathers picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we dont do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something weve done thats offensive." ...|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{the mixed}} and {{negative}} reviews, a positive review came from Amazons Rebecca Wallwork, who praised Dion for [...] "an unrelenting theme {{of joy and}} believing in ones self" [...] and highlighted the album for [...] "being both well timed and well executed." [...] But she revealed that [...] "it contains no surprises, but then, besides her voice, <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Dions biggest assets." [...] In a more positive review, Entertainment Weeklys Elisabeth Vincentelli questioned [...] "why Celine get so little respect?" [...] and later went to praise the album for [...] "Dions uncanny ability to infuse sincerity into aural Hallmark cards and sound like the only person on earth who believes in true love." [...] In the end, she wrote: [...] "And in our age of postmodern ironists, isnt it refreshing to encounter someone who so genuinely loves her job?" [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani praised [...] "the album as a whole", saying that [...] "she continues the restrained approach of her last record, both in production and performance." [...] He finished the review, noting that [...] "One Heart may be the smartest album Dion could make {{at this stage in}} her career." [...] Billboard praised the album by concluding: [...] "One Heart may not crackle with the noise of an [...] "event" [...] record, but it succeeds at something far more important: It is a fine piece of music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes you confess. You always hide {{what youre}} confessing to. <b>Thats</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the reasons why}} you make up the story. When I wrote The Shining, for instance, the protagonist of The Shining {{is a man who}} has broken his sons arm, who has a history of child beating, who is beaten himself. And as a young father with two children, I was horrified by my {{occasional}} feelings of real antagonism toward my children. Wont you ever stop? Wont you ever go to bed? And time has given me the idea that probably there are a lot of young fathers and young mothers both who feel very angry, who have angry feelings toward their children. But as somebody who has been raised with the idea that father knows best and Ward Cleaver on Leave It To Beaver, and all this stuff, I would think to myself, Oh, if he doesnt shut up, if he doesnt shut up... So when I wrote this book I wrote a lot of that down and tried to get it out of my system, but it was also a confession. Yes, there are times when I felt very angry toward my children and have even felt as though I could hurt them. Well, my kids are older now. Naomi is fifteen and Joey is thirteen and Owen is eight, and theyre all super kids, and I dont think Ive laid a hand on one of my kids in probably seven years, but there was a time...|$|E
