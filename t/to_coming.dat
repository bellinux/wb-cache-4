Becoming a KC was a risk; he would go from competing with other junior barristers <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> up against the finest minds in the profession. Despite this he decided to take the risk, and he was accepted later that year.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Harvey was {{the final}} {{tropical}} cyclone in a record-breaking string of eight consecutive storms that failed to attain hurricane intensity. The eighth tropical cyclone and eighth named storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Harvey developed from a tropical wave in the western Caribbean Sea on August19. It moved over warm waters {{in the vicinity of}} Central America. Later on August19, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey while just offshore Honduras. Additional organization occurred and Harvey attained its peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) prior <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> ashore Belize on August20. Harvey weakened to a tropical depression on August21, but re-intensified to a tropical storm after emerging into the Bay of Campeche. Early on August22, it made landfall in Veracruz, then weakened and dissipated several hours later.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{lived through}} a tumultuous period of Mohave history {{where the people}} {{went from being a}} {{politically}} independent nation <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> under the political control of the United States, and the events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented. Most historical sources for the life of Irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted, or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to the East Coast and California, and on the conflicts in Arizona territory. Some Mohave versions of the events also exist: in the early 20th century anthropologist A. L. Kroeber interviewed Jo Nelson (Mohave: Chooksa homar), a Mohave man who participated in many of the events and knew Irataba personally; another version was told to ethnographer George Devereux by Irataba's granddaughter Tcatc, and versions recounted by members of the Fort Mohave band of Mohave, the descendants of Homoseh quahote, were recorded by ethnographer Lorraine Sherer during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Maldives {{received}} universality slots from IAAF to send two athletes (one {{male and}} one female) to the Olympics. The sprinters Afa Ismail and Hassan Saaid {{participated in the}} Games, with the former in the women's 200 metres and the latter in the men's 100 metres. This marked Saaid's debut in the Olympics, {{even though he has}} represented his country at the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games, as well as the 2010 and 2014 Asian Games. The Games were Ismail's second time in the Olympics because of her participation in the 2012 London Olympics. Ismail finished 8th in her heat with a time of 24.96 seconds, attaining a national record but failing to qualify for the semifinals. Saaid achieved a time of 10.43 seconds in his heat, ranking first place and advancing to the quarterfinals. However, Saaid failed to qualify for the semifinals due <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> eighth with a time of 10.47 seconds in the quarterfinals. He could not beat his national record of 10.33 seconds.|$|E

Using an anonymous questionnaire distributed to gay community organizations, the authors collected data on 21 questions related to three aspects of information seeking: personal information, information needs related <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> out and ongoing information needs. The survey had 47 respondents who had a generally high level of education.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{shoelaces}} {{were made}} of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other materials used {{in the manufacture of}} rope. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant nomex are applied in safety boots for firefighters.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} the most often cited {{resource}} of information related <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> out and for ongoing needs, followed by gay organizations and friends. When asked what types of materials respondents borrowed from the library, they most frequently cited music, followed by nonfiction and fiction. However, respondents had an overall negative impression {{about the amount of}} information related to gay males contained in the library, and suggested the need for expanding the gay collection, networking with gay and lesbian organizations and subscribing to gay magazines.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} having Tajikistan {{in this article}} is {{primarily}} because the government of the country itself, is - or is seen to be - the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In actual fact, the government - with the apparent approval of the people - is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.|$|E

25|$|During the {{religious}} peace which followed {{the persecution of}} Marcus Aurelius, the new bishop divided his activities between the duties of a pastor and of a missionary (as to which we have but brief data, late and not very certain). Almost all his writings were directed against Gnosticism. The most famous of these writings is Adversus haereses (Against Heresies). Irenaeus alludes <b>to</b> <b>coming</b> across Gnostic writings, and holding conversations with Gnostics, and this may {{have taken place in}} Asia Minor or in Rome. However, it also appears that Gnosticism was present near Lyon: he writes that there were followers of 'Marcus the Magician' living and teaching in the Rhone valley.|$|E
