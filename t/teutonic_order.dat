5|$|The {{rapid release}} of Przemysł II {{could have been}} aided by the {{intervention}} of Leszek II the Black and Mestwin II of Pomerelia. The reason {{for the arrival of}} Mestwin II to Greater Poland, in addition to helping his imprisoned ally, was to settle the claims of the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> over parts of Pomerelia and to resolve the issue of succession after his own death; from his first marriage, Mestwin II had only two daughters, Catherine and Euphemia. The situation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} Mestwin II gained the rule over all the Duchy of Pomerelia after a war against his uncles, Racibor and Sambor II, who in revenge for this willed his possessions (including Białogard and Gniew) to the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> upon his death in 1278.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald is a {{painting}} by Jan Matejko depicting the Battle of Grunwald and {{the victory of the}} allied Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania over the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> in 1410. The canvas dates to 1878 {{and is one of the}} most heroic representations of the history of Poland. It is displayed in the National Museum in Warsaw.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}}'s {{main focus}} {{is the death}} scene of the Grand Master of the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order,</b> Ulrich von Jungingen; another central figure is the Lithuanian duke Vytautas (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. The painting has been both hailed and criticized for its complexity. It is one of Matejko's most recognizable works, and has likely contributed to the popular image {{of the battle of}} Grunwald, and its enduring fame in Polish consciousness.|$|E
5|$|About {{the same}} time Nobel Prize-winner Henryk Sienkiewicz wrote the novel The Knights of the Cross (Polish: Krzyżacy), {{prominently}} featuring the battle {{in one of the}} chapters. In 1960 Polish filmmaker Aleksander Ford used the book as the basis for his film, Knights of the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order.</b> A museum, monuments and memorials were constructed at the battlefield in 1960. The battle site is one of Poland's official, national Historic Monuments, as designated October 4, 2010, and tracked by the National Heritage Board of Poland. The battle has lent its name to military decorations (Cross of Grunwald), sports teams (BC Žalgiris, FK Žalgiris), and various organizations.|$|E
5|$|Cracks in the {{cooperation}} between Poland and Lithuania {{after the death}} of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as grand duke of Lithuania, but when Švitrigaila, {{with the support of the}} <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in Lithuania, the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to Lithuania in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in Lithuania elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as grand duke, leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław's death.|$|E
50|$|In 1336, the {{defenders}} of Pilėnai in Lithuania set their castle on fire and committed mass suicide {{in order to make}} the attacking <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> victory a costly one.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> army lost around 1000 soldiers, {{including}} some 300 cavalrymen. Fifty soldiers were captured. The Teutonic commander was also killed in battle and {{was buried in}} the Żarnowiec chapter church.|$|R
50|$|In Lower Prussia {{there was}} a peasant {{rebellion}} against Polish rule. The peasants captured a few castles and gave them to the Teutonic Knights, declaring that {{they were ready to}} fight on the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> side against Poland.|$|R
5|$|Henry was {{particularly}} {{supportive of the}} mendicant orders; his confessors were drawn from the Dominican Friars, and he built mendicant houses in Canterbury, Norwich, Oxford, Reading and York, helping to find valuable space for new buildings in what were already crowded towns and cities. He supported the military crusading orders, and became a patron of the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> in 1235. The emerging universities of Oxford and Cambridge also received royal attention: Henry reinforced and regulated their powers, and encouraged scholars to migrate from Paris to teach at them. A rival institution at Northampton was declared by the King to be a mere school and not a true university.|$|E
5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War of 1409–1411, {{precipitated by}} the Samogitian uprisings in Lithuanian territories {{controlled}} by the State of the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order,</b> culminated in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg), in which the combined forces of the Polish and Lithuanian-Rus' armies completely defeated the Teutonic Knights. The offensive that followed lost its impact with the ineffective siege of Malbork (Marienburg). The failure to take the fortress and eliminate the Teutonic (later Prussian) state had dire historic consequences for Poland in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The Peace of Thorn of 1411 gave Poland and Lithuania rather modest territorial adjustments, including Samogitia. Afterwards, there were more military campaigns and peace deals that did not hold. One unresolved arbitration {{took place at the}} Council of Constance. In 1415, Paulus Vladimiri, rector of the Kraków Academy, presented his Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor in respect to Infidels at the Council, in which he advocated tolerance, criticized the violent conversion methods of the Teutonic Knights, and postulated that pagans have the right to peaceful coexistence with Christians and political independence. This stage of the Polish-Lithuanian conflict with the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> ended with the Treaty of Melno in 1422. The Polish-Teutonic War of 1431-35 (see Battle of Pabaiskas) was concluded with the Peace of Brześć Kujawski in 1435.|$|E
5|$|Władysław II Jagiello and Queen Jadwiga reigned as co-monarchs; {{and though}} Jadwiga {{probably}} had little real power, she took {{an active part}} in Poland's political and cultural life. In 1387, she led two successful military expeditions to Red Ruthenia, recovered lands her father Louis I of Hungary had transferred from Poland to Hungary, and secured the homage of Petru I, Voivode of Moldavia. In 1390, she also personally opened negotiations with the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order.</b> Most political responsibilities, however, fell to Jagiello, with Jadwiga attending to the cultural and charitable activities for which she is still revered.|$|E
50|$|In 1440, Danzig {{joined the}} nearby Hanseatic cities of Elbing and Thorn (Toruń) {{to form the}} Prussian Confederation, which in February 1454 seceded from the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> rule and {{recognized}} the suzerainty of King Casimir IV of Poland.|$|R
50|$|With the {{secularization}} of the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> Prussian territories in 1525, {{the town}} {{became part of}} the Duchy of Prussia. The town converted to Protestantism in the same year during the Protestant Reformation; it then did not have a Catholic church until the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty, Truce or Second Peace of Novgorod was {{concluded}} in March 1557. It ended the Russo-Swedish War (1554-1557), {{a series of}} skirmishes in the Viborg and Oreshek areas resulting from Swedish attempts to keep Livonia, where the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> rule had collapsed, out of the Russian sphere of influence.|$|R
5|$|Because none of Gediminas' {{siblings}} {{had strong}} heirs, Gediminas {{and his children}} were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.|$|E
5|$|The Order's landmeister and gebietiger, {{as well as}} {{the owners}} of Livonian estates, were all lesser nobles who guarded their {{privileges}} and influence by preventing the creation of a higher, more powerful noble class. Only the archbishopric of Riga successfully overcame resistance of the lesser nobles. Wilhelm von Brandenburg was appointed as archbishop of Riga and Christoph von Mecklenburg as his coadjutor, {{with the help of his}} brother Albert (Albrecht) of Brandenburg–Ansbach, the former Prussian hochmeister who had secularised the southern <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> state and in 1525 established himself as duke in Prussia. Wilhelm and Christoph were to pursue Albert's interests in Livonia, among which was the establishment of a hereditary Livonian duchy styled after the Prussian model. At the same time the Order agitated for its re-establishment ("Rekuperation") in Prussia, opposed secularization and creation of a hereditary duchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{protracted}} {{period of}} {{war between the}} Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the Treaty of Salynas, named after the islet in the Neman River where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> in a campaign to seize Pskov, while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize Novgorod. Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan Tokhtamysh of the White Horde, were crushed by the Timurids at the Battle of the Vorskla River, ending his imperial ambitions {{in the east and}} obliging him to submit to Władysław's protection once more.|$|E
50|$|Kneiphof {{became part}} of the Duchy of Prussia when the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> Prussian branch was secularized in 1525. The University of Königsberg, the Albertina, was founded just east of the cathedral in 1544. A new campus, the Neue Universität at the Paradeplatz north of Altstadt, was {{dedicated}} in 1861 as its replacement.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> {{strength}} {{is in its}} powerful heavy units. While lacking in speed, and thus vulnerable to horse archers on the open field, the Order's units more than {{make up for it}} in very powerful defensive strength. They are particularly effective in assaulting settlements, where the close quarters nullify their opponents' advantage of mobility.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the Golden Bull of Rimini in 1226 and the Papal Bull of Rieti of 1234, Prussia came into the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> possession. The Knights began the Prussian Crusade in 1230. Under their governance, {{woodlands}} were cleared and marshlands made arable, upon which many cities and villages were founded, including Marienburg (Malbork) and Königsberg (Kaliningrad).|$|R
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the insurrection in the Austrian Netherlands, he {{received}} permission from Field Marshal Laudon, shortly before the latter's death, to take a one year novitiate in the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order,</b> at Bonn where he remained until April 1792. The outbreak of the War of the First Coalition against France required his military talents and Mervelt rejoined the Habsburg army at as adjutant to Josias, Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. He led two infantry battalions in the Austrian victory at Neerwinden (18March 1793), during which his battalions repulsed a strong French column. For his role at the head of his battalions of grenadiers, which his commander considered greater than duty required, in this victory, Merveldt received the honor of carrying the message to the Emperor Francis in Vienna. There, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 7July 1794. Subsequently, he was appointed as an attaché to the staff of Frederick, Duke of York.|$|E
5|$|In 1422, Władysław fought another war, {{known as}} the Gollub War, against the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order,</b> {{defeating}} them in under {{two months before the}} Order's imperial reinforcements had time to arrive. The resulting Treaty of Melno ended the Knights' claims to Samogitia once and for all and defined a permanent border between Prussia and Lithuania. Lithuania was given the province of Samogitia, with the port of Palanga, but the city of Klaipėda was left to the Order. This border remained largely unchanged for roughly 500 years, until 1920. The terms of this treaty have, however, been seen as turning a Polish victory into defeat, as a result of Władysław's renunciation of Polish claims to Pomerania, Pomerelia, and Chełmno Land, for which he received only the town of Nieszawa in return. The Treaty of Melno closed a chapter in the Knights' wars with Lithuania but did little to settle their long-term issues with Poland. Further sporadic warfare broke out between Poland and the Knights between 1431 and 1435.|$|E
5|$|Jagiello's baptism {{failed to}} end the crusade of the Teutonic Knights, who claimed his {{conversion}} was a sham, perhaps even a heresy, and renewed their incursions on the pretext that pagans remained in Lithuania. From then on, however, the Order found it harder to sustain {{the cause of a}} crusade and faced the growing threat to its existence posed by the Kingdom of Poland and a genuinely Christian Lithuania alliance. Władysław sponsored the creation of the diocese of Vilnius under bishop Andrzej Wasilko, the former confessor of Elisabeth of Hungary. The bishopric, which included Samogitia, then largely controlled by the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order,</b> was subordinated to the see of Gniezno and not to that of Teutonic Königsberg. The decision may not have improved Władysław's relations with the Order, but it served to introduce closer ties between Lithuania and Poland, enabling the Polish church to freely assist its Lithuanian counterpart.|$|E
5|$|When the war resumed in June 1410, Władysław {{advanced}} {{into the}} Teutonic heartland {{at the head}} of an army of about 20,000 mounted nobles, 15,000 armed commoners, and 2,000 professional cavalry mainly hired from Bohemia. After crossing the Vistula over the pontoon bridge at Czerwińsk, his troops met up with those of Vytautas, whose 11,000 light cavalry included Lithuanians, Ruthenians, and Tatars. The <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> army numbered about 18,000 cavalry, mostly Germans and 5,000 infantry. On 15 July, at the Battle of Grunwald after {{one of the largest and}} most ferocious battles of the Middle Ages, the allies won a victory so overwhelming that the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> army was virtually annihilated, with most of its key commanders killed in combat, including Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen and Grand Marshal Friedrich von Wallenrode. Thousands of troops were reported to have been slaughtered on either side.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> {{attempts}} to conquer Orthodox Russia (particularly the Republics of Pskov and Novgorod), an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, accompanied the Northern Crusades. One {{of the major}} blows {{for the idea of}} the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. With or without the Pope's blessing, Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Karuse or Battle on the Ice {{was fought}} on 16 February 1270 between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Livonian Order {{on the frozen}} Baltic Sea between the Muhu Island and the mainland. The Lithuanians {{achieved}} a decisive victory. The battle, named after the Karuse village, was the fifth-largest defeat of the Livonian or <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Orders</b> in the 13th century.|$|R
5|$|The Union of Vilnius and Radom of 1401 {{confirmed}} {{the status of}} Vytautas as grand duke under Władysław's overlordship, while assuring the title of grand duke to the heirs of Władysław rather than those of Vytautas: should Władysław die without heirs, the Lithuanian boyars were to elect a new monarch. Since no heir had yet been produced by either monarch, {{the implications of the}} union were unforeseeable, but it forged bonds between the Polish and Lithuanian nobility and a permanent defensive alliance between the two states, strengthening Lithuania's hand for a new war against the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> in which Poland officially took no part. While the document left the liberties of the Polish nobles untouched, it granted increased power to the boyars of Lithuania, whose grand dukes had till then been unencumbered by checks and balances of the sort attached to the Polish monarchy. The Union of Vilnius and Radom therefore earned Władysław a measure of support in Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|The first {{king of the}} new dynasty was Jogaila, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, who {{was known}} as Władysław II Jagiełło in Poland. He was elected king of Poland in 1386 after his {{marriage}} to Jadwiga of Anjou, the Queen of Poland in her own right, and his conversion to Roman Catholicism. The Christianization of Lithuania in the Latin Rite followed. Jogaila's rivalry in Lithuania with his cousin Vytautas the Great, who was opposed to Lithuania's domination by Poland, was settled in 1392 in the Ostrów Agreement and in 1401 in the Union of Vilnius and Radom: Vytautas became the Grand Duke of Lithuania for life under Jogaila's nominal supremacy. The agreement made possible a close cooperation {{between the two nations}} necessary to succeed in struggles with the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order.</b> The Union of Horodło of 1413 defined the relationship further and granted privileges to the Roman Catholic (as opposed to Eastern Orthodox) segment of the Lithuanian nobility.|$|E
5|$|The first {{talks between}} Przemysł II and Mestwin II about the latter's {{succession}} probably occurred around 1281, on {{occasion of the}} arrival of the Duke of Pomerelia in Greater Poland to visit the Benedictine Abbey in Lubin. Although there is no direct evidence that Przemysł II was also in the Abbey in person, the presence of Jan I of Wysokowce, Bishop of Poznań and other Greater Poland dignitaries suggest that a compromise was then suggested. At the beginning of the next year Mestwin II again went to southern Greater Poland, in order to talk with the Papal legate Filippo di Fermo about his dispute with the <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order</b> over the possession of the towns of Gniew and Białogard. The legate stayed in Milicz, which belonged to the Diocese of Wrocław. Due to the friendly relations of Przemysł II (and thus his ally Mestwin II) with Henry IV Probus, the Duke of Pomerania decided to stop at the frontier village of Kępno (also in the Diocese of Wrocław), and waited to hear the legate's verdict.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> {{attempts}} to conquer Orthodox Russia (particularly the Republics of Pskov and Novgorod), an enterprise endorsed by Pope Gregory IX, {{can be considered}} {{as a part of the}} Northern Crusades. One of the major blows for the idea of the conquest of Russia was the Battle of the Ice in 1242. With or without the Pope's blessing, Sweden also undertook several crusades against Orthodox Novgorod.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1454, the Prussian Confederation rose {{against the}} <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> rule. Gabriel von Baysen and Johannes von Baysen, now leading the {{confederation}} {{with the support}} of Jan de Jani and Mikołaj Szarlejski, both of the Clan of Ostoja, requested the protection of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland. They also asked for, and received, a guarantee of their continued city rights and privileges for the nobility.|$|R
50|$|The Teutonic Knights' further advance into Prussia was {{slowed by}} the {{outbreak}} of the First Prussian Uprising in 1242. Alarmed by the crusaders' rapid expansion into territory bordering his lands, the Christian Duke Swantopelk of Pomerellia allied with the conquered Prussians and supported an armed rebellion against the crusaders. The <b>Teutonic</b> <b>Order's</b> capacity to resist was weakened, as there were fewer German crusaders arriving and the Polish princes were feuding amongst themselves.|$|R
