5|$|Many {{scholars}} have gleaned from this passage that <b>the</b> <b>Wicked</b> Priest and the Teacher of Righteousness followed different liturgical calendars, thus enabling <b>the</b> <b>Wicked</b> Priest {{to travel on}} Yom Kippur; some have even suggested that the Teacher of Righteousness was a schismatic High Priest during the pre-Jonathan intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there is no one High Priest who is the strongest candidate for identification with each of <b>the</b> <b>Wicked</b> Priest passages. The different demises of <b>the</b> <b>Wicked</b> Priest and the tenses associated with them are often cited as evidence of the impossibility of a single Wicked Priest.|$|E

5|$|Other scholars, however, {{argue that}} {{hereditary}} illegitimacy is not listed among the indiscretions of <b>the</b> <b>Wicked</b> Priest, {{and that this}} interpretation has been foisted upon the text by decades of questionable interpretation.

5|$|Since {{the time}} of de Vaux, the default {{assumption}} has been that <b>the</b> <b>Wicked</b> Priest is a single individual, if {{only because of the}} appealing parallelism to the Teacher of Righteousness. The consensus time period for the founding of Qumran (150-140 BCE) includes five High Priests: three Hellenized and two Maccabean: Jason, Menelaus, Alcimus, Jonathan, and Simon, and also the various figures potentially associated with the intersacerdotium.|$|E

5|$|The group {{assumes that}} {{completing}} this task {{will result in}} the granting of their wishes. <b>The</b> <b>Wicked</b> Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet Foo-Foo and her henchman Johnny Fiama. When <b>the</b> <b>Wicked</b> Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 crows of despair, a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals that work for her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.|$|E
