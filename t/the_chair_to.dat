5|$|With {{some help}} from Peter Donahue and O.M. Wozencraft, on May 26, 1857, after an {{introduction}} from the Commissioner of Indian Affairs James W. Denver, Kinman presented <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> Buchanan. The President was so pleased by the present that he bought Kinman a rifle and two pistols in return.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match pitted The Undertaker against A-Train in {{a standard}} match. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively before The Undertaker gained the advantage. He attempted to lift A-Train for a Tombstone piledriver. A-Train countered it, in the process knocking the referee down. He attempted {{to take advantage of}} the situation by trying to hit The Undertaker with a steel chair. The Undertaker, however, countered the attack with his boot, causing <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> hit A-Train in the face. The Undertaker then chokeslammed A-Train and, since the referee had recuperated, covered his opponent for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between Batista and JBL (managed by Orlando Jordan) for the World Heavyweight Championship. Jordan {{interfered}} {{by attempting to}} hit Batista with a folding chair, but Batista grabbed the chair from him. Batista then used <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> hit Jordan and JBL, and JBL was declared the winner, via disqualification. In WWE, a title cannot be won by disqualification, but only by pinfall or submission (the normal scoring conditions in professional wrestling matches). As a result, Batista retained the title. After the match Batista gave JBL and Jordan a Batista Bomb.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, it was owing {{in great}} measure to the Renaissance that <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> ceased <b>to</b> be a {{privilege}} {{of state and}} became a standard item of furniture for anyone who could afford to buy it.

Almost at once <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> began <b>to</b> change every few years to reflect the fashions of the day.|$|R
5|$|Clark {{chaired the}} government's Industrial Development Advisory Board from 1973 to 1980. In this {{position}} {{he found himself}} frustrated by Secretary of State for Industry Tony Benn's decision to ignore the board's advice and found workers' co-operative schemes at struggling firms Triumph Engineering and Fisher-Bendix in the early 1970s. Clark decided not to resign but to stay on and try to restrain Benn in the future. Benn bore him no ill-will for this and in 1974 asked him to join the government committee into the future of ailing car-makers Austin and British Leyland. He agreed to take the chair of Leyland in 1976 as a stop-gap measure but ended up holding the post {{for more than a}} year before the company, beset with strikes, nationalised and he handed <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> Michael Edwardes. Clark remained a board member and in 1986 undertook discussions with General Motors in an attempt to get an increased bid for Leyland Vehicles, a bid later stopped by public outcry over the inclusion of the Land Rover name.|$|E
5|$|In the show's fifth match, Randy Orton {{defended his}} World Heavyweight Championship against Christian, with the {{condition}} that Christian would win the title if Orton were disqualified or if there were poor officiating. Christian opened the bout by bringing a steel chair into the ring and trying to goad Orton into getting disqualified. Orton balked and threw <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> the floor. Christian performed his signature Killswitch, but Orton {{kicked out of the}} pin at the two count. As Orton was prepared to perform his signature RKO move, Christian spat in his face. An enraged Orton kicked Christian in the groin and was disqualified, so Christian became the new champion. Afterwards, Orton twice slammed Christian's face into the announcers' table with his RKO maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Steel cage {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Triple H and Randy Orton. During the {{beginning}} of the match, Triple H gained the advantage over Orton, as he performed a High Knee on Orton. Orton came back with a kick to the gut before starting his prolonged attack and attempting to escape through the cage door but Triple H prevented him from escaping. Triple H took control as he took out Orton's knee with a chop block and applied a figure four leglock. After Orton broke the hold, he crawled across to the cage door to escape, but Triple H grabbed him back inside. But, on the way back in, Orton managed to grab a steel chair that was on the ring floor. Orton tried to hit Triple H with the chair, but Triple H managed to avoid being hit. Triple H grabbed <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> hit Orton with it, but Orton hit him in the groin. Orton followed this with a chair shot to Triple H's back and performed a DDT. Throughout the match, Orton tried escaping from the cage, but was not in successful in doing so, as Triple H dragged him back in each time. The match came to an end when Orton tried to execute a running punt on Triple H's head, however, Triple H grabbed the chair and hit Orton with it. Triple H followed up by executing a pedigree. Triple H covered Orton for the pinfall victory, and thus retaining his title.|$|E

25|$|For {{adjustable}} chairs, such as {{an office}} chair, the aforementioned principles are applied in adjusting <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> the individual occupant.

25|$|The Hollys (Hardcore and Crash) {{versus the}} New Age Outlaws (Billy Gunn and The Road Dogg) was next. In {{the midst of}} the match, Hardcore Holly threw a steel chair into the ring. Billy Gunn, however, used <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> his {{advantage}} by performing an offense maneuver on Crash Holly that caused his head to slam into the chair which was lying in the ring. Therefore, the Hollys won the match by disqualification.|$|E
500|$|Because new {{planets are}} {{discovered}} infrequently, the IAU {{did not have}} any machinery for their definition and naming.

500|$|... "Black Widower" [...] was {{the second}} episode to show Patty and Selma's {{obsession}} with the character Angus MacGyver from the television show MacGyver, {{which has become a}} recurring joke on The Simpsons. When Sideshow Bob goes into the room to see Selma's corpse, he turns around the chair, only to see Bart sitting in it. Sideshow Bob turns around and sees Selma in the doorway. These shots, from Bob turning <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> Selma in the doorway, are a reference to the ending of the film Psycho. The music in the scene, written by composer Alf Clausen, is also a reference to Psycho. In Bart's retelling of the story {{at the end of the}} episode, Homer's shouts [...] "To the Simpsonmobile!" [...] as the family rushes to the hotel to save Selma's life. This is a reference to Batman's Batmobile and his recurring catchphrase, [...] "To the Batmobile!".|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{receiving}} <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> the Subcommittee on Investigations, McCarthy appointed Joseph Brown Matthews (generally known as J. B. Matthews) as staff {{director of the}} subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the House Un-American Activities Committee. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled [...] "Reds and Our Churches," [...] which opened with the sentence, [...] "The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen." [...] A group of senators denounced this [...] "shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy" [...] and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy initially refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, {{and the majority of}} his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews's ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.|$|E

500|$|During the 1960s, the {{ceremony}} of assenting by commission was discontinued {{and is now}} only employed once a year, {{at the end of}} the annual parliamentary session. In 1960, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod arrived to summon the House of Commons during a heated debate and several members protested against the disruption by refusing to attend {{the ceremony}}. The debacle was repeated in 1965; this time, when the Speaker left <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> go to the House of Lords, some members continued to make speeches. As a result, the Royal Assent Act 1967 was passed, creating an additional form for the granting of royal assent. As the attorney-general explained, [...] "there has been a good deal of resentment not only at the loss of Parliamentary time that has been involved but at the breaking of the thread of a possibly eloquent speech and the disruption of a debate that may be caused." [...] The granting of assent by the monarch in person, or by commission, is still possible, but this third form is used on a day-to-day basis.|$|E
500|$|John Wallis (professor 1649–1703) {{rented a}} house from New College on New College Lane from 1672 {{until his death}} in 1703; at some point, it was divided into two houses. [...] Towards the end of his life, David Gregory (the Savilian Professor of Astronomy) lived {{in the eastern part of}} the premises: {{although}} no lease between Wallis and Gregory survives (if one was ever made between the two friends), Gregory's name appears for the first time in the parish rate-book of 1701. [...] Wallis's son gave the unexpired portion of the lease to the university in 1704 in honour of his father's long tenure of <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>to</b> provide official residences for the two Savilian professors. New College renewed the lease at a low rent from 1716 and thereafter at intervals until the last renewal in 1814. Records of who lived in each house are not available throughout the period, but surviving documentation shows that the professors often sub-let the houses and for about twenty years in the early 18th century the premises were being used as a lodging house. Stephen Rigaud lived there from 1810 until he became the astronomy professor in 1827; thereafter, Baden Powell lived there with his family. [...] The geometry professors were associated with the houses for longer than the astronomy professors: when the Radcliffe Observatory was built in the 1770s, the post of Radcliffe Observer was coupled to the astronomy professorship, and they were provided with a house in that role; thereafter, the university sublet the astronomy professor's house itself. [...] In the early 19th century, New College decided that it wished to use the properties for itself and the lease expired in 1854.|$|E
500|$|Known {{throughout}} Europe, Blanchard drew {{large crowds}} for her ascents. In Frankfurt she was apparently {{the cause of}} the poor reception of Carl Maria von Weber's opera Silvana on its opening night, 16 September 1810: the people of the city flocked to see her demonstration while only a few attended the opera's debut. She gave many displays in Italy. In 1811 she travelled from Rome to Naples, splitting the journey in half with a stop after 60miles (97km), and later ascended again from Rome to a height of 12,000feet (3,660m) where she claimed that she fell into a profound sleep for a while before landing at Tagliacozzo. In the same year she again lost consciousness after having to ascend to avoid being trapped in a hailstorm near Vincennes. She spent 14½ hours in the air as a result. Sophie crossed the Alps by balloon, and on a trip to Turin on 26 April 1812 the temperature dropped so low that she suffered a nose bleed and icicles formed on her hands and face. She almost died on 21 September 1817 when, on a flight from Nantes (her 53rd), she mistook a marshy field for a safe landing spot. The canopy of her balloon became caught in a tree which caused <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>to</b> tip over; Blanchard, entangled in the rigging, was forced into the water of the marsh and would have drowned had not help arrived soon after her landing. Sympathising with Marie Thérèse de Lamourous who was attempting to run a shelter for [...] "fallen women" [...] (La Miséricorde) in Bordeaux, she offered to donate the proceeds from one of her ascents to the venture. De Lamourous refused the offer on the grounds that she could not be the cause of another risking their life.|$|E
