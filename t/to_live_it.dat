He became president of LICA after the death of its founder Bernard Lecache and directed its journal, The Right <b>to</b> <b>Live.</b> <b>It</b> was at his urging that mention of the fight against racism was added to the name of LICA, which became LICRA in 1979.

He found another house that belonged to a rich merchant and was well treated by the owner. He shared his exile with his brother Nicholas and with his cousin Dmitry Konstantinovich. They could move freely around town and visited each other frequently. On the morning of 14 July, two days before the murder of Nicholas II and his family, a car with four heavily armed men arrived and collected the Grand Dukes from their lodgings; they were arrested and interned in a small, walled village prison, where they could be more easily guarded. Rumors of the assassination of the tsar reached them while they were there. During these months George Mikhailovich frequently managed to smuggle letters to his wife, the last one dated 27 November 1918. His wife unsuccessfully tried to buy out his freedom and that of the other three Grand Dukes for fifty thousand pounds through the Danish minister in St Petersburg.|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>it</b> and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

500|$|According to Bruce, [...] "In Yo Face" [...] was {{originally}} titled [...] "Pie in Yo Face", {{but it was}} decided that the final title sounded better. [...] "The Bone" [...] features surf rock-influenced guitars. According to Bruce, [...] "Mike's beat for this was so fuckin' crazy sounding I {{had no idea what the}} fuck to do with it." [...] "To Catch a Predator" [...] was written during the mixing process, when the group realized that the album needed a song [...] "that attacks an evil". Inspired by the television series To Catch a Predator, the song's lyrics describe Violent J luring pedophiles into his house to violently murder them. According to Bruce, [...] "I could easily see myself killing pedophiles in real life and having no guilt. The only reason I don’t do it is because I'd probably get caught. So its nice <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>it</b> out through my music." [...] "Boing Boing", a comedic sex-oriented rap, samples audio from a pornographic film which had previously been sampled by the group on their Tunnel of Love EP. Bruce says that the song was intended as a joke. Some fans interpreted the song as Bruce and Utsler calling themselves ugly, while others believed that they were bragging about how many women they have sex with. Bruce commented [...] "We're not sex symbols, especially not me. If there are girls, they’re there to see Shaggy." ...|$|E
500|$|The fifth track, [...] "The Other Side", has churning, chunky guitars, a double-bass {{drum and}} Lee's [...] "ethereal, widescreen" [...] vocals with {{elements}} of R. Lyrically, the song's theme is death. [...] "Erase This", formerly titled [...] "Vanilla", was noted by Mary Ouellette of Loudwire as an [...] "uptempo rocker" [...] similar to [...] "What You Want" [...] which would sound better played live {{rather than through}} earphones. [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano, strings and Lee's unlayered vocals before adding the band for the song's climax; its lyrics reflect Lee's past struggles, apologizing to her fans for the band's five-year absence. The song's musical structure was compared to [...] "Jóga", by the Icelandic recording artist Björk. [...] "Sick" [...] has a loose, lazy melody and a chanted chorus; {{one of the first}} songs written for the album, it [...] "set a heavy direction {{for the rest of the}} record." [...] "End of the Dream" [...] begins [...] "full bore with chunky guitar, then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee's unmistakable vocals." [...] In the chorus, Lee sings [...] "Follow your heart 'til it bleeds," [...] evincing the track's [...] "seize the day" [...] message. Lee said about the song, [...] "It's about understanding that this life isn't forever, and how you have <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>it,</b> embrace even the pain, before it's all over. As much as it hurts, it just means you're alive. So don't be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living." [...] "Oceans" [...] begins with a big, low synth and a vocal before the band joins in. According to Lee, [...] "It's big and lush. We've been having a lot of fun playing that one especially." [...] "Never Go Back" [...] (originally called [...] "Orange") examines [...] "loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy". Lee said that the song, with the lyrics [...] "It's all gone, the only world I've ever known", was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] "Swimming Home" [...] is an electro-pop song with grinding guitars and a [...] "weeping" [...] piano.|$|E

Left {{destitute}} by automation (which threw his father, a hand weaver, out of work), the family emigrated to the United States in 1848 and settled in [...] "Slabtown"—an immigrant neighborhood in Allegheny City, at the time a distinct and fast-growing city {{on the north side of}} the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers across from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The family rented rooms from a relative who owned a house at 336 Rebecca Street. (The street is gone, replaced by Three Rivers Stadium football stadium.) Allegheny City was an unpleasant place <b>to</b> <b>live.</b> <b>It</b> had no municipal water system until 1848, no natural gas lines until 1853, and no sewer system, and wild hogs roamed the streets attacking children.
