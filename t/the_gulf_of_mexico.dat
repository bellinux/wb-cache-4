5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30.

It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so.

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken {{as it moved}} northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was closely connected with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few days of September 2002, an upper-level trough emerged in <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> and stalled. Thunderstorms {{developed}} along the trough and concentrated around a weak low pressure system. Gradually, the trough and associated low pressure drifted south into the warm waters of <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> A low pressure area in the northwest Gulf of Mexico became the dominant circulation and slowly developed persistent convection near the center. On September 5, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system. During the flight, a low-level center became evident and some deep convection persisted; as a result, it was classified as a tropical depression. Wind shear within <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico</b> was weak and remained favorable to tropical cyclone formation. A reconnaissance flight later that day discovered an ill-defined circulation which led to low confidence of the location of the center of circulation. However, enough convection persisted for the depression to be upgraded into Tropical Storm Fay that evening.|$|E

5|$|A broad mid-tropospheric trough {{over the}} southeastern United States spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} over the lower Mississippi River Valley on July 13, and drifted southward towards the warm waters of <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico.</b> As it moved into <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mexico,</b> a weak and isolated surface low pressure area formed {{off the coast of}} Louisiana.
