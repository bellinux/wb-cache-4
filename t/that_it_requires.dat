5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} {{is dependent on}} the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy of the transition state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E
5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mechanism}} involves {{effects on}} the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme chain {{that is responsible for}} effective tissue utilization of oxygen. Carbon monoxide binds to cytochrome oxidase with less affinity than oxygen, so it is possible <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> significant intracellular hypoxia before binding. This binding interferes with aerobic metabolism and efficient adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Cells respond by switching to anaerobic metabolism, causing anoxia, lactic acidosis, and eventual cell death. The rate of dissociation between carbon monoxide and cytochrome oxidase is slow, causing a relatively prolonged impairment of oxidative metabolism.|$|E

5|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the world described by string theory and the everyday world. In everyday life, there are three familiar dimensions of space (up/down, left/right, and forward/backward), and there is one dimension of time (later/earlier). Thus, {{in the language of}} modern physics, one says that spacetime is four-dimensional. One of the peculiar features of string theory is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> extra dimensions of spacetime for its mathematical consistency. In superstring theory, the version of the theory that incorporates a theoretical idea called supersymmetry, there are six extra dimensions of spacetime in addition to the four that are familiar from everyday experience.|$|E

The greater degree of clinical judgment required has also made the K-SADS less suitable for large epidemiological projects, which usually need to use interviewers with little prior clinical experience.|$|E

For example, in the O. J. Simpson murder trial, the jury was not convinced beyond reasonable doubt that O. J. Simpson had committed the crime of murder; but in a later civil trial, the jury in that case decided that there was sufficient evidence to meet the standard of preponderance of the evidence required to prove the tort of wrongful death.|$|E

25|$|Specialist-level {{training}} typically requires 3–4 {{years of}} graduate training including a 9-month (1200 hour) internship {{in a school}} setting. Doctoral-level training programs typically require 5–7 years of graduate training including a 12-month internship (1500+ hours), which {{may be in a}} school or other (e.g., medical) setting. Doctoral level training differs from specialist-level training in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>requires</b> students to take more coursework in core psychology and professional psychology. In addition, doctoral programs typically require students to learn more advanced statistics, to be involved in research endeavors, and to complete a doctoral dissertation constituting original research.|$|E
