Magneto-optic switch {{has been}} widely {{researched}} due to its capabilities handling large beam cross sections, operating at low voltages, featured as low insertion loss and intrinsic non-reciprocity. However, the switching speed is rather slow: switching time of available magneto-optics switches are of hundreds microseconds. Previously, we developed a novel type high speed magneto-optic switch based on Faraday rotation effect of light in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG). The switch shows its good performance and high reliabilities. However, it had some disadvantages: 1) Although it was polarization independently designed for the insertion loss, some dependence about 0. 5 dB was observed due to the components' misalignments since it has many components and adjustment points; 2) Faraday rotator assembly designed by using double YIG rods with diameter 3 mm require much higher switching current to rotate the light by 90 degrees. And the heat generated when operating may also affect the YIG performance. 3) The narrow and sharp pulse width of nanosecond trigger impulse signal generated with short duration can't accumulate the high speed switching magnetic field large enough to drive the YIG reach saturation magnetic field within a <b>trigger</b> <b>period.</b> In this paper, we mainly devote to design an improved switch featured as compact optical route, much more effective Faraday rotator assembly and nanosecond trigger impulse signal with wider pulse width...|$|E

30|$|In Fig. 6, a- 1 and a- 2 {{show the}} H-component of the {{geomagnetic}} field {{for an entire}} day and the enlarged segment of this field around SC, respectively. b- 1 is the averaged squared second detail of the entire day. In (b- 2), the segment around the SC in the second detail is enlarged. In this subfigure, we can notice that the condition of alarming for a trigger is satisfied when the amplitudes of the second detail exceed the triggering threshold over a period larger than the <b>triggering</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
40|$|Around the world, {{potentially}} effective {{responses to}} serious social problems are left untried because those responses are politically, culturally or morally problematic in affected communities.

30|$|In (b- 3), a spike {{during which}} the {{amplitude}} exceeds the threshold can be seen. This spike doesn't alarm for a trigger as the duration of such a spike {{is less than the}} <b>triggering</b> <b>period.</b> There is a possibility of the occurrence of the alarming condition when there is no SC; in such a situation, this trigger is called a false trigger. This possibility, of false triggers, is low in normal days but it is observed to increase after the occurrence of an SC. In order to confirm that this trigger is an SC and not a false trigger, the other stations are checked if they alarm for a trigger within a certain period around the time of this alarm. If a trigger is found at these stations, this trigger is declared to be an SC, otherwise this trigger is declared as a false <b>trigger.</b> This certain <b>period</b> is considered as an accepted margin, and can be set by the user. In this paper, we propose three minutes for this specific period. Examples explaining this point in detail will be described in the Section 6, and are shown in Table 2.|$|R

50|$|Nicholls {{was married}} three times, {{but it was}} his {{marriage}} to his second wife, Rhoda Holmes Nicholls, that caused a media sensation across the United States. In 1897 both Burr and Rhoda Nicholls submitted paintings to the Paris Salon; Rhoda's was accepted with honorable mention but Burr's was rejected. This <b>triggered</b> a <b>period</b> of marital discontent followed by separation. Their divorce was finalized in 1906 and was reported in many American newspapers. Journalists warned women of the peril of pursuing vocations that put them in competition with their husbands.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} this program, the U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), which authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect an annual federal employer tax used to fund state workforce agencies. FUTA covers {{the costs of}} administering the Unemployment Insurance and Job Service programs in all states. In addition, FUTA pays one-half {{of the cost of}} extended unemployment benefits which are <b>triggered</b> in <b>periods</b> of high state unemployment. FUTA also provides a fund from which states UI funds may borrow to pay benefits. As originally established, the states paid the federal government.|$|R
50|$|Typically, initial {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of this disorder occur during infancy or early childhood and can include feeding difficulties, lethargy, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, liver problems, and abnormalities in the retina. Muscle pain, a breakdown of muscle tissue, and abnormalities in the nervous system that affect arms and legs (peripheral neuropathy) may occur later in childhood. There is also a risk for complications such as life-threatening heart and breathing problems, coma, and sudden unexpected death. Episodes of LCHAD deficiency can be <b>triggered</b> by <b>periods</b> of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections.|$|R

However, Bonventre switched sides, joining Rastelli's faction. If Bonventre and the Zips had stayed loyal to Indelicato, he would have probably taken over the Bonanno family. The ascension of Rastelli as boss <b>triggered</b> a <b>period</b> of discontent and rivalry in the Bonanno family. As a result, Rastelli and Massino started purging their opponents in the family.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The modern Brazos Delta is {{composed}} {{of a series of}} ridge–trough pairs reflecting episodic delta growth. Previous work has shown that these features represent remnants of channel mouth-bar and back-bar lagoon deposits formed as a consequence of major floods. Subsequent reworking by wave action welds these units to the western flank of the delta plain, forming the next ridge–trough set. Recent work however, has brought to light a primary climate component in the development of these facies, making development of ridge–trough pairs a more complex process than the previous model suggests. Climate in Texas is characterized by extremes, many of which can be attributed to El Niño and La Niña cycles. El Niño events result in dramatically higher precipitation and flooding, and La Niña events <b>trigger</b> <b>periods</b> of extreme drought. The development of an emergent channel-mouth bar is correlated to high-sediment-yield floods induced by El Niño events. However, only five ridge–trough sets exist on the delta plain and an estimated 20 El Niño events have occurred since 1929, when the delta began to form, indicating that the flood criterion alone is not sufficient to initiate delta progradation. Each of the five episodes of rapid delta growth occurred when a period of extensive drought preceded an El Niño-induced flood. The droughts, associated with La Niña events, were instrumental in removing vegetation and pre-conditioning the drainage basin for erosion. Without a preceding drought, the floods are ineffective in generating sufficient sediment to create a ridge...|$|R
500|$|Dorgon's {{unexpected}} {{death on}} 31 December 1650 during a hunting trip <b>triggered</b> a <b>period</b> of fierce factional struggles {{and opened the}} way for deep political reforms. Because Dorgon's supporters were still influential at court, Dorgon was given an imperial funeral and was posthumously elevated to imperial status as the [...] "Righteous Emperor" [...] (yi huangdi 義皇帝). On the same day of mid-January 1651, however, several officers of the White Banners led by former Dorgon supporter Ubai arrested Dorgon's brother Ajige for fear he would proclaim himself as the new regent; Ubai and his officers then named themselves presidents of several Ministries and prepared to take charge of the government.|$|R
50|$|Between 1950 and 1970, {{neighborhood}} resident composition {{changed as}} the largely German, Irish, and Italian original residents moved further out. The {{construction of the}} interstate system in the 1970s led to the demolition of hundreds of homes and many businesses and churches, displacing residents and adding to the suburban flight {{that began in the}} 60s.

30|$|The 1980 s {{marked a}} time of {{structural}} adjustment around the world. New Zealand began the decade {{as one of the}} most regulated economies in the OECD. By 1984, it was facing unsustainable fiscal and current account deficits and high inflation and foreign debt. This <b>triggered</b> a <b>period</b> of comprehensive market-oriented economic reforms that lasted until 1993. Between 1984 and 1991, real per capita GDP growth averaged 0.4 % and unemployment rose from 5 % in 1984 to almost 11 % in 1992. These reforms had particularly severe negative impacts on Māori and Pacific Islanders, who were disproportionately employed in low-skilled manufacturing jobs that largely disappeared with the end of industry support and import restrictions.|$|R
40|$|Puberty is an {{important}} period during development hallmarked by increases in sex steroid levels. Human neuroimaging studies have consistently reported that in typically developing pubertal children, cortical and subcortical gray matter is decreasing, whereas white matter increases well into adulthood.

Here we review structural neuroimaging studies and show that the changes in sex steroids availability during puberty and adolescence might <b>trigger</b> a <b>period</b> of structural reorganization of grey and white matter in the developing human brain...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus subtilis {{sporulation}} is a last-resort phenotypical adaptation {{in response}} to starvation. The regulatory network underlying this developmental pathway has been studied extensively. However, how sporulation initiation is concerted {{in relation to the}} environmental nutrient availability is poorly understood. In a fed-batch fermentation set-up, in which sporulation of ultraviolet (UV) -mutagenized B. subtilis is repeatedly <b>triggered</b> by <b>periods</b> of starvation, fitter strains with mutated tagE evolved. These mutants display altered timing of phenotypical differentiation. The substrate for the wall teichoic acid (WTA) -modifying enzyme TagE, UDP-glucose, has recently been shown to be an intracellular proxy for nutrient availability, and influences the timing of cell division. Here we suggest that UDP-glucose also influences timing of cellular differentiation. ...|$|R
