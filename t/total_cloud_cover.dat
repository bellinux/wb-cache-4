The annual <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> has increased significantly during this period with the strongest and most significant positive trend found in winter, and positive tendencies observable in all seasons.

40|$|Nimbus- 7 {{cloud and}} earth {{radiation}} budget data are compared {{in a study}} of the effects of clouds on the tropical radiation budget. The data consist of daily averages over fixed 500 sq km target areas, and the months of July 1979 and January 1980 were chosen to show the effect of seasonal changes. Six climate regions, consisting of 14 to 24 target areas each, were picked for intensive analysis because they exemplified the range in the tropical cloud/net radiation interactions. It is found that the net radiation is strongly influenced by the average cloud type and amount present, but most net radiation values could be produced by several combinations of cloud types and amount. The regions of highest net radiation (greater than 125 W/sq m) tend to have medium to heavy <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> In these cases, thin medium-altitude clouds predominate.

Substantial agreement exists between global mean time series of surface- and satellite-observed upper-level cloud cover, indicating that the reported variations in this cloud type {{are likely to be}} real. Upper-level cloud cover has decreased over almost all land regions since 1971 and has decreased over most ocean regions since 1952.

The global mean satellite <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> time series appears spurious because the spatial pattern of correlations between grid box time series and the global mean time series closely resembles the fields of view of geostationary satellites rather than geophysical phenomena. The surface-observed low-level cloud cover time series averaged over the global ocean appears suspicious because it reports a very large 5 %-sky-cover increase between 1952 and 1997. Unless low-level cloud albedo substantially decreased during this time period, the reduced solar absorption caused by the reported enhancement of cloud cover would have resulted in cooling of the climate system that is inconsistent with the observed temperature record. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{computational}} burden associated with {{applications of the}} Tolerable Windows Ap-proach (TWA) considerably exceeds that of traditional integrated assessments of global climate change. As part of the ICLIPS (Integrated Assessment of Climate Protection Strategies) project, a computationally efficient climate model has been developed that can be included in integrated assessment models of any kind. The ICLIPS climate model (ICM) is implemented in GAMS. It is driven by anthropogenic emissions of CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, halocarbons, SF 6, and SO 2. The output in-cludes transient patterns of near-surface air temperature, <b>total</b> column-integrated <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> fraction, precipitation, humidity, and global mean sea-level rise. The carbon cycle module explicitly treats the nonlinear sea water carbon chemistry and the nonlinear CO 2 fertilized biosphere uptake. Patterns of the impact-relevant climate variables are derived form empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and scaled by the principal component of temperature change. The evolution of the latter is derived from a box-model-type differential analogue to its impulse response function convolution integral. We present {{a description of the}} ICM components and some results to demonstrate the model’s applicability in the TWA setting. 1...|$|R

A likely explanation to this paradox is {{the increase in}} aerosols over this clean region. However, this study shows that the radiation extinction due to aerosol loading is of one order lower in magnitude than the observed dimming, and the solar dimming is also seen in a satellite product that was produced without considering temporal variations of aerosols. Instead, the inter-annual variability and decadal change in solar radiation is contrasting to that in water vapor amount and deep cloud cover (but not <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover).</b> Therefore, we suggest that the solar dimming over the Plateau is mainly due {{to the increase in}} water vapor amount and deep cloud cover, which in turn are related to the rapid warming and the increase in convective available potential energy. 2012.

40|$|Ten {{years of}} {{nighttime}} weather observations from the Northern Hemisphere in December were classified {{according to the}} illuminance of moonlight or twilight on the cloud tops, and a threshold level of illuminance was determined, above which the clouds are apparently detected adequately. This threshold corresponds to light from a full moon at an elevation angle of 6 deg, light from a partial moon at higher elevation, or twilight from the sun less than 9 deg bvelow the horizon. It permits the use of about 38 % of the observations made with the sun below the horizon. The computed diurnal cycles of <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> are altered considerably when this moonlight criterion is imposed. Maximum cloud cover {{over much of the}} ocean is now found to be at night or in the morning, whereas computations obtained without benefit of the moonlight criterion, as in our published atlases, showed the time of maximum to be noon or early afternoon in many regions. The diurnal cycles of <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> we obtain are compared with those of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) for a few regions; they are generally in better agreement if the moonlight criterion is imposed on the surface observations. Using the moonlight criterion, we have analyzed 10 years (1982 - 91) of surface weather observations over land and ocean, worldwide, for <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> and for the frequency of occurrence of clear sky, fog, and precipitation. The global average cloud cover (average of day and night) is about 2 % higher if the moonlight criterion is imposed than if all observations are used.

For this purpose, precipitation observations at the Antarctic base Faraday/Vernadsky between 1960 and 1999 were analysed. A positive trend, significant at the 5 % level, {{was found in the}} number of precipitation events recorded during winter, showing an increase of 13 events per decade. The annual number of precipitation days has increased by 5. 7 per decade during the period of investigation, with highest increase rates being observed in winter and autumn. The characteristics of these findings confirm that results previously published though trends presented here are ∼ 50 % smaller due to a more thorough data quality control of the observational data. These results indicate that an increase in <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> at Faraday/Vernadsky observed since 1960 in the annual and wintertime data is reflected in higher numbers of precipitation events and days. Analyses of the precipitation type found an increase in the proportion of events of non-frozen precipitation, which is significant (1 % level) on an annual basis as well as in spring and autumn (both significant at 5 % level). This is a clear manifestation of the year round temperature increase observed over the Antarctic Peninsula. The increase in non-frozen precipitation will have reduced the albedo in the region and will thus have contributed to the temperature-albedo feedback. To refreeze rain that is draining through glaciers energy is extracted from the surrounding ice, thereby physically corroding the ice. This will have contributed to the observed retreat of glaciers around the Antarctic Peninsula. As non-frozen precipitation falling on frozen ground cannot be stored but instead runs off, less water will be available for the ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The decadal hindcast {{simulations}} {{performed for}} the Mittelfristige Klimaprognosen (MiKlip) project are evaluated using satellite-retrieved cloud parameters from the CM SAF cLoud, Albedo and RAdiation dataset from AVHRR data (CLARA-A 1) {{provided by the}} EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). The forecast quality of two sets of hindcasts, Baseline- 1 -LR and Baseline- 0, which use differing initialisations, is assessed. Basic evaluation focuses on multi-year ensemble mean fields and cloud-type histograms utilizing satellite simulator output. Additionally, ensemble evaluation employing analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis rank histograms (ARH) and a deterministic correlation score is performed. Satellite simulator output is available for {{a subset of the}} full hindcast ensembles only. Therefore, the raw model cloud cover is complementary used. The new Baseline- 1 -LR hindcasts are closer to satellite data with respect to the simulated tropical/subtropical mean cloud cover pattern than the reference hindcasts (Baseline- 0) emphasizing improvements of the new MiKlip initialisation procedure. A slightly overestimated occurrence rate of optically thick cloud-types is analysed for different experiments including hindcasts and simulations using realistic sea surface boundaries according to the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP). By contrast, the evaluation of cirrus and cirrostratus clouds is complicated by observational based uncertainties. Time series of the 3 -year mean <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> averaged over the tropical warm pool (TWP) region show some correlation with the CLARA-A 1 cloud fractional cover. Moreover, ensemble evaluation of the Baseline- 1 -LR hindcasts reveals potential predictability of the 2 – 5 lead year averaged <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> for a large part of this region when regarding the full observational period. However, the hindcasts show only moderate positive correlations with the CLARA-A 1 satellite retrieval for the TWP region which are hardly statistical significant. Evidence for predictability of the 2 – 5 lead year averaged <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> is found for parts of the equatorial to mid-latitudinal North Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|URL] {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} controlling the orientation of a single-axis solar tracker (1) that can be oriented about an axis of rotation (A), in which successive control phases are carried out in a repeated manner. According to the invention, the following successive steps are performed in each control phase: a) observing the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> above the solar tracker (1); b) comparing the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> observed with <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> models stored in a database, each <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> model being associated with an orientation set point value for the solar tracker; c) matching the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> observed with a <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> model; and d) controlling {{the orientation of the}} solar tracker by applying the orientation set point value to the <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> model selected in step c).

40|$|Using daily {{measurement}} {{of day and}} night infrared and incoming and absorbed solar radiation obtained from a TIROS satellite {{over a period of}} approximately 45 months, and integrated over 2. 5 degree latitude-longitude grids, the proportion of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> over each grid each day was derived for the entire period. For each of four three-month periods, estimates a and b of the two parameters of the best-fit beta distribution were obtained for each grid location. The (a,b) plane was divided into a number of regions. All the geographical locations whose (a,b) estimates were in the same region in the (a,b) plane were said to have the same <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> type for that season. For each season, the world was thus divided into separate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> types. Using estimates of mean <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> for each season, the world was again divided into separate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> types. The process was repeated for standard deviations. Thus for each season, three separate <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> models were obtained using the criteria of shape of frequency distribution, mean <b>cloud</b> <b>cover,</b> and variability of <b>cloud</b> <b>cover.</b> The <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> statistics were derived from once-a-day, near-local-noon satellite radiation measurements...|$|R
30|$|In past, many {{empirical}} {{models were}} developed by many researchers using various meteorological parameters like sunshine hours (Angstrom 1924), precipitation (Hargreaves and Samani 1982), air temperature (Jong and Stewart 1993), relative humidity (Elagib et al. 1998), and cloudiness (Black 1956) to establish a relationship with solar radiation. Bakirci (2015) has developed some new empirical models for predicting the monthly mean diffuse solar radiation on a horizontal surface for typical cities in Turkey. Chelbi et al. (2015) have done the solar radiation mapping using sunshine duration-based models and interpolation techniques for Tunisia. Simple correlation for estimating the global solar radiation on horizontal surfaces for India was done by Katiyar and Pandey (2010). Liu et al. (2015) found {{the changes in the}} relationship between solar radiation and sunshine duration in large cities of China. Robaa (2008) has done the evaluation of sunshine duration from cloud data in Egypt. Yang et al. (2012) have done the hourly solar irradiance time-series forecasting using <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> index. Nimnuan and Janjai (2012) have found another approach for estimating average daily global solar radiation from <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> in Thailand. New types of simple nonlinear models to compute solar global irradiance from <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> amount were found by Badescu and Dumitrescu (2014). Ehnberg and Bollen (2005) have done a simulation of global solar radiation based on cloud observations. Reddy (1974) has developed an empirical method for estimating sunshine from <b>total</b> <b>cloud</b> amount. Morf (2014) has done sunshine and <b>cloud</b> <b>cover</b> predictions based on Markov processes. Babatunde and Aro (1995) have established a relationship between “clearness index” and “cloudiness index” at a tropical station, for instance, Ilorin, Nigeria. Al-Mostafa et al. (2014) have done a review of sunshine-based global radiation models. Manzano et al. (2015) established a method to estimate the daily global solar radiation from monthly data.|$|R
