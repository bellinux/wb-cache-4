60|$|As {{the body}} lunged <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> Tarzan caught it and {{snatched}} the headdress from its shoulders, {{for the first}} sight of the creature had suggested to his ever-alert mind a bold scheme for deceiving his enemies.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect was}} instantaneous. John {{had risen from}} his seat as he {{delivered}} the blow, and it got the full benefit of his weight. Mr. Parker literally crumpled up. His head jerked, then fell limply forward. John pushed him on to the seat as he slid <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

50|$|The crater rim {{is roughly}} circular, with a sharp-edged, {{slightly}} angular rim, and a slender inner wall. The northwestern {{part of the}} rim has a linear cleft that runs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> crater is relatively level. There are some patches of lighter albedo in the interior, with the most notable lying near the northern inner wall.|$|R
60|$|Up, up, up it came <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> pattering of {{the feet}} ceased. The clanking rose until the five heard the {{scraping}} of the chain against the door frame {{at the head of}} the cellar stairs. They heard it pass across <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> center of the room and then, loud and piercing, there rang out against the silence of the awful night a woman's shriek.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it seems}} as if I had not broken my fast for four and twenty hours," [...] Hiram replied in a loud tone, at the same time motioning <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> above, as if to say that he would not {{converse}} with me however guardedly, while Master Lord was where he might come to believe we were holding secret council.|$|E
60|$|Still not a {{sound from}} Gilda, who--more like a cowering bird than ever--was trying with widely-dilated eyes to pierce the {{darkness}} around her, {{in order to see}} something of the enemy. She saw the outline of a plumed hat like a patch of ink against the sky above, and also a pair of very broad shoulders that were stooping <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the sledge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] said La Fleur, {{her eyes}} humbly {{directed}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> as she spoke, [...] "at {{least not for}} a permanency. I shall get the doctor a good cook. I shall make it my business {{to see that she}} is a person fully capable of filling the position. I have my eyes on such a one. As for me, I shall stay here with my dear Miss Cicely." ...|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a rotary {{drilling}} outfit, ca. 1940. A {{man wearing a}} jumpsuit {{can be seen at}} left standing behind a circular-shaped machine reading, "[?] Stone Drill [?]", which is visible with a pole extending from the top of it. A large spool of cable can be seen to the right, while a cable extends from it <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> is composed of rough wooden planks, while metal walls are visible in the background...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> arena <b>floor</b> {{is named}} Kilkenny Floor after former Oregon Athletic Director Pat Kilkenny. Called [...] "Deep in the Woods", the design {{features}} repeating silhouettes of Pacific Northwest tree lines, {{giving the impression}} of being lost in <b>the</b> forest, gazing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> sky. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> was designed by Tinker Hatfield, Nike's VP of Creative Design, who intended to design an [...] "iconic television presence possible for the University of Oregon" [...] and honor the [...] "Tall Firs", the nickname of the 1938-39 Oregon Ducks men's basketball team, winners of the inaugural NCAA basketball championship.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{was decorated with}} Italian marble and furniture brought from Italy and France. The main hall was decorated with typical Renaissance stairs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> projected second <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> main doors were specially crafted with wood from Brazil.|$|R
60|$|Arthur {{dragged out}} a few scraps and spread them upon the floor, thereby exhibiting {{portions}} of the beautiful patterns of the various pieces. Then, hoping to find some that had escaped the ruthless teeth of the rats, he and Runyon began pulling at the heap and working downward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Just a few small pieces were found intact, but these were of slight value. Practically the entire lot was irretrievably ruined.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seek not his eyes," [...] screamed Tara in warning; {{but it was}} too late. Already the horrid {{hypnotic}} gaze of {{the king}} kaldane had seized upon the eyes of Gahan. The red warrior hesitated in his stride. His sword point drooped slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Tara glanced toward Ghek. She saw the creature glaring with his expressionless eyes upon the broad back of the stranger. She saw the hand of the creature's rykor creeping stealthily toward the hilt of its dagger.|$|E
6000|$|Then a {{military}} secretary, standing close to His Excellency, takes Mr. Tomkins {{by the neck}} and bends him down <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and says very clearly and distinctly, [...] "Mr. Torpentine." [...] Then he throws him out by the neck into the crowd beyond and calls for another. The thing is done. Mr. Tomkins wipes the perspiration from his hair with his handkerchief and goes back at full speed to the Hoogli Hotel, Calcutta, eager for stationery to write at once to Ohio and say that he knows the Viceroy.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{we started}} up <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> main <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> building. Ghak headed the strange procession, then came Perry, {{followed}} by Hooja, while I {{brought up the}} rear, after admonishing Hooja that I had so arranged my sword that I could thrust it through the head of my disguise into his vitals were he to show any indication of faltering.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spinal}} cord of vertebrates, commissural neurons from the dorsal regions project {{downward}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ventral <b>floor</b> plate. Ipsilateral axons turn before reaching <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> plate to grow longitudinally, while commissural axons cross the midline and make their longitudinal turn on the contralateral side. Strikingly, Netrins, Slits, and Robos all play similar functional roles in this system as well. One outstanding mystery was the apparent lack of any comm gene in vertebrates. It now seems {{that at least some}} of Comm's functions are performed by a modified form of Robo called Robo3 (or Rig1).|$|R
60|$|A {{bitter and}} desperate melancholy fell upon the plainsman. What was the use? Such {{a woman was}} not for him. He had only the {{pleasure}} of the wild country. He would go back to his horses, his guns, and the hills, and never again come under the disturbing influence of this beautiful singer. She was not of his world; her smiles were not for him. When the others arose in song he remained seated, his sullen face set <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> denying himself the pleasure of even seeing Mary's face as she sang.|$|E
6000|$|She {{went into}} the rooms {{on one side of}} the corridor, and put up their windows, and flung the blinds back. He did the same on the other side. He got a {{peculiar}} effect of desolation from the mattresses pulled down over the foot of the bedsteads, and the dismantled interiors reflected in the mirrors of the dressing-cases; and he was going to speak of it when he rejoined Cynthia at the stairway leading to the third story, when she said, [...] "Those were Mrs. Vostrand's rooms I came out of the last." [...] She nodded her head over her shoulder <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> they were leaving.|$|E
60|$|He was {{so still}} that to merely human eyes {{he might have}} seemed asleep or dead. But a squirrel, that, emboldened by the stillness, had entered from the roof, stopped short upon a beam above the bunk, for {{he saw that the}} man's foot was slowly and {{cautiously}} moving <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and that the man's eyes were as intent and watchful as his own. Presently, still without a sound, both feet were upon the floor. And then the bunk creaked, and the squirrel whisked into the eaves of the roof. When he peered forth again, everything was quiet, and the man was gone.|$|E
25|$|Although {{standing}} {{in the shadow of}} its taller parent, Lingmell is very much a separate entity. In the manner of many fells it displays two contrasting aspects. The southern and western slopes– although steep– are smooth and rounded, while the northern and eastern faces fall as crags directly from the summit. The northern crag drops for a thousand feet <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> valley <b>floor,</b> with a further thousand feet of scree below.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} theory {{states that the}} canyon was likely formed by either water or lava, with the flow from south to north and {{additional}} material flowing from <b>the</b> slope <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> valley <b>floor.</b> According to <b>the</b> most popular theory, linear features on the valley bottom indicate possible ice flows and that ice may currently be plentiful. Mamers Valles is dated to the early Hesperian period, about 3.8 billion years ago.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was while}} seated solitary {{in his room}} one morning; his {{flagging}} faculties seeking a momentary respite; his head sideways turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> naked <b>floor,</b> following <b>the</b> seams in it, which, as wires, led straight from where he sat to the connecting door, and disappeared beneath it into the chamber of Isabel; that he started at a tap at that very door, followed by the wonted, low, sweet voice,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} the girls began to arrive, singly or in twos and threes, his mother {{was back in the}} little room, making tea for herself or sewing bits of them that had been torn as they stepped out of a cab, or helping them to put on the nightgowns, or pretending to listen pleasantly to their chatter and hating them all the time. There was every kind of them, {{gorgeous}} ones and shabby ones, old tired ones and dashing young ones, but whether they were the Honorable Mrs. Something or only Jane Anything, they all came to that room for the same purpose: to get a little gown and a pair of shoes. Then they went upstairs and danced to a stout little lady, called the Sylph, who bobbed about like a ball {{at the end of a}} piece of elastic. What Tommy never forgot was that while they danced the Sylph kept saying, [...] "One, two, three, four; one, two, three, four," [...] which they did not seem to mind, but when she said [...] "One, two, three, four, picture!" [...] they all stopped and stood motionless, though it might be with one foot as high as their head and their arms stretched out <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> as if they had suddenly seen a halfpenny there.|$|E

50|$|The palace {{was built}} in the early twentieth century, in 1909, by the Pontevedran {{architect}} Antonio Palacios for Victoriano Fernández Balsera, a wealthy merchant from Avilés. The building is in the Art Nouveau style popular at the time in Catalonia. One of the outstanding interior features is the V-shaped staircase opening <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> flat roof and tower balcony afford a view of the historic city below. Originally it had massive gardens on the scale of Versailles, but only a fragment of them remains.|$|R
5000|$|Twyman made a call during game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals {{between the}} New York Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers. During the pre-game segment with Schenkel, Twyman noticed Knicks' injured center Willis Reed (whose status for the {{clincher}} had been doubtful) advancing from <b>the</b> tunnel <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> court. Twyman then exclaimed: [...] "I think we see Willis coming out!" [...] The sight of Reed marching <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> basketball <b>floor</b> helped inspire <b>the</b> Knicks to a 113-99 victory - one that gave New York its first NBA league title.|$|R

5000|$|One of Abbie Hoffman's {{well-known}} publicity stunts {{took place}} in 1967, when he led members of the Yippie movement to the Exchange's gallery. The provocateurs hurled fistfuls of dollars <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> trading <b>floor</b> below. Some traders booed, and some laughed and waved. Three months later the stock exchange enclosed the gallery with bulletproof glass.

50|$|This crater has a {{sharp-edged}} rim {{that is not}} overlaid by any craters of note. It {{is roughly}} circular in shape, with slight bulges {{to the west and}} northwest.

A rotating circular set was used {{in at least one}} instance to make this effect with the actors always at the bottom; as they walked, the set would be turned to keep the actors at the bottom and prevent them from falling over as they walked up <b>the</b> curved <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> movie also features a rotating space station.|$|R
