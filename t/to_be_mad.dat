5|$|Strozzi was a Venetian, born in 1583, whose {{literary}} works included plays and poetry {{as well as}} opera libretti; Monteverdi had first met him in 1621. Strozzi knew Monteverdi's music, and had developed a strong appreciation of the composer's innovative style. On 20 June 1627, Monteverdi informed Striggio that Strozzi had expanded and arranged the text into five acts, under the new title La finta pazza Licori. Feigned madness was a standard theme in the commedia dell'arte tradition that had established itself in Italian theatre in the 16th century. In Strozzi's plot, the first known attempt at comic opera, the woman Licori disguises herself initially as a man, then as a woman, and then pretends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad,</b> all {{as part of a}} strategy to win the heart of her lover, Aminta.|$|E

500|$|Wong was {{disappointed}} with director Harry Longstreet, claiming {{he did not}} have respect for the script. Longstreet had failed to film one of the script's scenes, and had not obtained additional camera coverage for the scenes which had been filmed. As a result, Wong and another director, Michael Katleman, re-shot several scenes for additional coverage to complete the episode, and filmed the omitted scene and some inserts. Hutchison also had difficulty with Longstreet's directing; he found the acting instructions he was given [...] "ridiculous". Morgan said that the episode's production was problematic, feeling that [...] "Squeeze" [...] "was truly saved in postproduction". Duchovny also found issue with Longstreet's direction, and disagreed with the director's take on how Fox Mulder should be portrayed. Describing their different opinions, Duchovny noted [...] "the director wanted me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> about this horrible serial killer. I was like, 'No, this is an amazing discovery! He's not morally culpable, because he's genetically driven.' I judge no one".|$|E

Furthermore, she said [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] became the only song driven by anger on Taylor Swift, a topic she felt most teenage females could {{identify}} to. [...] "It's OK <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> after a breakup or after something goes wrong with a relationship", Swift said. The subject of [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] remains unaware that he is the inspiration behind the song. The song was chosen as a single based on the reactions it garnered at concerts. Swift recalled that, although [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] (2006) was her only single at the time she began opening for Rascal Flatts' Me and My Gang Tour (2006–07), [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] was the performance in which the crowd seemed to be the most enthusiastic with most screaming it [...] "at the top of their lungs".|$|E

[...] He prepares breakfast for him, including the two remaining eggs which he fries along with some fresh melon, but Ben taunts him and Locke becomes frustrated. [...] Kate cuts a deal with Locke's prisoner Miles Straume (Ken Leung): he will tell her what he knows about her if he can speak to Ben for a minute. [...] Miles wants to extort $3.2 million from Ben and in return, Miles promises to lie to his employer claiming Ben is dead. [...] Miles gives Ben a week to produce the cash. [...] Before Locke finds them, Miles reveals that he knows all about Kate's past. [...] Locke banishes Kate from the Barracks and goes to a lake house where Miles is being held captive. [...] Locke puts a grenade in Miles's mouth so that if he ceases to bite, he will die. [...] Kate sleeps with James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) but does not have sex with him. [...] Before Kate leaves for the camp at the beach, she slaps Sawyer across the face after he suggests that she is just pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> as an excuse to go back to Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and continue their love triangle.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout Pitt's life, {{many thought}} him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> {{due to his}} violent nature. He had {{a strong sense of}} honour and was far from cowardly, but he was {{frequently}} embroiled in violence, which was ultimately the cause of his death. Furthermore, there was rarely a time in his later life when Pitt was not engaged in some legal battle. [...] Following his death, his wish to leave £1000 to the city of Berne was viewed by one acquaintance as [...] "proof of his madness". When a full-length biography of Pitt was published in 1978, author Nikolai Tolstoy gave it the title The Half-Mad Lord in reference to this characteristic.|$|E

Wang had completed the script and begun casting when Sedaris asked to [...] "get out of it", after he and his sister worried how their family might be portrayed. He wrote about the conversation and its aftermath in the essay [...] "Repeat After Me". Sedaris recounted that Wang was [...] "a real prince ... I didn't want him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> at me, {{but he was so}} grown up about it. I never saw how it could be turned into a movie anyway." ...|$|E

2500|$|Private Baldrick {{never got}} to tell the {{audience}} his final [...] "cunning plan" [...] to escape the trenches, as he is sent [...] "over the top" [...] before he can reveal it to Blackadder, George and Captain Darling, though it possibly involved a splinter on the ladder. However, Baldrick stated that Blackadder was correct in the final plan being [...] "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University". Blackadder admits that [...] "whatever it was, {{it was better than}} my idea of pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad.</b> Who'd ever notice another mad man round here?" [...] The episode's ending implies that Baldrick is killed in that attack.|$|E
2500|$|Critics have {{described}} dril's voice as an amalgamation of ordinary Internet users, {{most of all}} those who are arrogant, ignorant, or hapless. According to The A.V. Clubs Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or [...] "your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a scabrous comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock)." [...] Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's [...] "naive appeals to moderation" [...] and [...] "flame war posturing," [...] and said dril [...] "is the internet's collective id, given form. He's the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we may never know who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled." [...] Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like [...] "a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays." [...] At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a [...] "joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> online." ...|$|E
2500|$|The catchphrase [...] "I have a cunning plan" [...] {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the pilot episode, {{but it is not}} regularly used until the third series; Blackadder had mentioned the phrase twice in the first series and Baldrick once. Baldrick had also claimed to have [...] "a plan" [...] in a [...] "cunning" [...] voice on one occasion in Blackadder II. In the final episode of the last series, Blackadder Goes Forth, Baldrick announces that he has a cunning plan to save the main characters from [...] "going over the top", although it is never revealed what this plan might be (other than that it is [...] "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University"). Blackadder, perhaps realising he cannot postpone going into battle (and certain death) indefinitely, dismisses it, telling Baldrick [...] "Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than my plan {{to get out of here}} by pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad.</b> I mean, who would have noticed another madman around here?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of the play's {{language}} {{is in the}} elaborate, witty language expected of a royal court. This {{is in line with}} Baldassare Castiglione's work, The Courtier (published in 1528), which outlines several courtly rules, specifically advising servants of royals to amuse their rulers with their inventive language. Osric and Polonius seem to especially respect this suggestion. Claudius' speech is full of rhetorical figures, as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's, while Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers use simpler methods of speech. Claudius demonstrates an authoritative control over the language of a King, referring to himself in the first person plural, and using anaphora mixed with metaphor that hearkens back to Greek political speeches. Hamlet seems the most educated in rhetoric of all the characters, using anaphora, as the king does, but also asyndeton and highly developed metaphors, {{while at the same time}} managing to be precise and unflowery (as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother, saying [...] "But I have that within which passes show, / These but the trappings and the suits of woe."). His {{language is}} very self-conscious, and relies heavily on puns. Especially when pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>mad,</b> Hamlet uses puns to reveal his true thoughts, while at the same time hiding them. Psychologists have since associated a heavy use of puns with schizophrenia.|$|E

30|$|The organic red(s) {{present in}} the {{manuscript}} could not be identified, but their presence was inferred from microscopic observation of the red colorants {{and the lack of}} characteristic elements detectable by XRF, except Al. In all cases, the attempted Raman analysis of organic red colorants yielded no further information due to the overwhelming fluorescence of the organic red itself. When examined with ultraviolet light, no visible fluorescence was observed, suggesting that the organic red colorant <b>was</b> unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>madder.</b> Spectra for the pigments vermilion and red lead are reproduced in Fig.  16. Similarly, no organic yellow(s) <b>were</b> identified due <b>to</b> the lack of characteristic elements detected by XRF analysis and no identifiable peaks in the Raman spectra. Identification of organic yellows typically involves sampling for analysis by chromatography mass spectrometry, which was not possible for this manuscript.|$|R
