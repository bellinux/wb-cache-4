5|$|After {{watching}} a news {{report on the}} cause of the explosion, Alex realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the plane. He deduces that Ms. Lewton is next and rushes to her house to ensure her safety. Thinking Alex is up to no good, Ms. Lewton calls the FBI agents, who take him in for questioning. Although Alex is unable to convince the agents of what is happening they decide <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> Nonetheless, he is too late to save Ms. Lewton, whose house explodes after she is impaled and killed by a falling kitchen knife.|$|E
5|$|New Directions needs twelve {{members to}} compete, but only has nine with Rachel {{suspended}} from school. Finn (Cory Monteith) and Rachel travel to Kentucky to ask Sam (Chord Overstreet) {{to come back}} to McKinley High for Sectionals. Unknown to his parents, Sam is dancing at a strip joint to help pay family expenses; he wants to return to McKinley, and they agree <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> Upon his return, Quinn attempts to reconnect with him to help her reclaim Beth, but he refuses her. He tells his former girlfriend Mercedes (Amber Riley) that he intends to woo her back from her new boyfriend, Shane (LaMarcus Tinker). For the final two performers they need, New Directions recruits its bassist and drummer to instead sing and dance.|$|E
5|$|Due to the NHL lockout, {{as well as}} rib {{and knee}} {{injuries}} sustained during the 2004 World Cup, Jovanovski was inactive during the 2004–05 season. When the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Jovanovski was on pace for a career year, but his season was interrupted by groin, foot and abdominal injuries. He finished with 33 points in 44 games for a career-high 0.75 points-per-game average. The Canucks suffered from Jovanovski missing the final 27 {{games of the season}} and did not qualify for the 2006 playoffs. Following the 2005–06 season, Jovanovski did not receive a contract offer from the Canucks, subsequently becoming an unrestricted free agent. The decision <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> was influenced by the re-signings of Daniel and Henrik Sedin, as well as the acquisition of goaltender Roberto Luongo, leaving no room on the team's salary cap to retain Jovanovski.|$|E
6000|$|... "26th.--Where is George to go? I {{have been}} {{thinking}} of it all through the night, and I cannot arrive at a conclusion. It is so difficult to reconcile myself <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> away alone.|$|R

5|$|During lunch, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Leslie that he {{is going}} to propose to Ann (Rashida Jones). Ann {{suggests}} that Leslie get some sleep, but she plans on consuming Sweetums bars to stay awake for another 24 hours. As the telethon begins, Leslie is already exhausted and is falling asleep. With time to kill, Tom brings Detlef to the Snakehole Lounge, but the owner, Freddy (Andy Milder), refuses <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> because Detlef is bringing a lot of business, delaying Leslie's big headliner. Andy's (Chris Pratt) band, Mouse Rat, is asked to replace Detlef, but when they complete all of their songs, Leslie has nothing else to put on the air. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to demonstrate how to cane a chair, but his presentation is so boring that the telethon actually starts to lose money.|$|E
5|$|If Mary was {{to secure}} England for Roman Catholicism, she needed an heir. On {{the advice of}} the Holy Roman Emperor she married his son, Philip II of Spain; she needed to prevent her Protestant {{half-sister}} Elizabeth from inheriting the Crown and thus returning England to Protestantism. There was opposition, and even a rebellion in Kent (led by Sir Thomas Wyatt); even though it was provided that Philip would never inherit the kingdom if there was no heir, received no estates and had no coronation. He was there to provide an heir. But she never became pregnant, and likely suffered from cancer. Ironically, another blow fell. Pope Julius died and his successor, Pope Paul IV, declared war on Philip and recalled Pole to Rome to have him tried as a heretic. Mary refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> The support she might have expected from a grateful Pope was thus denied.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Verdugo {{aimed to}} block Niezijl's dike with Frate's and Bievres' companies, but as these troops lagged behind, {{he found himself}} alone on the dike when Norreys and his {{officers}} attempted to retreat back to their camp. Alone, Verdugo fought desperately against them. Twice the Spanish commander was taken prisoner, but in the end, as he killed or wounded many of his foes, Norreys preferred <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> free rather than risk allowing the pursuing Spanish troops to capture himself or his remaining men. Once he had recovered, Verdugo massed some cavalry and completed the Anglo-Dutch defeat by destroying an English troop which, {{trying to save the}} flags, fled across a field towards the Niezijl canal. Most of the English flags and all of their artillery were lost. As the night was falling, Verdugo collected his troops and returned to Noordhorn, where they formed into squadron formation and, kneeling down, prayed to thank God for their victory.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] {{continued}} the Bloater, becoming more grave and confidential, [...] "it's my opinion, Jim, {{that you and}} I shall 'ave {{a run for it}} to-night. It's quite plain that our hamiable friend who seems so fond o' fire-raisin' is goin' to pay 'is respects to Number 5. 'Avin' got it well alight it is just within the bounds o' the possible--not to say prob'ble--that 'e'll give 'em leg-bail--make tracks, as the Yankees say--cut and run for it.

50|$|Athansor, {{the white}} horse, {{acts as a}} {{guardian}} angel of Peter Lake. Able to fly and possessing extraordinary endurance, the white horse {{appears to be an}} angelic being.

5|$|While there, Nico {{settles into}} camp life; Percy and Blackjack save a sea monster Percy nicknames Bessie; and Artemis's {{lieutenant}} Zoë Nightshade has mysterious dreams about the goddess being in grave danger. Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy. Chiron and Zoë organize a quest, but Percy is forbidden from going because the Hunters refuse to travel with a boy. He successfully sneaks away from camp on Blackjack, though he is almost stopped by Mr. D (Dionysus) who agrees <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> {{because there is a}} good chance that Percy will get killed while on the quest.|$|E
5|$|Whilst Tommy {{is under}} day-release, Toshiko (Naoko Mori) elects {{to keep him}} company. Whilst Toshiko spends time with Tommy, Jack (John Barrowman) and Gwen (Eve Myles) {{discover}} that the abandoned Cardiff hospital is showing signs of time distortion, with elements of the 1918 hospital appearing in the present. Meanwhile, Toshiko and Tommy grow closer; after an afternoon in the pub, he kisses her romantically. Later, Toshiko's colleague Owen (Burn Gorman) realises that Toshiko has developed feelings for Tommy and warns her to be careful as {{he does not want}} her to get hurt. Upon their return, Jack realizes that the present year is when Tommy will be needed: he will have to travel back to 1918 and activate a Rift Key to close the connection between 1918 and the present and prevent disaster. As Tommy is due to be executed for cowardice three weeks after his return to 1918, Tosh initially refuses <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> back. Jack persuades her of the necessity of Tommy's return.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{was highly}} {{successful}} at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 {{he was offered}} the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (tekhnikum) in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (rabfak) attached to the tekhnikum {{that was designed to}} bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the tekhnikum. While enrolled in the rabfak, Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine. One of his teachers later described him as a poor student. He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the rabfak in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire tekhnikum, and {{became a member of the}} bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy. All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later claimed to have finished his rabfak studies, it is unclear whether this was true.|$|E

50|$|Outside the courthouse, Cheung {{catches up}} with Sandy to express his {{gratitude}} to her, and Sandy said they do not fit together, and claims she only did that just <b>to</b> not <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail and tells him to {{take good care of}} Ruby and Tai-hung. As they separate, Cheung was unexpectedly killed by Uncle Mei's henchmen on the streets.|$|R
5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, but he soon moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, feeling in limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, {{the family}} learns that Peter's {{condition}} {{has a big}} chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They learn that the only other option besides the daily procedures is that one must give up one of their kidneys to Peter. Lois volunteers to give up one of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover {{that he has the}} same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog kidneys are smaller than human's, the donation requires both kidneys. If the procedure was successful, Brian would lose his life. Brian decides {{to go along with the}} procedure to save Peter's life. Reluctant to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman reveals that he is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own kidneys. He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog kidneys would work, meaning that Brian would have died for nothing. Thus, Brian's life is spared.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) {{returns home}} from {{boarding}} school and accidentally overhears a conversation from his grandmothers (Achala Sachdev and Sushma Seth) concerned Rahul's adoption {{and the reason}} why Rahul left home, whereupon Rohan vows to reunite the family. He learns that Rahul, Anjali, and her younger sister Pooja (with whom he shared a playful relationship during his childhood) moved to London, and tells his parents that he wishes to pursue further studies in London. Yash is skeptical at first, but once Rohan emphasizes that he is following the family traditions, his parents agree <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> In London, Rahul and Anjali now have their own son, Krish. Pooja (Kareena Kapoor), now a popular fashion-obsessed diva, is a student at King's College London, where Rohan enrolls. He and Pooja meet again and he tells her that he has come to London to bring his brother and sister-in-law back home. Pooja tells Rahul that Rohan is her friend's brother who currently has nowhere to stay. After some persuasion, Rahul agrees to let Rohan stay as Rohan uses the name 'Yash' to hide his real identity. Right before the family attends Krish's school functin, Sayeeda and Anjali find out his real identity, though they promise to keep quiet. At Krish's school function, Krish leads his class in singing Jana Gana Mana (Indian national anthem), and later recites advice which Rohan had given him. Rahul, having given Rohan this advice ten years ago, now realizes that Rohan is his brother.|$|E
50|$|The Company {{attempted}} suing Schäffer {{for damages}} but he counter-attacked, demanding reimbursement for his alleged business expenses, {{and in the}} end the Company found it easier <b>to</b> simply <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> Germany. By this time the United States established a permanent consulate in Honolulu; Kaumualii, the only ally of Russians, was subdued by Kamehameha's son and successor Liholiho.|$|R
50|$|As Jack {{begins to}} turn pale Sun stops the {{transfusion}} because {{the blood is}} pooling in Boone's dead right leg.

25|$|The Han central {{government}} later reassigned Liang Mao {{to be the}} Administrator of Lelang Commandery (樂浪郡; around present-day Pyongyang, North Korea). At the time, the warlord Gongsun Du controlled the nearby Liaodong Commandery (遼東郡; around present-day Liaoyang, Liaoning). While Liang Mao passed by Liaodong en route to Lelang, Gongsun Du detained him in Liaodong and refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> to Lelang. Liang Mao was unfazed by Gongsun Du's bold and illegal action.|$|E
25|$|Bellamy {{stated that}} he would like to stay at Cardiff City beyond his loan spell to achieve his dream of them one day playing in the Premier League. After Cardiff manager Dave Jones' sacking, Bellamy became a {{surprise}} favourite to take over. However, the new Cardiff boss, Malky Mackay, who knew Bellamy from their days at Norwich, did not say whether he would attempt to sign Bellamy. Bellamy asked Manchester City <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> on a free transfer after they put a £4,000,000 price tag on him.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} two Bundesliga seasons, Simonsen continued his prolific goalscoring, as Mönchengladbach finished 2nd and 8th respectively. He won another international trophy with Mönchengladbach in 1979, when he scored eight goals in eight games to guide the club to the final games of the 1978–79 UEFA Cup. He scored the deciding goal in the 2–1 1979 UEFA Cup Final win against Red Star Belgrade. Simonsen had been approached by Spanish club FC Barcelona in 1978, but Mönchengladbach refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> Instead, Simonsen waited for his contract to expire and moved to FC Barcelona in 1979, rejecting offers from Hamburger SV, Juventus, and several Arabian clubs.|$|E
25|$|For reasons unknown (the tablet is {{partially}} broken) Enkidu is in a sad mood. In order to cheer him up Gilgamesh suggests {{going to the}} Pine Forest to cut down trees and kill Humbaba (known here as Huwawa). Enkidu protests, as he knows Huwawa and is aware of his power. Gilgamesh talks Enkidu into it with some words of encouragement, but Enkidu remains reluctant. They prepare, and call for the elders. The elders also protest, but after Gilgamesh talks to them, they agree <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go.</b> After Gilgamesh asks his god (Shamash) for protection and both equip, they leave with the elder's blessing and counsel.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, he {{was offered}} {{a job as a}} trainee in Standard Oil Company (Mobil) in 1962 and he opted for it while hoping to go to Germany. When he {{returned}} from his training, he found out to his dismay that his father had written to AEG declining to send him to Germany. He could feel that his father was not prepared <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> away out of love, and he accepted this as such. In the meantime, his cousin Kazi Abdur Rasheed also arranged for him to proceed to the USA to do his master's degree, but in deference to his father’s wishes he remained behind in India to work with Standard Oil Company.|$|E

Cledus and Justice then start a final pursuit with Buford on two tires, first through {{a bunch of}} cattle, then to boats, then finally through a field where the Enoses set off a series of explosives, one of which destroys all of the bodywork, leaving the engine, seats, and police light bar (being held by Junior above his head.) Cledus decides to {{surrender}} the fish <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Buford win.
