5|$|Carleton ordered {{most of the}} British army to sail upriver toward Sorel on June 9, {{but they}} did not {{actually}} leave until he joined them on June 13. A detachment of 1200 men under Fraser marched up the northern shore toward Berthier and Montreal. The British fleet arrived at Sorel late on the 14th; the Americans had left <b>there</b> <b>just</b> that morning. Elements of the British army entered Montreal on June 17, and also arrived at Fort Saint-Jean {{in time to see the}} last Americans (the very last one reported to be Benedict Arnold) push away from its burning remnants.|$|E
5|$|John Jordan Crittenden {{was born}} September 10, 1787, near Versailles, Kentucky. He {{was the second}} child and first son of Revolutionary War veteran John Crittenden and his wife Judith Harris. John and Judith Crittenden had four sons and five daughters, {{all but one of}} whom survived infancy. On his father's side, he was of Welsh ancestry, while his mother's family was French Huguenot. His father had {{surveyed}} land in Kentucky with George Rogers Clark, and settled <b>there</b> <b>just</b> {{after the end of the}} American Revolution. Two of Crittenden's brothers, Thomas and Robert, became lawyers, while the third, Henry, was a farmer.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{continued}} {{between the}} North Koreans and the ROK Capital Division {{on the hills}} bordering the valley from An'gang-ni to Kyongju. The 3rd Battalion, US 19th Infantry, became involved <b>there</b> <b>just</b> after midnight on September 8–9. A North Korean force attacked K Company and drove it from Hill 300, a defensive position midway between An'gang-ni and Kyongju. North Koreans held the hill during September 9 against counterattack. Farther north, {{on the left side}} of the valley, the ROK 17th Regiment attacked and, with the support of the US 13th Field Artillery Battalion, captured Hill 285 and held it against several North Korean counterattacks. On the opposite, east side of the valley the ROK 18th Regiment made limited gains. These battles took place in drenching typhoon rains. Low-hanging clouds allowed very little air support. The rains finally ceased on September 10.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized {{loss of life}} along the coast. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone. A total of 586homes were damaged <b>there.</b> <b>Just</b> outside {{the city in the}} Hinthada District, a flash flood killed at least 18people. Overall, the storm claimed 37lives in the country and left US$6.7million in damage. In the wake of Mala, the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless. Government and social organizations donated 5.4million kyat (US$4,320) in cash to survivors in the Ayeyarwady Region.|$|E

5|$|In May, Shōkaku and Zuikaku were {{assigned}} to a mission to counterattack the American offensive in the Aleutian Islands, but this operation was cancelled after the Allied victory on Attu on 29 May 1943. The sister ships were transferred to Truk in July. In response to the carrier raid on Tarawa on 18 September, the carriers {{and much of the}} fleet sortied for Eniwetok to search for the American forces before they returned to Truk on 23 September, having failed to locate them. The Japanese had intercepted some American radio traffic that suggested another attack on Wake Island, and on 17 October, Shōkaku and Zuikaku and the bulk of the 1st Fleet sailed for Eniwetok {{to be in a position}} to intercept any such attack, but no attack occurred and the fleet returned to Truk. At the beginning of November, the bulk of their air groups were transferred to Rabaul to bolster the defenses <b>there,</b> <b>just</b> in time to help defend the port against the Allied attack a few days later. They accomplished little there, for the loss of over half their number, before returning to Truk on the 13th. The sisters returned to Japan in December.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians <b>there.</b> <b>Just</b> before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because he could see the desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E
