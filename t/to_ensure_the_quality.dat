5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of {{life they}} seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation {{and population growth}} are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The {{metalworking}} {{industry has}} instituted specifications and codes to guide welders, weld inspectors, engineers, managers, and property owners in proper welding technique, design of welds, how {{to judge the}} quality of Welding Procedure Specification, how to judge the skill of the person performing the weld, and how <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of a welding job. Methods such as visual inspection, radiography, ultrasonic testing, phased-array ultrasonics, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic particle inspection, or industrial computed tomography can help with detection and analysis of certain defects.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} sound film {{released}} by Tan's, but far from {{the first in the}} Indies. The earliest sound films released in the Indies, Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 and The Rainbow Man, were both shown in 1929. The following year, a domestic part-talkie, G. Krugers' Karnadi Anemer Bangkong, was also released, becoming the first domestic sound film. Two other directors had followed with full-talkies in 1931: The Teng Chun with Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang and the Wong brothers with Indonesia Malaise. In order <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the sound, Tan's hired Krugers and his single-system camera to do the cinematography and sound direction for this black-and-white film.|$|E

5|$|Njai Dasima was {{directed}} by Bachtiar Effendi for Tan's Film, a production company owned by the Tan brothers. With this {{he became the first}} native Indonesian film director in the Indies. It starred Momo and Oesman. The story was adapted from G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima, which Tan's had already adapted in 1929 with the same name for their first release. The story was already well known in Batavia (now Jakarta), in part because it was a popular part of stage performers' repertoires. <b>To</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the story, Effendi worked with a scenario and, later, shooting script– two items which had, until then, never been used for a domestic production.|$|E

25|$|The {{creation}} of a national DNA database within the U.S. was first mentioned by the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (TWGDAM) in 1989. In 1990, the FBI began a pilot DNA databasing program with 14 state and local laboratories. In 1994, Congress passed the DNA Identification Act which authorized the FBI to create a national DNA database of convicted offenders as well as separate databases for missing persons and forensic samples collected from crime scenes. The Act also required that laboratories participating in the CODIS program maintain accreditation from an independent nonprofit organization that is {{actively involved in the}} forensic fields and that scientists processing DNA samples for submission into CODIS maintain proficiency and are routinely tested <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of the profiles being uploaded into the database. The national level of CODIS (NDIS) was implemented in October 1998. Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, federal law enforcement, the Army Laboratory, and Puerto Rico participate in the national sharing of DNA profiles.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the U.S. federal {{government}} took up an initiative to provide patients with an explicit list of rights concerning their healthcare. The political philosophy behind such an initiative essentially blended {{ideas of the}} Consumers' Bill of Rights with the field of healthcare. It was undertaken in an effort <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of care of all patients by preserving {{the integrity of the}} processes that occur in the healthcare industry. Standardizing the nature of healthcare institutions in this manner proved provocative. In fact, many interest groups, including the American Medical Association (AMA) and Big Pharma came out against the congressional bill. Basically, having hospitals provide emergency medical care to anyone, regardless of health insurance status, as well as the right of a patient to hold their health plan accountable for any and all harm done proved to be the two biggest stumbling blocks for the bill. As a result of this intense opposition, the initiative eventually failed to pass Congress in 2002.|$|E

Although she wrote [...] "went off very well" [...] in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, {{and concluded that}} she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach {{for the remainder of}} her life. He later explained that her [...] "warm and spacious tone" [...] was in part due {{to the size of the}} cavity at the back of her throat: [...] "one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to [...] "her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character".|$|E

500|$|Mike E. Clark {{produced}} much of Insane Clown Posse's discography {{until the}} group's sixth and seventh albums, Bizzar and Bizaar. After Clark nearly {{died from a}} collapsed lung, he became less active in the music industry, his studio not being used {{for much of the}} early decade, and the group worked with Mike Puwal on their eighth and ninth albums, [...] and Hell's Pit. In 2006, Clark returned to Psychopathic Records and produced the group's tenth studio album, The Tempest in 2007, but did not work with the group directly. Bang! Pow! Boom! was the first album which Clark worked on directly with Joseph Bruce and Joseph Utsler since Bizaar. Bang! Pow! Boom! was recorded between September 2008 and July 2009 at Clark's Fun House Studio. Bruce listened to music by the progressive rock band Gong for inspiration. In order <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> of their vocal recordings, Bruce and Utsler drank tea before every take and didn't smoke cannabis while recording. Much material was recorded for the album; some songs left off the initial release appeared on the [...] "Nuclear Edition" [...] reissue, while another song intended for Bang! Pow! Boom!, [...] "If I Ate Your Brains", was released as part of a single for the 2009 Hallowicked concert.|$|E
2500|$|In Portugal {{according}} to Base Law of Educative System from 1973 [...] (...) the diploma mill is impossible.
