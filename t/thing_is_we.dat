Although Harris admits that he [...] "wasn't really into it" [...] at first, he then thought, [...] "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> know Bruce {{and we know what}} he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.' I mean, we got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so... after I thought about it, I didn't really have a problem with it." ...|$|E

Executive {{producer}} Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode, and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters. He said that although Dan Castellaneta’s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright’s voicing of Bart changed as well, because [...] "it was lower-register, {{and you can see}} in the difference in this segment. It was really funny to get the interplay [...] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. The great <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> didn’t have to ask—we already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons." [...] He also revealed that the segment expanded on an earlier episode which implied that the Ullman Simpsons were murdered and buried under the family home, stating [...] "if people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it." ...|$|E

In May 2007, Esposito filed {{for a divorce}} that was {{finalized}} in November. [...] "It was just something that happened. The good <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> both realized it. Sometimes you just realize it", he has since explained. Before his marriage, he met Renée Zellweger while filming Case 39 in 2006. The media speculated {{about the nature of}} their relationship in 2009 when the film was released. Although they refused to speak about the romance, they made several appearances together, and in 2011, the media reported {{about the end of the}} relationship. In December 2011, he was involved in a romantic relationship with Zoe Saldana that ended in January 2013. In March 2013, he began dating English model Suki Waterhouse who is 17 years his junior. According to a report by E!, they broke up in March 2015 because of their age difference and Waterhouse's desire to focus on her career. Cooper began a relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk the following month. In November, he moved into her apartment in New York's West Village. In March 2017, Shayk gave birth to their daughter.|$|E

For two years he sent sample material to several shows before, in 1996, he was hired to co-write the Seinfeld episode [...] "The Wait Out". In 1997, Selman joined to staff of The Simpsons {{and has been a}} writer and producer on the show ever since. He is currently an executive producer on the show. He has written 19 episodes and also co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show entitled The Simpsons Movie. Selman noted: [...] "The hardest <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> have to try and make each episode as good as everything that's come before it. We have a legacy of greatness, and you don't want to be the person that ruins The Simpsons." ...|$|E

Celebrities and supermodels have posed naked for the group's [...] "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" [...] campaign—some men, but mostly women—triggering criticism from some feminist animal rights advocates. The New Yorker writes that PETA activists have crawled {{through the streets of}} Paris wearing leg-hold traps and thrown around money soaked in fake blood at the International Fur Fair. They sometimes engage in pie-throwing—in January 2010, Canadian MP Gerry Byrne compared them to terrorists for throwing a tofu cream pie at Canada's fishery minister Gail Shea in protest of the seal slaughter, a comment Newkirk called a silly chest-beating exercise.

60|$|The {{philosophy}} called Positive is not {{a recent}} invention of M. Comte, but a simple adherence to the traditions of all the great scientific minds whose discoveries have made the human race what it is. M. Comte has never presented it in any other light. But he has made the doctrine his own by his manner of treating it. To know rightly what a <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> require to know, with equal distinctness, what it is not. To enter into the real character of any mode of thought, we must understand what other modes of thought compete with it. M. Comte has taken care that we should do so. The modes of philosophizing which, according to him, dispute ascendancy with the Positive, are two in number, both of them anterior to it in date; the Theological, and the Metaphysical.|$|E
