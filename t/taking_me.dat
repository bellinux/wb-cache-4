25|$|In 1996, Clark guest starred as {{herself in}} popular New Zealand soap opera Shortland Street. A satirical book, later adapted as a play, titled On the Conditions and Possibilities of Helen Clark <b>Taking</b> <b>Me</b> as Her Young Lover, by Richard Meros, was {{published}} by Lawrence and Gibson in 2005. Clark has also guest-starred on bro'Town, the New Zealand animated television series.|$|E
500|$|... "It's {{a lot of}} money", Kinsler said. [...] "I've never {{imagined}} being in this position in my life." [...] "This is a big day {{for me and my}} family", he reflected. [...] "I've been working my whole life to get to this point, since my dad first started <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> out in the backyard and started throwing the baseball with me." ...|$|E

500|$|Del Rey {{stated the}} use of her lower vocals on the tracks {{claiming}} that [...] "people weren't <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> very seriously, so I lowered my voice, believing that it would help me stand out. Now I sing quite low... well, for a female anyway." [...] The singer's first singles, [...] "Video Games" [...] and [...] "Born to Die" [...] were described variously as [...] "quasi-cabaret balladry", [...] "woozy and sometimes soporific soundtrack soul", [...] "pop", and [...] "indie pop".|$|E
500|$|In the song's opening verse, Harrison {{admits that}} he [...] "Can't say what I'm doing here" [...] in the {{material}} world, a statement that theologian Dale Allison identifies as Kafkaesque until Harrison offers [...] "eschatological hope" [...] with the subsequent line, [...] "But I hope to see much clearer". Harrison then states that he uses his body [...] "like a car / <b>Taking</b> <b>me</b> both near and far". Author Ian Inglis regards this as an apt metaphor, since our bodies [...] "are merely the vehicles that carry us on our journeys".|$|E
500|$|... "They were saying, 'Well, do {{a couple}} of weeks, a farewell.'" [...] Dahl said. [...] "I said, 'It's not a farewell. You guys are <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> off the air. I'm not retiring.' ... "I still have {{two and a half}} years left on my deal so, quite frankly, I'm not letting them out of it." [...] Dahl also said he was {{prepared}} to stay off the air for the remainder of his contract, which was to end in mid-2011 and was said to be worth more than $1 million annually.|$|E

500|$|... "It's Like That" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Carey and Jermaine Dupri. It features hand claps and whistles, {{as well as}} ad-libs and verses from Dupri and Fat Man Scoop. The song's bassline and chord progression are aligned with piano and string notes. Its lyrics are arranged to portray the singer during a celebration: [...] "I came to have a party / Open off that Bacardi ... Purple <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> higher / I'm lifted and I like it." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised its lyrics and beat, and felt the song prepares listeners for the album's [...] "party theme". Lyrically, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] {{was described as a}} [...] "broken-hearted lament for love"; it features finger-snaps, kick drums, and a piano-driven melody.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and {{talking to me about}} the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} was widely reported and condemned by the Soviet press. Kharlamov himself believed that [...] "Bobby Clarke {{was given the}} job of <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> out of the game." [...] The slash was apparently done at the instigation of assistant coach John Ferguson. [...] "I remember that Kharlamov's ankle was hurting pretty bad. I called Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle.' I didn't think twice about it. It was Us versus Them. And Kharlamov was killing us. I mean, somebody had to do it." [...] Canadian journalist Dick Beddoes asked Clarke about it later at a team reunion, calling it a [...] "wicked two-hander", to which Clarke replied [...] "Dick, if I hadn't learned how to lay on a two-hander once in a while, I'd never have left Flin Flon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thinkest thou that, while I was <b>taking</b> upon <b>me</b> {{the power}} which all women love, I {{would have been}} myself an object for a maiden's eye to rest upon? To speak plain, what would Catharine have thought of me in the ceremonial?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, <b>taking</b> with <b>me</b> a single-barrelled gun, {{that same}} little Purdey rifle with which I shot the {{vultures}} on the Hill of Slaughter at Dingaan's Kraal,[*] we started on foot, for I would not risk my only horse {{on such a}} journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I was weel {{through this}} business," [...] thought Edie to himself; [...] "mony folk surmise that the Earl's no very {{right in the}} judgment, and wha can say how far he may be {{offended}} wi' <b>me</b> for <b>taking</b> upon <b>me</b> sae muckle?" ...|$|R
500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{electronic}} group West London Deep sampled Manson's vocal from [...] "You Look So Fine" [...] {{in their}} white label track [...] "You're <b>Taking</b> <b>Me</b> Over". Manson refused clearance {{for the sample}} and the track was scrapped. By that point the track, and remixes by Inner City, Problem Kids and Desyn Masiello and Leon Roberts had already been circulated. The song was reworked and re-released the following year as [...] "Gonna Make You My Lover", without Manson's vocal.|$|E
2500|$|According to Johnson, {{creating}} the book involved [...] "9 years of writing, 16 drafts, [...] 3 deletion attempts [...] " [...] While working on Pym, Johnson also finished three critically acclaimed graphic novels – Hellblazer: Papa Midnite (2005), Incognegro (2008), Dark Rain: A New Orleans Story (2010) – and a fourth, as yet unnamed graphic novel scheduled {{for publication in}} 2012. In an interview with Mike Emery, Johnson stated {{that there were many}} times when he thought that Pym [...] "was taking too much of my time, and it was <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> in the wrong direction". He credits his wife, journalist Meera Bowman Johnson (to whom he dedicated Pym), and friends with persuading him to continue with the novel.|$|E

2500|$|A weary Wells {{worked on}} {{material}} {{for her new}} record label while dealing with other issues, including being bedridden for weeks suffering from tuberculosis. Wells' eponymous first 20th Century Fox release included the first single [...] "Ain't It The Truth", its B-side [...] "Stop <b>Taking</b> <b>Me</b> for Granted", the lone top 40 hit, [...] "Use Your Head" [...] and [...] "Never, Never Leave Me". However, the album flopped, as did the Beatles tribute album she released not too long afterwards. Rumors have hinted Motown may have threatened to sue radio stations for playing Wells' post-Motown music during this time. After a stressful period in which Wells and the label battled over various issues after her records failed to chart successfully, the singer asked to be let go in 1965 and left with a small settlement.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was common}} {{for the young}} Mayweather {{to come home from}} school and find used heroin needles in his front yard. His mother was {{addicted}} to drugs, and he had an aunt who died from AIDS because of her drug use. [...] "People don't know the hell I've been through," [...] he says. The most time that his father spent with him was taking him to the gym to train and work on his boxing, according to Mayweather. [...] "I don't remember him ever <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> anywhere or doing anything that a father would do with a son, going to the park or to the movies or to get ice cream," [...] he says. [...] "I always thought that he liked his daughter (Floyd's older sister) better than he liked me because she never got whippings and I got whippings all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} {{game of the}} series, Bobby Clarke slashed Kharlamov intentionally, {{fracturing}} a bone in his ankle. He would miss the seventh game of the series, {{and returned to the}} lineup for the final game of the series, but at much reduced effectiveness. At the time, many felt the slash was intentional. Assistant coach John Ferguson would later say [...] "I called (Bobby) Clarke over to the bench, looked over at Kharlamov and said, 'I think he needs a tap on the ankle'." [...] As for Kharlamov himself, he had little doubt that an attempt had been made to limit his effectiveness, [...] "I'm convinced that Bobby Clarke was given the job of <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> out of the game." [...] Kharlamov's injury, and his diminished play in the aftermath have been regarded as a turning point for the series in Canada's favour, who won the series in the eighth and final game.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{possible}} her change in political leanings {{was the result}} of the social upheavals occurring in American society at the same time. Beginning in the late 1950s and continuing into the 1970s, the struggle of African-Americans for social and legal equality could not have escaped the notice of a woman always known for approaching everyone she first met with respect, without regard for station in life. As an example of her attitudes on race, in 1965 her black chauffeur Richard Turner, who was also one of her best friends, was driving Alice to an appointment. During the trip, Turner pulled out in front of a taxi, and the driver got out and demanded to know of Turner, [...] "What do you think you're doing, you black bastard?" [...] Turner took the insult calmly, but Alice did not and told the taxi driver, [...] "He's <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> to my destination, you white son of a bitch!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, the band's {{style has}} been {{described}} as coming from [...] "the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre." [...] Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On [...] "My Baby's <b>Taking</b> <b>Me</b> Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. [...] Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look {{at myself in the mirror}} the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but I remember my father <b>taking</b> <b>me</b> to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget," [...] I interposed, [...] "that I had no {{opportunity}} of asking you. Lucilla interrupted us, and diverted {{my attention to}} other things. What {{do you mean by}} putting me on my defence in this way?" [...] I went on, more and more irritated by the tone he was <b>taking</b> with <b>me.</b> [...] "What right have you to judge my conduct?" ...|$|R
60|$|The leader, a great, bearded ruffian, {{held his}} gun against my ear {{while the others}} searched my pockets, <b>taking</b> from <b>me</b> my overcoat, my pistol, my glass, my sword, and, worst of all, my flint and steel and tinder. Come what might, I was ruined, for I had no longer the means of {{lighting}} the beacon even if I should reach it.|$|R
60|$|I {{reflected}} {{that perhaps the}} noise {{was caused by the}} oxen pushing their way through the carelessly-closed entrance, and at any rate that I had better go to see. So I slipped on my boots and a coat and went without waking Hans or the boys, only <b>taking</b> with <b>me</b> a loaded, single-barrelled rifle which I used for shooting small buck, but no spare cartridges.|$|R
