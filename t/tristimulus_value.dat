A neutral object infers equal values of red, green and blue stimulus. The lack of luminance information in rg prevents having more than 1 neutral point where all three coordinates are of equal value. The white point of the rg chromaticity diagram is defined by the point (1/3,1/3). The white point has one third red, one third green and the final third blue. On an rg chromaticity diagram the first quadrant where all values of r and g are positive forms a right triangle. With max r equals 1 unit along the x and max g equals 1 unit along the y axis. Connecting a line from the max r (1,0) to max g (0,1) from a straight line with slope of negative 1. Any sample that falls on this line has no blue. Moving along the line from max r to max g, shows a decrease in red and an increase of green in the sample, without blue changing. The further a sample moves from this line the more blue is present in the sample trying to be matched.|$|E

Natural color reproduction under arbitrary illumination becomes possible using spectral information of both image and illumination light. In addition, multiprimary color display, i. e., using more than three primary colors, has been also developed for the reproduction of expanded color gamut, and for discounting observer metamerism. In this paper, we present the concept for the multispectral data interchange for natural color reproduction, and the experimental results using 16 -band multispectral camera and 6 -primary color display. In the experiment, the accuracy of color reproduction is evaluated in CIE ∆Ea*b * for both image capture and display systems. The average and maximum ∆Ea*b * = 1. 0 and 2. 1 in 16 -band mutispectral camera system, using Macbeth 24 color patches. In the six-primary color projection display, average and maximum ∆Ea*b * = 1. 3 and 2. 7 with 30 test colors inside the display gamut.

40|$|A {{most common}} problem {{encountered}} in radiosterilization of solid drugs is discoloration or yellowing. By pharmacopoeia method, discoloration {{can be assessed}} by measuring absorbance of solutions of irradiated solid samples at 450  nm. We propose to evaluate discoloration of solid samples directly by recording their diffuse reflectance spectra. Further, the reflectance spectrum is used to compute various color parameters: CIE XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value,</b> CIE Lab, Δ E_ab^ * (color difference), yellowness index (YI), dominant wavelength, and excitation purity by CIE method. The investigation of difference reflectance spectra and color parameters revealed that for fluoroquinolones, e-beam was more damaging than gamma radiation, whereas for cephalosporins, trend was reversed. The quantum of discoloration with gamma radiation and e-beam {{is found to be}} nearly equal when assessed by pharmacopeia method, and it is therefore inadequate to assess small color differences. The color parameters Δ E_ab^ * and ΔYI are found to be reliable indicators of discoloration. The tolerance limits proposed in terms of /Delta E_ab^ * and ΔYI are ± 2 and ± 10  U, respectively. The dominant wavelength for all compounds has shifted to higher values indicating change in hue but defining color tolerance limit with this parameter requires adjunct excitation purity value...|$|E

In addition, at pH 10. 0, the differences were found in the a * and b * values from the lysine enantiomers and C*ab value from the asparagine enantiomers. Therefore, the color development of melanoidins was influenced by the type of amino acid enantiomers and pH levels.

30|$|Because of {{the complex}} color-forming process, the shade, lightness, and {{distribution}} of jadeite-jade green are not as uniform as a single crystal gem with an optical homogeneity, show the polychromatism caused by the heterogeneity of crystal optics, or reveal the color zonal distribution formed with different grow stages. Therefore, based on the calculation of jadeite-jade <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> under different spectral power distribution [4, 5], the quality evaluation of jadeite-jade green is influenced not only by its own characteristics but also by its transparency and shape. At the same time, the color of non-spontaneous optical objects is affected by external lighting conditions, such as the color temperature, illuminance, and color rendering of the light source, and the observer, then the color appearance, is not only different with the color temperature [6, 7], {{there will also be}} a significant change in illumination [8 – 11], and it can lead to the international popular research on the color prediction of non-spontaneous optical objects [12 – 14]. Similar to the color grading system of other materials [15], the color temperature of lighting source must in the scope of 4500 – 5500 K and color rendering index must not be lower than 90, which is claimed in the China National Standards (CNS) GB/T 23885 - 2009 of Jadeite-Jade Grading [16]. Of course, the complexity of on-spontaneous light objects’ color appearance under heterogeneous illumination reveals that an inversion relationship is clarified between lightness and brightness and also between chroma and colorfulness under nonuniform illumination with different illuminance levels (high and low) within the same visual field [17]; this is impossible under uniform lighting condition.|$|E
