40|$|Background: Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Lungs and lymphatics {{are the principal}} sites affected by this disease. The disorder is often not suspected by physicians. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study done on 140 <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> received for histopathological examination in the Department of Pathology for 1 year in a multispeciality tertiary care hospital, in Delhi. Results: Out of 140 <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> studied, 13 cases of sarcoidosis were diagnosed histopathologically. In these patients a clinical, pathological, and radiological corelation was done. And a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis was given after excluding other granulomatous lesions.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundLittle {{is known}} about trends in the {{utilization}} or complication rates of <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy,</b> particularly in community hospitals. MethodsWe used the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Florida State Inpatient and State Ambulatory Surgical Databases to assess trends in <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> utilization in adults from 2000 to 2009. We subsequently calculated population based estimates of complications associated with <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> (iatrogenic pneumothorax and procedure-related hemorrhage) and identified characteristics associated with complications. ResultsFrom 2000 to 2009, the age-adjusted rate of transbronchial biopsies per 100, 000 adults in Florida decreased by 25 % from 74 to 55 (p <  0. 0001), despite stability in the overall utilization of bronchoscopy. Analysis of 82, 059 procedures revealed that complications associated with transbronchial biopsy were uncommon and stable over the study period, with 0. 97 % (95 % CI 0. 94 – 1. 01 %) of procedures complicated by pneumothorax, 0. 55 % (95 % CI 0. 52 – 0. 58 %) by pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement, and 0. 58 % (95 % CI 0. 55 – 0. 61 %) by procedure-related hemorrhage. Patients with COPD (OR 1. 51, 95 % CI 1. 31 – 1. 75) and women (OR 1. 32, 95 % CI 1. 15 – 1. 52) were {{at increased risk for}} pneumothorax, while renal failure (OR 2. 85, 95 % CI 2. 10 – 3. 87), cirrhosis (OR 2. 31, 95 % CI 1. 18 – 4. 52), older age (OR 1. 17, 95 % CI 1. 09 – 1. 25) and female sex (OR 1. 40, 95 % CI 1. 17 – 1. 68) were associated with higher risk of procedure-related hemorrhage.

40|$|The {{clinical}} significance of minimal acute rejection (grade A,) in lung transplant recipients is unknown. We prospectively analyzed 1, 159 <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> in 184 patients. Two hundred seventy-nine biopsies in 128 participants confirmed A, histology at a mean postoperative day of 229 +/- 340. Sixty four of 255 surveillance A, lesions progressed to high-grade acute rejection by 3 months of follow-up, whereas 40 developed new lymphocytic bronchiolitis. Twenty-four A, biopsies were symptomatic, {{with only two}} cases progressing to high-grade rejection after steroid therapy. Seventy-eight of 184 patients experienced multiple (greater {{than or equal to}} 2) A, biopsies in the first 12 months after transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome developed in 68 % of patients with multiple A(1) lesions at a mean of 599 +/- 435 days, compared with 43 % of patients with one or less A, lesions at a mean of 819 +/- 526 (p = 0. 022). Eighteen patients experienced multiple A, biopsies after transplant in the absence of high-grade rejection episodes yet also developed earlier obliterative bronchiolitis (456 +/- 245 days, p = 0. 020). We conclude that for A(1) <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies,</b> the conventional treatment of observation only is now challenged even in patients who are asymptomatic.

These granulomas contained dust identified by mineralogic analyses as consisting mainly of aluminum particles.

About 1 yr after cessation of exposure, a chest radiograph and lung function tests remained essentially unchanged, but signs of alveolitis disappeared. This observation suggests that aluminum may cause granulomatous lung disease accompanied by a helper T-lymphocyte alveolitis, similar to that of berylliosis and sarcoidosis.

MethodsFrom June 2005 to July 2006, a total of 451 patients were given diagnoses of and treated for pulmonary tuberculosis in a university-affiliated hospital. Among them, 121 patients who received bronchoscopy because of sputum-negative conditions were recruited. Of these, 73 patients received bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography, and 48 patients received conventional bronchoscopy. ResultsPatients who received bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography had higher diagnostic yields of acid-fast bacilli smears (31. 5 % vs 12. 5 %, P =. 018) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, M tuberculosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (67. 1 % vs 47. 9 %, P =. 024), and pathologic reports of tuberculosis in <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens (32. 9 % vs 4. 2 %, P <. 0001) than patients who received conventional bronchoscopy. With the aid of endobronchial ultrasonography, the overall diagnostic yield for tuberculosis by using bronchoscopic procedures (smears and cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> specimens) was higher (80. 8 %) than {{for those who did}} not undergo endobronchial ultrasonography (58. 3 %, P =. 035).

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Lung {{cancer is the}} leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Because the locations of peripheral lung cancer are special, diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer is difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic value of <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy</b> (TBLB) in peripheral lung cancer. MethodsTransbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) were performed in 78 cases of peripheral lung cancer which could not be observed by bronchoscope, 42 cases among whom were diagnosed by pathology and cytologic examination. Thirty-six cases of peripheral lung cancer were not able to be diagnosed by TBLB, 22 cases among them were diagnosed by percutaneous lung biopsy (PNLB), and 14 cases being left were diagnosed by surgical operation, lymphadenopathy biopsy, pleura biopsy and sputum cytologic examination successively. Results The positive rate produced by <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsy,</b> brush biopsy were 53. 8 % and 8. 9 % respectively. The total positive rate was 57. 7 %. The positive rate produced by TBLB was higher than that of brush biopsy (P < 0. 01). Along with tumor's diameter enlarge, the positive rate of diagnosis was higher. The positive rate of right lung was higher than that of left lung. The positive rate of inferior lung was higher than that of upper lung.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether bronchoalveolar lavage reflects the histologic {{aspects of the}} lung histology in patients with sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cells recovered from lavage fluid were compared with tissue sections from <b>transbronchial</b> <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> in 33 patients. The evaluation of cellular types and their topographic distribution in situ was determined by using monoclonal antibodies in combination with immunohistochemical techniques. Cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage and <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> were significantly correlated both in sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. In fact, the relative proportions of inflammatory and immunocompetent cells recovered from lavage fluid accurately overlapped those observed in lung tissue sections. However, in patients with more pronounced alveolitis, the frequency of macrophages in tissue sections was higher than that observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage, {{and the degree of}} lymphocytes in the lavage was higher than that observed in the corresponding biopsy. Specifically, in these patients the lavage underestimated the amount of macrophages in the <b>lung</b> <b>biopsies</b> and overestimated the number of lymphocytes that were present in the lung parenchyma. This was more evident in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, where the intensity of alveolitis was higher than in sarcoidosis. Our data support the idea that, at least in patients with sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, bronchoalveolar lavage correctly samples the alveolitis. Discrepancies in patients with very high intensity alveolitis could be due to a more pronounced recirculation of lymphocytes from the parenchyma to the alveolar spaces...|$|R
