40|$|ABSTRACTBACKGROUNDThe SYNTAX {{score was}} {{developed}} as an angiographic tool <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> of {{coronary artery disease}} in patients with three-vessel and/or left main disease. We evaluated its role in predicting clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in non-selected patients, treated in the daily clinical practice of a reference center. METHODSAnalysis of patients undergoing PCI from March to September 2009 and followed-up for up to 12 months. Patients were divided in tertiles according to the SYNTAX score. The primary endpoint included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) – death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and target-vessel revascularization. The ability of the SYNTAX score in predicting MACE was assessed by the ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve. RESULTSTwo hundred and thirty-four patients with a mean SYNTAX score of 11. 6 ± 6. 2 points were included. Tertile I had a SYNTAX score ≤ 9 (average 5. 9); tertile II, > 9 and≤ 13 (average 10. 8); and tertile III, > 13 (average 18. 3). In the clinical follow-up of 7. 2 ± 4. 9 months, the incidence of MACE was greater in tertile III when compared to tertiles I and II (2. 5 % vs. 6. 4 % vs. 14. 1 %; P= 0. 0075). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0. 667 (P= 0. 012) indicating a moderate ability to anticipate the occurrence of MACE in this population. CONCLUSIONSThe SYNTAX score proved to be useful in predicting the occurrence of MACE after PCI in real world patients...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Determination of the QT {{interval}} dispersion {{by means}} of a standard ECG at rest has been widely used for cardiovascular risk assessment during the last 15  years as one of the recent explanations for the development of life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. However, {{little is known about the}} relation between QT dispersion and the severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis as defined by SYNTAX score. Aim of work:: The present study was done to assess the correlation between QTc dispersion and the severity of coronary artery disease in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) detected by SYNTAX score. Patients and methods: It included 50 patients who were non-diabetic, non-hypertensive and diagnosed as acute STEMI within 6  months undergoing coronary angiography in the cath. lab. of Assiut University Hospital. QT dispersion was calculated as the difference between the longest (QT max) and the shortest QT (QTmin) interval recorded by standard 12 lead ECG. The QT interval was corrected by using Bazett’s formula (QTc = QT/square root of R-R interval in seconds). Corrected QT dispersion (QTcd) was defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum QTc for a given heart rate. The SYNTAX score is calculated by syntax calculator, a new tool <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> of coronary artery disease. Results: Out of 50 participating patients, there were 43 (86 %) males with mean age 53. 9  ±  12. 1  years. The mean QTc dispersion was 83. 1  ±  20. 3  ms, while mean SYNTAX score was 11. 6  ±  6. 1. There is a strong positive correlation between QTc dispersion and SYNTAX score. This was not related to age, gender, risk factors or family history of ischemic heart disease. Of note, there was a relationship between QTc dispersion and serum creatinine. Conclusions: Our study concluded that there is a significant positive correlation between corrected QT dispersion and severity of coronary artery disease as assessed by SYNTAX score...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Syntax {{score is}} a lesion-based {{angiographic}} scoring system, originally devised <b>to</b> <b>grade</b> <b>the</b> anatomic <b>complexity</b> of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and thereby facilitate consensus {{in the study of}} a diagnostic angiogram between surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be a predictor for higher Syntax score remains unknown as well. METHODS: Severity of 105 patients who underwent coronary angiography, were evaluated with Syntax score. Laboratory tests were conducted for routine blood test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, creatinine and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). RESULTS: Ureum had significant correlation with Syntax score, p= 0. 016 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 05 - 0. 55. Result of logistic regression analysis showed that HDL and haematocrit had significant correlation with Syntax score, with cut off point 34 (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 0033, respectively). Based on multi-variate analysis, Syntax score 34 = 16 (HDL ≤ 40 + Ureum ≥ 23) + 10 (Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ≥ 3. 789) + 10 (HbA 1 c ≥ 7) + 13 (monocyte ≥ 9 %). CONCLUSION: HDL cholesterol, ureum, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, HbA 1 c and monocyte altogether can predict the higher Syntax score...|$|R
