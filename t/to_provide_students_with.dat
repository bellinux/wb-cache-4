500|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at Baltimore City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits. From 1927 to the early 1990s, the college preparatory curriculum at Baltimore City College was divided into two tracks: the [...] "A" [...] course and the [...] "B" [...] course. Though both tracks were intended <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> the skills necessary for college, the [...] "A" [...] course was intended to be more rigorous, enabling students to complete sufficient college-level courses to enter directly into the second year of college. In the early-1990s, then-Principal Joseph Antenson removed the two-tier system because he believed it to be racially discriminatory.|$|E
