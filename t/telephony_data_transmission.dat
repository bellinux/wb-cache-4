One unexpectedly finds two types of behavior in wire <b>telephony</b> <b>data</b> <b>transmissions</b> and only one type where cellular telephony is employed, contravening any reasonable electoral normative. Differentiation in <b>data</b> <b>transmissions</b> arise when comparing number of incoming and outgoing data bytes per machine against total number of votes per machine reported officially by the CNE. The respective distributions of electoral variables {{for each type of}} transmission show that the groups classified by it do not correspond to random sets of the electoral universe.

The presidential elections of 1998, 2000 and the 2004 Presidential Recall Referendum (2004 PRR) are compared according to the type of transmissions in 2004 PRR.

50|$|Asynchronous CDMA {{offers a}} key {{advantage}} in the flexible allocation of resources i.e. allocation of a PN codes to active users. In the case of CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA the number of simultaneous orthogonal codes, time slots and frequency slots respectively are fixed, hence the capacity in terms of number of simultaneous users is limited. There are a fixed number of orthogonal codes, time slots or frequency bands that can be allocated for CDM, TDMA, and FDMA systems, which remain underutilized due to the bursty nature of <b>telephony</b> and packetized <b>data</b> <b>transmissions.</b> There is no strict limit {{to the number of}} users that can be supported in an asynchronous CDMA system, only a practical limit governed by the desired bit error probability, since the SIR (signal-to-interference ratio) varies inversely with the number of users. In a bursty traffic environment like mobile telephony, the advantage afforded by asynchronous CDMA is that the performance (bit error rate) is allowed to fluctuate randomly, with an average value determined by the number of users times the percentage of utilization. Suppose there are 2N users that only talk half of the time, then 2N users can be accommodated with the same average bit error probability as N users that talk all of the time. The key difference here is that the bit error probability for N users talking all of the time is constant, whereas it is a random quantity (with the same mean) for 2N users talking half of the time.|$|R
