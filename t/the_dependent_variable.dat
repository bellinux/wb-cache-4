5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variable,</b> albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E

30|$|This is a tree based {{learning}} algorithm which constructs classification or regression tree {{based on}} <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> [46]. If <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> are categorical, it constructs the classification tree; if <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> are numerical, it constructs the regression tree. CART creates rules for splitting the data at a node {{based on one}} variable. After splitting the data, recursion is applied in the child node until stopping rules are found. Finally, the leaf nodes generate the final prediction.|$|R

25|$|The {{differential}} equation F(x) = (x) {{has a special}} form: the right-hand side contains only <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> (here x) and not the independent variable (here F).

25|$|The theorem {{can be used}} to {{establish}} a number of theoretical results.

50|$|MPC {{uses the}} current plant measurements, the current dynamic {{state of the}} process, the MPC models, and the process {{variable}} targets and limits to calculate future changes in <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> These changes are calculated to hold <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variables</b> close to target while honoring constraints on both independent and <b>dependent</b> <b>variables.</b> <b>The</b> MPC typically sends out only the first change in each independent variable to be implemented, and repeats the calculation when the next change is required.|$|R
25|$|A {{common goal}} for a {{statistical}} research {{project is to}} investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion {{on the effect of}} changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.|$|E
25|$|Reeves and Nass {{established}} two rules {{before the}} test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected {{people to be}} less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.|$|E
25|$|Early {{evidence}} relating tobacco smoking to {{mortality and}} morbidity came from observational studies employing regression analysis. In {{order to reduce}} spurious correlations when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models {{in addition to the}} variable of primary interest. For example, suppose we have a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of interest, and <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variable</b> is lifespan measured in years. Researchers might include socio-economic status as an additional independent variable, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to some effect of education or income. However, it is never possible to include all possible confounding variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, randomized controlled trials are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as instrumental variables regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.|$|E

500|$|The {{derivative}} of {{a function of}} a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is {{the slope of the}} tangent line to the graph of the function at that point.

500|$|Bem, in {{a defense}} of his {{hypothesis}} published {{in the same issue}} of Psychological Review, wrote that in their path analysis Bell et al. engaged in [...] "an unfortunate dichotomization of <b>the</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>variable,</b> sexual orientation ... grouping the bisexual and homosexual respondents into the same category." [...] In his view, while this procedure [...] "might have seemed reasonable on a priori grounds ... it should have been abandoned as soon as the researchers saw the results of their own subanalyses, which {{made it clear that the}} bisexual respondents were not only very different from their exclusively homosexual counterparts but actually were more like the heterosexual respondents in theoretically critical ways."

[...] "reduced many of the correlations and increased the likelihood that important antecedent variables would be erroneously eliminated during the recursive process of discarding the weaker correlates from successive iterations of the path model." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{considered}} their sample of homosexual adults more representative than {{those used in}} previous studies, and argued {{that the fact that}} they examined blacks separately from whites, and men separately from women, helped them {{to determine the extent to}} which patterns of homosexual and heterosexual development depend on race and sex. They wrote that while Bell, a psychologist and therapist, was [...] "relatively supportive of psychodynamic theory", Weinberg and Hammersmith were sociologists with a different theoretical perspective. They argued that their varying outlooks counteracted any bias due to their respective backgrounds. Bell et al. did not believe that completing their study earlier would have altered their findings. Believing that familiarity with scientific theories about homosexuality might bias their respondents′ answers, Bell et al. did not report results that could be explained through exposure to books, articles or scientific lectures about homosexuality. They used path analysis, a statistical technique originally developed for use in the biological sciences, to try to establish which factors were most important. Path analysis required dividing [...] "the independent variables into sequential stages, according to the time when their influences are most likely to occur."
