5|$|A pilot episode for {{the series}} was made in 2004. It was {{animated}} by Tin House, Inc., written by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and directed by Dave Filoni. Mitchel Musso voiced Aang in <b>this</b> <b>pilot</b> but was later replaced by Zach Tyler Eisen when the show began production. In the episode, Sokka and his sister Kya (Katara was named Kya {{at the time of}} the pilot) must travel the world to find masters for Aang, who is the Avatar; however, they must evade a critical foe, Prince Zuko of the Fire Nation, who wants to capture Aang.|$|E

5|$|On December 15, 2002, ABC aired Nancy Drew, {{starring}} Maggie Lawson {{and produced}} by Lawrence Bender. The movie {{was intended to}} be a pilot for a possible weekly series, which saw Nancy and her friends going off to college in a modern setting. Like the 1930s films, <b>this</b> <b>pilot</b> also took a more mature turn. The pilot aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney series, with additional scripts being ordered and production contingent on the movie's reception. The series was passed at ABC, and UPN also passed following Lawson being cast on another series.|$|E
5|$|One {{third of}} the council is elected each year, {{followed}} by one year without elections. At the 2008 election, for example, there were 70 candidates contesting 20 seats. In 2007, turnout at the polling stations ranged from 26% in Orton Longueville to 55% in Central ward. At the previous election, voters were required to provide a signature before being issued with a ballot paper. <b>This</b> <b>pilot</b> scheme trialled new procedures which are now included in the Electoral Administration Act 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} making an {{animated}} adaptation of Valérian dates back to at least 1976. In 1982, Mézières produced concept art for an episode titled The Asteroids of Shimballil (Les Astéroïdes de Shimballil) which was later published in 2000 as an appendix to the album release of Bad Dreams. In 1991, Dargaud Films financed {{the production of a}} three-minute pilot, directed by Bernard Deyriès and animated by Studio 32 in Paris and Luxembourg, but nothing came of this venture. Several stills from <b>this</b> <b>pilot</b> episode were published in Mézières Extras. Another pilot, directed by Florient Ferrier, was made by the French animation studio 2 Minutes in 2001. Nothing came of this attempt either.|$|E

Some local private firms such as Google and Adobe Systems have also deployed charging infrastructure.

5|$|The programme's pilot {{episode was}} {{recorded}} on 16 April 2007 {{and was the}} entitled The Professor of Curiosity. The guests for this episode were Alastair Fothergill, Victoria Finlay and Simon Munnery. <b>This</b> <b>pilot,</b> recorded at the Rutherford Room at the institute of Physics, has not been broadcast. The first series was recorded at the Pleasance Theatre in Islington and, since then, the show has been recorded at the BBC Radio Theatre, with occasional recordings at other venues, such as the Shaw Theatre and RADA Studios (formerly The Drill Hall), all in London. The series was created by Lloyd, Richard Turner and Dan Schreiber. Turner and Schreiber also produce the show. The show's researchers are James Harkin, Xander Cansell (for series one), Molly Oldfield (from series two onward) and Stevyn Colgan (Series 5 onward).|$|E

5000|$|Central {{vision is}} {{relatively}} {{weak in the}} dark (scotopic vision) since cone cells lack sensitivity at low light levels. Rod cells, which are concentrated further away from the fovea, operate better than cone cells in low light. This makes peripheral vision useful for detecting faint light sources at night (like faint stars). Because of <b>this,</b> <b>pilots</b> are taught to use peripheral vision to scan for aircraft at night.|$|R
500|$|According to {{the test}} pilots, the Heinkel He 50 had a better {{acceleration}} rate, and could climb away from the target area much more quickly, avoiding enemy ground and air defences. Richthofen stated that any maximum speed below [...] was unacceptable for those reasons. Pilots also complained that navigation and powerplant instruments were mixed together, and were not easy to read, especially in combat. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>pilots</b> praised the aircraft's handling qualities and strong airframe.|$|R

50|$|The airport {{previously}} had a VOR/DME located on station, {{but it had}} been looted the previous July. Because of <b>this</b> <b>pilots</b> had to use the NDB located 5 km west {{in order to get a}} general fix of the area, and had to keep descending until they could make visual contact with the airfield in inclement weather. As a result, the frequency of aborted landings had increased over the rainy season. The runway lights had also been looted, but were reportedly replaced and illuminated at the time.|$|R
40|$|To {{ensure the}} highest levels of safety each flight crewmember must {{carefully}} monitor the aircraft’s flight path and systems, as well as actively cross-check the actions of each other. 1 Effective crew monitoring and cross-checking can literally be the last line of defense; when a crewmember can catch an error or unsafe act, this detection may break the chain of events leading to an accident scenario. Conversely, when this layer of defense is absent the error may go undetected, leading to adverse safety consequences. Following a fatal controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) approach and landing accident (ALA) involving a corporate turbo-prop the surviving pilot (who was the Pilot Not Flying) told {{one of the authors of}} this paper, “If I had been watching the instruments I could have prevented the accident. ” <b>This</b> <b>pilot’s</b> poignant statement is quite telling; in essence, he is stating that if he had better monitored the flight instruments he could have detected the aircraft’s descent below the minimum descent altitude (MDA) before it struck terrain. <b>This</b> <b>pilot’s</b> statement is eerily similar to a conclusion reached by the U. S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) after an airliner descended through the MDA and impacted terrain during a nighttime instrument approach. “If the First Officer had monitored the approac...|$|R
