40|$|In a {{modified}} version of the Gravity Model, appropriate dummy variables have been introduced to analyze the effects of both trade creation and trade diversion by the three economic organizations of the EEC (European Economic Community), the LAFTA (Latin American Free Trade Association) and the CMEA (Council of Mutual Economic Assistance), for the period 1960 to 1990, with five year intervals the subject of measurement. Using a similar approach, the situation of non-aligned trade by Japan is analyzed, with particular interest in the effects of such activities by these three institutions upon their trade with Japan, and Japanese commerce in general. The subsequent results show that these economic institutions display the effects on the amount of trade which occurs within their respective organizations, or intra-union trade, while at the same time expanding their volume of <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries,</b> despite being commercial activity taking place outside their respective unions...|$|E
40|$|Changes {{in trade}} policy affect a nation’s {{economic}} welfare through terms-of-trade and volume-of-trade effects. A move to global free trade would imply higher world economic welfare {{equal to the}} sum of all nations ’ volume-of-trade, or efficiency, effects. Since the sum of the terms-of-trade effects across all nations is zero, terms-of-trade effects are contentious. Konishi, Kowalczyk, and Sjöström (2003) have shown that if customs unions do not affect <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries,</b> immediate global free could be achieved if free trade were proposed together with international sidepayments equal to the terms of trade effects. How large would these terms of trade effects, and hence transfers, be? This paper presents estimates from a simple computable general equilibrium model of a world economy of perfect competition. We show 2 that, in some cases, terms-of-trade effects are small compared to efficiency gains, and transfers are not necessary for free trade. In other cases, terms-of-trade gains may account for more than 50 % of a country’s gains from free trade and transfers could be large. (168 words) 3...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} three issues. First, it investigates {{the impact of}} {{fluctuations}} in international trade competitiveness on employment in the UK manufacturing sector over the period 1999 to 2010. We find statistically significant effects of a shock to international trade competitiveness {{on the level of}} employment. We suggest that the adjustment process in employment mainly works through job creation. We also find that compared to large firms, small firms contribute more towards job creation than job destruction. Our results show that changes in GDP growth rate and average wages are significantly related to employment, suggesting that the UK labor market responds significantly to market forces. Finally, we find that the effect of changes in the real exchange rate on both job creation and job destruction differs for exporting and non-exporting firms. Second, the thesis empirically examines the impact the financial dependence, specifically during the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis, on the UK exports using monthly data over the period January 2002 to September 2011. We find that the UK exports are highly sensitive to the fluctuations in the cost of capital. The UK tends to export relatively less in the sectors which depend more on external finance than the sectors which are less dependent of external finance. These effects became stronger during the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis. We also find that adverse credit conditions affect both the supply and demand sides of exports and {{play a significant role in}} determining the supply and demand for UK exports. We find that along with the financial conditions in the trading partners, the volume of GDP and capital labor ratios of the importing countries are the main factors in determining the demand for the UK exports, whereas the supply of the UK exports is driven by financial conditions, GDP and the capital-labor ratio of the UK. The third issue examined in the thesis is the impact of the 4 th and 5 th extensions in European Union (EU) on the trade flows of member and non-member countries. Specifically, the thesis tests whether 4 th and 5 th extensions EU causes trade diversion or trade creation. Moreover, we test that whether the trade creation and trade diversion effects of these extensions are same across the extensions and across the new members joining in these two extensions. Applying the correctly specified fixed effect gravity model on the data of imports and exports of the EU countries spanning from 1988 to 2008, our results show that in most of commodity groups, the EU boosts trade among member countries at the cost of lowering the <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> However, the increase in trade with member countries is more than the decrease in the <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Moreover, we found that trade creation and trade effects vary across the extensions in the EU, across the commodity groups and across the members joining the EU in 4 th and 5 th extensions of the EU. ...|$|E

40|$|At {{the same}} time as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have been {{encouraging}} trade liberalized, there has been a proliferation of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs). These RTAs also aim to reduce trade barriers, but they do so it in a preferential way. There is continued debate as to whether such RTAs are an effective way of achieving free trade, or if increased trade among members causes less <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries?</b> If RTAs increase total trade, this is known as [`]trade creation&# 039;, whereas if the extra trade occurs at the expense of non-members, this is called [`]trade diversion&# 039;. Trade creation implies improved welfare, whereas [`]trade diversion&# 039; may adversely affect welfare. This paper examines five different RTAs using a gravity model to see if they have been trade creating or trade diverting. Annual data from 26 countries covering five RTAs in the Asia and Pacific region for the years 1980 - 2000 was used. The results show that the effects of the different RTAs varied remarkably. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Australian and New Zealand Closer Economic Relations (CER) fostered greater trade with trading partners and with the rest of the world. While the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) tended to be trade diverting, that is, they expanded intra-bloc trade at the expense of trade with others...|$|E
40|$|Following {{closely the}} {{analytical}} approach adopted by Head and Mayer (2004) and Novy (2010), this paper derives a micro-founded bilateral trade cost measure for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{as a function}} of observable domestic and inter-national trade data. The derived measure of trade cost by Novy (2010), consistent with the Ricardian and heterogeneous firm's models of trade, enables us to track changes in trade costs in SSA over time. This is a significant contribution to the trade cost literature in SSA because measures of many components of trade frictions in SSA have been unreliable. Based on bilateral trade data from BACI and production figures from the Trade, Production and Protection database by Nicita and Olarreaga (2007) for the period 1980 - 2003, our estimates of the tariff equivalent bilateral trade costs measure indicate that on average trade costs in SSA are relatively higher than other regions, confirming evidence which indicates trading costs in SSA to be the highest within the global trading system. The estimates indicate that SSA countries traded with each other at a lower cost than they did with other regions {{with the exception of the}} EU. Within SSA, member countries of economic blocs traded at relatively lower costs than <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries.</b> Using each of the main five economic blocs within SSA as a reference, overall average relative bilateral trade costs within bloc was significantly lower than across blocs. This paper therefore argues for increased efforts at regional integration within SSA to derive benefits from lower trade costs...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{modified}} gravity model, {{this study examines}} whether the free trade areas of NAFTA, ANZCER and ASEAN would result in trade creation among the member countries and trade diversion with the non-member countries. Further, it applies Linder's income similarity concept to explain the trade patterns in the developed and developing countries within these free trade areas. First, {{the results suggest that}} the implementations of the free trade areas have facilitated higher trade among the member countries, particularly the ANZCER and ASEAN countries. However, among all three free trade areas, the formation of the ANZCER free trade area has resulted in trade diversion with non-member countries, whereas that of the ASEAN free trade area has resulted in a trade increase with non-member countries. Surprisingly, the formation of the NAFTA free trade area has no significant effect on <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> as their trade flows remain quite low even before its implementation. Second, the result indicates that the trade-enhancing effect of income similarity is confirmed for the developing rather than developed member countries. The developing member countries with similar incomes would trade extensively more with each other. This result can be partly explained by Hanink's income threshold concept, which argues that the income similarity effect is only applicable to developed countries with very small difference in incomes. Given the heterogeneous country sample in this study, the substantial income differences among the developed member countries would probably account for the lack of income similarity effect in these countries.

40|$|Many {{countries}} of the Western Hemisphere {{in recent years have}} shown interest in participating in preferential trading arrangements (PTA) in anticipation of expanding exports. Results in this paper show that export expansion depends upon the type of agreement that is formed and who else is participating. Trade of two agricultural commodities are examined; wheat, and fruit and vegetable juices. Five~As are examinedeactrincludingtheunited States and one or more ‘Western Hemisphere countries. Recently the United States {{and a number of other}} Western Hemisphere countries have shown interest in participating in preferential trade agreements (PTA). 1 A PTA would reduce or remove tariff and nontariff barriers to trade between the {{countries of}} the PTA, but each country’s barriers to <b>trade</b> <b>with</b> <b>non-member</b> <b>countries</b> would remain unchanged.

In the hub-and-spoke model, one country, presumably the United States, could have separate bilateral free-trade agreements with each of the participating countries (Wonnacott).

The model is structured as a three-stage game in which union members select common external tariffs that yield utility outcomes that are Pareto optimal and dominate the stand-alone alternative. Numerical examples are use to demonstrate the wide range {{in the nature of}} these outcomes.
