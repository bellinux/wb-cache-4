There is some {{evidence}} that it dates back hundreds of years into the British Empire, and originally stood for [...] "British Regiment Attached Traveler". However, acronyms are a product of the 20th century and all attempts to trace this theory have failed to find a legitimate source. [...] There have been American military brats dating back 200 years to the birth of the United States. Military spouses and their children have been following armies for thousands of years, perhaps for as long as there has been organized warfare. [...] The term [...] "Little Traveller", used to describe the <b>travelling</b> <b>child</b> of a soldier (following his or her father's army from place to place), also appears in literature as early as 1811.|$|E

He joined the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in 1985 {{and worked in}} Sydney, Newcastle, Canberra and Los Angeles covering such areas as family law, international drug trafficking and people smuggling. He established the AFP's Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team in 2003, which addresses crimes of transnational sexual exploitation and <b>travelling</b> <b>child</b> sex offenders. From here he took the position of Chair of the Interpol Expert working Group on trafficking in Women and Children, becoming an international expert in this field. He went on to work as the National Surveillance Coordinator, Coordinator of Transnational Crime Intelligence and in 2006 gained promotion to Commander, {{in his capacity as}} Manager Criminal Intelligence Collection.

His work within this role was praised by the Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O'Connor who echoed and endorsed comments made by the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste His Excellency Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão. O'Connor said [...] "Praise from the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste His Excellency Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão today, is testament to Commander Edwards’ professionalism and the dedication that he has brought to the role.

40|$|Child {{sex tourism}} {{is a growing}} problem and a {{relatively}} new challenge for the Dutch national police, which is faced {{with the task of}} combatting child sexual abuse by Dutch citizens abroad. Little is known about <b>travelling</b> <b>child</b> sex offenders. In this literature review, information from (international) scientific research, Dutch policy reports, and other documents is analyzed to investigate the characteristics, motives and techniques (modus operandi) of (Dutch) child sex tourists. We conclude that this offender group is not homogeneous, and that different motivations (preferential/situational) and modus operandi (short stay/long stay/online) apply. The diversity of the offender group requires a variety of initiatives which are well-adjusted to the different offender types. The scarcity of research on this topic furthermore illustrates the necessity to gather more intelligence and conduct follow-up research...|$|E
