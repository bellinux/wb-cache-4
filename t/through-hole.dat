The process can be performed using CMOS-compatible standard semiconductor technologies and permits clear reduction in production throughput times compared with known processes, thus lowering production costs. In the process according to the invention, the individual component layers are processed separately from each other in different substrates and are then joined together. First <b>through-holes</b> are opened on the front of a finished top substrate, said <b>through-holes</b> penetrating all existing component layers. Then a handling substrate is applied and the top substrate is thinned from the rear up to the <b>through-holes.</b> A finished bottom substrate is then joined to the top substrate. After removing the handling substrate, the <b>through-holes</b> are extended through the remaining layers up to a metallization plane of the bottom substrate and the electrical contact is made between the top and bottom substrates...|$|R

25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional <b>through-hole</b> printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to present analysis techniques that quantify the scattering of angle-beam ultrasonic waves from <b>through-holes</b> in plates. This topic is of interest because increased understanding of the scattering of ultrasonic waves by a defect {{is important for the}} development of many nondestructive evaluation (NDE) applications. Angle-beam techniques are commonly used in industry to detect and characterize defects, and many structures of concern have plate-like components. Scattering from <b>through-holes</b> is particularly important because cracks tend to form around fastener holes, which have high stress concentrations. In addition, varying boundary conditions within a fastener hole can change {{over the course of a}} structure’s lifetime and may have significant effects on NDE results. In this research, two signal processing techniques are developed to obtain scattering information from <b>through-holes</b> for a variety of fill conditions, including epoxy and complete and partial filling with metal inserts, using experimentally acquired wavefield measurements. Experimental procedures for acquiring wavefields, which measure the out of plane motion of ultrasonic waves on the surface of a specimen and allow for the visualization and characterization of propagating waves, are presented. Methods for obtaining radial and directional energy maps, which quantify scattering as a function of scattered angle and phase velocity, are described. In addition, baseline subtraction is used to obtain scattering patterns for both methods, which quantify scattering as a function of polar angle for each wave mode present in the wavefield. These techniques are applied to wavefield measurements from <b>through-holes</b> with various fill conditions to investigate the effects of boundary conditions on ultrasonic scattering. A comparison of the radial and directional energy mapping techniques, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, is provided, and recommendations are made for future work. M. S...|$|R

25|$|Originally, every {{electronic}} component had wire leads, and the PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The components' leads were then {{passed through the}} holes and soldered to the PCB trace. This method of assembly is called <b>through-hole</b> construction. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the United States Army Signal Corps developed the Auto-Sembly process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and dip soldered. The patent they obtained in 1956 {{was assigned to the}} U.S. Army. With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a wave-soldering machine. However, the wires and holes are wasteful since drilling holes is expensive and the protruding wires are merely cut off.|$|E

[...] Horizontal installation of <b>through-hole</b> parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be soldered either manually or by a wave soldering machine.|$|E

40|$|As the {{performance}} of digital electronic components improves, maintaining the integrity of high-frequency signals through circuit boards becomes increasingly challenging. The dimensions and material parameters of in-plane circuit board features, such as striplines, microstrips and co-planar waveguides are tuned to control signal impedance. Conventional multi-layer vertical interconnects, which connect between board layers, are not impedance matched to the in-plane signal traces. Multi-connection vias, developed in this thesis, provide a method for matching the impedance of vertical and in-plane features by forming co-cylindrical waveguides. Solutions from a high-frequency full-wave solver provide insight into field interactions within multi-connection vias; and results from these simulations and signal integrity experiments indicate impedance "tuneability" by adjusting the multi-connection via dimensions. The results also suggest that features can be impedance-matched independent of via diameter. Multi-connection vias are formed by creating distinct conductor paths within cylindrical plated <b>through-holes.</b> The thesis explores several alternative manufacturing methods for fabricating these features. A specialized broaching machine and carbide-insert broaches were used to manufacture multi-connection vias for signal integrity experiments. Models of the broach tool and cutting force simulations resulted in several iterations of the broach design. (cont.) Broaching multi-connection vias is challenging due to the small diameters and high aspect ratios of plated <b>through-holes,</b> {{as well as the}} unique copper-epoxy/resin material. Since the broaching process prefers larger plated <b>through-holes</b> to permit larger broach tools, a new method was developed to analyze the cumulative connection density of multi-connection via arrays. Multi-connection vias provide fertile ground for the development of corollary electronic products. Simulations for connector launches indicate that via impedance control can extend to board-mounted devices and connectors. Products that may benefit from multi-connection vias include by-pass capatrs, IC packages, test probes and pogo pins. The thesis presents a road map for commercializing multi-connection vias.
