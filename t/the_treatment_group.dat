25|$|Autologous hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) {{is based on the}} assumption that autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient's blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient's white blood cells are destroyed with cyclophosphamide and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then the stored blood is returned to the patient's bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system which will not attack the body. The results of a phase 3 trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients with heart disease, and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive. Another trial, the Stem Cell Transplant vs. Cyclophosphamide (SCOT) trial, is ongoing.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze and compare the results obtained after 2 types of treatment, surgical and conservative, for acute patellar dislocations. Methods: We divided 33 patients with acute patellar dislocations into 2 groups. One group with 16 patients underwent conservative treatment (immobilization and subsequent physiotherapy), and the other group with 17 patients underwent surgical treatment. A radiographic examination was performed in the evaluation of the patients to verify predisposing factors for patellofemoral instability, and the Kujala questionnaire was applied with the intention of analyzing the improvement of pain and quality of life. The chi(2) test, t test, and Fisher test were used in the statistical evaluation. A significance level of P<. 05 was adopted. Results: The groups were considered parametric in relation to age and sex. <b>The</b> conservative <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> exhibited a higher number of recurrent dislocations (8 patients) than <b>the</b> surgical <b>treatment</b> <b>group,</b> which did not have any relapses.

2500|$|Mentalization based treatment, {{developed}} by Peter Fonagy and Antony Bateman, {{rests on the}} assumption that people with BPD have a disturbance of attachment due to problems in the early childhood parent-child relationship. [...] Fonagy and Bateman hypothesize that inadequate parental mirroring and attunement in early childhood lead to a deficit in mentalization, [...] "the capacity to think about mental states as separate from, yet potentially causing actions"; in other words the capacity to intuitively understand the thoughts, intentions and motivations of others, and the connections between one's own thoughts, feelings and actions. Mentalization failure is thought to underlie BPD patients' problems with impulse control, mood instability and difficulties sustaining intimate relationships. Mentalization based treatment aims to develop patients' self-regulation capacity through a psychodynamically informed multi-modal treatment program that incorporates group psychotherapy and individual psychotherapy in a therapeutic community, partial hospitalization or outpatient context. In a randomized controlled trial, a group of BPD patients received 18 months of intensive partial-hospitalization MBT followed by 18 months of group psychotherapy, and were followed up over five years. <b>The</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>group</b> showed significant benefits across a range of measures including number of suicide attempts, reduced time in hospital and reduced use of medication.|$|E
