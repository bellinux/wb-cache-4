5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful.

This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E

5|$|At one tour date in England, the {{tensions}} {{came to a}} head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over his recent despondence, leading to a band meeting where Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment {{to the rest of the}} group. After some discussion, the band agreed that <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band. Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when they played a show at the Granada Theater in Lawrence, Kansas to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, Live! @ The Granada Theater.|$|E
5|$|In Greek folklore, vampirism {{could occur}} through various means: being excommunicated, desecrating a {{religious}} day, committing a great crime, or dying alone. Other causes included having a cat jump across one's grave, eating meat from a sheep {{killed by a}} wolf, and being cursed. Vrykolakas were usually thought to be indistinguishable from living people, giving rise to many folk tales with this theme. Crosses and antidoron (blessed bread) from the church were used as wards in different places. To prevent vampires from rising from the dead, <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> were pierced with iron nails while resting in their graves, or their bodies burned and the ashes scattered. Because the Church opposed burning people who had received the myron of chrismation in the baptism ritual, cremation was considered a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK'in P'ol caught Mirones and his {{soldiers}} off guard and unarmed {{in the church}} at Sakalum and slaughtered them. Spanish reinforcements led by Juan Bernardo Casanova arrived too late; the Spanish soldiers had been sacrificed, hanged and beheaded, with their corpses burned and impaled on stakes {{at the entrance to}} the village; Mirones and the Franciscan priest had been bound to the church posts and then sacrificed with <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> cut out. A number of local Maya men and women had also been hanged but not decapitated, and the attackers had burned the town.|$|E

5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E

To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows {{him that there}} have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days, who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing that several of the victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} sought to {{replicate}} previous findings on the discrepancy between Type A's self-reporting of stress and their physiological arousal. An attempt was also made to clarify whether this discrepancy was due to A's inability to detect <b>their</b> <b>heart</b> rate changes, or simply due to their "attentional style". Twenty-eight A's and twenty-eight B's were selected from 200 male Introductory Psychology students {{on the basis of}} extreme scores on the Jenkins Activity Survey (JAS). After a 5 -minute rest period, subjects were asked to estimate <b>their</b> <b>heart</b> rates, after which they were given feedback. Two minutes later, they were again asked to estimate <b>their</b> <b>heart</b> rates. The subsequent session was the limit period where the subjects were presented with taperecorded string of digits of increasing length until they reached their own limit. Subjects then performed a digit recall task twice: under instructions to concentrate hard on the task to maximize performance or to focus on <b>their</b> <b>heart</b> rate during the task performance. The order of these two instructions was randomly assigned to each subject. Upon completion of each task, the subjects estimated <b>their</b> <b>heart</b> rates during the digit recall. They also completed the anxiety scale from the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL) and a self-report questionnaire. Actual heart rate was recorded throughout the experimental session. The results indicated that A*s manifested greater heart rate increases than B's during the task, but no differences were noted in their anxiety scores on the MAACL, thus, replicating the previous reported discrepancy. Contrary to expectation. Type A subjects were found to significantly over-estimate <b>their</b> <b>heart</b> rates, compared to Type B's, both at rest and during the task performance. Feedback significantly improved Type A's accuracy of <b>their</b> <b>heart</b> rate estimation, although attention-directing instructions had no effect in either A's or B's. The findings of the present study are difficult to reconcile with the suggestion that A's do not report higher stress because they under-estimate their level of physiological arousal...|$|R
5|$|Once on {{the lake}} the Itza {{overturned}} some of the canoes and killed some of Díaz's men; others were wounded and dragged ashore to be killed. Díaz, the Dominicans and two other men were in a large canoe that was not overturned and were taken to Nojpetén where a fierce struggle ensued as Díaz attempted to defend himself with his sword, killing several Itzas. The two other men were immediately killed while the friars were beaten and tied to X-shaped crosses before having <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> cut out. Across the lake, the Itza attacked the porters guarding the expedition supplies and killed all of them. The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers. The remains of the small group that were killed on Nojpetén were later retrieved by the Spanish {{after the fall of}} the city and were taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala for burial.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. Once in a while, the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find a way in. Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness in <b>their</b> <b>hearts,</b> which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and new kinds of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E
5|$|Once a room is {{cleared of}} monsters, {{it will remain}} clear, {{allowing}} the player to re-trace {{their way through the}} level, though once they move onto the next level, they cannot return. Along the way, the player can collect money to buy power-ups from shopkeepers, keys to unlock special treasure rooms, and new weapons and power-ups to strengthen their chances against the enemies. The player's health is tracked by a number of hearts; if the character loses all <b>their</b> <b>hearts,</b> the game ends in permadeath and the player must start over from a freshly-generated dungeon. Each floor of the dungeon includes a boss which the player must defeat before continuing to the next level. On the sixth of eight floors, the player fights Isaac's mother; after defeating her, Isaac crawls into her womb. Later levels are significantly harder, culminating in a fight against the heart of Isaac's mother on the eighth floor. An optional ninth floor, Sheol contains the boss Satan. Winning the game with certain characters or by certain conditions unlocks new power-ups that might appear in the dungeon or the ability to use one of the other characters. The game tracks the various power-ups that the player has found over time which can be reviewed from the game's menus.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish party {{retreated from}} the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were {{surrounded}} by about 2,000 Itza warriors who attempted to disarm them; the Itzas managed to seize another Spaniard and immediately struck off his head. At this point about 10,000 Itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate. A Christian Maya musketeer and six other Indians fled {{at the start of}} the battle and took news to García that the entire expedition had been slaughtered; Zubiaur and the survivors of his expedition marched back into the base camp at Chuntuki two days later. Ursúa later reported that the Spanish prisoners were taken back to Nojpetén where they were all killed; this was also confirmed by AjChan at a later date. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the final assault on Nojpetén in 1697; AjK'in Kan Ek', the Itza high priest, later reported that he had bound San Buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes and cut out <b>their</b> <b>hearts.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1622, {{governor}} of Yucatán Diego de Cardenas ordered captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano {{to launch an}} assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. The expedition first camped at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, {{where there was a}} lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts. When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek', asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital, {{but as soon as the}} Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals. The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods, with <b>their</b> <b>hearts</b> cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around the town. After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others. The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernardino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They escaped to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and returned to Mirones with the news.|$|E
