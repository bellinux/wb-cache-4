5|$|The couple {{moved into}} a very basic ground-floor {{apartment}} in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given {{how hard it was}} to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ₤6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years.

A major problem with <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather. They were removed as useless in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915, {{after several}} {{occasions}} when the British had to temporarily dismount regiments and send them into the front lines, an establishment for the Dismounted Cavalry Division was created. The three British cavalry divisions each formed a dismounted cavalry brigade, with the 1st Brigade being raised from the 1st Division, and so on. The cavalry brigades formed a dismounted cavalry battalion, numbered after their parent brigades, so the 9th Cavalry Brigade formed the 9th Dismounted Battalion, for example. The cavalry regiments each formed one dismounted company and a machine gun section for their battalion. However, the Dismounted Cavalry Division, with only three brigades, was smaller than an infantry division, which had four brigades. This disadvantage was felt throughout the formation, with the dismounted cavalry brigade only having three battalions instead of the four in an infantry formation, and the dismounted cavalry battalion only having three, albeit larger, companies as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> an infantry battalion. There was one other divisional-sized formation raised in 1916 that contained British cavalry regiments. This was the Imperial Cavalry Division, which served in the campaign in Mesopotamia. This was another British Indian Army division, and like all Indian divisions, it had one British regiment per brigade.|$|E

5|$|Hunter {{began to}} achieve limited success after {{a trip to}} the Etaples art colony in {{northern}} France in 1914. Here, inspired by French art and the local landscape, he began to develop the style and ability that would later identify him as a colourist. However, the onset of the First World War forced him to return to Scotland, where his work became noticed by Alexander Reid of Reid & Lefevre. In 1915, Hunter held his first one-man exhibition with Reid in Glasgow. Hunter's work at this stage of his career focused primarily on still lifes, inspired by Chardin, Kalf and Manet. During the 1920s, Hunter began to be associated with a group of three other artists: John Duncan Fergusson, F. C. B. Cadell, and Samuel Peploe. <b>The</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> them became known as the Scottish Colourists, although the term was not used until 1948, by which time only Fergusson was still alive.|$|E

More men then arrive, led by X, who intimidates the Lone Gunmen. Byers confronts X, asking him about his actions and mentioning the supposed cover-up of the John F. Kennedy assassination.

5|$|To {{prove his}} innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get {{in contact with}} the other three actors, and <b>the</b> <b>four</b> <b>of</b> them were interviewed for an Italian {{television}} show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.|$|E
