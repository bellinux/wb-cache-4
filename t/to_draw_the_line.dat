As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty over this maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of delimitation {{with respect to the}} territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, the US Eighth Army {{issued an}} {{operational}} directive to all UN ground forces in Korea for their planned withdrawal {{east of the}} Naktong River. UN units would then establish main defensive positions behind {{what was to be}} called the Pusan Perimeter. The intent was <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> on retreating and hold off the Korean People's Army while the U.S. Army built up its forces and launch a counteroffensive. The US 25th Infantry Division held the southernmost flank at Masan, while the 24th Infantry Division withdrew to Koch'ang. The 1st Cavalry Division withdrew to Waegwan. US forces demolished all bridges over the Naktong River in the retreat. At one bridge in the 1st Cavalry Division sector, the division commander attempted several times to clear refugees from the bridge but they continued to cross it despite warnings and several attempts to clear the bridge. Eventually the commander was forced to demolish the bridge, taking several hundred refugees with it.|$|E

This resulted in the ceasing of Turkish Cypriot participation in the government, and following more intercommunal violence in 1964, a number of Turkish Cypriots moved to the Turkish quarter of Nicosia, causing serious overcrowding.|$|E
25|$|A muzzle gag {{works in}} a similar way as an over-the-mouth gag, only that they are usually made of leather, are {{fastened}} around the head with buckles and straps, and cover {{the lower part of the}} face. It is so called because it resembles a muzzle used on animals, with a flexible pad which straps over the mouth, and sometimes also around the cheeks and chin. Muzzle gags have a strong psychological effect on some people, because of the association of being restrained in a way generally associated with animals. Restricting movement of the jaw and covering the cheeks can both increase the efficiency of a gag. It is difficult <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between a muzzle gag and a head harness with an attached gag.|$|E

500|$|Hand's {{democratic}} {{respect for}} legislation {{meant that he}} hardly ever struck down a law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators {{know what they are}} doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, Hand set himself to interpret the legislative intent. Sometimes, however, he was obliged <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between federal and state laws, as in United States v. Schechter Poultry. In this important case, he ruled that a New Deal law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: [...] "It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where {{it is part of a}} comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole. With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do..." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Phillips {{said that}} the appeal raised the [...] "narrow issue" [...] of whether [...] "the act of {{preparing}} a joint witness statement is one in respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit", and the broader issue of whether [...] "public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence {{in relation to the}} performance of his duties in that capacity." [...] He said that it was surprising that the immunity had simply been accepted in the past and never challenged. He noted that the immunity dated back to Cutler v Dixon in 1585, over 400 years ago, before English tort law developed the modern law of negligence. It was originally a complete protection for witnesses against claims for defamation, before developing to cover protection from other tort claims. [...] He noted that it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at present between expert assistance that was immune from claim and that which was not: it might be that the earlier advice was negligent, not the evidence given in court resiling from that earlier advice, even if it was the later developments about which the client complained.|$|E

500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, but we have <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... because sometimes you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E
500|$|The {{doctrine}} of wrongful delegation is sometimes {{said to be}} a reflection of the Latin maxim delegatus non potest delegare (a delegate cannot appoint another), which means that a body to which or person to whom power was delegated by Parliament cannot further delegate the power to another. Academics have submitted that the maxim does not state a rule of law, but is [...] "at most a rule of construction" [...] and in applying it to a statute [...] "there, of course must be a consideration of the language of the whole enactment and of its purposes and objects". Thus, in reality, there is no such principle as delegatus non potest delegare; the maxim plays no real part in the decision of cases but is sometimes used as a convenient label. Consequently, in most cases the courts have adopted such a construction as will best accord with the facts of modern governmental agencies. For statutory powers, the important question is whether it is intended that a power conferred upon A may be exercised on A's authority by B. The maxim is merely the pencil with which the court is able <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> between authorized and unauthorized sub-delegation, and the courts must then ask whether statutory discretion remains {{in the hands of the}} proper authority, or whether some other person purports to exercise it. Thus where an Act said that an inspector of nuisances [...] "may procure any sample" [...] of goods for analysis, it was held that the inspector might validly send his assistant to buy a sample of coffee, as he had in no way authorized his assistant to exercise the discretion legally reposed in himself. Ultimately, the courts must decide the issue based on what Parliament has authorized according to what may be summarized as the language, scope and objects of the empowering statute.|$|E
500|$|Lord Hope {{disagreed}} with the principles and analogies relied upon by the majority. [...] Of the principle that [...] "where there is a wrong {{there must be a}} remedy", he said that the policy decision to protect witnesses from litigation had been taken some time ago, without anything being said to cast doubt on the policy choice. [...] He also asked how the rule could be altered to allow negligence claims but not defamation claims, since if there was a well-founded defamation claim barred by witness immunity then a wrong would have been done without remedy in that instance. He said that advocates and experts performed different functions and so it could not be assumed that the fact that advocates' immunity had been removed without difficulty would mean that immunity could be removed from experts without any problems. [...] He was more impressed with the difficulties about where <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> if the claim was allowed to proceed than the argument {{that there would be a}} [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the availability of witnesses, wondering what the impact would be for experts involved in criminal proceedings or family cases involving children. He wondered whether a company director, owing a duty of care to the company, would face removal of the immunity if making an [...] "inexcusable error" [...] when giving evidence on the company's behalf. [...] Overall, he considered that the matter was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission. He furthermore noted that the decision in Watson remained binding in Scots law, in preference to the decision in Jones (since Jones only concerned the law of England and Wales), adding that the issue ought also to be considered by the Scottish Law Commission.|$|E
