5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of biblical inerrancy seems inherently improbable, for two reasons. Firstly, the Scriptures contain what {{seem to be}} evident errors and contradictions (although great ingenuity {{has been applied to}} explain these away). Secondly, the books of the Old and New Testaments did not gain their place within the [...] "canon", or list of approved books, {{as soon as they were}} written. The Old Testament canon was not closed until late in the Apostolic age, and the New Testament canon was <b>not</b> <b>finally</b> <b>closed</b> until the fourth century. If all the Bible's contents were inerrant, one would have thought that this would have become apparent within a much shorter period.|$|R

50|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, {{construction}} of new commercial buildings {{came to a stop}} as the economy declined. With changing manufacturing practices, many textile companies in New England closed or relocated to the South, where non-union workers could be hired for less money. Nashua Manufacturing Company did <b>not</b> move, and <b>finally</b> <b>closed</b> in 1948.|$|R
500|$|The {{completion}} of the Brighton Main Line from London to Brighton in 1841 encouraged high-density housing development on the hill west of London Road. Between this area and the railway line and station stood Brighton's steam locomotive works and {{the lower part of}} the station goods yard. The first locomotive was produced here in 1852. By 1896, the works employed more than 2,200 people in the manufacture and maintenance of locomotives for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. The works and its associated buildings were situated on an artificial plateau dug into the side of the chalk slopes, with the railway line on top, the works at a lower level and the lower goods yard beneath, [...] below track level. (The works had been extended on a pier across the lower goods yard at one point.) Production lasted until 1957, after which the buildings survived for some time before being cleared in 1966 to make way for the largest car park on what was then British Rail's Southern Region. The lower goods yard section towards Trafalgar Street was no longer used by British Rail after the early 1970s, although it did <b>not</b> <b>finally</b> <b>close</b> until 1980. Part of the land was incorporated into the car park, and the rest saw a mixture of uncoordinated uses, such as small office blocks and used car dealerships. Many of the houses adjoining the goods yard were demolished in 1962 and 1968, and some tower blocks were built nearby. Further north, a large multi-storey car park was built in 1976 close to St Bartholomew's Church.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to ascertain the exact date of the editing of Genesis Rabba. It was probably undertaken not much later than the Jerusalem Talmud (4th to 5th centuries). But even then the text was probably <b>not</b> <b>finally</b> <b>closed,</b> for longer or shorter passages could always be added, the number of prefatory passages to a section be increased, and those existing be enlarged by accretion. Thus, beginning with the Torah portion Vayishlach, extensive passages are found that bear the marks of the later haggadah, and have points of connection with the Tanhuma homilies. The passages were probably added at an early date, since they are not entirely missing in the older manuscripts, which are free from many other additions and glosses that {{are found in the}} present editions. In the concluding chapters, Genesis Rabba seems to have remained defective. In the sections of the Torah portion Vayigash, the comment is no longer carried out verse by verse; the last section of this Torah portion, as well as the first of the Torah portion Vayechi, is probably drawn from Tanhuma homilies. The comment to the whole 48th chapter of Genesis is missing in all the manuscripts (with one exception), and to verses 1-14 in the editions. The remaining portion of this Torah portion, the comment on Jacob's blessing (...) is found in all the manuscripts — with the above-mentioned exceptions — in a revision showing later additions, a revision that was also used by the compiler of the Tanhuma Midrash edited by Solomon Buber.|$|R
40|$|Each big river, {{including}} the Danube, makes a single system from their spring to their delta or estuary. Wherever we intervene into the system, {{this will be}} necessarily affect the whole of that. Thespillover effects are especially striking {{in the case of}} the lower reaches, in the Danube River in the Delta area. The utilisation of the hydroelectric power of the Danube River has been continuously on the agenda in the Hungarian areas since the turn of the 19 th and 20 th centuries, as an economic, planning, development and thenpolitical and environmental issue. The plans made before the World War I featured hydroelectric plants as the carriers of technical and scientific progress. World War I and the subsequent changes of the state borders swept these plans aside. Between the two world wars, the planning of hydroelectric power stations on the Danube wascontinued within the new state borders, two Hungarian governments and prime ministers of the time were fully committed to the construction of three power plants on the Danube River. After World War II, the hydroelectric plant planned on the Hungarian-Czechoslovakian border and its construction became a basic economic and, from the 1980 s, an environmental issue. Finally, only a part of the planned hydroelectric power plant system was constructed, and the issue was <b>not</b> <b>finally</b> <b>closed</b> by specific interpretation of the international law. The Danube Strategy of the European Union, the programmes until 2020, the increase of the role of renewable anergies, the nuclear disaster in Japan, and the interests of international navigation filled the debate with new content. Thepossibility of the construction of hydroelectric power plants on the Danube River was “accidentally” put among the official documents of the government in power since 2010. The government declared it had nothing to do with the plans, and the debate has been going on since then...|$|R
