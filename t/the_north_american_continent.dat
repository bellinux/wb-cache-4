5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent</b> was pushed against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, {{creating}} a subduction zone. A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline was pushed to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E
5|$|Representations of America as {{a female}} Native American, or Indian princess, dated back to the 16thcentury; cartographers would place a native woman, often wearing a {{feathered}} headdress, upon their version of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent.</b> This evolved into an image of an Indian queen, then an Indian princess, and although Columbia eventually came to be the favored female embodiment of the United States, {{the image of the}} Indian princess survives in the popular view of such figures as Pocahontas and Sacagawea.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} of Siletzia against <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent</b> approximately 50 {{million years}} ago (contemporaneous with the initiation of the bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain) was a major tectonic event associated with a reorganization of the earth's tectonic plates. This {{is believed to have}} a caused a shift in the subduction zone, termination of the Laramide orogeny that was uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and major changes in tectonic and volcanic activity across much of western North America.|$|E
50|$|Cittaslow {{was founded}} in Italy in October 1999, {{following}} a meeting organised by the mayor of Greve in Chianti, Tuscany. A 54-point charter was developed, encouraging high quality local food and drink, general conviviality and the opposition to cultural standardisation. In 2001, 28 Italian towns were signed up to the pledge, certified by trained operatives of Cittaslow. It expanded broadly beyond Italy and, by 2006, national Cittaslow networks existed in Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom. By mid-2009, fourteen countries {{had at least one}} officially accredited Cittaslow community.

5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique being on the track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to insulate the ice and equipment designed to allow the cars to be loaded. In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent.</b>|$|E
5|$|The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument {{lies within}} the Blue Mountains physiographic province, which {{originated}} {{during the late}} Jurassic and early Cretaceous, about 118 to 93million years ago. Northeastern Oregon was assembled in large blocks (exotic terranes) of Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic rock shifted by tectonic forces and accreted to {{what was then the}} western edge of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent,</b> near the Idaho border. By the beginning of the Cenozoic era, 66million years ago, the Blue Mountains province was uplifting (that is, was being pushed higher by tectonic forces), and the Pacific Ocean shoreline, formerly near Idaho, had shifted to the west.|$|E
5|$|The Metacomet Ridge is {{the result}} of {{continental}} rifting processes that took place 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The basalt (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge {{is the product of a}} series of massive lava flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent</b> from Eurasia and Africa. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric rift valley which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

50|$|During the Proterozoic {{a series}} of terranes were accreted onto <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> craton, forming <b>the</b> Piedmont of the central Appalachians. Following the Grenville orogeny, {{mountains}} eroded, and the sediments from this erosion were deposited below the mountains.

5|$|The NCVP is {{underlain}} by {{four large}} crustal fragments, namely Stikinia, Yukon-Tanana, Cassiar and Cache Creek. Stikinia comprises volcanic, plutonic and sedimentary rocks that {{were created in}} an island arc environment during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. Mélange and abyssal peridotites, formed largely in an ancient oceanic basin, are the primary rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. These are also Paleozoic to Mesozoic in age and are intersected by younger granitic intrusions. Yukon-Tanana and Cassiar consist of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks derived from <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent.</b> The rocks of these two terranes are displaced and autochthonous in nature.|$|E
5|$|This crisis had {{its roots}} in the Great Powers' {{competition}} for colonies in the last decades of the 19th century. The German Empire, invigorated by its victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War and by its unification under the Prussian monarchy, had newfound imperial ambitions that stretched beyond Europe. It had shared in the division of Africa, and in the 1880s looked to the Pacific as well. Ships of its Imperial Navy were sent to Apia in Samoa, where German agents had fomented rebellion against the indigenous government. They were countered there by the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy. The United States had nearly completed establishing control over its territories on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent,</b> leading American ambitions to stretch beyond its shores. The squadron was at Samoa to assert US interests in the Pacific and to watch the Germans.|$|E
5|$|When the North American Plate on its slow journey westwards {{encountered}} the Pacific Plate approximately 250 {{million years ago}} during the Paleozoic, the latter began to subduct under <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent.</b> Intense pressure underground caused some of the Pacific Plate to melt, and the resulting upwelling magma pushed up and hardened into the granite batholith that makes up much of the Sierra Nevada. Extensive layers of marine sedimentary rock that originally made up the ancient Pacific seabed were also pushed up by the rising granite, and the ancestral Merced River formed on this layer of rock. Over millions of years, the Merced cut a deep canyon through the softer sedimentary rock, eventually hitting the hard granite beneath. The encounter with this resilient rock layer caused the Merced River to mostly stop its downcutting, although tributary streams continued to widen the ancient canyon.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes colonised <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent</b> in two waves: {{during or}} before the Illinoian glaciation, {{and during the}} Wisconsinan glaciation. Gene mapping {{demonstrates}} that red foxes in North America have been isolated from their Old World counterparts for over 400,000 years, thus raising the possibility that speciation has occurred, and that the previous binomial name of Vulpes fulva may be valid. In the far north, red fox fossils {{have been found in}} Sangamonian deposits in the Fairbanks District and Medicine Hat. Fossils dating from the Wisconsian are present in 25 sites in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming. Although they ranged far south during the Wisconsinan, the onset of warm conditions shrank their range toward the north, and have only recently reclaimed their former American ranges because of human-induced environmental changes. Genetic testing indicates two distinct red fox refugia exist in North America, which have been separated since the Wisconsinan. The northern (or boreal) refugium occurs in Alaska and western Canada, and consists of the large subspecies V.v.alascensis, V.v.abietorum, V.v.regalis, and V.v.rubricosa. The southern (or montane) refugium occurs in the subalpine parklands and alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada. It encompasses the subspecies V.v.macroura, V.v.cascadensis, and V.v.necator. The latter clade has been separated from all other red fox populations since the last glacial maximum, and may possess unique ecological or physiological adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The American Revolutionary War was a {{war between}} the nation of England and the 13 colonies in <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>continent.</b> This war lasted from 1775 to 1783 and began with the Battle of Bunker Hill, where over 1,150 British {{soldiers}} were killed or wounded. This equated to {{almost half of the}} entire British army that were present at the engagement. American casualties were far less severe, totaling an estimated at 450 killed and wounded. The British, however, were able to take the ground and push the newly formed Continental Army back to the city of Boston, which also soon fell to British forces. Before the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April, 1775, saw British troops begin their assault into the American colonies. British troops were searching for colonist supply depots, however, were met by heavy resistance and the British forces were turned around at Concord by outnumbering Minutemen forces. On July 4, 1776 the Declaration of Independence was signed by the Second Continental Congress and officially declared the colonies of North America to be a sovereign nation, free from England’s rule. Also, the Congress permitted funding for a Continental Army, which is the first instance of an American political body handling military affairs. The British were dominating {{in the beginning of the}} war, holding off Continental regulars and militia and gaining vast amounts of territory throughout North America. However, the tide began to turn for the colonists in 1777 with their first major victory over British forces at the Battle of Saratoga. Victory for the rest of the war pushed back and forth between the British and colonists, but the alliance with France in 1778 by the American colonists leveled the playing field and aided in the final push for the defeat of the British Army and Navy. In 1781, American and French forces were able to trap the escaping southern British Army at Yorktown, thus ending the major fighting of the Revolution. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, and recognized the American colonies as an independent nation. The newly formed United States would undergo numerous transitions to becoming one of the top economic and military powers in the world.|$|E
