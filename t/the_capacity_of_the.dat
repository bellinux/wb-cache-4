5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground.

5|$|Anfield {{was built}} in 1884 on land {{adjacent}} to Stanley Park.

5|$|However, {{by then it}} {{had become}} clear that Frogner west of Solli plass would remain dominantly a {{residential}} area. The estimates showed that the station would capture few new riders and instead simply give a shorter walk for {{a small minority of}} those who used Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station. With the upgraded Nationaltheatret Station, which opened in 1999, <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oslo Tunnel increased from 16 to 24 trains per hour in each direction, because the station from then had four, rather than two, tracks. A similar upgrade would need to be done for Elisenberg Station, should it be taken into use, or <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tunnel would again be reduced. It is therefore highly unlikely that the station will ever be opened. In 1998, the readers of the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten proposed making Elisenberg an emergency exit.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, as the Interstate Highway System was being built {{throughout}} the United States, east–west travel through western Maryland was difficult, as US40, the predecessor to I-68, was a two-lane country road with steep grades and hairpin turns. In Cumberland, the traffic situation was particularly problematic, as {{the usage of}} US40 exceeded <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's narrow streets. Traffic following US40 through Cumberland entered through the Cumberland Narrows and followed Henderson Avenue to Baltimore Avenue. After the construction of I-68, this route through Cumberland became US40 Alternate (US40 Alt.).|$|E
