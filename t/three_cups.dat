500|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 17th century, Taunton had two dissenting places of worship: [...] "Paul's Meeting" [...] and the Baptist Meeting.

After Mayor Timewell sacked both Paul's Meeting and the Baptist Meeting in 1683, the dissenters were driven to worship in private houses on the {{outskirts}} of Taunton, where their assemblies were regularly raided by the Justices. Paul's Meeting survived attempts to turn it into a workhouse and, with the coming of William III and Mary II, followed by the Toleration Act 1688, was reopened.

500|$|F-Zero X {{has five}} {{different}} gameplay modes: GP (Grand Prix) Race, Practice, Time Attack, Death Race, and VS Battle. In GP Race, the player races against 29 opponents through 3 laps of each track in a cup. Players get {{a certain number}} of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed, and the winner of the cup is the character who receives the most total points. If the player has a [...] "spare machine"—the equivalent of an extra life—then falls off a track or runs out of energy, the race can be restarted. Each cup has four selectable difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Expert, and Master. The higher the difficulty level selected, the tougher the opponents, and less spare machines the player starts with. Furthermore, the <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> initially available are ordered by increasing difficulty (Jack, Queen and King respectively) and have 6 tracks each. Eventually, the player can unlock the Joker Cup with its set of 6 tracks, followed by the X Cup. The X Cup is a set of 6 randomly generated tracks every time played. The randomized track elements lack loops and can be simplistic, but others are intricate.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} a parody on the {{disaster}} film genre, {{which has been}} parodied in previous South Park episodes, like [...] "Pandemic", the twelfth season parody of the film Cloverfield. [...] "Pee" [...] included a particularly large number of references to 2012, a science fiction film {{about the end of}} the world as predicted by the Mayan calendar, which was released only days before [...] "Pee" [...] was originally broadcast. The episode parodies many common elements of such disaster films, including scientists struggling to figure out the source of the problem. The destruction of rides and park amenities by the tsunami of urine is a reference to the destruction of historical monuments in 2012, and other such disaster films by Roland Emmerich, the director of, White House Down, 2012, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow. [...] "Pee" [...] also includes several references to the 2012 phenomenon, the prediction that cataclysmic events would occur in the year 2012, which is said to be the end of the Mayan Long Count calendar. The scene in which Kyle is forced to drink <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> of urine in order to prevent his body from enduring the effects of fluid pressure before swimming down to drain it all out, is a parody of a scene in the 1989 film The Abyss, where the protagonist inhales a liquid breathing medium before venturing into the ocean depths.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario Kart has two single-player modes, Mario Kart GP (which {{stands for}} Grand Prix) and Time Trial. In Mario Kart GP, one player is {{required}} to race against seven computer-controlled characters {{in a series of}} five races which are called cups. Initially there are <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> available – the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup and Star Cup – at two difficulty levels, 50cc and 100cc. By winning all three of the cups at the 100cc level, a fourth cup – the Special Cup – is unlocked. Winning all four cups at 100cc unlocks a new difficulty level, 150cc. Each cup consists of five five-lap races, each taking place on a distinct track. In order to continue through a cup, a position of fourth or higher must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in fifth to eighth position, they are [...] "ranked out" [...] and the race must be replayed – at the cost of one of a limited number of lives – until a placing of fourth or above is achieved. If the player has no lives when they rank out, the game is over. Points are accrued by finishing in the top four positions in a race; first to fourth place receive nine, six, three and one points. If a player finished in the same position three times in a row, then an extra life is awarded. The racer with the highest number of points after all five races have been completed wins the cup. In time trial mode, players race against the clock through the same tracks that are present in Mario Kart GP mode, attempting to set the fastest time possible.|$|E

It was followed by two shouts [...] "Ei!" [...] (Glory") and [...] "O!"

2500|$|Nintendo World Report's Daniel Bloodworth {{thought the}} Grand Prix mode, {{which should be}} the focus of the game, is [...] "woefully lacking". Bloodworth criticized track length of the first 3 cups; he clocked-in at [...] per lap and {{finished}} <b>three</b> <b>cups</b> within 20 minutes on standard difficulty. He concluded [...] "combined with the low difficulty and re-used environments and music, it all ends up feeling rather unsatisfying." [...] While the fourth cup is more difficult, Bloodworth was taken back by its sudden spike in difficulty—even when playing every cup on Expert or Master. Also, many of its courses were rehashes from the first F-Zero game and GP Legend. During Siliconera's playtest, they praised Climaxs track design and varying levels of difficulty between courses—easier courses are relatively straight compared to later ones which require honed drifting skill. They mentioned the game demanded players to have quick reflexes and master the track layout on difficulties beyond novice since the AI-controlled opponents are unforgivable. Siliconera noted players have to be proficient at both types of speed boosting. Bloodworth explained a properly timed double speed boost can substantially alter the momentum of a race. Compared to GP Legends controls, Siliconera thought the spin attack [...] "is a neat trick to use, that adds a new element to the game." [...] Bloodworth liked the personalized button configurations, especially since vehicles feel stiffer and the game does not allow players to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed.|$|E
