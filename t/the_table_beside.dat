5|$|The {{portrait}} {{depicts the}} tensions and manoeuvrings of 16th century court politics. The deep red background and heavy brushstrokes establish an anxious and tense atmosphere, and the uneasy {{relationship between the}} Pope and his suitors. The pope is old, ill and tired and, to some critics' eyes, glares at Ottavio in an accusatory manner. His hat or camauro cloaks his baldness, but there are tell-tale signs of age in his long nose, dark beady eyes, stooped shoulders and long uneven beard. He is noticeably older than in the second Naples portrait of 1543. This fact {{is reinforced by the}} clock placed on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, which serves both as a memento mori and a reminder that time is running out. Given this, the presence of his grandsons indicates that the commission was prompted by thoughts of succession.|$|E
25|$|Bull and Fox {{captured}} Spillman with no incident, {{and placed}} him {{in the custody of}} several miners while the two continued to search for the others. Locating them in a large tent used as a saloon, Bull stepped inside with a double barrel shotgun, and demanded both men throw up their hands and surrender. Arnett immediately grabbed his pistol laying on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, at which point Bull shot him with one blast from his shotgun in the chest, killing him instantly. Jermagin surrendered, and he and Spillman were tried the next morning in a makeshift court. Jermagin was able to successfully argue that he played no part in the horse theft. However, Spillman was convicted and sentenced to hang. The next morning he was executed.|$|E

[...] John replied with various rebuffs including 'don't bother, don't bother'.|$|E

5000|$|In Estonian, {{the ending}} -l {{is added to}} the genitive case, e.g. laud (table) - laual (on <b>the</b> <b>table).</b> <b>Besides</b> <b>the</b> meaning [...] "on", this case is also used to {{indicate}} ownership.

60|$|After {{waiting a}} few minutes, {{the company of}} {{passengers}} took their seats at <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>Besides</b> <b>the</b> plates for the guests, there was a row of dishes extending {{up and down the}} middle of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> containing apples, pears, oranges, nuts, raisins, little cakes, and bon-bons of various kinds. There were also in this row two vases containing flowers.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, yes; I {{have been}} to Miss Lapidoth's, {{to ask her to}} come and sing for us," [...] said Gwendolen, laying her gloves on <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her, and looking down at them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Mister Gascoyne," [...] {{began the}} seaman, sitting {{down on the}} edge of <b>the</b> small <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> <b>the</b> low pallet, and raising the lantern a little, while he gazed earnestly into the prisoner's face, [...] "I've reason to believe--" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{we went in}} to breakfast. On <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>beside</b> my plate, {{was lying}} a letter from Cynthia.|$|E

60|$|The {{officer who}} {{was sitting at the}} head of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> made room <b>beside</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|She was {{instantly}} gone, on which Mrs. Brook had more attention for her son. This, after an instant, {{as she approached}} the sofa and raised her eyes from <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> it, came straight out. [...] "Where {{in the world is}} that five-pound note?" ...|$|R
60|$|She sits on {{the edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He sits <b>beside</b> her, and puts his arm wearily round her waist.|$|R

60|$|Having said this, he {{took his}} hat, which lay on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> my palette. Once more {{he looked at the}} portrait.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush," [...] {{she said}} almost sternly, {{and then moved}} very quietly away from the bed. Deringham came in and leaned upon <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> her.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} {{that in the early}} times of the republic they were used as a mnemonic tool and a framework by the decemviri in the drafting of <b>the</b> XII <b>Tables.</b> <b>Besides</b> they acted as an intermediary stage between the mores and <b>the</b> XII <b>Tables,</b> answering <b>the</b> requirements of a society that was no longer satisfied with the revelations of the Pontifex Maximus.|$|R
60|$|She {{ascended the}} tower noiselessly. On raising her head above the {{hatchway}} she beheld Swithin bending over a scroll of paper which lay on <b>the</b> little <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him. <b>The</b> small lantern that illuminated it showed also {{that he was}} warmly {{wrapped up in a}} coat and thick cap, behind him standing the telescope on its frame.|$|R

60|$|He pushed {{some papers}} off <b>the</b> long <b>table</b> <b>beside</b> him, and Maxwell {{sat down to}} his task. It was not difficult. The {{material}} was really of kindred character throughout. He had merely to write a few prefatory sentences, in the editorial attitude, to his report, and then append the editorial, with certain changes, again. It did not take him long; {{in half an hour}} he handed the result to Ricker.|$|R
6000|$|He began sorting and {{overlooking}} the papers, muttering half audibly the while, as he transferred each bundle {{from his own}} side of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to that <b>beside</b> which Lady Sue was sitting: ...|$|R

60|$|That done, Crispin bade the lad unbuckle {{and remove}} the parson's belt. Next he ordered that man of texts to be seated upon their only chair, and with that same belt he {{commanded}} Kenneth to strap him to it. When at length the Puritan was safely bound, Crispin lowered his rapier, and seated himself upon <b>the</b> <b>table</b> edge <b>beside</b> him.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{working table}} (1959) was {{designed}} {{as part of a}} flexible working environment.
