5|$|The {{position}} of Balaur {{relative to other}} bird-like dinosaurs and early birds {{has been difficult to}} determine.

A 2013 study by Brusatte and colleagues, using a modified version of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>data,</b> found it in an unresolved close relationship with the dromaeosaurids Deinonychus and Adasaurus, with some possible alternative trees suggesting it branched off before the common ancestor of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, while others maintained it as the closest relative of Velociraptor, with Adasaurus as their next closest relative.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>data</b> and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to a heterosexual and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes, pastures, {{cultivated}} land, coastal cliffs, and towns. They thrive when forested {{areas are}} cleared and converted to fields and open areas. Habitats {{with a mix}} of large trees, buildings, and open ground are preferred; open fields are left to the rook, and more wooded areas to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius). Along with other corvids such as the rook, common raven (Corvus corax), and hooded crow (C. cornix), some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks; populations measured in three urban parks in Warsaw show increases from October to December, possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>data</b> from Warsaw, collected from 1977 to 2003, showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four-fold.
