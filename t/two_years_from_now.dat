This paper reviews some of the methods which have been used. We start with the classical Ramsey model of economic growth, which remains a central reference in the current debate, and we study the determinants of the interest rate in that framework. We then adapt the model (and the results) to take into account various concerns, namely (a) the existence of the environment as a distinct, non-producible good, (b) uncertainty on the parameters or on the model (c) intergenerational equity...|$|R

40|$|The {{debate on}} the {{economics}} of climate change is often framed as a choice between two possible scenarios. In a stylized and ultra-simplified situation we can choose {{to live in a}} world where we do nothing now to mitigate climate change, but in the future will have to suffer income losses from the damages of warming—say, a loss in yearly GDP, one or <b>two</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> Or, we can choose {{to live in a world}} where those future income losses are avoided, but at the expense of taking costly action starting now or very soon, which implies cuts in yearly GDP in the short-run. Naturally, in this second world, mitigation corresponds to future benefits in terms of avoided losses from climate change. But mitigation also has costs in terms of income foregone to pay for those future benefits. This is how cost-benefit analysis of climate change is typically framed. This single world analysis relates to trade-offs in the distribution of income across generations. Why across generations? Because climate change seen from a single world perspective is a very longterm challenge. Emissions of greenhouse gases that drive warming are almost irreversible. Substantial amounts—up to a third—of today’s emissions will stay in the atmosphere for centuries. For example, emissions at the outset of the Industria...|$|R

Irving {{went on to say}} that he believed anti-Semitism will increase all over the world because [...] "the Jews have exploited people with the gas chamber legend" [...] and that [...] "In ten years, Israel will cease to exist and the Jews will have to return to Europe". In his 1991 revised edition of Hitler's War, he had removed all references to death camps and the Holocaust. In a speech given in Hamburg in 1991, Irving stated that in two years time [...] "this myth of mass murders of Jews in the death factories of Auschwitz, Majdanek and Treblinka ... which in fact never took place" [...] will be disproved (Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka were all well established as being extermination camps). Two days later, Irving repeated the same speech in Halle before a group of neo-Nazis, and praised Rudolf Hess as [...] "that great German martyr, Rudolf Hess". At another 1991 speech, this time in Canada, Irving called the Holocaust a [...] "hoax", and again predicted that by 1993 the [...] "hoax" [...] would have been [...] "exposed". In that speech, Irving declared, [...] "Gradually the word is getting around Germany. <b>Two</b> <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> too, the German historians will accept that we are right. They will accept that for fifty years they have believed a lie". During that speech given in October 1991, Irving expressed his contempt and hatred for Holocaust survivors by proclaiming that:Ridicule alone isn't enough, you've got to be tasteless about it. You've got to say things like 'More women died on the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.' Now you think that's tasteless, what about this? I'm forming an association especially dedicated to all these liars, the ones who try and kid people that they were in these concentration camps, it's called the Auschwitz Survivors, Survivors of the Holocaust and Other Liars, 'ASSHOLs'. Can't get more tasteless than that, but you've got to be tasteless because these people deserve our contempt.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{implications}} of indicating the biosphere's self-organization by the trend over time of the net entropic flow from the Earth's surface, the actual physical boundary of virtually all biotic mass. This flow, derived from the radiative surface entropy budget, is approximately inversely related to the surface temperature when the solar incident flux remains constant. In the geophysiological ('gaian') interpretation, biospheric self-organization has increased with the progressive colonization of the continents and evolutionary developments in the land biota, {{as a result of}} surface cooling arising from biotic enhancement of weathering. The key site for this self-organization is at the interface between land and atmosphere, the soil, where carbon is sequestered by its reaction (as carbonic and organic acids) with calcium magnesium silicates. Along with disequilibrium (steady-state) levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the occurrence of differentiated soil is the critical material evidence for biospheric self-organization, whether it be geophysiological or geochemical (ie., purely result of inorganic reactions). The computed equilibrium levels of carbon dioxide and corresponding equilibrium temperatures in the past are dramatically different from the steady-state levels. With future solar luminosity increase, the biospheric capacity for climatic regulation will decrease, leading to the ending of self-organization some <b>two</b> billion <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> The Earth's surface will then approach chemical equilibrium with respect to the carbonate-silicate cycle...|$|R

Adaptation to an online system {{has led to a}} structural change {{in the way in which}} knowledge is disseminated and materials produced, and the application of the so-called Bologna Process (adaptation to the European Higher Education Area, EHEA) has brought with it the need to change certain habits in the way knowledge is disseminated, a new credit transfer system (ECTS) and skills-based training. The Department has taken part in a pilot test project initiated by the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB).

I have developed a scenario-based method that produces lists of legal challenges and helps to analyze them. The method highlights information products and services from commercial entity's viewpoint: other business aspects are paid less attention. Also, some specific characteristics of particular companies cannot be considered in a general method like this. Therefore challenges in legal areas such as tax law or competition law do not appear although in practice they can be relevant. The method is still able to point out numerous relevant legal challenges. The study focuses on the future: the time span is about <b>two</b> to ten <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> The {{focus is on the}} business-to-consumer (B 2 C) market.

40|$|Throughout history, {{societies}} have been predicated on {{ready access to}} sources of drinking water, whether in the cisterns of Masada high above the Dead Sea, the graceful aqueducts carrying water into Rome, or the sacred Aboriginal water holes in Australia’s outback. But access is not enough. The water has to be safe to drink. And this presupposes a deceptively simple question - {{how do we know}} what “safe” water is? In 21 st century America, the answer seems simple - government experts and scientists tell us. We take for granted that our tap water is subject to exacting chemical and biological analyzes. The name of the relevant federal law - The Safe Drinking Water Act - says it all. Yet, in historical terms, the very idea of the need to conduct detailed chemical and biological analyzes, much less even appreciating why we should care about drinking water’s invisible contents, is still stunningly novel. The germ theory of disease has only been around for about 150 years, a recent development compared to the history of human settlement. And, even today, legitimate questions are being asked about our drinking water. Are the standards stringent enough? Does the infrastructure delivering our water meet these standards? How can we be sure we are even regulating the right substances? This article explores how societies through history have answered the timeless question, “Is it safe to drink the water?” Our technical understanding of water safety is more sophisticated than ever before, but a society’s understanding and regulation of drinking water has never been a purely technical matter. While the Safe Drinking Water Act may look dramatically different than the laws and norms relied on by other societies and in other times, they share far more similarities than differences. Norms and values shape our management of safe drinking water just as surely as do chemical assays. The fundamental problem, as we shall see, is that no source of water can ever be safe in completely objective terms, either today or <b>two</b> hundred <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> Because of the universality of this challenge, because safety is an eternally moving target, one can take valuable lessons from the historical record. The article explores how {{societies have}} changed their conception of safe drinking water through time, shifting their behavior, governance and laws as a result, and what this means for us today...|$|R
40|$|Responsibility for {{regulating}} culvert {{installations in}} Maine is spread over several entities. Regulatory decision-making {{rests with the}} Army Corp of Engineers (COE) and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), acting with scientific review from their respective resource agencies. There is significant overlap, but COE and DEP generally coordinate well together so that project applicants are not burdened with duplicative requirements. However, there are gaps in regulatory coverage {{and it is not}} unusual for culvert installations to occur in valuable streams without any sort of oversight. The problem is especially noteworthy with town-owned structures. This has been recognized for some time and new laws (LD 1333 2 ̆ 6 LD 1725) were recently enacted that could have substantially improved stream and fisheries protection. The statute language was somewhat problematic, and careful rulemaking would be needed to make the laws effective. The initial attempt at rule development, based on a bankfull width standard, resulted in failure amid some acrimony between the various stakeholders. At this point, MaineDOT was asked to serve as the primary technical resource in a second attempt at drafting new rules. Months of work were invested, only to be rejected by stakeholders on all sides of the issue after the political sea change in Maine in November 2010. At this point it seems as if everyone is playing a waiting game, hoping that their own side will ultimately prevail in elections <b>two</b> or four <b>years</b> <b>from</b> <b>now.</b> In the short term, there is a strong likelihood that the new laws will be rescinded, returning Maine culvert rules to the status quo ante.

40|$|In a world {{characterized}} by increased global competition, and {{a rapidly changing}} business environment, companies and organization are forced to continuously reevaluate how they work. Since the first systematic studies of manual labor began during the last century, the focus have changed from a strict control of employees toward looser organizations, increased globalization, {{and the emergence of}} HRM-Human Resource Management during the 80 ’s. Research shows that employee compensation can account for as much as 70 - 80 percent of companies cost,but also show that the value of a company’s human capital can significantly affect the market value of the company. Studies also show that managers see non-monetary reward and recognition systems as very effective in reaching eight out of ten organizational objectives. Another problem facing international companies is establishing themselves in cultures vastly different from their own, in regards to organizational as well as national cultures being different. A company that has been highly regarded and are among the most valued companies in the world is General Electric, which established themselves in Sweden and Umeå when Amersham became GE Healthcare n 2004. This background led us to our problem formulation: How does GE Healthcare in Umeå use Reward and Recognition strategies and how do their co-workers perceive these strategies with a focus on motivation and jobsatisfaction? And our purpose: We want to examine potential gaps between evidence and practice on Reward and Recognition Strategies. Furthermore we want to develop and understanding of how co-workers perceive these strategies. We have chosen to use a case study to examine GE Healthcare Umeå, and we have interviewed twelve respondents, both managers, white-collar and blue-collar workers. We are using a hermeneutic stance, and our interviews are semi-structured and qualitative in approach. Furthermore we are using an abductive research process in performing our case study. We have chosen to use a theoretical framework based on soft and hard HRM, reward and recognition strategies, and motivation and job satisfaction. We found that GE is highly focused on individual reward and recognition systems, but that they have to some extent adapted to the Swedish collective working culture. GE Healthcare is still in a transition phase in Umeå, and we found that there are some dissatisfaction primarily amongst blue-collar workers with the new organizational structure and culture. Feedback and communication was seen as {{the most important factor in}} affecting motivation and job satisfaction, and this was seen as lacking, especially amongst blue-collar workers. We think that this will most likely change over time, as GE’s Session C and EMS systems are implemented throughout the organization and the communication has been further developed.
