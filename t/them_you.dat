25|$|I'm {{not saying}} the whole {{audience}} {{gave us a}} standing ovation, but there was this sizable standing ovation there. And I thought: 'This is incredible, because no one's heard this number yet. This {{is the first time}} they're hearing it!' It obviously touched <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> know. And that was at the L.A. Forum, so I knew we were onto something with that one.|$|E
25|$|That we are {{commanded}} to take {{possession of}} the Land which the Almighty, Blessed Be He, gave to our forefathers, to Avraham, to Yitzchak, and to Yaakov; and not to abandon it to other nations, or to leave it desolate, as He said to <b>them,</b> <b>You</b> shall dispossess {{the inhabitants of the}} Land and dwell in it, for I have given the Land to you to possess it, (Numbers, 33:53) and he said, further, To Inherit the Land which I swore to your forefathers, (to give them,) behold, we are commanded with the conquest of the land in every generation.|$|E
25|$|Columbia University Professor John McWhorter {{has pointed}} out that Shakespeare’s {{language}} is no longer entirely ours. Granted, he says, with the help of notes and time to study <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> can work out the sense of some of the obscure dialogue, but not in a theatre {{in a matter of seconds}} while the action speeds by and the actors deliver the lines with all the urgency of the moment then move on. Its time, goes the argument of many scholars, for versions that will do for a contemporary English-speaking public what has been done for much of the world where Shakespeare is performed in the native language of the audience—make every word intelligible.|$|E

"Can't help that," [...] {{the honest}} fellow would reply, gruffly, but not unkindly, turning aside {{to hide his}} emotion; [...] "you've had <b>'em</b> all between <b>you.</b> We don't make <b>'em,</b> <b>you</b> know: <b>you</b> can't have <b>'em</b> if we haven't got <b>'em,</b> can <b>you?</b> Come earlier next time." ...|$|R
25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain <b>them.</b> <b>You</b> also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
25|$|Hua Jin 化劲 ('Transforming Jin') - This is {{considered}} the highest stage of practice. You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in <b>them.</b> <b>You</b> should {{have a lot of experience}} in fighting as you must know that this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in Taijiquan). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E
25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about <b>them.</b> <b>You</b> must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

500|$|Clare Heal in the Sunday Express gave a mixed review, {{saying that}} while she found it amusing, it was too similar to the Internet saying, [...] "The programme's only failing was that on {{occasion}} {{it was a little}} to [...] reminiscent of the real Internet, ie a virtual ocean full of morons willing to shout loudly about things even (or perhaps especially) if they know nothing about <b>them.</b> <b>You</b> wouldn't want more than half an hour of Bigipedia, no matter how amusing it is." ...|$|E

500|$|Cobain has said, [...] "The entire song {{is made up}} of {{contradictory}} ideas [...] It's {{just making}} fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought." [...] Drummer Dave Grohl has stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, [...] "Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has {{a lot to say about}} something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes." ...|$|E
500|$|Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay {{bleeding}} for {{at least}} 17minutes before an ambulance picked up Jamal and Muhammad together, {{but he did not}} film any of it. When Esther Schapira asked why not, he replied: [...] "Because when the ambulance came it closed on <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> know?" [...] When asked why he had not filmed the ambulance arriving and leaving, he replied that he had only one battery. Enderlin reportedly told the Paris Court of Appeal that Abu Rahma changed batteries at that point. Enderlin wrote in 2008 that [...] "footage filmed by a cameraman under fire is not the equivalent of a surveillance camera in a supermarket." [...] Abu Rahma [...] "filmed what circumstances permitted." ...|$|E

500|$|When Lisa, Apu, and the McCartneys {{gather on}} the Kwik-E-Mart roof, Apu tells Lisa, [...] "I learned long ago to {{tolerate}} others rather than forcing my beliefs on <b>them.</b> <b>You</b> know, you can influence people without badgering them always. It's like Paul's song, 'Live and Let Live'." [...] Paul corrects Apu {{and says the}} song's title is actually [...] "Live and Let Die". In the same scene, Apu refers to himself as the [...] "fifth Beatle", and Linda alludes to {{a line in the}} Beatles' 1969 song [...] "Octopus's Garden". The McCartneys later ask Lisa if she would like to hear a song, and Apu sings part of [...] "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", to which the McCartneys snap along.|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but {{he might as well}} withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole turns out to be more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of <b>them...</b> <b>You</b> work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E
500|$|The dragons {{featured}} in the episode's finale were implemented by Bluebolt, UK, the lead VFX agency for the first season. VFX supervisor Angela Barson confirmed that the CGI dragons {{were among the most}} stressful effects, prompting sleepless nights. Commenting on the episode's climactic scene where the hatchling dragons are revealed, actress Emilia Clarke told VH1, [...] "You see the relationship that Dany has with her eggs, and you see that grow and grow and grow and kind of the intuitive connection she has with <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> see that develop really beautifully." [...] Clarke also hinted that she expected to [...] "get to play with some more dragons!" [...] in the second season, based on her conversations with book author and executive producer George R.R. Martin. [...] "VFX Data Wrangler" [...] Naill McEvoy has confirmed that dragon presence will be increasing in season two.|$|E

500|$|Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly {{questioned}} whether Darren could adjust to fatherhood, while What's on TV labelled him a [...] "doting father". Once Nancy became pregnant again Claire Crick of All About Soap said [...] "At last – {{some good news}} in Hollyoaks for once! Our favourite soapy couple, Nancy and Darren, discover they’re going to be parents once again in tonight's episode, and we’ve got our fingers (and toes!) crossed that it works out for them this time". She said that [...] "with Darren's cheeky escapades and Nancy's no-messing attitude, they’ll make the perfect parents and we can’t wait to see them with a little one". Crick {{went on to say}} [...] "while Darren might be dad to twins already (remember <b>them?</b> <b>You</b> could be forgiven for forgetting they even existed – it seems Darren already has!), we think he's got potential to be great daddy material".|$|E
500|$|From then on, Williams {{began to}} work in {{independent}} features, which attracted smaller audiences. [...] "I feel like I haven't been working in a particularly flashy or visible way," [...] she reflected to Vogue magazine. [...] "If you weren't looking for <b>them,</b> <b>you</b> would miss the movies that I've made that I'm proud of." [...] For Me Without You (2001), Williams co-starred with Anna Friel. The movie's reception was split, with review aggregator website, Rotten Tomatoes, assigning it a 66% rating based on 65 reviews. Next was Prozac Nation (2002), starring Christina Ricci {{and based on the}} autobiography of the same name by Elizabeth Wurtzel. It portrayed her struggle with major depression. Asked if her roommate role was interesting to play, Williams said: [...] "I think what it needed to be was helpful. Somebody to stand like this [...] so that she [...] could keep smacking up against it." ...|$|E
500|$|Just {{as little}} is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the {{wilderness}} to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says, [...] "Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent <b>them</b> <b>you,</b> my only son." [...] The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete , featuring the fall, resurrection and his battle with evil. Another vision was that of The Creation of Adam.|$|E
