60|$|He {{passed the}} {{examinations}} necessary {{to reduce his}} military service to a minimum, and his want of any special scientific or <b>technical</b> <b>qualification</b> and a certain precocious corpulence that handicapped his aviation indicated the infantry of the line as his sphere of training. That was the most generalised form of soldiering. The development {{of the theory of}} war had been for some decades but little assisted by any practical experience. What fighting had occurred in recent years, had been fighting in minor or uncivilised states, with peasant or barbaric soldiers and with but a small equipment of modern contrivances, and the great powers of the world were content for the most part to maintain armies that sustained in their broader organisation the traditions of the European wars of thirty and forty years before. There was the infantry arm to which Barnet belonged and which was supposed to fight on foot with a rifle and be the main portion of the army. There were cavalry forces (horse soldiers), having a ratio to the infantry that had been determined by the experiences of the Franco-German war in 1871. There was also artillery, and for some unexplained reason much of this was still drawn by horses; though there were also in all the European armies a small number of motor-guns with wheels so constructed that they could go over broken ground. In addition there were large developments of the engineering arm, concerned with motor transport, motor-bicycle scouting, aviation, and the like.|$|E

50|$|In 1871, {{to enable}} the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, to {{overtake}} its arrears of colonial appeals, an act was passed providing for four paid judgeships, two of which were to be held by judges or ex-judges of the English bench.To none could one of the law officers be appointed.One of these two judgeships was accepted by Sir Montague Smith.The other was offered to and refused by three English judges, and a fourth having intimated that he would refuse it if offered, Lord Hatherley, the Lord Chancellor, thought it unseemly to hawk the appointment about any further.It was imperative that the vacancy should be at once filled, and Collier agreed to relieve the government in this difficulty.To give him the necessary <b>technical</b> <b>qualification,</b> Lord Hatherley in November 1871 appointed him to a vacant puisne judgeship in the Common Pleas.Here he sat a few days only; three judgments of his are, however, reported.Though a writ was made out appointing him a serjeant, it was never executed in open court, nor was he a member of Serjeants' Inn.|$|E
