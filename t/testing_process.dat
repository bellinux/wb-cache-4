40|$|Testing {{is often}} {{considered}} as an expensive and uncontrollable <b>process.</b> <b>Testing</b> takes too much time, {{costs a lot}} more than planned, and offers insufficient conception {{of the quality of the}} <b>test</b> <b>process.</b> Therefore, the quality of the information system and the risks for the business can be difficult to determine. Many organisations realise that improving the <b>test</b> <b>process</b> can solve these problems. However, in practice it turns out to be hard to define what steps to take for improving and controlling the process, and in what order.

This work {{focuses on the}} testing activities in reallife software organisations, identifying the important <b>test</b> <b>process</b> components, observing <b>testing</b> work in practice, and analysing how the organisational <b>test</b> <b>process</b> could be developed. Software professionals from 14 different software organisations were interviewed {{to collect data on}} organisational <b>test</b> <b>process</b> and testing‐related factors. Moreover, additional data on organisational aspects was collected with a survey conducted on 31 organisations. This data was further analysed with the Grounded Theory method to identify the important <b>test</b> <b>process</b> components, and to observe how real‐life test organisations develop their testing activities. The results indicate that the test management at the project level is an important factor; the organisations do have sufficient test resources available, but they are not necessarily applied efficiently. In addition, organisations in general are reactive; they develop their process mainly to correct problems, not to enhance their efficiency or output quality. The results of this study allows organisations to {{have a better understanding of}} the <b>test</b> <b>processes,</b> and develop towards better practices and a culture of preventing problems, not reacting to them...|$|R

500|$|After {{the concept}} was put into the {{pipeline}} for production, General Motors began looking for a partner to develop the Volt's lithium-ion battery pack. The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different battery cell chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world. Due to their more promising cell technologies, two companies were selected in June 2007, Compact Power (CPI), which uses a lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) cell made by its parent company, LG Chemical; and Continental Automotive Systems, which uses lithium iron phosphate based cylindrical cells made by A123Systems. By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack prototypes, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008. General Motors <b>testing</b> <b>process</b> was conducted at the laboratory the carmaker had created for the GM EV1 program.

General Motors also was expecting the battery could withstand 5,000 full discharges without losing more than 10% of its charge capacity. According to GM, , no batteries have been changed due to degradation.|$|E

He has seen many years of service and has survived several battles with the Covenant. Such is his influence that he dominates the Security Committee and can talk down most higher-ranking officers without fear of reprisal. Due to the competition between Ackerson and other departments, most notably Section Three and the SPARTAN-II project, Ackerson harbors a strong resentment toward his opponents and toward the Spartans in particular. He does eventually convince the top members of ONI to approve his SPARTAN-III Program.

500|$|Concept {{development}} on Human Revolution began in early 2007, {{shortly after the}} founding of Eidos Montréal. The team at this point was fairly small, consisting of producer David Anfossi, director Jean-François Dugas, senior designer François Lapikas, and art director Jonathan Jacques-Belletête. The early period was devoted to research before performing brainstorming sessions to create the game's basic concepts. One of the concepts established early on {{was that it would}} be an ambitious project and they needed to bring the key staff on board as early as possible. They started with playing the first two games, determining what they liked and disliked about the original Deus Ex, and how they could carry over or improve these points. An early decision was to remain true to the series' core values, despite Human Revolution being essentially a series reboot. When presenting their project to Eidos management, they presented multiple sheets of their concept, and after two days the game was green-lit. The entire main staff were newcomers to the Deus Ex series, providing a large challenge to the development team as a whole. During the early design process, {{one of the things that}} worked well was the blueprint <b>testing</b> <b>process</b> and cutting items that would either not fit into the game or would make the project too large to handle.

500|$|Testing {{before the}} onset of {{symptoms}} is a life-changing event and a very personal decision. The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions. Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested. Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment. A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result. Irrespective of the result, stress levels {{have been found to be}} lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result. Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected. Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it. In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations. [...] Genetic counseling in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the <b>testing</b> <b>process.</b> Because of the implications of this test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington's.|$|E
