The total cost of fueling PHEV under modeled and real-world <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> is compared to {{the total cost of}} fueling PHEV under constant rates. Time-resolved vehicle en-ergy consumption and fueling cost is derived for a variety of PHEV designs from travel survey data and charging behavior models. A decision treemodel of PHEV consumer choices is proposed with ef-fectiveness and cost metrics defined at each decision point. Results show that gasoline PHEV that charge off-peak incur higher gaso-line costs than PHEV that charge at-will. These additional fueling costs reduce the magnitude of the economic incentives for off-peak charging that <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> can provide to PHEV consumers. These results are then used to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of model and real-world <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> and to discuss implications for modeling PHEV total fueling cost.

40|$|Through the Smart Metering Initiative in the Canadian {{province}} of Ontario, all residential electricity customers will be converted from a tiered rate regime to a time-of-use (TOU) rate regime {{by the year}} 2010. Although <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> {{are designed to be}} cost-neutral for the average consumer, research suggests that <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> may affect consumers differently depending on their socioeconomic characteristics. In an effort to better understand the effects of <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> on lower-income and senior-headed households, a case-study in Milton was conducted between June and December of 2007. The overarching thesis question is: What are the behavioural responses to, and financial impacts of, TOU electricity rates on lower-income and senior-headed households? Nine expert interviews were conducted with Ontario professionals working in government, environmental non-profit groups, citizen advocacy organizations and affordable housing associations in order to provide context for the study. Time-differentiated electricity consumption data were then collected from 199 households from two senior housing complexes and two affordable housing complexes in Milton, Ontario between June and December 2007. A questionnaire was also sent to each household to determine some socio-economic and structural characteristics of the households. The electricity consumption data collected from the four sites suggest that the households would not benefit financially from <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> given electricity consumption behaviour during the period prior to the implementation of <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> in June 2007. Thus, they would have to change their behaviour in order to benefit financially from <b>TOU</b> <b>rates.</b> During this pre-TOU period, Site A, Site B and Site C would have paid more, on average, for their electricity under <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> than on tiered rates ($ 0. 34, $ 0. 61 and $ 0. 15 per week, respectively). While Site D, on average, would have seen no change under <b>TOU</b> <b>rates.</b> A conservation effect was detected by comparing the electricity consumption from billing periods in 2006 to corresponding billing periods in 2007 after the implementation of <b>TOU</b> <b>rates.</b> Site A saw a conservation effect during the first corresponding billing period (35 %); while Site B saw a conservation effect for three corresponding billing periods (21 %, 24 % and 9 %). Site C saw a conservation effect for the first five corresponding billing periods (ranging from 8 % to 21 %), while Site D saw a conservation effect for all corresponding billing periods (ranging from 10 % to 34 %). The presence of a conservation effect at Site D was unexpected, particularly because households at Site D are not responsible for paying their own electricity bills. Although a conservation effect was observed after the implementation of <b>TOU</b> <b>rates,</b> {{the extent to which it}} could be attributed to the implementation of <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> is unclear, and should be investigated further. There was no considerable shift in the proportion of electricity consumed during each of the peak periods during the summer TOU period for Site A and Site D after the introduction of <b>TOU</b> <b>rates.</b> There was, however, a slight reduction in the portion of electricity consumed during the summer TOU period for Site B and Site C (0. 2 % and 0. 1 % per week, respectively). Due to the change in the on-, mid- and off-peak schedule from the summer TOU period to the winter TOU period, the households consume more electricity during the off-peak periods in the winter than they do during the off-peak periods in the summer (even though their patterns of consumption do not change). Similar to the pre-TOU period, during the summer post-TOU period, Site A and Site B, and Site C, on average, paid more for electricity (commodity) under <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> than they would have paid if they had continued on tiered rates ($ 0. 38, $ 0. 51 and $ 0. 16 more per week, respectively), while Site D would have seen no change in their electricity costs. In contrast, during the winter post-TOU period several sites paid less for electricity on <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> than they would have if they had continued on tiered rates. Site B, Site C and Site D paid, on average, $ 0. 78, $ 0. 16 and $ 1. 76 less per week, respectively. Although Site A paid more under on <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> during the winter post-TOU (on average $ 0. 18 more per week), the cost was less than during the summer post-TOU period. The change in costs expressed here does not reflect any reduced costs that may have resulted from conservation. For example, if the households were shown to have a conservation effect, they might have lower electricity costs. Additionally, the changes in costs do not reflect any additional fees or charges that might be attributed to the smart meter installation and the Smart Metering Initiative (e. g., additional fees from Milton Hydro). In conclusion, <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> appear to be ineffective at motivating these lower-income and senior-headed households in Milton, Ontario to shift electricity from on-peak periods to off-peak periods, however, a reduction in electricity usage may be attributed to <b>TOU</b> <b>rates.</b> Further research is required to confirm these effects. It is important to note that some of the lower-income and senior-headed households in this study appeared to see an increase in their electricity bill, particularly during the summer TOU period. Lower-income and senior-headed households are thought to be less able to shift electricity consumption, therefore it is important to develop mechanisms to identify households that are at risk of bill increases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As the {{integrator}} {{of energy}} resources (DERs), a {{virtual power plant}} (VPP) {{would be able to}} control the amount of the power access to the distribution transformers such that energy efficiency can be improved.

This paper aims to maximize the benefit of the supplied powers over the 24 hours under VPP operation. Combining an iterative dynamic programming optimal BESS schedule approach and a PSO-based DR scheme optimization approach, an optimal VPP operational method is proposed to minimize the total electricity cost with respect to the power supply limit of the distribution transformers and the system security constraints, especially, within the peak load hours. With the <b>TOU</b> <b>rate</b> given each hour, test results had confirmed the validity of the proposed method with the obviously decreased power supply in each peak-load hours and the largely reduced electricity cost accordingly...|$|R

LIPA will incorporate lessons learned from this pilot in future deployments, including lessons relating to equipment performance specifications and testing, as well as equipment deployment and tracking issues. LIPA ultimately deployed three AMI technologies instead of the two that were originally contemplated. This enabled LIPA to evaluate multiple systems in field conditions with {{a relatively small number}} of meter installations. LIPA experienced a number of equipment and software issues that it did not anticipate, including issues relating to equipment integration, ability to upgrade firmware and software âover the airâ (as opposed to physically interacting with every meter), and logistical challenges associated with tracking inventory and upgrade status of deployed meters. In addition to evaluating the technology, LIPA also piloted new Time-of-Use (<b>TOU)</b> <b>rates</b> to assess customer acceptance of time-differentiated pricing and to evaluate whether customers would respond by adjusting their activities from peak to non-peak periods. LIPA developed a marketing program to educate customers who received AMI in the pilot areas and to seek voluntary participation in TOU pricing. LIPA also guaranteed participating customers that, for their initial year on the rates, their electricity costs under the TOU rate would not exceed the amount they would have paid under the flat rates they would otherwise enjoy. 62 residential customers chose to participate in the <b>TOU</b> <b>rates,</b> and every one of them saved money during the first year. 61 of them also elected to stay on the TOU rate â without the cost guarantee â at the end of that year. The customer who chose not to continue on the rate was also the one who achieved the greatest savings. However, after the first year, the customer in question installed equipment that would have made <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> a more costly option than the residential flat rate. During the second year, all but one customer saved money. That customer increased usage during peak hours, and as a result saw an increase in annual costs (as compared to the flat rate) of $ 24. 17. The results were less clear for commercial customers, which LIPA attributes to rate design issues that it will take into account for future deployments. LIPA views this pilot as a complete success. Not only is LIPA better prepared for a larger deployment of AMI, but it is confident that residential customers will accept AMI and <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> and shift their energy consumption from peak to non-peak periods in response to pricing. On a larger scale, this will benefit LIPA and all of its customers by potentially lowering peak demand when energy costs are highest...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of new peaking power plants with their {{associated}} auxiliary equipment are installed to meet the growing peak demand every year. However, 10 % utility capacity is used for only 1 %~ 2 % of the hours in a year. Thus, {{to meet the demand}} and supply balance through increasing the infrastructure investments only on the supply side is not economical. Alternatively, demand-side management might cut the cost of maintaining this balance via offering consumers incentives to manage their consumption in response to the price signals. ^ Time-varying electricity rate is a demand-side management scheme. Under the time-varying electricity rate, the electricity price is high during the peak demand periods, while it is low during the off-peak times. Thus, consumers might get the cost benefits through shifting power usages from the high price periods to the low price periods, which leading to reduce the peak power of the grid. ^ The current research works on the price-based demand-side management are primarily focusing on residential and commercial users through optimizing the “shiftable” appliance schedules. A few research works have been done focusing manufacturing facilities. However, residential, commercial and industrial sectors each occupies about one-third of the total electricity consumption. Thus, this thesis investigates the flow shop scheduling problems that reduce electricity costs under time-varying electricity rate. ^ A time-indexed integer programming is proposed to identify the manufacturing schedules that minimize the electricity cost for a single factory with flow shops under time-of-use (<b>TOU)</b> <b>rate.</b> The result shows that a 6. 9 % of electricity cost reduction can be reached by shifting power usage from on-peak period to other periods. ^ However, in the case when a group of factories served by one utility, each factory shifting power usage from on-peak period to off-peak hours independently, which might change the time of peak demand periods. Thus, a TOU pricing combined with inclining block rate (IBR) is proposed to avoid this issue. Two optimization problems are studied to demonstrate this approach. Each factory optimizes manufacturing schedule to minimize its electricity cost: (1) under TOU pricing, and (2) under TOU-IBR pricing. The results show that the electricity cost of each factory is minimized, but the total electricity cost at the 2 nd hour is 6. 25 % beyond the threshold under TOU pricing. It also shows that factories collaborate with each other to minimize the electricity cost, and meanwhile, the power demand at each hour is not larger than the thresholds under TOU-IBR pricing. ^ In contrast to <b>TOU</b> <b>rate,</b> the electricity price cannot be determined in ahead under real-time price (RTP), since it is dependent on the total energy consumption of the grid. Thus, the interactions between electricity market and the manufacturing schedules bring additional challenges. To address this issue, the time-indexed integer programming is developed to identify the manufacturing schedule that has the minimal electricity cost of a factory under the RTP. This approach is demonstrated using a manufacturing facility with flow shops operating during different time periods in a microgrid which also served residential and commercial buildings. The results show that electricity cost reduction can be achieved by 6. 3 %, 10. 8 %, and 24. 8 % for these three time periods, respectively. The total cost saving of manufacturing facility is 15. 1 % over this 24 -hour period. The results also show that although residential and commercial users are under “business-as-usual” situation, their electricity costs can also be changed due to the power demand changing in the manufacturing facilities. ^ Furthermore, multi-manufacturing factories served by one utility are investigated. The manufacturing schedules of a group of manufacturing facilities with flow shops subject to the RTP are optimized to minimize their electricity cost. This problem can be formulated as a centralized optimization problem. Alternatively, this optimization problem can be decomposed into several pieces. A heuristic approach is proposed to optimize the sub-optimization problems in parallel. The result shows that both the individual and total electricity cost of factories are minimized and meanwhile the computation time is reduced compared with the centralized algorithm. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Residential {{microgrid}} has {{the capability}} {{to participate in the}} distribution grid as a very flexible and dynamic component for demand side energy management (energy efficiency, peak-load reduction, and demand response). Various hierarchical (appliance, home, and neighborhood level) advanced control algorithms need to be developed and validated for such residential microgrids. GridLAB-D is the most promising tool for power system modeling of a microgrid. However, it is limited in supporting advanced control algorithm development with debugging support and does not provide a user friendly interface for modeling the structural and behavioral aspects of a residential microgrid.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{framework for}} the economic valuation of current energy storage systems coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems is presented. The solar-with-storage system's operation is optimized for two different rate schedules: (1) Time-of-use (TOU) for residential systems, and (2) Real-time wholesale rates for centralized generators. Nine storage technologies are considered for PV coupling, including six different battery chemistries, hydrogen electrolysis with a fuel cell, compressed air, and pumped-hydro energy storage. In addition, these technologies are assessed in the capacity of enabling a solar energy generator to provide a set service requirement. Concentrating solar thermal power (CSTP) with thermal storage {{is presented as a}} comparison for this final baseload scenario. Some general insights were gained during the analysis of these technologies. It was discovered that there is a minimum power rating threshold for storage systems in a residential TOU market that is required to capture most of the benefits. This is about 1. 5 kW for a 2 kWP residential PV system. It was found that roundtrip efficiency is extremely important for both TOU and real-time markets, but low self-discharge rates are even more critical in real-time rate schedules. It was also estimated that large storage systems for centralized generation would capture the most revenue with a power rating twice that of the storage capacity (2 hours of discharge). However, due to cost limitations, actual optimal ratios were calculated to be about 3 to 7 hours of discharge for operation in a real-time market. None of the current technologies considered are able to economically meet the requirements for a residential <b>TOU</b> <b>rate</b> schedule; and only CSTP with thermal storage, pumped-hydro, and potentially compressed air storage are able to offer value in a centralized real-time market or a baseload scenario. Recommendations for future research and development (R&D) on the various storage technologies are given. For many of the electrochemical batteries, the key focus areas include cycle lifetime as well as energy and power costs. Roundtrip efficiency was identified as the weak-point of hydrogen systems; the energy cost of lithium-ion batteries was found to be prohibitively expensive for energy arbitrage applications; and the balance of system (BOS) and power costs were identified as the main focus areas for the larger pumped-hydro and compressed air storage systems. by Trannon Mosher.

40|$|In May 2007, a Los Angeles Times {{newspaper}} article {{reported that the}} California Solar Initiative (CSI), commonly called the "million solar roofs" program, was being hobbled by a requirement that recipients of the solar PV subsidies go on time-of-use (<b>TOU)</b> <b>rates.</b> <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> charge higher prices for electricity at peak demand times (primarily weekday summer afternoons in California) and lower prices at off-peak times than the more common flat-rate tariff, which imposes the same price for a kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity at all times. The LA Times story reported that orders for solar installations had dropped 78 % since January 1, 2007 when the TOU-mandate went into effect for solar-rebate recipients. By June, California regulators had eliminated the TOU mandate. I examine data from a sample of 274 medium- to high-use residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and Southern California Edison (SCE) {{to see if the}} TOU mandate makes the solar rebate program less attractive financially. Among PG&E customers, I find that the vast majority would be better off on TOU than on a flat rate tariff. For SCE customers, however, the effect of a switch to TOU is {{complicated by the fact that}} SCE's flat rates are tiered (ie, increasing marginal electricity price with greater total level of monthly consumption), but its <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> are not. Thus, even though solar PV production is greatest during TOU peak periods, many customers' value from the system is maximized on a flat-rate tariff. I then examine the overall economics of installing a solar PV system for these customers. The financial return to solar PV depends very much on how retail rates will change over the 20 - 30 year life of the panels, a very difficult path to predict. If inflation-adjusted rates were to remain at current levels, however, I find that a solar PV installation might generate a positive financial return for up to half of PG&E's medium- and high-consumption residential customers, but not for any of the SCE customers, regardless of whether they are on TOU or flat rates. Together, these results suggest that the TOU mandate is unlikely to have been a significant cause of declining demand for solar PV installations. Finally, returning to the claims in the {{newspaper article}} that demand for solar installations declined after January 1, 2007, an examination of California's solar rebate databases indicates that there was a large dropoff in orders early in 2007, but it had already rebounded before public discussion of the repealing the TOU mandate even began...|$|E
40|$|In this report, we analyze PV break-even {{costs for}} U. S. {{residential}} customers. We evaluate some key drivers of grid parity both regionally and over time. We also examine {{the impact of}} moving from flat to time-of-use (<b>TOU)</b> <b>rates,</b> and we evaluate individual components of the break-even cost, including effect of rate structure and various incentives. Finally, we examine how PV markets might evolve on a regional basis considering the sensitivity of the break-even cost to four major drivers: technical performance, financing parameters, electricity prices and rates, and policies. We find that electricity price rather than technical parameters are in general the key drivers of the break-even cost of PV. Additionally, this analysis provides insight about the potential viability of PV markets...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} of the energy efficiency of belt conveyor systems can be achieved at equipment or operation levels. Switching control and variable speed control are proposed in literature to improve energy efficiency of belt conveyors. The current implementations mostly focus on lower level control loops or an individual belt conveyor without operational considerations at the system level. In this paper, an optimal switching control and a variable speed drive (VSD) based optimal control are proposed to improve the energy efficiency of belt conveyor systems at the operational level, where time-of-use (<b>TOU)</b> tariff, ramp <b>rate</b> of belt speed and other system constraints are considered. A coal conveying system in a coal-fired power plant is taken as a case study, where great saving of energy cost is achieved by the two optimal control strategies. Moreover, considerable energy saving resulting from VSD based optimal control is also proved by the case study.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{systematic}} review of various home energy management (HEM) schemes. Employment of home energy management programs will make the electricity consumption smarter and more efficient. Advantages of HEM include, increased savings for consumers as well as utilities, reduced {{peak to average ratio}} (PAR) and peak demand. Where there are numerous applications of smart grid technologies, home energy management is probably the most important one to be addressed. Utilities across the globe have taken various steps for efficient consumption of electricity. New pricing schemes like, Real Time Pricing (RTP), Time of Use (<b>ToU),</b> Inclining Block <b>Rates</b> (IBR), Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) etc, have been proposed for smart grid. Distributed Energy Resources (DER) (local generation) and/or home appliances coordination along with different tariff schemes lead towards efficient consumption of electricity. This work also discusses a HEM systems general architecture and various challenges in implementation of this architecture in smart grid.

40|$|AbstractDomestic demand-side {{response}} (DSR), if widely adopted, {{could help}} make electricity more secure, clean and affordable. However, {{little is known}} about consumer demand for different approaches to achieving DSR. This study aimed to gauge the acceptability of a range of DSR tariffs, and explore factors affecting it. An online between-subjects survey experiment was deployed to a representative sample of bill payers in Great Britain (N= 2002), testing five tariffs including static/dynamic time of use (TOU) pricing (with/without automated response to price changes) and direct load control (DLC) of heating on a below-average flat rate. The tariff permitting limited DLC of heating was significantly (p<. 01) more popular than the TOU tariffs. This was surprising given evidence for concern around loss of control in DLC, and suggests that for many people DLC is acceptable in principle (within tight bounds and with override ability). The option of automated response made dynamic TOU (otherwise the least popular tariff) as acceptable as static TOU. This is important because dynamic TOU offers additional network benefits, while automation can improve duration and reliability of response. The <b>TOU</b> tariffs were <b>rated</b> highly for giving people control over spending on electricity, but other factors were more associated with overall acceptance...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{proposals}} {{to restructure the}} electricity industry in North America may effect the disintegration of a vertically integrated company into several smaller entities, including distribution companies (Discos). We explore whether time-of-use (TOU) pricing or a Hopkinson tariff would be more suitable for a regulated Disco. Focusing on the economic efficiency of these alternative rate structures, we argue that a Hopkinson tariff with demand subscription is superior to <b>TOU</b> <b>rates,</b> as it can better handle the limited load diversity of local transmission and distribution (T&D) demands made upon the contemporary Disco, while finessing the problem of endogenous marginal costs of local T&D capacity.

40|$|Caves et al. (1983) {{recently}} reported that mandatory time-of-use (TOU) pricing for residential customers served by four Illinois electric utilities fails {{to pass the}} cost-benefit test. Gains in economic efficiency are outweighed by the relatively high TOU meter costs. An obvious alternative is to offer a TOU rate option for which customer participation is voluntary (see, for example, Woo et al. [1983, Section D] and Malko and Faruqui [1980, pp. 161 - 62]). The problem of optimal pricing under self-selection has been analyzed by Faulhaber and Panzar (1977), Panzar and Sibley (1978), and Mirman and Sibley (1980). Following these studies, this paper derives the optimal electricity prices when a customer can choose between paying the <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> and the full incremental costs of a TOU meter and remaining on a flat rate schedule. My approach departs from the earlier studies in using the expenditure function to characterize the optimization problem as described by Diamond and McFadden (1974). ...|$|E
40|$|Electric utility {{companies}} curb their system peak power demand through numerous Demand Response (DR) programs, {{such as the}} Time-Of-Use (<b>TOU)</b> <b>rates</b> where the cost of energy is typically much higher during the peak period and lower {{for the rest of}} the time relative to the standard flat rate. Meanwhile, a vertically installed West-facing bifacial PV array is expected to provide an advantage over a conventional South-facing orientation as it receives more sunlight during the period of high energy cost. This article evaluates the performance of a 1 kW bifacial PV array under different orientations while considering two energy rate options provided by the local power provider (a flat fixed rate and a TOU rate). Actual data collected during the 2011 and 2012 summer months, and numerical simulations using typical meteorological year data of the local region suggest that re-orienting the array to face west during the summer period does not result in any significant cost savings...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the implementation of a proposed Energy Hub Management System (EHMS) mathematical model for residential appliances under Time of Use (<b>TOU)</b> based electricity <b>rate</b> structure. The objective is to shift the residential electrical energy consumption during periods of high grid energy demand to low demand periods subject to operational constraints. The customer benefits from reduced daily energy consumption and consequent reduction to its cost with minimal effect on the comfort level. Two scheduling periods are considered simultaneously. The first is a 24 -interval schedule with one-hour time steps for appliances such as a dishwasher, clothes washer and dryer. The second is a 96 -interval schedule with 15 -minute time steps for other appliances such as refrigerator, freezer and water heater. Each appliance has been modeled as a discrete time linear dynamic system and the objective of this thesis is to make these models work in a real world situation by determining realistic estimations of the model parameters and constants. It is vital to properly calculate the mathematical model parameters as they have direct impact on the results. Minor modifications to some domestic appliance models were proposed to make the practical implementation easier. It was found that while some parameters in the mathematical model can be easily calculated based on thermodynamic equations, other parameters are hard to be calculated; therefore, a practical procedure was proposed to measure these parameters. An experiment on a small refrigerator was carried out to validate the refrigerator mathematical model and parameters measurement procedure. The resulting model is a mixed integer linear problem (MILP) and was solved using GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) freeware solver. The performance of GLPK was found to be satisfactory as compared to the commercial solver CPLEX, and was particularly suitable for practical and commercial implementations...|$|R
40|$|As part {{of their}} Demand Side Management programs, {{electric}} utility companies often offer Time of Use (TOU) or other incentive rates to large industrial clients. Such rates offer potential money saving opportunities to industrial clients, {{and the benefits of}} improved load shape to the electric power utility. The evidence indicates, however, that industrial facilities have taken only limited advantage of such opportunities. Even those industrial plants that are on <b>TOU</b> <b>rates</b> tend not to adjust the operating policy of their plant utilities (boilers, turbines, chillers, etc.) in response to varying power costs. The main reason for these missed opportunities is a lack of suitable dispatching programs. A key component of successful DSM programs is dispatching software which should not only be reliable, realistic and robust, but must also be easy to use by plant operations and planning staff. Once such software is in place, continuous benefits can be realized by both the industrial clients and the sponsoring utility. Details of development and deployment of such a program sponsored by Detroit Edison for a local refinery are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Grid parity [...] or {{break-even cost}} [...] for {{photovoltaic}} (PV) technology {{is defined as}} the point where the cost of PV-generated electricity equals the cost of electricity purchased from the grid. Break-even cost is expressed in $/W of an installed system. Achieving break-even cost is a function of many variables. Consequently, break-even costs vary by location and time for a country, such as the United States, with a diverse set of resources, electricity prices, and other variables. In this report, we analyze PV break-even costs for U. S. residential customers. We evaluate some key drivers of grid parity both regionally and over time. We also examine the impact of moving from flat to time-of-use (<b>TOU)</b> <b>rates,</b> and we evaluate individual components of the break-even cost, including effect of rate structure and various incentives.
