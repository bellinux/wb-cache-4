5|$|During the character's {{original}} {{appearance on}} Hollyoaks, {{there was no}} additional information to Sarah's life beforehand. Mike (Tony Hirst) and Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley) struggled to cope with Kathy's pregnancy, as the two were still teenagers at the time, and they discussed putting her up for adoption, although Mike then became attached <b>to</b> <b>Sarah</b> after her birth and the couple decided to keep her when Mike realised {{that he wanted to}} be a father after all.|$|E
5|$|On a Clear Night drew {{mixed reviews}} from critics both in Australia and abroad.

Higgins was nominated for four awards at the 2007 ARIA Music Awards and won 'Best Female Artist'.|$|E
5|$|While married <b>to</b> <b>Sarah</b> Tekarihogen, Jones {{maintained}} {{a relationship with}} Tuhbenahneequay (Sarah Henry), the daughter of Mississauga chief Wahbanosay. Jones had previously hired Wahbanosay as a guide during some of his surveying expeditions in the area, including the surveying of Yonge Street. Their relationship had begun in the mid-1790s, and Jones had previously married Tuhbenahneequay in a Mississauga ceremony. Their first son, John (anglicised as Theyandanegea, written in Ojibwa as Tyenteneged, after Joseph Brant) was born in 1798. Their second son, Peter Jones (Kahkewaquonaby) was born January 1, 1802 to Tuhbenahneequay {{in the area of}} Burlington Heights. Due to Jones' marriage <b>to</b> <b>Sarah</b> Tekarihogen, the task of raising Peter and John was left to Tuhbenahneequay. It was soon after their second son's birth that the relationship between Jones and Tuhbenahneequay ended. Jones wanted the respect of his Christian neighbours, who disapproved of polygamy, and so Jones settled permanently with Sarah Tekarihogen, who had converted to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{considered}} for the fourth series, it would have seen Sarah Jane being captured by an alien, who uses her DNA to impersonate her, and frame her for stealing an important piece of alien merchandise. Sarah would have used her gadgets to fight her clone. This story however, was very similar <b>to</b> <b>Sarah</b> Jane in Prison, so it was scrapped.|$|E

She {{is considered to be}} the moral opposite of Tychus Findlay, acting as a metaphorical angel on Raynor's shoulder, and represents a positive moral influence on Raynor. Originally designed as a male character, Hanson was changed in development to female to act as a love interest for Raynor, albeit limited by Raynor's status as a mercenary and fugitive, and moreover the fact that Raynor is still trying to sort himself out in relation <b>to</b> <b>Sarah</b> Kerrigan.|$|E

5|$|Adam Mort's {{descendants}} {{continued to}} support the chapel and school and remained at Damhouse until 1734 when it was bought by Thomas Sutton. After Sutton's death in 1752 the house was inherited by Thomas Froggatt of Bakewell who contributed to rebuilding the chapel in 1760. Froggatt's descendants owned Damhouse until 1800 when it was leased to tenants, {{one of whom was}} George Ormerod, owner of the Banks Estate in Tyldesley who gave land for its churchyard and church school. In 1839 the house became the property of Captain Adam Durie of Craig Lascar by marriage <b>to</b> <b>Sarah</b> Froggatt. Damhouse was dilapidated when the Duries moved in. Captain Durie gave land to build a school on Church Road. After his death in 1843 his widow, Sarah, married Colonel Malcolm Nugent Ross. The Ross's Arms public house at Higher Green is named in his honour. The Durie's daughter Katharine, who married first, Henry Davenport and second Sir Edward Robert Weatherall, became lady of the manor after her mother's death but the family was in financial difficulties and the house and estate sold in November 1889.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coachesâ€”first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasbergâ€”also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According <b>to</b> <b>Sarah</b> Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E

5000|$|Ruckus tolerates the Dubois, {{largely due}} <b>to</b> <b>Sarah's</b> {{presence}} (Sarah is white).

He doesn't think much of Jazmine due to her half-black status, calling her a [...] "mulatto" [...] in a pejorative manner and a [...] "little half and half."

5|$|Yvonne Strahovski {{is given}} limited screen {{time in the}} episode due <b>to</b> her character, <b>Sarah,</b> being in a coma.

Thus, Chuck and Sarah's wedding vows are given added weight due <b>to</b> <b>Sarah's</b> being said early in the episode, and Chuck's being improvised from Sarah's.|$|R
