5|$|Tesla {{noted the}} hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early {{investigation}} of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated {{in contact with the}} skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} other AJ-2 was {{purchased}} and used as a water bomber before it was purchased in 1970 by Avco Lycoming for use as an engine testbed for the YF102 turbofan. The J33 turbojet had to be reinstalled and the aircraft required almost a year of maintenance {{before it could be}} flown to Avco Lycoming's home airfield at Stratford, Connecticut. The YF102, too fat to fully fit in the bomb bay, was mounted on a retractable mechanism that could be lowered below the aircraft for tests. The testing was conducted from January to July 1972. Another round of testing on the commercial derivative of the F102, the ALF 502, was performed between January 1979 and December 1980. In 1984, routine maintenance discovered several loose rivets on the spar and further examination showed that <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> starting to separate from the spar. This damage was too uneconomical to repair so Avco Lycoming decided to donate the last surviving Savage to the National Museum of Naval Aviation. The AJ-2 was flown to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida on 9 May 1984.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not having}} a sting, the {{porcupine}} ray is capable of injuring humans with its many sharp thorns. It is reportedly bold and tolerant of being approached closely underwater. The tough, thorny skin of this ray, made into a form of leather called shagreen, had many historical uses. In particular, {{it was used to}} cover the hilts of various melee weapons, as its extremely rough texture prevented slippage during battle. For example, the Japanese deemed it the only species whose skin was acceptable for covering sword grips. The Malayans used it to cover shields. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> also used ornamentally, such as by the Chinese, who dyed it and ground down the thorns to yield a mottled pattern. The native inhabitants of Funafuti Atoll used dried portions of the ray's tail as a rasp-like tool.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E
5|$|One of the specimens, AMZ 6698, is {{an adult}} female {{that lived in}} Zürich Zoo. It is {{represented}} by a virtually complete skeleton, but <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> not preserved. According to Schwartz, the skeleton shows signs of osteoporosis and periodontitis (common in zoo animals), but not of other pathologies or abnormalities. The right teeth were removed before Schwartz studied the specimen. Schwartz selected this specimen as the holotype. The other specimen, AMZ-AS 1730, is a subadult male collected in the wild, of which only the skull, including the mandible (lower jaw), was preserved. The dentition includes both permanent and deciduous teeth. Specimens of Pseudopotto are at least superficially similar to pottos, but according to Schwartz, they differ {{in a number of}} traits. Among lorisids, Schwartz saw similarities between the false potto and true pottos as well as angwantibos and slow lorises (Nycticebus). The false potto is comparable in size to the smallest pottos, but falls within their range of metrical variation; small size is also seen in western pottos.|$|E

5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> covered in small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{it is hard}} to {{determine}} the maximum speed of extinct sea creatures. For plesiosaurs, this is made more difficult by the lack of consensus about their flipper stroke and gait.

Small wrinkles are present in the skin that may have prevented separation of the laminar flow in the boundary layer and thereby reduced skin friction.|$|E

50|$|In the {{traditional}} facelift, an incision {{is made in}} front of the ear extending up into the hairline.

After <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> incision <b>is</b> made, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> separated from <b>the</b> deeper tissues with a scalpel or scissors (also called undermining) over the cheeks and neck.

25|$|Originally, <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> {{attached}} by wooden pegs {{that were}} driven through {{holes in the}} skin and the shell near the playing edge. Four to five people would stretch the wet skin over the drum to apply tension while the pegs were driven into the bowl. The shrinkage of the skin while it dried then applied sufficient additional tension for the skin to resonate. A similar mounting technique is still used by the Landouma (a subgroup of the Baga people) for a djembe-like drum known as a gumbe. This mounting technique most likely goes back hundreds of years; the exact period is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} {{mounting}} system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope. <b>The</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> attached with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sown into {{the perimeter of the}} skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A long strip of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs wedged between the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|E
25|$|Soft tissue {{remains of}} plesiosaurs are rare, but sometimes, {{especially}} in shale deposits, {{they have been}} partly preserved, e.g. showing {{the outlines of the}} body. An early discovery in this respect was the holotype of Plesiosaurus conybeari (presently Attenborosaurus). From such finds it is known that <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> smooth, without apparent scales but with small wrinkles, that the trailing edge of the flippers extended considerably behind the limb bones; and that the tail bore a vertical fin, as reported by Wilhelm Dames in his description of Plesiosaurus guilelmiimperatoris (presently Seeleyosaurus).

25|$|The {{discovery}} of {{an impression of}} the skin covering the dorsal plates has implications for all possible functions of stegosaurian plates. Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) found that <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> smooth with long, parallel, shallow grooves indicating a keratinous structure covering the plates. The addition of beta-keratin, a strong protein, would indeed allow the plates to bear more weight, suggesting {{they may have been}} used for active defense. A keratinous covering would also allow greater surface area for the plates to be uses as a mating display structures, which could be potentially coloured like the beaks of modern birds. At the same time this finding implies that the use of plates for thermo-regulation may be less likely because the keratinous covering would make heat transfer from the bone highly ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to natural}} selection, {{people who lived}} in areas of intense {{sunlight}} developed dark skin colouration to protect against ultraviolet light and to protect their body mainly from folate depletion. Evolutionary pigmentation of <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> caused by Ultraviolet Radiation (UV) of the sun. As hominids gradually lost their fur between 4.5 and 2 million years ago, to allow for better cooling through sweating, their naked and lightly pigmented skin was exposed to sunlight. In the tropics, natural selection favoured dark-skinned human populations as high levels of skin pigmentation protected against the harmful effects of sunlight. Indigenous populations’ skin reflectance (the amount of sunlight the skin reflects) and the actual UV radiation in a particular geographic area is highly correlated, which supports this idea. Genetic evidence also supports this notion, demonstrating that around 1.2 million years ago there was a strong evolutionary pressure which acted on the development of dark skin pigmentation in early members of the genus Homo. The effect of sunlight on folic acid levels has been crucial in the development of dark skin.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{previously}} {{believed that}} <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>was</b> an effective barrier to inorganic particles. Damage from mechanical stressors {{was believed to}} {{be the only way to}} increase its permeability. Recently, however, simpler and more effective methods for increasing skin permeability have been developed. For example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has been used to slightly damage the surface of skin, causing a time-dependent defect allowing easier penetration of nanoparticles. The UVR’s high energy causes a restructuring of cells, weakening the boundary between the stratum corneum and the epidermal layer. The damage of the skin is typically measured by the transepidermal water loss (TEWL), though it may take 3–5 days for the TEWL to reach its peak value. When the TEWL reaches its highest value, the maximum density of nanoparticles is able to permeate the skin. Studies confirm that UVR damaged skin significantly increases the permeability. The effects of increased permeability after UVR exposure can lead to an increase in the number of particles that permeate the skin. However, the specific permeability of skin after UVR exposure relative to particles of different sizes and materials has not been determined.|$|E

30|$|One of the {{difficult}} targets could be the object with thick <b>skin.</b> Because <b>the</b> incident point of the path is determined as the first point where {{the light from the}} source hit the surface, an actual incident point of the path should lie on the inner boundary between <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> and <b>the</b> body; therefore, these two points do not match when <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> thick and <b>the</b> light is spread by the diffusion in <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Our model <b>is</b> applicable when <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> <b>is</b> thin enough.|$|R
