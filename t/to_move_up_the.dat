5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|Gil de Ferran won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his lead throughout the race's first half. Andretti {{made contact with}} Scott Dixon on the first lap and made a pit stop along with a change of strategy <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> field. Hélio Castroneves took over the lead after de Ferran made a pit stop for fuel and held it for 15 laps before he retired with a mechanical issue. Fernández and Tony Kanaan held the first position {{over the next seven}} laps. Andretti moved into first place on the 71st lap and maintained the position to win the race.|$|E

5|$|In either 469 or 466 BC, the Persians began {{assembling}} a large army and navy {{for a major}} offensive against the Greeks. Gathering near the Eurymedon, {{it is possible that}} the expedition aimed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city in turn. This would bring the Asiatic Greek regions back under Persian control, and give the Persians naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the Aegean. Hearing of the Persian preparations, the Athenian general Cimon took 200 triremes and sailed to Phaselis in Pamphylia, which eventually agreed to join the Delian League. This effectively blocked the Persian strategy at its first objective.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Brulé {{worked with}} a sports {{psychologist}} to address the mental aspect of his game, including his confidence. Near {{the end of the}} Oilers' training camp, on October 2, 2011, he was placed on waivers for the purpose of being assigned to the team's AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. While the departure of Andrew Cogliano in July 2011 made room for Brulé <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Oilers' depth chart at centre, the performance of Oilers rookies Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Anton Lander helped make him expendable. Regarding the move, Oilers General Manager Steve Tambellini described Brulé as having lacked consistency. Brulé cleared waivers two days later; an Edmonton Sun article suggested that he would have likely been picked up by another team if not for his $1.85 million salary.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{upon their}} arrival in New Guinea in January 1942 the 39th Battalion {{was used to}} defend the {{airfield}} at Seven Mile Aerodrome near Port Moresby and to carry out various other garrison tasks such as building defences and unloading stores at the wharf. In May 1942, the battalion's commanding officer, Conran, was deemed medically unfit for service and on 24 May he relinquished command. In June 1942, as the military situation in New Guinea deteriorated further, the battalion received orders <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Kokoda Track in order {{to act as a}} blocking force against the possibility of a Japanese advance overland from the north. In order to counter this threat, Maroubra Force composed of troops the 39th Battalion and the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB) were sent to Kokoda, arriving there on 15 July. This move proved prescient as a large Japanese force landed at Gona only a week later, and they quickly began to move inland towards Kokoda.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} {{maintain}} his lead from teammate Coulthard. On lap two Herbert moved into fifth position after Irvine dropped to seventh place when Verstappen overtook him. Further down the field Barrichello continued to gain positions when he passed both BAR drivers for eighth. The McLaren drivers managed to maintain a gap to Trulli who set the fastest lap of the race, 1:46.321. Irvine lost a further position to Barrichello on lap three, as Frentzen claimed 14th from Diniz. On lap four, Frentzen made up a further position by passing Heidfeld for 13th. On the same lap Verstappen locked up his tyres to avoid a collision with Herbert. This allowed Barrichello to pass Verstappen for sixth position in the run up to the Clark chicane on lap five. Herbert lost fifth position to Barrichello on lap six with Frentzen continuing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> field by passing Ralf Schumacher and Wurz for eleventh. Barrichello began setting consecutive fastest laps as he closed the gap to de la Rosa. Zonta lost 10th position when he was passed by Frentzen on lap seven. On the next lap, Verstappen suffered a worrying moment when half of his engine cover was shed from its chassis. Frentzen managed to gain a further four positions {{in the next four}} laps.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher lapped {{consistently}} in the 1:26 range, {{setting the}} new fastest lap {{of the race}} on lap 22, a 1:26.428, to extend his lead over Häkkinen to 5.4 seconds, who in turn was 9.9 seconds in front of Zonta. Verstappen in fourth was a further 2.9 seconds behind, but was drawing ahead of Ralf Schumacher in fifth. On lap 23, Zonta became the first front runner to make a scheduled pit stop and emerged in eleventh position. Salo continued <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> field when he passed Wurz for sixth on lap 25. Three laps later, Zonta moved into ninth position after he overtook Mazzacane and Diniz. Salo made a pit stop {{for the second time}} on lap 29 and emerged in tenth place. Verstappen took his pit stop three laps later and came out in seventh position. Zonta made his third and final pit stop of the race on lap 36 and dropped to eighth position. Michael Schumacher took his pit stop on lap 39 and rejoined 13.6 seconds behind Häkkinen, who now led the race. Three laps later, Häkkinen made a pit stop and rejoined behind Michael Schumacher with a deficit on eleven seconds. Fisichella was the final driver to make a scheduled stop on lap 44. Fisichella's pit stop was problematic: he stalled when he encountered a problem with his clutch system and his mechanics push-started his Benetton and he rejoined in eleventh.|$|E
