5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. He talks about how the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making <b>the</b> <b>shadows,</b> <b>and</b> he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles are {{the only}} act to have four Christmas number ones, three {{consecutively}} starting from 1963. On two occasions, 1963 and 1967, they had both the Christmas number one and the number two, the only act to have achieved this. As part of two acts, George Michael repeated the feat with Band Aid and Wham! in 1984. Paul McCartney has been top eight times with various acts. Cliff Richard has spent four Christmasses at number one; two as a solo act, one with <b>The</b> <b>Shadows</b> <b>and</b> one as part of Band Aid II. The Spice Girls later equalled the record of having three consecutive Christmas number ones, from 1996 to 1998. Spice Girl Melanie C achieved a fourth Christmas number one {{as a member of}} The Justice Collective in 2012, which also gave Robbie Williams his third.|$|E

25|$|Becoming {{concerned}} {{over the}} Shadows' growing influence among his people, Centauri ambassador Londo Mollari attempts to sever ties with them. Mr. Morden, the Shadows' human representative, tricks him into restoring the partnership by engineering {{the murder of}} Mollari's mistress while putting the blame on a rival Centauri House. Open warfare breaks out between <b>the</b> <b>Shadows</b> <b>and</b> the alliance led by Babylon 5 and the Minbari. It is learned that genetic manipulation by the Vorlons {{is the source of}} telepathy in humans and other races, as it is later discovered that Shadow ships are vulnerable to telepathic attacks. Displeased at the Vorlons' lack of direct action against the Shadows, Captain John Sheridan browbeats Vorlon ambassador Kosh Naranek into launching an attack against their mutual enemy. Kosh's deeds lead to his subsequent assassination by the Shadows.|$|E
25|$|Rex Goh {{was born}} as Tee Haut Rex Goh on 5 May 1951 in Singapore {{and grew up}} in Aljunied. At ten he learned the ukulele with {{guidance}} from a neighbouring musician, Benny Chan, who was a guitarist for a local group, The Checkmates. After three or four years he started on guitar, and was inspired by early 1960s bands, <b>The</b> <b>Shadows</b> <b>and</b> The Ventures, and then by Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix and Terry Kath. He joined Tani's Titans on bass guitar, which appeared on a children's TV show, performing country music. After finishing secondary school {{he was a member of}} Group 123, initially on bass guitar but soon switching to lead guitar. He acquired his 1969 Gibson Les Paul guitar; the group performed at British RAF bases.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} Dark Signer-like figures (called Shadow Drones in the dub) who are {{recruited}} {{and controlled by}} Roman's spiders. They only have access to Dark Tuner and Dark Synchro Monsters. When these Shadow Drones are defeated, their Mark of <b>the</b> <b>Shadows</b> <b>and</b> Deck disappear, and they lose their memories of being possessed. According to Goodwin, a true Dark Signer cannot be returned to normal, because they have already died. In addition, their duels end with the losing duelist being killed (in the dub, the loser {{is sent to the}} Netherworld). When a true Dark Signer is defeated, all the souls that were used for summoning their Earthbound Immortal are freed (this also seems to apply to non-Dark Signers who were defeated in Shadow Duels). After Goodwin and the King of the Netherworld are defeated, Goodwin and Roman pass on to the afterlife while Carly, Misty, and Devack are revived with no memory of their time as Dark Signers. Kalin is later shown to still remember his time as a Dark Signer, as well as Greiger. It is speculated that they kept their memories because, unlike the others, they willingly became Dark Signers.|$|E

25|$|The Mustangs were a surf music instrumental/dance band {{formed in}} Adelaide in 1964 with Mick Bower on rhythm guitar, Rick Morrison on lead guitar, Brian Vaughton on drums and Gavin Webb on bass guitar. Initially they played covers of <b>The</b> <b>Shadows</b> <b>and</b> The Ventures songs. The band's output was profoundly {{influenced}} by the Australian tour of The Beatles in June 1964, which had a particular impact in Adelaide, due to recent migrants from United Kingdom (UK). When The Beatles arrived in Adelaide they were greeted by the largest crowd ever seen in their touring career—estimates as high as 300,000 while Adelaide's population being less than 1 million—one-third of the city {{had turned out to}} greet them (see The Beatles' influence on popular culture). Following The Beatles' chart breakthrough and tour, it was obvious that the surf/instrumental style was passé. The Mustangs changed style and took on a lead singer, Scottish immigrant, Jim Keays. The Mustangs rehearsed regularly in a shed behind a hotel owned by Vaughton's family. Their original manager, Graham Longley, made a tape recording of a rehearsal; it was rediscovered and released on CD in 2004 as Mustangs to Masters... First Year Apprentices. After Keays joined on lead vocals, the band produced more original songs in the beat style.|$|E
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn work boots, {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> <b>and</b> under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E
