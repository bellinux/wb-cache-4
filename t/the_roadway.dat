5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated <b>the</b> <b>roadway</b> as CR26.

The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from <b>the</b> <b>roadway</b> on September26, 1994.|$|E

A technical corrections bill solved the legal hurdles involved. The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave <b>the</b> <b>roadway.</b> Local officials received the checks to pay for the projects at a ceremony in August 2008.

5|$|Records {{indicate}} that the alignment of PA371 was first constructed as a cut from the Delaware River to the community of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, in1791 through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties. In1801, the state legislature of New York and Pennsylvania brought up the proposal for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (later the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike) to connect the Hudson River to the Delaware River. Although the route was finished in New York, the portion in Pennsylvania was not legislated until March29,1804. Construction through Wayne and Susquehanna Counties commenced in1806, with completion of <b>the</b> <b>roadway</b> coming in1811. At that point, the turnpike was extended onto the cut in Pennsylvania to the Susquehanna River. The turnpike was used for transportation of farmers' goods and stock along with a route for pioneers to use for heading westward. After construction of the original CochectonDamascus Bridge in 1817 (and later in 1821), {{the area around the}} bridge became a bustling community. The alignment of what is now PA371 eventually became littered with a large rate of development, with nineteenth-century style buildings constructed in Damascus. The turnpike itself fared poorly later on, and was abandoned in1853. Although <b>the</b> <b>roadway</b> itself was abandoned, the turnpike corporation that was supposed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>roadway</b> remained intact until 1868, when it was dissolved. Even afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>roadway</b> remained the only physical route in the area until at least the1890s.|$|E
