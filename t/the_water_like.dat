5|$|Common {{threshers}} are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} infrequent reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Like</b> the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently {{for long periods of}} time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers, the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus {{is known}} from three {{specimens}} {{collected in the}} lowlands of the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region in southeastern Nicaragua. The first, an old male, was collected on November5, 1904, in a banana plantation with very moist red clay on the Río Escondido near El Rama. The second, a young adult male, was caught on July26, 1966, in dense cane on the south bank of the Río Mico at El Recreo, 15km (9mi) west from {{the location of the}} first specimen, along with three other rice rats (O.couesi, Melanomys caliginosus, and Oligoryzomys fulvescens), the cotton rat Sigmodon hirsutus, and the cottontail rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis. The third was caught at a stream near Bluefields. Reid suggested that the species is semiaquatic, spending some time in <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>like</b> other Oryzomys.|$|E

25|$|Belugas are slower {{swimmers}} {{than the}} other toothed whales, such as the killer whale and the common bottlenose dolphin, because they are less hydrodynamic and have limited movement of their tailfins, which produce the greatest thrust. They frequently swim at between , although {{they are able to}} maintain a speed of 22km/h for up to 15 min. Unlike most cetaceans, they are capable of swimming backwards. Belugas swim on the surface between 5% and 10% of the time, while {{for the rest of the}} time they swim at a depth sufficient to cover their bodies. They do not jump out of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>like</b> dolphins or killer whales.|$|E

Jeremy bounces [...] "up {{to the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>like</b> a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle", and swims to the pond's edge. He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, having lost his fishing equipment but quite sure he will never go fishing again.|$|E
500|$|The tail fluke of a dugong is notched {{and similar}} to those of dolphins, whereas the tail fluke of {{manatees}} is paddle-shaped. The fluke is raised up and down in long strokes to move the animal forward, or twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing. Unlike manatees, the dugong lacks nails on its flippers, which are only 15% of a dugong's body length. Manatees generally glide at speeds of , but can reach speeds of [...] in short bursts. The body is [...] to prevent drag in <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> <b>Like</b> cetaceans, the hind limbs are internal and vestigial. The snout is angled downwards to aid in bottom-feeding. Sirenians typically make two to three minute dives, but manatees can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes while resting and dugongs up to six minutes. They may stand on their tail to hold their head above water.|$|E

500|$|A {{failure to}} {{adequately}} seal the watertight bulkheads aboard Grosser Kurfürst caused {{the ship to}} sink rapidly, {{in the span of}} about eight minutes. Figures for the number of fatalities vary. Erich Gröner reports that out of a crew of 500 men, 269 died in the accident, while Lawrence Sondhaus states that 276 men were killed. Many of the bodies ended up in Cheriton Road Cemetery, where there is a substantial memorial. Arthur Sullivan, on his way to Paris, witnessed the incident, writing, [...] "I saw it all– saw the unfortunate vessel slowly go over and disappear under the water in clear, bright sunshine, and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>like</b> a calm lake. [...] It was too horrible– and then we saw all the boats moving about picking up the survivors, some so exhausted they had to be lifted on to the ships." [...] Among those rescued was the ship's captain, Count Alexander von Monts.|$|E
500|$|There are {{numerous}} accounts of common threshers using the long upper lobes of their tail fins to stun prey, {{and they are}} often snagged on longlines by their tails after presumably striking at the bait. In July 1914, shark-watcher Russell J. Coles reported seeing a thresher shark use its tail to flip prey fish into its mouth, and that one fish that missed was thrown a [...] "considerable distance". On April 14, 1923, noted oceanographer W.E. Allen observed a [...] thresher shark pursuing a California smelt (Atherinopsis californiensis) off a pier at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The shark overtook the small fish and swung its tail above <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "coachwhip" [...] with [...] "confusing speed", severely injuring its target. In the winter of 1865, Irish ichthyologist Harry Blake-Knox claimed to have seen a thresher shark in Dublin Bay use its tail to strike a wounded loon (probably a great northern diver, Gavia immer), which it then swallowed. Blake-Knox's account was subsequently disputed by other authorities, who asserted that the thresher's tail is not rigid or muscular enough to effect such a blow.|$|E
500|$|The dolphin's {{search for}} food is {{aided by a}} form of sonar known as echolocation: it locates objects by {{producing}} sounds and listening for the echos. A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam {{in front of the}} dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>like</b> a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object. To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with bats and sonar, which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers. Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an [...] "echoic image" [...] or sound picture of their targets.|$|E

500|$|Gardner Lake is {{a natural}} lake and is named for the Gardner family which owned {{a large portion of}} the {{surrounding}} area, but the history of the lake itself is more identified as the site of [...] "an extremely public miscalculation". Thomas LeCount, a grocer from Niantic, Connecticut wanted to move his two-story summer house from the south side of the lake to the east side of the lake, but believed that moving the house conventionally would be inefficient. LeCount raised up his fully furnished house and placed it on sleds and waited until February 1895 when the lake was frozen. After moving the house about [...] off the south shore, the house slid sideways into a snowbank. The ice cracked as LeCount attempted to pull the house back, before abandoning the work at nightfall. That night, the mill operators utilized some of the lake's water for power and made a gap between the ice and surface of the water, causing the house to crack through the ice and pitch over. LeCount's summer home remained in this position until the spring thaw where it came to rest in [...] of water with the second story and attic positioned above <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>like</b> a small lighthouse. For years, the house was the subject of children who fished off it in summer and ice skated through the house in the winter, but an enduring tale told by fishermen is that the house's piano could be heard playing on quiet nights. By 2005, the house was mostly rotted away.|$|E
2500|$|Dolomedes spiders {{are covered}} all over in short, velvety hairs which are unwettable (hydrophobic). [...] This {{allows them to}} use surface tension to stand or run on <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>like</b> pond skaters. [...] They can also climb beneath the water, and then air becomes trapped in the body hairs and forms a thin film over the whole {{surface of the body}} and legs, giving them the {{appearance}} of fine polished silver. [...] Like other spiders, Dolomedes breathe with book lungs beneath their abdomens, and these open into the air film, allowing the spiders to breathe while submerged. [...] The trapped air makes them very buoyant and if they do not hold onto a rock or a plant stem they float to the surface where they pop onto the surface film, completely dry.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Jose of Caesarea {{read the}} words, [...] "He is swift upon {{the face of}} the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth, he turns not by the way of the vineyards," [...] in [...] to teach that the righteous Noah rebuked his contemporaries. Noah urged them to repent, or God would bring a deluge upon them and cause their bodies to float upon <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>like</b> gourds, reading [...] to say, [...] "He floats lightly upon {{the face of the}} waters." [...] Moreover, Noah told them that they would be taken as a curse for all future generations, as [...] says, [...] "their portion is cursed." [...] And Rabbi Jose of Caesarea taught that the words, [...] "he turns not by the way of the vineyards," [...] {{indicate}} that as the people worked in their vineyards, they asked Noah what prevented God from bringing the Flood at that moment. And Noah replied that God had one dear one, one dove, to draw out before God could bring the Flood. (That is, the aged Methuselah had to die first, so that he would not suffer the punishment of the Flood).|$|E

2500|$|PC-552 was a Class 461 ship. Class 461 Patrol Craft {{were built}} mainly for the US Navy from 1941 to 1944. [...] This class was called Class 461 {{because the first}} one built was PC-461, which began the series. The first of the class to enter service was the PC-471. The class 461 was {{designed}} for rapid production in large numbers, to be effective anti-submarine vessels, and to relieve larger vessels from convoy duty. The U.S. Navy usually did not provide traditional names to PCs; the [...] of this ship was PC-552. This PC class was considered seaworthy but bounced around on <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>like</b> no other craft. The PCs were a match for the enemy submarines when the submarines were submerged but the PCs were clearly outgunned in a surface battle. In such a case, the PCs preferred tactic was to charge the submarine to ram it, before the submarine could bring its superior gun to bear. Class 461 Patrol Craft were designed to get most of their drinking water from an onboard distillation plant. Because of the violent pitching, the distillation plants of the PCs rarely worked. Consequently, the PCs were continuously plagued by a shortage of drinking water.|$|E
2500|$|Aqua Skoot: Invented by Ken Bailey in {{the early}} 1980s, riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled {{up to the top}} of the ride, go down a slide {{consisting}} of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>like</b> a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. [...] At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was 30' long. [...] The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998, the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. [...] The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003.|$|E
