The gem-dialkyl substituents have been used in the past for recognizing thermodynamic properties of chemical systems, though recent studies have pushed those discoveries to the understanding of kinetic systems as well.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} for <b>transition</b> <b>metal-catalyzed</b> olefin metathesis {{has been widely}} researched over the past forty years. RCM undergoes a similar mechanistic pathway as other olefin metathesis reactions, such as cross metathesis (CM), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and acyclic diene metathesis (ADMET). Since all steps {{in the catalytic cycle}} are considered reversible, it is possible for some of these other pathways to intersect with RCM depending on the reaction conditions and substrates. In 1971, Chauvin proposed the formation of a metallacyclobutane intermediate through a 2+2 cycloaddition which then cycloreverts to either yield the same alkene and catalytic species (a nonproductive pathway), or produce a new catalytic species and an alkylidene (a productive pathway). This mechanism has become widely accepted among chemists and serves as the model for the RCM mechanism.|$|E
