25|$|Each mission had to {{fabricate}} {{virtually all of}} its construction materials from local materials. Workers in the carpintería (carpentry shop) used crude methods to shape beams, lintels, and other structural elements; more skilled artisans carved doors, furniture, and wooden implements. For certain applications bricks (ladrillos) were fired in ovens (kilns) to strengthen <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> them more resistant to the elements; when tejas (roof tiles) eventually replaced the conventional jacal roofing (densely packed reeds) they {{were placed in the}} kilns to harden them as well.

25|$|Seeking {{to lower}} the {{spiralling}} cost of the MX system, which had reached at least $35 billion {{by the end of}} the 1970s, Jimmy Carter announced a greatly simplified deployment using simpler silos and reduced number of false launchers. The launchers changed from vertical to horizontal, which would reduce the cost of building <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it simpler to rapidly move the missiles in and out of the silos without it being easily seen. LoADS was adapted to work in these new shelters, and by the late 1970s was known as the Baseline Terminal Defense System.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the Dowager Duchess's lack of discipline, Catherine became {{influenced}} by some older girls who candidly allowed men into the sleeping areas at night for entertainment. The girls were rewarded with food and wine and gifts. Catherine was not as well educated as some of Henry's other wives, although, on its own, her ability to read and write was impressive enough at the time. Her character has often been described as vivacious, giggly and brisk, but never scholarly or devout. She displayed great interest in her dance lessons, but would often be distracted during <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> jokes. She also had a nurturing side for animals, particularly dogs.|$|E
25|$|The Insurance Fraud Bureau in the UK {{estimated}} {{there have}} already been more than 20,000 staged collisions and false insurance claims across the UK from 1999 to 2006. One tactic fraudsters use is to drive to a busy junction or roundabout and brake sharply causing a motorist to drive {{into the back of}} them. They claim the other motorist was at fault because they were driving too fast or too close behind <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a false and inflated claim to the motorist's insurer for whiplash and damage which can give the fraudsters up to £30,000. In the Insurance Fraud Bureau's first year or operation, the usage of data mining initiatives exposed insurance fraud networks and led to 74 arrests and a five-to-one return on investment.|$|E

25|$|Women are {{becoming}} more confident {{in the workplace and}} are trying harder to step up in their career. More and more of these women want to fit into the management level by trying to emulate men via fashion and outward appearance to appear more masculine and powerful. Most of the higher position in the work field were occupied by man at that time, it is understandable that how womenswear is influenced by man’s figure and body feature to mock the general existing powerful image at that time. Hence, they would want garments that empower <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> them look more masculine in shape, thus making the woman appear to be more capable of higher level tasks and seem more professional by fitting in with the male majority. This would be accomplished with attributes such as wider shoulders with the aid of padding and larger sleeves.|$|E
25|$|Following the disappointing {{response}} to the film Brother and the film Dolls, Kitano received a sequence of unsympathetic reviews from the press in the United States. Criticism was less severe in Europe and Asia though many commentators were not as lavish with their praise {{as they had been}} with his previous films. 2003's Zatōichi, in which Kitano directed and starred, silenced many of these dissenters. With a new take on the character from Shintaro Katsu's long-running film and TV series, Zatōichi was Kitano's biggest box office success in Japan, did quite well in limited release across the world, and won countless awards at home and abroad, including the Silver Lion award at the Venice Film Festival. Kitano revealed that he was approached by others to create the film and therefore differed from his own techniques and followed the common filmmaking process in order to please <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a pure-entertainment film.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{between the}} Arian Vandals and their Trinitarian {{subjects}} (including both Catholics and Donatists) were a {{constant source of}} tension in their African state. Catholic bishops were exiled or killed by Genseric and laymen were excluded from office and frequently suffered confiscation of their property. He protected his Catholic subjects when his relations with Rome and Constantinople were friendly, as during the years 454–57, when the Catholic community at Carthage, being without a head, elected Deogratias bishop. The same was also the case during the years 476–477 when Bishop Victor of Cartenna sent him, during a period of peace, a sharp refutation of Arianism and suffered no punishment. Huneric, Genseric's successor, issued edicts against Catholics in 483 and 484 in an effort to marginalise <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> Arianism the primary religion in North Africa. Generally most Vandal kings, except Hilderic, persecuted Trinitarian Christians {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, banning conversion for Vandals, exiling bishops and generally making life difficult for Trinitarians.|$|E

500|$|... gave {{us all a}} bit of paper, and we made lists {{from one}} to 15. Eno said 'No. 2, we all play a G; No. 7 we all play a C sharp'; an so on.

Robert Fripp, who worked with Eno on (No Pussyfooting) and Here Come the Warm Jets, performed the solo on [...] "St. Elmo's Fire". Eno asked Fripp to improvise a lightning-fast guitar solo that would imitate an electrical charge between two poles on a Wimshurst high voltage generator. This {{was the basis for}} Eno crediting Fripp's solo on this track as [...] "Wimshurst Guitar".|$|E
500|$|After portraying Adam Carter {{for four}} years, Rupert Penry-Jones felt his {{character}} had {{run its course}} over the series and wanted to explore other venues, stating he was [...] "getting {{to the point where}} I needed to move on." [...] In December 2007, before the sixth series finale was shown, Penry-Jones announced he would leave the series sometime during its seventh year, and revealed the character would leave in what he believed to be [...] "one of the best" [...] Spooks exits. To keep the series in general fresh, the producers wanted to tease the audience into thinking whether or not Adam would escape his fate in time, and even after he is killed, wanted to surprise <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> them think [...] "Oh my God, I can't believe they just did that." [...] Penry-Jones found that his last days on Spooks was generally upsetting and [...] "welled up" [...] on his final day.|$|E
500|$|According to Tripp, sexual {{attraction}} is encouraged by [...] "tension and distance" [...] between {{one person and}} another, and is consequently [...] "seldom aroused and never rewarding unless something in the partner or in the situation itself is viewed as resistant to it." [...] Tripp maintains that societies have increased divisions {{between men and women}} partly to satisfy needs inherent in sexual psychology. He suggests that there are often elements of truth to traditional accusations made against women, such as deviousness, and that derogatory descriptions of women serve to increase divisions between the sexes, create tension between <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> relations between men and women more exciting. Tripp proposes that social bonds between men are not prone to becoming sexual because the similarity and camaraderie between men make them too close to each other for homosexual activities to have any interest. Tripp maintains that heterosexuality and homosexuality generally develop in parallel ways, but that since homosexuality, unlike heterosexuality, is not encouraged and institutionalized by society, its origins are more [...] "scattered and diverse." [...] He reviewed anthropological evidence on homosexuality.|$|E

500|$|During the {{transition}} from Versus XIII to XV and the optimization of Luminous Studio for game development, the team created a conceptual environment using a prototype engine environment called [...] "Ebony". After the initial reveal, the team ran into difficulties with the new hardware, prompting them to contact HexaDrive due to their experience with high-spec gaming hardware. To solve the issues faced by XV, the team used a similar development approach to Ubisoft: they created an approximate game system that they could build on and edit in real-time. Graphics and animation were developed first, followed by a cinematics editor and a system to manage events during transitions between cutscenes and gameplay. This latter element was what allowed the developers to create {{what would become the}} game's final version. To help maximize the realism of the characters, their hair was first created by a hairstylist using a mannequin's wig, then rendered into the game using the technology of Luminous Studio. The same technique was used for Agni's Philosophy, the engine's 2012 demo. Character movements were created using motion capture technology: the animators' movements were first captured while they wore special suits, then their actions were adjusted in the team's computer to perfect <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> minor additions like finger movements. These actions were then implemented in the game environment for the intended characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{new album}} came back in 2010, as {{frontman}} Dave Grohl was touring Australia with Them Crooked Vultures. Grohl decided that [...] "we should make a documentary about the recording of this new album {{and make it a}} history of the band too. Rather than just record the album in the most expensive studio with the most state-of-the-art equipment, what if Butch and I were to get back together after 20 years and dust off the tape machines and put them in my garage?" [...] Grohl later elaborated that Vig was brought in so the record could be [...] "that one album that kinda defines the band: it might not be their best album, but it's the one people identify the band with the most, like Back In Black or the Metallica Black Album. It's like you take {{all of the things that}} people consider your band's signature characteristics and just amplify <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> one simple album with that. And that's sorta what I thought we could do with Butch, because Butch has a great way of trimming all the fat and making sense of it all." [...] Grohl also used the tour with the Vultures to turn song ideas into demos, which were then brought to drummer Taylor Hawkins to be further developed. The album would also mark the return of guitarist Pat Smear as a permanent member; Smear left the Foo Fighters after the release of The Colour and the Shape, but had been part of the touring band since 2006.|$|E

Wretchedness squirms for alleviation, and in the public- house its pain is eased and forgetfulness is obtained. It is unhealthy. Certainly it is, but everything else about their lives is unhealthy, while this brings the oblivion that nothing else in their lives can bring.
