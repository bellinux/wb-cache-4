5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744–1829) was {{a member}} of the French Academy of Sciences and a {{professor}} of botany at the Jardin des Plantes and then became the first professor of zoology at the new Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. He became known for his work on the taxonomy of the invertebrates, especially of molluscs. However, he is mainly remembered for the theory that now bears his name, Lamarckism, and in particular his view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> (called by Lamarck the conditions of life) gave rise to permanent, inherited, evolutionary changes in animals. He described his theory in his 1802 Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants, and in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique, and later in his Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres, (1815–1822).|$|E
5|$|Otis began {{gradually}} entering cooler ocean waters, {{although the}} National Hurricane Center noted {{in one of}} its discussions on the system <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> was still warm enough to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105mph (165km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, and the center of circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low-level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. VanOrd was not impressed, stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> do {{not look}} as good viewed from a top-down perspective, but he praised the art style {{and some of the}} game's [...] "eye-catching" [...] landmarks. Tan liked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> were varied and unique, saying that each level felt [...] "vast" [...] and filled with details. Villoria found its visual quality lacking when compared with that of Mass Effect 2, adding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> facial animation can feel wooden at times. However, he found the combat animation rewarding and satisfying. He further criticized the sex sequences as [...] "off-putting". Yin-Poole said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game's graphics were boring and generic, and called the sex scenes [...] "anti-climatic" [...] and poorly-executed. Both Villoria and Yin-Poole felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> six-year development time was too long, considering the game's mediocre graphics.|$|R
5|$|The {{historian}} of science Sharon Kingsland, in a 1978 paper on Abbott Thayer and the protective coloration debate, uses Beddard repeatedly {{to illuminate the}} different strands of the argument. She quotes Beddard (p.94) on how difficult the question of animal coloration seemed in the 1890s. Thayer — an artist, not a scientist — had dived head-first into the debate. One of the protagonists, notes Kingsland, was Joel Asaph Allen, who had reviewed Beddard's book, and who believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> directly influenced animal coloration — Kingsland cites Beddard p.54 here —, so natural selection seemed to him an unlikely factor, and {{he pointed out that}} blending inheritance would dilute the effect of selection. Furthermore, argues Kingsland, again citing Beddard (p.148), another major protagonist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was emphasizing the problem of conspicuous markings, which could be selected for as warning coloration.|$|E
5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back, which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E

25|$|Around 1960, Ray Solomonoff {{founded the}} theory of {{universal}} inductive inference, {{the theory of}} prediction based on observations; for example, predicting the next symbol based upon a given series of symbols.

Methods to reduce negative impact and improve the value to conservation are the subject of research.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of intelligence is {{usually associated with}} the performance over a selection of tasks or <b>environments.</b> <b>The</b> most general approach in this line is called Universal Intelligence, which assigns a probability to each possible environment according to several constructs derived from Kolmogorov complexity. In this context, new testing paradigms are being defined in order to devise intelligence tests which are anytime and universal: valid for both artificial intelligent systems and biological systems, of any intelligence degree and of any speed. In this paper, we address one of the pieces in this puzzle: {{the definition of a}} general, unbiased, universal class of environments such that they are appropriate for intelligence tests. By appropriate we mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> are discriminative and that they can be feasibly built, in such a way <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environments</b> can be automatically generated and their complexity can be computed...|$|R

25|$|Lamarck {{stressed}} {{two main}} themes in his biological work. The first was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{gives rise to}} changes in animals. He cited examples of blindness in moles, the presence of teeth in mammals {{and the absence of}} teeth in birds as evidence of this principle. The second principle was that life was structured in an orderly manner and that many different parts of all bodies make it possible for the organic movements of animals.|$|E
25|$|Virginians were {{intensely}} individualistic at this point, {{weakening the}} small new communities. According to Breen (1979) their horizon was {{limited by the}} present or near future. They believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> could and {{should be forced to}} yield quick financial returns. Thus everyone was looking out for number one {{at the expense of the}} cooperative ventures. Farms were scattered and few villages or towns were formed. This extreme individualism led to the failure of the settlers to provide defense for themselves against the Indians, resulting in two massacres.|$|E
25|$|The {{equation}} can be {{also seen}} {{from the perspective of}} the system taken together with its surroundings (the rest of the universe). First, assume that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring. Then the entropy released or absorbed by the system equals the entropy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> must absorb or release, respectively. The reaction will only be allowed if the total entropy change of the universe is zero or positive. This is reflected in a negative ΔG, and the reaction is called exergonic.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatry, {{like most}} medical {{specialties}} has a continuing, has significant need for research into its diseases, classifications and treatments. Psychiatry adopts biology's fundamental belief that disease and health are different elements of an individual's adaptation to an environment. But psychiatry also recognizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{of the human}} species is complex and includes physical, cultural, and interpersonal elements. In addition to external factors, the human brain must contain and organize an individual's hopes, fears, desires, fantasies and feelings. Psychiatry's difficult task is to bridge the understanding of these factors {{so that they can be}} studied both clinically and physiologically.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of evolution are taught transparently by showing {{the advantages of}} various types of plant behaviour in action. The adaptations are often complex, as it becomes clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> to which plants must adapt comprises not just soil, water and weather, but also other plants, fungi, insects and other animals, and even humans. The series shows that co-operative strategies are often much more effective than predatory ones, as these often lead to the prey developing methods of self-defence — from plants growing spikes to insects learning to recognise mimicry. Yet humans can work around all these rules of nature, so Attenborough concludes with a plea to preserve plants, {{in the interest of}} self-preservation.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{there was}} a gorilla that used a stick to measure how deep water was. In 2009, {{there was a}} western lowland gorilla at Buffalo zoo that used a bucket to collect water. Most notably, an {{experiment}} was conducted at Buffalo Zoological Gardens from 17 April 2010 to 26 June 2010 relating to this incident. The experiment involved one adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas given five gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger female gorillas were able to successfully fill the buckets with water. This is the first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools to drink in zoos. What should be worth noting is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> of the zoo may affect {{the behavior of the}} gorillas.|$|E

25|$|Habitats and biota do {{frequently}} change. Therefore, {{it follows}} that the process of adaptation is never finally complete. Over time, it may happen <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> changes little, and the species comes to fit its surroundings better and better. On the other hand, it may happen that changes in the environment occur relatively rapidly, and then the species becomes less and less well adapted. Seen like this, adaptation is a genetic tracking process, which goes on all the time to some extent, but especially when the population cannot or does not move to another, less hostile area. Given enough genetic change, as well as specific demographic conditions, an adaptation may be enough to bring a population back from the brink of extinction in a process called evolutionary rescue. It should be noted that adaptation does affect, to some extent, every species in a particular ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|On 29th Jan 2011, the {{chairman}} of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) Madhav Gadgil opined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b> Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Athirappilly hydel power project was not properly carried out and 70% of it is bogus. The panel, appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, was asked to look into and give recommendations on various projects in the Western Ghats such as the hydroelectric projects in Gundiya in Karnataka and Athirappilly in Kerala and the overall development projects in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Maharashtra. Gadgil said that the proposed Athirappilly hydro-electric project cannot be approved until the Forest Rights Act is implemented in its true spirit for the Kadar tribal community of the area and also no comprehensive study had been carried out so far on the natural riparian forest vegetation along the Western Ghats.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E
