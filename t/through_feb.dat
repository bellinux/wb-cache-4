40|$|Aerobiological {{data have}} been widely used by many scientists, {{including}} those that study modern ¯ ora as well as those wishing to reconstruct past vegetational associations. Burkard (Hirst-type) volumetric spore traps are widely used instruments for studying airborne pollen, while Tauber traps are typically used to analyze pollen deposition. The present study compared the pollen collected by these two methods in Tulsa, Oklahoma a warm temperate area with year-round pollen. There was a strong correlation between the pollen in¯ ux from the Tauber traps and cumulative sum of average daily airborne pollen concentrations recorded with the Burkard spore trap over the course of 12 months from 1 <b>Feb</b> 1997 <b>through</b> 1 <b>Feb</b> 1998.

Although COARE consisted of several field phases, including a year-long atmospheric enhanced monitoring period (1 July 1992 [...] 30 June 1993), the heart of COARE was its four-month Intensive Observation Period (IOP) extending from 1 Nov. 1992 <b>through</b> 28 <b>Feb.</b> 1993.

Aspects of tropical variability beginning in Aug. 1992 and extending through Mar. 1993, with some sounding data for Apr. 1993 are considered.
