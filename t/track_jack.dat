50|$|Jack Arnst {{was one of}} {{thirteen}} children born to Hermann and Catharina Arnst. The family lived at Tai Tapu near Christchurch. He, {{and several of his}} brothers, became champion cyclists both on the road and on the <b>track.</b> <b>Jack</b> and his brother Richard were placed third and fourth respectively in the 1903 Timaru to Christchurch road race which was over a distance of 112 mi. Jack subsequently was first and fastest, in record time, in the 1903 road race between Warrnambool and Melbourne over a distance of 165 mi which carried with it the title of Long Distance Road Champion of Australasia. Some of the credit of this win was due to his brother Richard's unselfish pacing, who finished in 5th place in the second fastest time, that was also inside the previous best time. The brothers returned to Australia in 1904 with Richard finishing in 10th and Jack well back in 25th. In 1905 Jack could only manage 76th with Richard in 77th.|$|E
5000|$|In many ways, {{these three}} songs on Buffalo Springfield Again, [...] "Mr. Soul", [...] "Expecting to Fly", and [...] "Broken Arrow", are harbingers {{of much of}} Young's later work in that, {{although}} they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. [...] "Mr. Soul" [...] is the only Young song of the three that all {{five members of the}} group performed together. In contrast, [...] "Broken Arrow" [...] was confessional folk-rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Young's experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a soundbite of Dewey Martin singing [...] "Mr. Soul" [...] and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. [...] "Expecting to Fly" [...] was a lushly produced ballad similar to the baroque pop of the mid-1960s, featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the <b>track,</b> <b>Jack</b> Nitzsche, would dub [...] "symphonic pop".|$|E

The Debrief consists of Agent Ramirez and other agents attempting to discover more about the supposed-death of an undercover agent, Marcus Holt, who disappeared shortly after Jack's imprisonment in China at the hands of Cheng Zhi. Since Holt was involved with the Chinese government, it is believed that Jack leaked information that led to his identity being discovered and execution. At the end of the series, the agents announce that they have no conclusive evidence about his involvement, but Ramirez promises to {{keep a close eye on}} him until he is certain. Jack tells Ramirez that if he ever sees him again, he better say [...] "The Lord's Prayer", because it will mean he's come to kill him.|$|E
