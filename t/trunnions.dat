5|$|The bridge's Whipple truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire Whipple, who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. Whipple {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of <b>trunnions.</b> Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E
40|$|To {{make the}} fulcrum (Figure 1) of a bascule bridge, a long hollow steel shaft called the <b>trunnion</b> is shrink {{fit into a}} steel hub. The {{resulting}} steel trunnion-hub assembly is then shrink fit into the girder of the bridge. Figure 1 Trunnion-Hub-Girder (THG) assembly. This is done by first immersing the <b>trunnion</b> in a cold medium such as liquid nitrogen. After the <b>trunnion</b> reaches the steady state temperature of the cold medium, the <b>trunnion</b> outer diameter contracts. The <b>trunnion</b> is {{taken out of the}} medium and slid though the hole of the hub (Figure 1). When the <b>trunnion</b> heats up, it expands and creates an interference fit with the hub. Because of the large thermal shock that the <b>trunnion</b> undergoes, it is suggested that the <b>trunnion</b> be cooled in stages. First, put the <b>trunnion</b> in a refrigerated chamber, then dip it in dry-ice/alcohol mixture and then immerse it in a bath of liquid nitrogen. However, this approach will take more time. One is mainly concerned about the cool down time in the refrigerate...|$|R

25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet saw with a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted <b>trunnions</b> and some have table-mounted <b>trunnions.</b> In general, cabinet-mounted <b>trunnions</b> are easier to adjust than table-mounted <b>trunnions.</b> Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|E
25|$|An {{oscillating}} {{engine was}} {{a type of}} direct-acting engine {{that was designed to}} achieve further reductions in engine size and weight. Oscillating engines had the piston rods connected directly to the crankshaft, dispensing with the need for connecting rods. In order to achieve this aim, the engine cylinders were not immobile as in most engines, but secured in the middle by <b>trunnions</b> which allowed the cylinders themselves to pivot back and forth as the crankshaft rotated, hence the term oscillating. Steam was supplied and exhausted through the <b>trunnions.</b> The oscillating motion of the cylinder was usually used to line up ports in the <b>trunnions</b> to direct the steam feed and exhaust to the cylinder at the correct times. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the timing to be varied to enable expansive working. (As, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen.) This compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|E

25|$|Despite the railroad's {{incomplete}} state, {{the first}} paying customers started riding on August 14, 1868, {{and the construction}} reached the summit in July 1869. The early locomotives all had vertical boilers, like many stationary steam engines of the time; the boilers were mounted on <b>trunnions</b> allowing them to be held vertically {{no matter what the}} gradient of the track. Later designs introduced horizontal boilers, slanted so that they remain close to horizontal on the steeply graded track.|$|E
500|$|The {{cylindrical}} piers of {{the bridge}} were [...] in diameter and finished with an ashlar of cut granite. The completed bridge had its bascule leaves pivot on <b>trunnions</b> located [...] {{from the end of}} the girders. The bridge's reinforced-concrete counterweights, measuring [...] high by [...] wide, was supported by pivots at the ends of the girders. The <b>trunnions</b> were supported by box-girder posts on the sides of the bascule leaves and each set of inside trunnion posts were braced by a girder ran both between them and to the operating mechanism. Earle Gear and Machine Company provided the operating mechanism for the bridge. The bascule leaves were raised by a motor that used reduction gears and engaged a pinion to move the rack quadrant to raise the bridge. A manual-operation shaft was originally present so that it could be operated from the surface of the roadway, but it was later paved over. The operator's house was located on the south side of the western approach, it originally housed the operator's house and public bathrooms, but it was removed in 1936. The plans originally dictated for a second station on the opposite end, but 1930s photos shows it was apparently never constructed.|$|E
500|$|Development {{of the new}} {{tank was}} offered to five {{separate}} manufacturers: Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX), Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée (FCM), Renault, Societe Lorraine de Dietrich (SLD-Lorraine) and Societé d'Outillage Mécanique et d'Usinage d'Artillerie (SOMUA). The new vehicle {{was based on the}} new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were {{similar to that of the}} German Panther tank, which had been used by the French Army in the immediate post-war. The French government's specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier Tiger I; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach [...] engine, based on an earlier model, and the torsion bar sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an oscillating turret, mounted on <b>trunnions,</b> which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the <b>trunnions</b> of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system. Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX's first prototype was armed with a [...] cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger [...] gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the Western European Union, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a heavy tank project with an even larger [...] tank gun; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.|$|E
30|$|In summary, the {{association}} between large-diameter femoral heads and increased <b>trunnion</b> wear is inconclusive.

500|$|By {{end of the}} 15th century, several {{technological}} advancements were made, making cannon more mobile. Wheeled gun carriages and <b>trunnions</b> became common, and {{the invention of the}} limber further facilitated the transportation of artillery. As a result, field artillery became viable, and began to emerge, often used alongside the larger cannon intended for sieges. The better gunpowder, improved, cast-iron projectiles, and the standardization of calibers meant that even relatively light cannon could be deadly. In The Art of War, Niccolò Machiavelli observed that [...] "It is true that the arquebuses and the small artillery do much more harm than the heavy artillery." [...] This was the case at Flodden, in 1513: the English field guns outpaced the Scottish siege artillery, firing twice, or even thrice, as many rounds. Despite the increased maneuverability, however, cannon were still much slower {{than the rest of the}} army: a heavy English cannon required 23 horses to transport, while a culverin, nine, yet, even with this many animals transporting them, they still moved at a walking pace. Due to their relatively slow speed, and lack of organization, discipline, and tactics, the combination of pike and shot still dominated the battlefields of Europe.|$|E
500|$|Some of the 28cm SK L/40 {{guns were}} {{transferred}} to the German Army from the Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) when the pre-dreadnoughts began to be disarmed and relegated to training duties in 1916 after the Battle of Jutland had proved {{that they were not}} suitable for contemporary naval combat. [...] One obvious change made for land service was the placement of a large counterweight just forward of the <b>trunnions</b> to counteract the preponderance of weight towards the breech. This, although heavy, was simpler than adding equilibrators to perform the same function. It was fitted with a hydro-pneumatic system to absorb the recoil from firing and to return the gun to its firing position, ready for the next round. The first four guns were placed in Bettungsschiessgerüst (firing platform) (BSG) mountings in 1917 for coast defense duties as part of [...] "Batterie Graf Spee" [...] on the island of Wangerooge. These were a semi-portable mount that could be emplaced anywhere after several weeks of labor to prepare the position. It rotated on a pivot {{at the front of the}} mount and the rear was supported by rollers resting on a semicircular rail and was sometimes equipped with a gun shield. The gun's rate of fire in these mounts was about one round per five minutes.|$|E
500|$|Four muzzle-loading smoothbore [...] guns, {{based on}} the American Rodman design, were {{originally}} intended as Petr Velikys main armament, but the Russians were impressed by a demonstration of a new Krupp [...] rifled gun. They bought a few guns directly {{as well as a}} production license and an enlarged 12-inch, 20-caliber, gun was selected to replace the 20-inch guns. In order to keep the gun ports as small as possible the hydraulic turret machinery raised and lowered the guns' <b>trunnions</b> rather than their muzzles. They had a maximum elevation of +12.5° and a maximum depression of −2.5°. This gave the guns a range of about [...] at maximum elevation. The gun turrets were of the Coles type and weighed [...] each. Powered by steam engines they could make a complete 360° rotation in one minute, although they had a firing arc of only 310°. The guns recoiled into the turrets after firing, which meant that a great deal of powder smoke was released into the turret. To counter this problem, ventilation fans were mounted in the turret roofs. The ship's machinery filled almost the entire breastwork, which forced the main gun magazines away from the turrets towards the ends of the ship, and that complicated the ammunition resupply arrangements for those guns. While some shells were stored in the breastwork, most were not, and likely would have slowed the ship's sustained rate of fire in a lengthy engagement.|$|E

500|$|Using {{detailed}} {{information provided by}} Loyalist spies, the grenadier companies searched the small town for military supplies. When they arrived at Ephraim Jones's tavern, by the jail on the South Bridge road, they found the door barred shut, and Jones refused them entry. According to reports provided by local Loyalists, Pitcairn knew cannon had been buried on the property. Jones was ordered at gunpoint to show where the guns were buried. These {{turned out to be}} three massive pieces, firing 24-pound shot, that were much too heavy to use defensively, but very effective against fortifications, with sufficient range to bombard the city of Boston from other parts of nearby mainland. The grenadiers smashed the <b>trunnions</b> of these three guns so they could not be mounted. They also burned some gun carriages found in the village meetinghouse, and when the fire spread to the meetinghouse itself, local resident Martha Moulton persuaded the soldiers to help in a bucket brigade to save the building. Nearly a hundred barrels of flour and salted food were thrown into the millpond, as were 550 pounds of musket balls. Of the damage done, only that done to the cannon was significant. All of the shot and much of the food was recovered after the British left. [...] During the search, the regulars were generally scrupulous in their treatment of the locals, including paying for food and drink consumed. [...] This excessive politeness was used to advantage by the locals, who were able to misdirect searches from several smaller caches of militia supplies.|$|E
500|$|The range {{had grown}} too far for {{accurate}} shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port {{to close the}} range again between 16:12 and 16:15. This manoeuvre exposed Lion to the fire of the German battlecruisers, and she was hit several times. The smoke and fumes from these hits caused [...] {{to lose sight of}} Lion, which had sheered out of line to starboard, and to switch her fire to Queen Mary, now visible to Derfflinger's gunnery officer as the second ship in the British line and therefore assumed to be Princess Royal, at 16:16. Queen Mary hit Seydlitz again at 16:17 and knocked out one gun of her secondary armament. In return, Queen Mary had been hit twice by Seydlitz before 16:21 with unknown effects, but the German battlecruiser hit the turret face of 'Q' turret at that time and knocked out the right-hand gun in the turret. By 16:25 the range was down to , and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. This move came too late, however, for Queen Mary, as Derfflingers fire began to take effect, hitting her twice before 16:26. One shell hit forward and detonated {{one or both of the}} forward magazines, which broke the ship in two near the foremast. Stationed inside 'Q' turret, Midshipman Jocelyn Latham Storey survived and reported that there had been a large explosion forward which rocked the turret, breaking the left gun in half, the gun breech falling into the working chamber and the right gun coming off its <b>trunnions.</b> Cordite in the working chamber caught fire and produced poisonous fumes that asphyxiated some of the turret's crew. It is doubtful that an explosion forward could have done this, so 'Q' turret may have been struck by the second shell. A further explosion, possibly from shells breaking loose, shook the aft end of the ship as it began to roll over and sink. The battlecruiser behind her, , was showered with debris from the explosion and forced to steer to port to avoid her remains. 1,266 crewmen were lost; eighteen survivors were picked up by the destroyers , , and , and two by the Germans.|$|E

40|$|This thesis compiles {{information}} {{of a kind}} of bracket named “Trunnion cap” which is used at some of the loaders and trucks that are developed at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB in Örebro, the information is needed to create a technical guideline for design of new <b>trunnion</b> caps. The thesis is limited to investigate <b>trunnion</b> caps that are used to attach steering cylinders on six different vehicles, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 and ST 1520. It investigates what angles the force generated by the steering cylinders acts from, which varies from a range of 6 to 96 degrees depending on which vehicle and frame it is. The forces generated by the steering cylinder have also been calculated regarding the maximum pressure which is between 21, 5 and 30 MPa for the different vehicles. Any kind of useful information from customers has also been searched partly by asking employees at Atlas Copco customer centres around the world if they are aware of any occasions were <b>trunnion</b> caps or bolts to <b>trunnion</b> caps have broke down. The results indicate that no problems exist today and that old problems had to do with lack of service. Even the internal databases for service reports have been searched for failures that regard parts to <b>trunnion</b> caps but no relevant information was found. The tolerances for the holes in the <b>trunnion</b> caps and to the pins that are assembled to the <b>trunnion</b> caps has also been identified with a result that vary, some assemblies have a tight fitting while others have a loose fitting. Finally has the availability of bolts with property class 8. 8 and 10. 9 been investigated where it has been noticed that the lead time for bolts with property class 8. 8 more often is shorter than it is for bolts with property class 10. 9. Detta examensarbete sammanställer och tar fram information om en typ av fäste som kallas “Trunnion cap” som används på några av de truckar och lastare som utvecklas på Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB i Örebro. Informationen behövs för att skapa en konstruktionsriktlinje för <b>trunnion</b> caps. Arbetet är begränsat till att undersöka de <b>trunnion</b> caps som används vid infästning av styrcylindrar på sex olika fordon, MT 436 B, MT 5020, MT 6020, ST 1030, ST 14 och ST 1520. Det undersöker från vilka vinklar kraften som genereras av styrcylindern verkar från. Dessa vinklar verkar inom ett intervall från 6 till 96 grader. Själva kraften har också beräknats med avseende på maximalt styrtryck vilket varierar från 21, 5 till 30 MPa beroende på fordon. Värdefull information från kunder har också eftersökts delvis genom att fråga anställda vid några av Atlas Copcos marknadsbolag runt om i världen om de är medvetna om några tillfällen då <b>trunnion</b> caps eller bultar till <b>trunnion</b> caps har havererat. Svaren på denna fråga tyder på att inga problem existerar idag men att de problem som funnits tidigare berott på bristande service. Även Atlas Copcos interna databaser för servicerapporter har genomsökts på rapporter som rör delar till <b>trunnion</b> caps, dock utan att någon relevant information hittats. Examensarbetet har även sammanställt de toleranser som hålen i <b>trunnion</b> caps:en samt axeln som monteras dit har. Resultatet varierar då några sammanställningar har greppassning medan andra har spelpassning. Slutligen har även tillgängligheten på bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 och 10. 9 undersökts där det har noterats att ledtiden för bult med hållfasthetsklass 8. 8 i allmänhet är kortare än för bultar med hållfasthetsklass 10. 9...|$|R
