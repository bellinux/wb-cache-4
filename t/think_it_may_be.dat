25|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{taken that}} we owe the sailors' working song {{as we now}} possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and {{to the establishment of}} a Yankee marine.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> one of the biggest stories in Hollyoaks history. It's very, very serious and I think it will really divide the audience. It will really test them and their {{relationship}} to the nth degree, and we'll see whether they can recover from it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Architecture {{historian}} Andrew Dolkart <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> [...] "the most flamboyant {{apartment house}} in New York," [...] with its striking, [...] "French-inspired" [...] sculpted figures {{and an enormous}} iron gate [...] "reminiscent of those that guard French palaces." ...|$|R
2500|$|A eugenicist {{who applied}} his social Darwinism to entire nations, Pearson saw war against [...] "inferior races" [...] as a logical {{implication}} {{of the theory of}} evolution [...] "My view – and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> called the scientific view of a nation," [...] he wrote, [...] "is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races." [...] He reasoned that, if August Weismann's theory of germ plasm is correct, the nation is wasting money when it tries to improve people who come from poor stock.|$|E
2500|$|Collier's {{views on}} {{religion}} and ethics are interesting for their comparison with the views of Thomas and Julian Huxley, both of whom gave Romanes lectures on that subject. In The religion of an artist (1926) Collier explains [...] "It [...] is mostly concerned with ethics apart from religion... I {{am looking forward to}} a time when ethics will have taken the place of religion... My religion is really negative. [...] can be attained by other means which are less conducive to strife and which put less strain on upon the reasoning faculties." [...] On secular morality: [...] "My standard is frankly utilitarian. As far as morality is intuitive, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> reduced to an inherent impulse of kindliness towards our fellow citizens." [...] His views on ethics, then, were very close to the agnosticism of T.H. Huxley and the humanism of Julian Huxley.|$|E
2500|$|The plagues {{seemed to}} affect [...] "all {{the land of}} Egypt", but the {{children}} of Israel were unaffected. For the last plague, the Torah indicates that they were only spared from the final plague by sacrificing the Paschal lamb, marking their place directly above their doors with the lamb's blood, and hastily eating the roasted sacrifice together with unleavened bread (now known as Matzoh) which they took from their ovens in haste, as they made ready for the Exodus. The Torah describes God as actually passing through Egypt to kill all firstborn children and cattle, but passing over (hence [...] "Passover") houses which have the sign of lambs' blood on the doorpost. It is debated whether it was actually God who came through the streets {{or one of his}} angels. Some also <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the Holy Spirit. It is most commonly known as the [...] "Angel of Death". The night of this plague, Pharaoh finally relents and sends the Israelites away under their terms.|$|E
50|$|He {{was missing}} from the Olympic Games as because he tested {{positive}} for a banned substance. Chang denies taking any banned drugs and <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> because of medication he took. As {{a result of the}} test he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> banned for 3 years.|$|R
5000|$|Billy goes to House {{and tells}} him he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> too hard {{to live with her}} now. [...] "It's always hard," [...] House says.

50|$|Father Jacob {{is called}} in by Father Daniel to {{investigate}} reports of demonic possession in a prison. Father Jacob <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{a case of}} possession by a saint and not a demon; the first in all of recorded church history. Cardinal Bukovak begins {{to take a more}} active role in stopping Father Jacob's pursuit of performing exorcisms.|$|R

On the idea of God: [...] "People may claim without much exaggeration that the belief in God is universal. They omit to add that superstition, often of the most degraded kind, is just as universal". And [...] "An omnipotent Deity who sentences even the vilest of his creatures to eternal torture is infinitely more cruel than the cruellest man". And on the Church: [...] "To me, as to most Englishmen, the triumph of Roman Catholicism would mean an unspeakable disaster to the cause of civilization".

60|$|In this memorable epistle, he {{considers}} such excesses as fatalities {{arising from the}} very nature of things, and consequently not to be punished. He allows a space of time for the duration of these agitations; and lest he should be thought rigid and too scanty in his measure, he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> long. But he would have things to cease at length. But when? and where?--When they may approach his own person.|$|R

5000|$|The {{surviving}} {{material of}} the Westcar Papyrus consists of twelve columns written in hieratic script. Miriam Lichtheim dates the document to the Hyksos period (18th to 16th century BC) and {{states that it}} is written in classical Middle Egyptian. Linguist and Egyptologist Verena Lepper <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> possible that the Westcar Papyrus had already been written during the 13th dynasty.

A widower, he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> helpful to have a loving and caring wife at his side and focuses his attention on Madeleine Lee.

5000|$|The Egyptian god Ptah {{is given}} the title ḏū gitti 'Lord of Gath' in a prism from Lachish which has on its {{opposite}} face the name of Amenhotep II (c. 1435-1420 BCE) The title ḏū gitti {{is also found in}} Serābitṭ text 353. Cross (1973, p. 19) points out that Ptah is often called the Lord (or one) of eternity and <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> this identification of ʼĒl with Ptah that lead to the epithet ’olam 'eternal' being applied to ʼĒl so early and so consistently.
