40|$|While {{numerous}} studies of aldosterone 18 -glucuronide excretion in pregnancy {{have been published}} few data have been available about the other major catabolite of aldosterone, the 3 [alpha], 5 [beta]-tetrahydro derivative. Tetrahydroaldosterone, measured by gas Chromatographie techniques, is higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase of nonpregnant young women. A wide range in tetrahydroaldosterone excretion was noted in pregnant subjects on unrestricted salt intake at the same stage of gestation. While some values remained at those levels encountered during the menstrual cycle, even in the last trimester of pregnancy, the average excretion generally rose with added weeks of gestation. The increases in tetrahydroaldosterone excretion are smaller than those reported by other workers for the 8 -glucuronide aldosterone metabolite, supporting the suggestion made by K. M. Jones, R.

40|$|Extensive {{analysis}} of flat-plate radiative panels operation using average hourly weather data for a maritime climate region was performed. The panels are integrated {{in the space}} ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. Their primary function is to prepare sufficient quantity of cold water, integrating radiative and convective cooling, that is collected in the cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank. A simulation model for the parametric {{analysis of}} the system in summer operating conditions and influence of its components on the system 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> was developed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze and improve the {{transient}} stability of an industrial {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system in a high-tech science park in Taiwan. The CHP system installed two 161 [*]kV/ 161 [*]kV high-impendence transformers to connect with Taipower System (TPS) for both decreasing the short-circuit fault current and increasing the fault critical clearing time. The transient stabilities of three types of operation modes in CHP units, 3 G 1 S, 2 G 1 S, and 1 G 1 S, are analyzed. Under the 3 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> mode, the system frequency is immediately restored to 60 [*]Hz after tie line tripping with the TPS. Under the 1 G 1 S and 2 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> modes, the system frequencies will continuously decrease and eventually become unstable.

The proposed rules aim at generating competitive prices based on monitoring the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> conditions, thus maximising the profit from selling electricity to the utility grid throughout the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. A decision tree based linear programming and fuzzy system are developed to generate the proposed rules.

To simulate the behaviour of electronic competition, we have implemented a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to represent the performance of two competitive sellers and one buyer under uniform and discriminatory pricing rules. As a case study, our proposed pricing rules are tested on the power grid of the Joondalup campus of Edith Cowan University in Western Australia.
