5|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Lithuania, Gens {{headed the}} Jewish {{hospital}} in Vilnius before {{the formation of}} the ghetto in September 1941. He was appointed chief of the ghetto police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of the ghetto Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions in the ghetto and believed that it was possible <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>some</b> Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in Ponary in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>some</b> Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>some</b> Chicago inmates on death row {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E
5|$|Grenier {{directed}} his well-managed retreat {{along the road}} toward Haag, with all the units falling back in an orderly echelon. <b>To</b> <b>save</b> <b>some</b> artillery from capture, the 2nd Dragoons charged their pursuers and captured 100 Austrians. After falling back , the French soldiers reached the open ground around Haag, where they assumed a defensive position. All told, the battle lasted six hours. In addition to the Latour Dragoons, the most heavily engaged Austrian units were the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment (IR) # 3 and the Waldeck Dragoons # 7 from Riesch's column, plus IR # 60 and the Vecsey Hussars # 4 from Johann Kollowrat's column.|$|E

5|$|Puritans {{believed}} that God is sovereign {{over all of}} history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of predestination, or choice <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>some</b> people, to the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving {{those who had been}} chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>some.</b> By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E

25|$|Reformed theologians {{teach that}} sin so affects human nature {{that they are}} unable even to {{exercise}} faith in Christ by their own will. While people are said to retain will, in that they willfully sin, they are unable not to sin because of the corruption of their nature due to original sin. Reformed Christians believe that God predestined some people to be saved. This choice by God <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>some</b> is held to be unconditional and not based on any characteristic or action {{on the part of}} the person chosen. This view is opposed to the Arminian view that God's choice of whom to save is conditional or based on his foreknowledge of who would respond positively to God.|$|E
25|$|The No.7 Razorbacks {{swept the}} No.25 Georgia Bulldogs. In game one, {{televised}} by ESPN2, Drew Smyly limited the Bulldogs to five hits with seven strikeouts and no walks {{as he went}} the distance. He got ten runs {{of support from the}} Razorback offense, led by an Andy Wilkins home run in the first inning and Bo Bigham, who reached base five times. Game two was another 10–2 win for the Razorbacks behind a strong seven-inning outing by Brett Eibner. The junior from Houston also had four RBI to help his cause. Collin Kuhn went 4 for 5 at the plate, falling a home run short of the cycle. The Razorback offense continued to excel in game three. Freshman Monk Kreder hit his second longball of the year, and Brett Eibner made a fine catch in the second inning <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>some</b> Georgia runs. At the conclusion of the Georgia series, Arkansas has won eleven straight games.|$|E
50|$|Rigel was a {{large black}} Newfoundland dog who was said <b>to</b> have <b>saved</b> <b>some</b> of the {{survivors}} of the sinking of the RMS Titanic. One account of the story was published in the New York Herald, April 21, 1912, the other was the book Sinking of the Titanic and Great sea disasters by Logan Marshall, published 1912. However, although the story has been widely reproduced, there is doubt about whether the dog actually existed.|$|R
