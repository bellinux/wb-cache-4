5|$|In November 1941, Kesselring was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief South and {{was transferred to}} Italy along with his Luftflotte 2 staff, which {{for the time being}} also functioned as his Commander-in-Chief South staff. Only in January 1943 did he form his headquarters into a true theatre staff and create a separate staff to control Luftflotte 2. As a <b>theatre</b> <b>commander,</b> he was answerable directly to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) and commanded ground, naval and air forces, but this was of little importance at first as most German units were under Italian operational control.|$|E

He was awarded the American Legion of Merit on 27 August 1943 and awarded the Grand Cross of the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta on 1 October 1943. He went on to be Commander of Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, which took in an expanded group of air forces, in December 1943.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola {{included}} land, naval and air forces, {{which came}} under the joint command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Angola. Until 17 June 1961, there was not an appointed Commander-in-Chief, with the joint command {{in the early stages}} of the conflict being exercised by the commanders of the land forces, generals Monteiro Libório (until June 1961) and Silva Freire (from June to September, 1961). From then on, the role of Commander-in-Chief was performed successively by the generals Venâncio Deslandes (1961-1962, also serving as Governor-General), Holbeche Fino (1962-1963), Andrade e Silva (1963-1965), Soares Pereira (1965-1970), Costa Gomes (1970-1972), Luz Cunha (1972-1974) and Franco Pinheiro (1974), all of them from the Army, except the first one who was from the Air Force. The Commander-in-Chief served as the <b>theatre</b> <b>commander</b> and coordinated the forces of the three branches stationed in the province, with the respective branch commanders serving as assistant commanders-in-chief. With the course of the conflict, the operational role of the Commander-in-Chief and of his staff was increasingly reinforced at the expense of the branch commanders. In 1968, the Military Area 1 - responsible for the Dembos rebelled area - was established under the direct control of the Commander-in-Chief and, from 1970, the military zones were also put under his control, with the Eastern Military Zone becoming a joint command. When the conflict erupted, the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola only included 6500 men, of which 1500 were Metropolitans (Europeans) and the remaining were locals. By the end of the conflict, the number had increased to more than 65 000, of which 57.6% were Metropolitans and the remaining were locals.|$|E
500|$|Allied forces misinterpreted the Ke {{preparations}} as {{the beginning}} of another Japanese offensive to try to retake Guadalcanal. At the same time, Admiral William Halsey, Jr., the Allied <b>theatre</b> <b>commander,</b> was under pressure from his superiors to complete the replacement of the 2nd Marine Regiment, which had been in combat on Guadalcanal since August, with fresh Army troops. Halsey hoped to take advantage of what he believed was an impending Japanese offensive to draw Japanese naval forces into a battle, {{while at the same time}} delivering the replacement Army troops to Guadalcanal. On 29 January 1943, Halsey sent five task forces [...] toward the southern Solomons area to cover the relief convoy and to engage any Japanese naval forces that came into range. These five task forces included two fleet carriers, two escort carriers, three battleships, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{appointment}} of Gamelin {{led to a}} further change of location, as he sought to reconcile his roles as <b>theatre</b> <b>commander</b> (demanding {{close proximity to the}} field armies) and as commander-in-chief (which required working alongside the Paris-based Minister of National Defence). [...] Gamelin established his own command post, separate from the GQG structure, at the Château de Vincennes in the eastern suburbs of Paris, a site originally earmarked for the command post of the French Navy. [...] By doing so he avoided direct pressure from the political body and involvement with the day-to-day affairs of the GQG, still sited at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre and Meaux.|$|E
2500|$|Early on 2 May the German <b>Theatre</b> <b>commander,</b> Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, {{agreed to}} Field Marshal Alexander's {{surrender}} terms and broadcast orders to cease fire. [...] By 3 May, the South African Division was north east of Milan when General Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin delivered {{the surrender of}} the German forces in Italy to General Clark in Florence. [...] This was followed by Winston Churchill's announcement {{of the end of}} the war in Europe on 8 May 1945. [...] The division held a major victory parade at the Monza motor racing circuit on 14 July 1945 attended by Generals Clark (15th Army Group) and Truscott (5th Army) as well as commanders of numerous formations in the region. [...] During this parade, numerous US awards were made to men within the division, including the Legion of Merit (Commander) being awarded to General Poole.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, {{chief of}} the Abwehr, {{originally}} reported 5,000 British troops on Crete and no Greek forces. It {{is not clear whether}} Canaris, who had an extensive intelligence network at his disposal, was misinformed or was attempting to sabotage Hitler's plans (Canaris was killed much later in the war for supposedly participating in the 20 July Plot). Abwehr also predicted the Cretan population would welcome the Germans as liberators, due to their strong republican and anti-monarchist feelings and would want to receive the [...] "...favourable terms which had been arranged on the mainland..." [...] While the late republican prime minister of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos, had been a Cretan and support for his ideas was strong on the island, the Germans seriously underestimated Cretan loyalty. King George and his entourage escaped from Greece via Crete, with the help of Greek and Commonwealth soldiers, Cretan civilians and even a band of prisoners who had been released from captivity by the Germans. 12th Army Intelligence painted a less optimistic picture, but also underestimated the number of British Commonwealth forces and the number of Greek troops who had been evacuated from the mainland. General Alexander Löhr, the <b>theatre</b> <b>commander,</b> was convinced the island could be taken with two divisions, but decided to keep 6th Mountain Division in Athens as a reserve.|$|E
5000|$|The {{planning}} of Operation Fortitude {{came under the}} auspices of the London Controlling Section (LCS), a secret body set up to manage Allied deception strategy during the war. However, the execution of each plan fell to the various <b>theatre</b> <b>commanders,</b> in the case of Fortitude this was Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) under General Dwight D. Eisenhower. A special section, Ops (B), was established at SHAEF to handle the operation (and all of the theatre's deception warfare). The LCS retained responsibility for what was called [...] "Special Means"; the use of diplomatic channels and double-agents.|$|R
5000|$|Naval Ultra {{was handled}} {{differently}} from Army and Air Force Ultra because the Admiralty was an operational HQ and could give orders during a battle; while the Imperial General Staff (Army) and Air Staff would give directives to <b>theatre</b> <b>commanders</b> general orders say to [...] "clear the enemy out of Africa" [...] with discretion {{over how to}} do it. Verbatim translations of naval decodes {{were sent to the}} Naval Intelligence Division (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC) in London and nowhere else (except for some naval intelligence sent directly from Bletchley to Commanders-in-Chief in the Mediterranean).|$|R
5|$|In June 1944, the USAAF's XX Bomber Command began flying combat {{operations}} with B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers from air bases near Kharagpur in northeastern India. Although the Command's primary {{role was to}} attack industrial targets in the Japanese home islands, approximately 50 percent of its missions were undertaken to support other Allied operations in the Pacific. The XXBomber Command reported to the USAAF's Twentieth Air Force, which was personally directed from Washington, D.C., by {{the commander of the}} USAAF General Henry H. Arnold, rather than the Allied <b>theatre</b> <b>commanders</b> in India and China. Major General Curtis LeMay assumed command of XXBomber Command on 29August after Arnold relieved its first commander.|$|R
2500|$|When Lucian Truscott's 3rd Division {{was first}} {{selected}} for the operation, he pointed out to Clark that the position was a death trap {{and there would be}} no survivors. Agreeing, Clark canceled the operation, but Prime Minister Churchill revived it. Apparently the two allies had different concepts: the Americans viewed such a landing as another distraction from Cassino, but if they could not break through at Cassino, the men at Anzio would be trapped. Churchill and the British high command envisioned an outflanking movement ending with the capture of Rome. Mediterranean <b>Theatre</b> <b>commander</b> General Dwight D. Eisenhower, leaving to take command of Operation Overlord, left the decision up to Churchill with a warning about German unpredictability. Both sides finally agreed that the troops could not remain at Anzio, but Lucas received somewhat equivocal orders. He was to lead the Fifth Army's U.S. VI Corps in a surprise landing in the Anzio area, and make a rapid advance into the Alban Hills to cut German communications and [...] "threaten the rear of the German XIV Panzer Corps" [...] under General Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin. It was hoped that this threat would draw Germany's forces away from the Cassino area and facilitate an Allied breakthrough there. No one saw the point of taking the Alban Hills, nor was Churchill's idea of a flanking movement expressed.|$|E

50|$|On 4 April 1944, {{a special}} {{strategic}} command was established, {{to be known}} as the Twentieth Air Force, which would carry out the aerial assault against Japan. This was done at the insistence of General Arnold himself, mainly to avoid having the B-29s being diverted to tactical missions under pressure from CBI <b>theatre</b> <b>commanders.</b> Twentieth Air Force would be commanded by General Arnold himself at Joint Chiefs of Staff level. It would be completely autonomous and their B-29s would be completely independent of other command structures and would be dedicated exclusively against strategic targets in Japan. The operational vehicle was to be the 58th Bombardment Wing (Very Heavy) of XX Bomber Command.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} modern grand {{strategy}} is {{the decision of}} the Allies in World War II to concentrate on the defeat of Germany first. The decision, a joint agreement made after the attack on Pearl Harbor (1941) had drawn the US into the war, was a sensible one in that Germany was the most powerful member of the Axis, and directly threatened the existence of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Conversely, while Japan's conquests garnered considerable public attention, they were mostly in colonial areas deemed less essential by planners and policy-makers. The specifics of Allied military strategy in the Pacific War were therefore shaped by the lesser resources made available to the <b>theatre</b> <b>commanders.</b>|$|R

50|$|American <b>theatre</b> <b>commanders</b> became {{air power}} enthusiasts, and built their {{strategies}} around {{the need for}} tactical air supremacy. MacArthur had been badly defeated in the Philippines in 1941-42 primarily because the Japanese controlled the sky. His planes were outnumbered and outclassed, his airfields shot up, his radar destroyed, his supply lines cut. His infantry never had a chance. MacArthur vowed never again. His island hopping campaign {{was based on the}} strategy of isolating Japanese strongholds while leaping past them. Each leap was determined by the range of his air force, and the first task on securing an objective was to build an airfield to prepare for the next leap.Eisenhower's deputy at SHAEF was Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder who had been commander of the Allied Mediterranean Air Command when Eisenhower was in charge of Allied operations in the Mediterranean.|$|R

50|$|Despite many {{frustrations and}} disappointments, mainly due to {{shortage}} of aircraft, he persevered with training organizers and dispatching {{them into the}} field. The first liaison flight to Poland took place in February 1941, and during 1942 and 1943 European resistance movements aided by SOE scored notable successes, including a raid on a heavy water production plant in Norway. In September 1943 GHQ Middle East, the Foreign Office, and the Joint Intelligence Committee mounted an attack on SOE's autonomy. Despite having the firm support of Dalton's successor, Lord Seborne, the resulting modus vivendi placed SOE's field operations {{under the direction of}} <b>theatre</b> <b>commanders.</b> Sir Charles Hambro, the executive head of SOE, resigned in protest. Gubbins was appointed as his replacement. SOE's position nevertheless remained precarious, and in January 1944 there was a further attempt to dismantle SOE, following the revelation that SOE's operations in the Netherlands had been penetrated by Nazi intelligence.|$|R
500|$|As [...] "one of {{the reasons}} for the lamentable record in malaria control in 1942 and early 1943 was the absence of medical {{authority}} at the level of the <b>theatre</b> <b>commander's</b> headquarters", Fairley suggested that there be a body responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the South West Pacific Area. General Blamey took the matter up with the General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander. MacArthur, who had himself suffered an attack of malaria back in 1904 (and a serious relapse the next year), created the Combined Advisory Committee on Tropical Medicine, Hygiene and Sanitation with Colonel Fairley as its chairman in March 1943. After its first meeting, Fairley met with MacArthur, who emphasised that he did not wish the committee to concern itself with matters of academic interest but to make concrete recommendations on essential medical matters. The committee proceeded to make a series of recommendations regarding training, discipline, equipment, procedures and priorities, which then went out as GHQ orders to all commands.|$|R
