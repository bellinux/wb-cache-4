The police in Bolton questioned his wife, Gina about her involvement in the drugs trade, and his son, Jonathan Jr (nicknamed both 'Mad Pup' and 'Daft Dog') has been charged with selling crack cocaine and heroin. Adair himself was arrested and fined for assault and <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviour</b> in September 2005. He had married Gina Crossan, his partner for many years, at the Maze prison on 21 February 1997. Together they had three children.|$|E
25|$|On Day 33, Daley {{became the}} first housemate to be ejected from the Big Brother House since the show moved to Channel 5. The {{ejection}} was due to Daley's <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviour</b> towards Hazel. Channel 5 later chose to broadcast the footage that caused the ejection which showed Daley slap Hazel's behind, clasp her by her throat and pin her down against her bed. This resulted in Ofcom receiving a total of 60 complaints and it was later confirmed that they had launched an investigation. Daley was later banned from appearing on the show's final.|$|E
500|$|In a 1961 {{by-election}} Mosley was {{an election}} {{agent for the}} Union Movement, supporting Walter Hesketh as parliamentary candidate for Manchester Moss Side. The motor racing journalist Alan Henry describes {{him as one of}} his father's [...] "right-hand men" [...] at the time of a violent incident in 1962, in which Sir Oswald was knocked down by a mob in London and saved from serious injury by his son's intervention. As a result of his involvement in this fracas, Mosley {{was arrested and charged with}} <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviour.</b> He was later cleared at Old Street Magistrates' Court on the grounds that he was trying to protect his father. By 1964, when he began work as a barrister, Mosley was no longer involved in politics.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that audit staff engage in audit quality <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviours</b> (QTB). Auditee personnel interact with audit staff during fieldwork, and their perceptions of QTB are reported in this paper. Interview findings reveal that auditees (particularly those with previous audit experience) perceive themselves as being in a position to detect some shortcomings in audit work; however, few consequences were perceived as arising from the behaviours and they reported a general reluctance to report the behaviours externally, should they be detected. Implications of the findings and areas for future research are discussed in the paper...|$|R

500|$|Wenger has {{directed}} his anger towards referees when decisions {{have not gone}} his team's way. In August 2000, {{he was charged with}} [...] "alleged <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviour</b> and physical intimidation" [...] towards fourth official Paul Taylor, after Arsenal's 1–0 defeat at Sunderland on the opening day of the 2000–01 season. An FA disciplinary commission found Wenger guilty; he received a 12-match touchline ban and a fine of four weeks' salary. He successfully appealed the ban, but was reprimanded and fined £10,000 for his actions. Following the 2007 Football League Cup Final, he called a linesman a liar, for stating Emmanuel Adebayor aimed a punch at Chelsea's Frank Lampard. This led to an investigation by the FA, a fine of £2,500 and a warning.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{sequence}} of events which led to Van Gogh's mutilation of his ear is not known. Gauguin claimed, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave. The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House. Gauguin reported that Van Gogh followed when Gauguin left {{the house for a}} walk, and [...] "rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand". This account is uncorroborated; Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{opened the}} league season away to Sunderland on 18 August 2000. A second-half header from Niall Quinn {{was enough to}} earn the home team victory, in a match where Arsenal wasted {{numerous}} chances to equalise. Patrick Vieira was sent off for swiping his forearm at defender Darren Williams in injury time and Wenger was involved in an altercation with fourth official Paul Taylor in the stadium tunnel. He was later charged with [...] "alleged <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviour</b> and physical intimidation" [...] and found guilty by a FA disciplinary commission. Right back Lauren scored on his debut for Arsenal against Liverpool two days after; Vieira was dismissed off the pitch for the second successive game, with Liverpool being reduced to nine men when midfielders Gary McAllister and Dietmar Hamann were also shown red cards. In Vieira's final match before his five-match suspension, he scored two goals against Charlton Athletic at Highbury in a 5–3 win. Arsenal earned a point away to Chelsea {{in the first week}} of September and drew 1–1 against Bradford City. Although the team beat Coventry City 2–1, they needed a late goal scored by Dennis Bergkamp to draw away against promoted Ipswich Town.|$|E

40|$|Background: The over-representation of Indigenous Australians {{in custody}} is well documented, yet {{little is known}} about whether the health and social needs of Indigenous prisoners are met in correctional facilities. This study sought to {{identify}} common areas of need in a representative sample of Indigenous people in custody, and consider how well prison services were addressing these issues. Methods: The sample comprised 122 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody in Victoria. Participants were administered the Camberwell Assessment of Need Forensic-Short Version to ascertain {{the presence or absence of}} needs in custody. Statistical analyses to determine associations with re-offence were conducted. Results: Findings indicated that prisons were able to meet the non-criminogenic needs of many offenders; however there was a limited capacity to address specific criminogenic needs. Psychological distress, substance abuse, poor treatment adherence and <b>threatening</b> <b>behaviours</b> were considered ongoing needs regardless of supports/interventions being provided. Moreover, these four unaddressed needs were all associated with future recidivism. Conclusions: Effective prison treatment services focusing on these four areas of need are urgently required. Such initiatives require continuation post-release combined with additional assistance to uphold basic non-criminogenic needs acquired in prison...|$|R
