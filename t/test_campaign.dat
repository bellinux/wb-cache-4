5|$|The 1948 {{tour was}} Hassett's second <b>Test</b> <b>campaign</b> in England. A {{diminutive}} right-handed batsman, he toured England under Bradman in 1938, making his Test debut during the series and playing {{in all four}} matches. Following the interruption of World War II, Hassett led the Australian Servicesa military teamin the Victory Tests. He became a regular member of the Test team and was the vice-captain under Bradman for the series against England and India in Australia during 194647 and 194748 respectively.

5|$|After taking 5/18 in an innings {{win over}} North Eastern Transvaal, Johnston was {{ineffective}} in the high-scoring drawn Fourth Test, taking 1/68. He took {{a total of}} 6/52 and scored 24 not out against Griqualand West, and finished the <b>Test</b> <b>campaign</b> with 3/22 in the Fifth Test in Port Elizabeth, taking all his wickets in the second innings as Australia completed an innings victory and took the series 4–0. It was a successful tour for Johnston, with 23 wickets at 17.04, taking the most wickets at the lowest average among the Australian pacemen among those who took more than three wickets. The entire first-class campaign was even more successful; Johnston took a total of 7/37 as the Australians ended their tour with an innings victory over a South African XI. Johnston ended the African summer with 53 wickets at 14.09.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} 1947–48 season, Toshack {{warmed up}} for the <b>Test</b> <b>campaign</b> against the touring Indians by taking 2/64 and 4/65 for New South Wales in an innings win, dismissing Hemu Adhikari twice. He retained his position in the national team, and in the First Test at Brisbane on a wet pitch, Toshack took ten wickets for {{the only time in}} his Test career. In reply to Australia's 8/382 declared, India had been reduced to 5/23 by Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston before Vijay Hazare and captain Lala Amarnath took the score to 53 without further loss, prompting Toshack's introduction into the attack. He dismissed both and removed the remaining lower-order batsmen to end with 5/2 in 19 balls as India were bowled out after adding only five further runs. Bradman enforced the follow on and India reached 1/27 before a spell of 6/29 from Toshack reduced them to 8/89, including the wickets of Hazare, Amarnath and Khanderao Rangnekar for a second time. India were bowled out for 98 as Australia won by an innings and 226 runs. Injury persistently curtailed Toshack during the season, and he missed a month of cricket, including the next two Tests. He returned for the second match against arch-rivals Victoria, and took 6/38 and 2/71 to {{play a key role in}} a New South Wales victory by six wickets. His victims in the first innings included Test batsmen Lindsay Hassett, Neil Harvey and Sam Loxton as New South Wales took a decisive 290-run lead. He dismissed Hassett and Ken Meuleman in the second innings to help set up victory. Toshack only played in one further Test during the season, the Fourth, where he was less successful with match figures of 2/139. He dismissed centurion Dattu Phadkar as Australia went on to win the series 4–0. When fit, Toshack was a heavy wicket-taker; his 41 wickets at 20.26 placed him second only to Bill Johnston's 42 among Australian bowlers for the season.|$|E

40|$|Within a joint {{research}} effort of Astrium and DLR, cold-gas <b>test</b> <b>campaigns</b> with subscale nozzles {{were performed to}} investigate a) the wall heat flux for separated nozzle flows, and b) the plume pattern for an overexpanded supersonic free-jet nozzle flow. For both <b>test</b> <b>campaigns,</b> a thrust-optimized, parabolic nozzle {{was the subject of}} investigation. This type of rocket nozzle, frequently used in the Western world for rocket engines, features two separation patterns during start-up and shut-down, or for engine operation with chamber pressures not sufficient to reach full-flowing in the nozzle extension, the classical free shock separation and restricted shock separation. The objective of both <b>test</b> <b>campaigns</b> was the investigation of the wall heat transfer in both separation patterns, and the investigation of the cap-shock pattern which special emphasis on the partly subsonic core vortex at the centreline. Wall temperatures were measured by infrared thermography, showing that a local heat flux increase is observed in the incipient separation. Furthermore, the formation of vortexes near the wall was observed. For the plume investigation, the core vortex was resolved by means of threads and laser induced grids. Experimental results for the core vortex position were compared with numerical flow field analyses...|$|R
