500|$|On April 12, 2006, the {{governor}} signed the resulting Massachusetts health reform law, commonly called [...] "Romneycare", which requires nearly all Massachusetts residents to {{buy health insurance}} coverage or face escalating <b>tax</b> <b>penalties,</b> such as {{the loss of their}} personal income tax exemption. The bill also established means-tested state subsidies for people who lacked adequate employer insurance and whose income was below a threshold, using funds that had covered the health costs of the uninsured. He vetoed eight sections of the health care legislation, including a controversial $295-per-employee assessment on businesses that do not offer health insurance and provisions guaranteeing dental benefits to Medicaid recipients. The legislature overrode all eight vetoes, but {{the governor}}'s office said the differences were not essential. The law was {{the first of its kind}} in the nation and became the signature achievement of Romney's term in office.|$|E

Tales of Natural and Unnatural Catastrophes, her 1987 anthology of short stories, was notoriously anti-American, and she often cast her homeland in a deeply unflattering light.

40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} {{difference}} in individual shareholder tax rates between dividend income and capital gain (the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>penalty)</b> affects a firm's choice between distributing funds to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases. The {{results of this study}} suggest that, in periods in which the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> increases, firms are more likely to distribute funds to shareholders through share repurchases as opposed to dividends. The results also indicate that the relationship between the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> and corporate payout choice is affected by the types of shareholders who own stock in the firm. As managerial share ownership increases and the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> increases firms are more likely to make distributions to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As aggregate institutional ownership increases and the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> increases, firms are neither more likely to repurchase shares nor more likely to distribute dividends. Division of the institutional ownership category indicates that institutions classified as mutual funds and investment advisors (brokers) have the strongest preference for share repurchases as the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> increases. In contrast, institutions classified as banks, insurance companies and other institutions have the smallest preference for share repurchases as the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> increases. The implication of this study is that individual shareholder taxes affect firms' corporate payout choice...|$|R

40|$|In 2010, President Obama signed {{legislation}} that significantly altered the healthcare {{and health insurance}} markets in the United States. An integral part of that reform is the individual mandate, a provision that requires individuals to purchase and maintain healthcare insurance. Failure to maintain such coverage subjects an individual to a <b>tax</b> <b>penalty.</b> The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of that provision under Congress’s taxing power. Despite the Supreme Court upholding the individual mandate, fundamental questions remain. This Article addresses {{the question of whether}} the use of a <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> to encourage taxpayers to do something that the government desires is normatively a bad policy. Many commentators have contended that a <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> is economically equivalent to the current tax system’s use of deductions and credits to encourage behavior. This Article argues that despite some similarity, there are major differences between the two that should lead Congress to reconsider the desirability of using a <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> approach in the future. This Article also considers whether the use of the Internal Revenue Service to administer and enforce a penalty that has little to do with the correct baseline of income will have an adverse effect on general tax compliance. This Article explores the individual mandate <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> in detail. It explains the mechanics of the <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> provision and points out several ambiguities in the provision that will likely require clarification. It also explores whether the extent of some of the problems in the healthcare system at which the mandate is aimed have been exaggerated. The Article concludes that Congress should reexamine the pros and cons and unintended consequences of using a <b>tax</b> <b>penalty</b> to induce behavior before going down a similar road...|$|R
2500|$|Henry George is {{best known}} for his {{argument}} that the economic rent of land (location) should be shared by society. The clearest statement of this view is found in Progress and Poverty: [...] "We must make land common property." [...] By taxing land values, society could recapture the value of its common inheritance, raise wages, improve land use, and eliminate the need for taxes on productive activity. George believed it would remove existing incentives toward land speculation and encourage development, as landlords would not suffer <b>tax</b> <b>penalties</b> for any industry or edifice constructed on their land and could not profit by holding valuable sites vacant.|$|E
2500|$|For this reason, {{financial}} advisers often encourage {{those who have}} the option to do so to supplement their Social Security contributions with private retirement plans. One [...] "good" [...] supplemental retirement plan option is an employer-sponsored 401(K) (or 403(B)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans. Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee's savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee's salary. Even without employer matches, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a [...] "good" [...] investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into [...] "good" [...] investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed to leave it there to earn compound interest until needed after retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses [...] "self correct", and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns. The IRS has <b>tax</b> <b>penalties</b> for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(K)s, etc. before the age of 59½, and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 70; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s). For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement savings plans have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.|$|E
