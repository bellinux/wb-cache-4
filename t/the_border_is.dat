25|$|Perhaps the {{ultimate}} example of U.S. imperialism and expansionist ideas along <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>is</b> the U.S.–Mexican War.

This two-year-long war was a prime illustration of just how far the U.S. would go to achieve its ambitious imperialistic goals.|$|E

25|$|Victoria's {{northern}} border follows {{a straight line}} from Cape Howe {{to the start of the}} Murray River and then follows the Murray River as the remainder of the {{northern border}}. On the Murray River, <b>the</b> <b>border</b> <b>is</b> the southern bank of the river. This precise definition was not established until 1980, when a ruling by Justice Ninian Stephen of the High Court of Australia settled the question as to which state had jurisdiction in the unlawful death of a man on an island in the middle of the river. The ruling clarified that no part of the watercourse is in Victoria. The border also rests at the southern end of the Great Dividing Range, which stretches along the east coast and terminates west of Ballarat. It is bordered by South Australia to the west and shares Australia's shortest land border with Tasmania. The official border between Victoria and Tasmania is at 39°12' S, which passes through Boundary Islet in the Bass Strait for 85 metres.|$|E
