The book received negative reaction from critics, conservative and feminist anti-porn groups, due to its sexually explicit photographs which many characterized as hardcore pornography. Taraborrelli opined that much of the book appears surprising and not shocking. He derided the whole concept as childish and impetuous rather than an adult book. According to him, though Madonna insisted that she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, the author believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it. [...] "She was being a brat, not a revolutionary", the author concluded. Author Lucy OBrien declared that the book was a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonnas attempt at invincibility, the book appeared as [...] "a curious act of self-destruction". [...] "The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing," [...] stated Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone. [...] "The images are derivative, and Madonna herself seems far too eager to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisels self-congratulatory - and silly - sense of their own bravery, as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary." ...|$|E

[...] The singer said that she had even sent Morton a book of philosophy—The Power of Kabbalah—to try to dissuade him from continuing. [...] "It's a beginner's crash course in what it's all about - that eventually in some way shape or form it would come back round to him, but he either didn't read it or didn't care," [...] Madonna added.

I never saw a groom walk down an aisle with a bigger smile than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip. It's same old, same old."
