5|$|Although {{the number}} of dead and wounded was {{relatively}} low compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the fire, the cultural losses were huge.

5|$|A {{laboratory}} observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began {{within the first}} six days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened within seventeen days (nest leaving occurred within 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place within forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> one of two siblings {{living in the same}} area was likely killed by the other.|$|E
5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death.

5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window.

A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar countermeasures on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the landings in Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Although sea lochs are the boobries' natural {{home they}} will shelter on land in {{overgrown}} heather. Accounts are inconsistent as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the boobrie's habitat. Campbell of Islay {{claims that it}} is specific to the lochs of Argyllshire, as does Emeritus Professor of English James MacKillop. The writers Katharine Briggs and Patricia Monaghan {{on the other hand}} consider the creature's range to be the broader Scottish Highlands, although Briggs does sometimes specify Argyllshire. Campbell of Islay's undated manuscript notes the boobrie had not been seen for several years probably due to the widespread burning of heather in the area of its habitat.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, St Briavels Castle {{had been}} in a slow period of decline for many years, similar to that of several other royal castles in the region, {{including}} Bristol and Gloucester. Minor improvements were made, including various light windows added to the internal buildings in the 15th century, and extensive restyling of the chapel in the 17th century, but not <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> those castles successfully converted to more luxurious dwellings.|$|E

5|$|Chile, {{facing the}} Pacific Ocean, {{has a large}} British presence. Over 50,000 British {{immigrants}} settled in Chile from 1840 to 1914. A significant number of them settled in Magallanes Province, especially {{in the city of}} Punta Arenas when it flourished as a major global seaport for ships crossing between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through the Strait of Magellan. Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> making it virtually a British colony during the last decades of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century. However, the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 and the outbreak of the First World War drove many of them away from the city or back to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> oppression, and destitution, many Zoroastrians {{ventured to}} the {{hazardous}} journey to India. Those {{who could not}} afford the voyage aboard the ships, risked their lives by crossing the hostile desert on donkeys or even on foot. In India, they were recognized for Sedreh and Kushti and were sheltered by their Parsi brethren. There, they formed the second major Indian Zoroastrian community known as the Iranis.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{land was}} {{to some extent}} held collectively in South Wales, as in feudal England, with villages {{surrounded}} by ridge-and-furrow open fields. In contrast, in North Wales, farmers {{living in the same}} hamlet may have co-operated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> sharing plough teams, but land was held by individuals. Throughout the Middle Ages, sheep were less significant than hardy upland cattle. Welsh medieval land holdings, however, were disrupted by partible inheritance (where all the land was shared amongst all the sons of a landowner), creating small farms which often sank into poverty. Partible inheritance was abolished by Parliament in 1542.|$|E

In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded {{the theory that the}} physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
