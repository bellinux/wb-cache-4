50|$|Based on our analysis, {{we believe}} that High Frequency Traders exhibit trading {{patterns}} inconsistent with the traditional definition of market making. Specifically, High Frequency Traders aggressively trade {{in the direction of}} price changes. This activity comprises a large percentage of <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> volume, but does not result in a significant accumulation of inventory. As a result, whether under normal market conditions or during periods of high volatility, High Frequency Traders are not willing to accumulate large positions or absorb large losses. Moreover, their contribution to higher trading volumes may be mistaken for liquidity by Fundamental Traders. Finally, when rebalancing their positions, High Frequency Traders may compete for liquidity and amplify price volatility.|$|E

50|$|The {{exchange}} has {{the deepest}} liquidity pool among all Chinese Commodity Futures Exchanges. According to the Futures Industry Association, the bourse {{has been the}} largest mainland futures exchange by volume for eight years, half the domestic market share in 2007, and captures roughly 2% of global futures market share (including financial futures). A near-tripling in volumes of its benchmark corn future in 2006 saw the contract leapfrog the DCE soy complex to become the single-largest product, with the 65m traded, trailing only Nymex WTI Crude in the global commodity rankings. According to the Futures Industry Association, DCE is the second largest agricultural futures bourse in the world, with a 29% market share. In 2007, <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> volume and turnover reached 371 million contracts and RMB 11.97 trillion (1.67 trillion USD).

50|$|In {{order for}} a market to be liquid {{transactions}} must be executed rapidly and with little impact on prices. Firms pursue cross border listings since it reduces transaction costs via an improvement in market liquidity following the foreign listing. The relationship between liquidity and cross listing lies upon the global competition for order flow (trading volume). Consequently, exchanges are forced to continuously {{look for ways to}} improve their trading processes in order to enhance market quality and maintain or attract order flow. The benefits that companies seek to gain through cross border listing come as a reduction in the firm’s bid ask price resulting in an increase in firm’s valuation, therefore this improved liquidity is more likely to attract more institutional investors. Low liquidity is perceived as a barrier for institutional investors that prevent them from holding the firms stock due to the high trading costs associated in holding this security (Witmer, 2006; Chouinard & D’Souza, 2003). Further more, the proportion of <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> volume that the new market captures along with the trading restrictions imposed on foreigners prior to listing are factors that affect the extent to which liquidity is enhanced. In addition, another factor favouring the enhancement of liquidity, especially for listing firms that come from emerging markets, is the existence of informational links between markets. If informational links for example were poor for listing firms that come from emerging markets cross-listing would actually reduce liquidity and increase volatility on the domestic market as informative trades were directed to other markets (Domowitz et al. 1998 cited in Chouinard & D’Souza, 2003).|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the components of}} trading costs incurred in trading large and liquid stocks listed on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. We find that aggressive orders pay an immediacy price measured by price impact, whereas executed passive orders gain the immediacy price. We also find a sizable opportunity cost from the unexecuted portion of a limit order that more than offsets the benefit obtained from the partial fulfillment of the order. The <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> cost, which includes price impact and opportunity cost, is positively related to order size and stock price volatility, but negatively associated with firm size, stock price, and stock liquidity. The <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> cost has a U-shaped relation with order aggressiveness. Collectively, our study suggests that, to minimize the <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> cost, the optimal strategy is simply to use a limit order submitted at the best quote...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} study on relationship between external debt and <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> in economic growth in Malaysia. Factors such as external debt and <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> {{have been identified in}} order to investigate whether or not these factors have a relationship with economic growth. The problems that a researcher wants to study are how economic growth will be affected by the accumulated external debt in Malaysia from year 1975 to 2005. Besides that, the researcher also wants to study how <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> in Malaysia affected economic growth. This study also wants to discover the relationship between external debt and <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> on economic growth in Malaysia. Data are analyzed by using Pearson correlation, Durbin-Watson, mean square, F value, R Square and coefficient of variables as well as gap analysis through SPSS Program. External debt and <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> are known as the major contributors to the economy of a nation. This study examines the role of these two variables in the economic growth in Malaysia by using a Malaysia time series data covering a period of 30 years (19752005). The results show that <b>total</b> <b>trade</b> is associated positively with the economic growth and statistically significant, but external debt is associated negatively with economic growth but significantly at 0. 05 level. It can be inferred from these results that the external debt has not been utilized properly so as to make it a contributor to economic growth in Malaysia. Besides that, results also do not support the model equation that the external debt contributes to the economic growth positively...|$|R

30|$|Returns in the {{financial}} futures market are the trading-price-value ratios (TPVR), which are the day’s closing prices (DCP) divided by the average money values (Barik and Supriya, 2007). The average money value (AMV) is the <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> value (TTV) divided by <b>total</b> <b>trading</b> quantity (TTQ), i.e., the total money value of business {{that took place in}} the market during the day divided by the total number of contracts for which business took place during the day. The total money value of business {{that took place in the}} market during the day reflects the money supply at the futures market. The total number of contracts for which business took place during the day reflects the trading transactions at the Nifty Futures market. In other words, average money value is equal to money supply divided by transactions at the Nifty Futures market.|$|E
