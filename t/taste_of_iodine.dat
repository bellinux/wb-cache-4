Lack <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> in the {{environment}} {{is one of the}} topical medico-social problems in many countries <b>of</b> the world. <b>Iodine</b> deficiency is an important risk factor for the developmental delay, memory loss, or the ability for analysis and abstract thinking. Traditionally in Ukraine the problem <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> deficiency was relevant in Western regions, but recent studies indicate the existence <b>of</b> moderate <b>iodine</b> deficiency in all areas. The aim of our study was to assess the <b>iodine</b> status <b>of</b> primary schoolchildren from Kyiv. Materials and methods. The examination of 52 children aged 6 – 12 years was performed, which involved a survey of families on awareness of the consequences <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> deficiency and frequency of consumption <b>of</b> foods containing <b>iodine,</b> objective and ultrasound thyroid investigation, determination <b>of</b> urine <b>iodine</b> content in single portions <b>of</b> urine. Results. <b>Iodine</b> deficiency was detected in 87  % of pupils, mostly mild. Diffuse goiter grade 1 was diagnosed in 23 % of patients. To correct iodine deficiency, we have used new generation product — jodis-concentrate as an aqueous solution. Conclusions. Research <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> status in schoolchildren aged 6 – 12 years in Kyiv showed the presence <b>of</b> mild <b>iodine</b> deficiency in 87 % of them (in 68 and 19 %, respectively).

40|$|Iodine is a {{trace element}} that is {{essential}} for the production of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Iodine deficiency had in the past result in many serious diseases and disorders. At present is in the Czech Republic considered mastered. However, Iodine deficiency are vulnerable to specific groups of the population, including pregnant and nursing women, because of their need and the recommended daily dose <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> is increased. Breastfeeding women should receive adequate amounts <b>of</b> dietary <b>iodine</b> for optimal saturation for themselves and their child. Otherwise, exposing themselves and their child risk of diseases and disorders <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> deficiency. Increased supply <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> can be replaced by eating foods rich in iodine. In the event that you cannot increase intake <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> - rich food preferences in iodine, there are various supplements that contain <b>iodine.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this thesis was to evaluate the intake <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> supplements and supplements in nursing women and breast-feeding women to assess the awareness for greater needs <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> and food iodine sources. There were set up the three research questions: How many nursing women used to supply iodine supplements and supplements?, What is the awareness of breastfeeding women need more iodine? and What is the awareness of breastfeeding women about dietary sources <b>of</b> <b>iodine?</b> A quantitative research strategy was used for the implementation of the research. The method used for data collection was made by an anonymous questionnaire. A questionnaire was handed in a printed copy to pediatricians and gynecologists in the southern Bohemia. With the doctors help were invited nursing women to fulfill the questionnaire. Part of the women was invited to complete the questionnaire directly. The research sample consisted of 117 female respondents. The research shows that 62 % of breastfeeding women know why it is important to increased need for iodine during lactation. But only 9 % of women know all the risks <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> deficiency on the mother mentioned in the questionnaire and only one new mother knows all risk <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> deficiency for infants listed in the questionnaire. The recommended daily intake <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> properly reported or estimated 40. 2 % of women. It turned out that 46 % of respondents from the research group used food supplements and supplements containing <b>iodine.</b> Each <b>of</b> these respondents used only one preparation with iodine. The most commonly used products were: GS mamavit, a Smart baby and Femibion 400 and Gravital. 43 % of respondents had used a dietary supplement containing iodine from the beginning of pregnancy and in 57 % of the respondents were informed about food supplements through a doctor (gynecologist, pediatrician). The results showed that awareness of breastfeeding women about food sources <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> is not good. 67 % of women know that settlement higher needs iodine during lactation is possible by eating foods rich in iodine, but all food sources <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> in the questionnaires (sea fish, seafood and seaweed, iodized salt, and milk and dairy products) registered only one respondent. 39 % of women known as a rich source <b>of</b> <b>iodine,</b> seafood, seafood and seaweed, iodized salt, but none of them knew that the rich and a good source <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> is also milk and dairy products.

Deficiency <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> can lead to creation of pregnancy goiter, it also decrease the probability of carrying fetus to term and increase the probability of disorder in psycho-motoric evolution of child. Czech Republic is geographically lined up among the regions with lack <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> in natural sources and food. However, nowadays the iodine deficiency is considered to be managed. But risk groups of population still exists, especially pregnant women can be endangered by lack <b>of</b> <b>iodine,</b> because the need <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> intake in pregnancy increases to 200 250 ug per day and this level must be ensured. Consumption of food rich in iodine can cover the increased need <b>of</b> <b>iodine.</b> Significant source <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> is milk and milk products. Another source is table salt enriched with iodine, but its daily intake is limited. Rich sources <b>of</b> <b>iodine</b> like sea fish, sea products and seaweed rarely occur in our diet. The goal of thesis was to evaluate intake of dietary supplements with iodine by pregnant women and evaluate women's awareness <b>of</b> higher <b>iodine</b> need and iodine food sources. Quantitative research in form of questionnaires was chosen for getting information from higher number of individuals. The questionnaire consists of 15 questions. Answers were gained from 118 respondents living in Central Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia region, Liberec region, region Highlands and South Bohemia. Questionnaire was distributed to gynecological ambulances by employees of State health institution. I visited gynecological ambulances in South Bohemia personally. By evaluation of questionnaire was found out that dietary supplement with iodine use 63 % pregnant women in researched population. All respondents always use only one type of dietary supplement. Among the most used belong "Chytré miminko", "GS mamavit" and "Femibion 800 ". 68 % of respondents know the importance <b>of</b> higher <b>iodine</b> intake in time of pregnancy.
