5|$|In Besançon, {{the people}} called for Catholic Philip II of Spain {{to help fight}} all heresies in 1571. In {{response}} to this, the new archbishop, Claude de La Baume, demanded <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> suspected of heresy be expelled from Besançon. Local authorities kept count of the Protestants in the city, expelling fifty of them later. The outcast Protestants took refuge in Switzerland and Montbéliard. In the midst of increasing violence in the region after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, the Protestant personae non gratae gathered in Montbéliard and Neuchâtel before marching to Besançon in 1575.|$|E
5|$|So {{yesterday}} morning the Tories, {{by the hand}} of Mr Calcraft, accomplished the final act of separation between England and Ireland. The only thing that the Fenians still lacked were martyrs. They have been provided by Derby and G Hardy. Only {{the execution of the}} three has made the liberation of Kelly and Deasy the heroic deed which will now be sung to every Irish babe in the cradle in Ireland, England and America... To my knowledge, the only time <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> has been executed for a similar matter in a civilised country was the case of John Brown at Harpers Ferry. The Fenians could not have wished for a better precedent. The Southerners had at least the decency to treat J. Brown as a rebel, whereas here everything is being done to transform a political attempt into a common crime.|$|E

25|$|Lack of {{sanitation}} {{refers to}} the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> would want to use voluntarily.

It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked improved sanitation facilities as of 2015.|$|E

Swamiji came clean in all these court cases. The fact that a guru of a community had to go through trial in court cases, resulted in a character assassination of sorts.|$|E
25|$|However {{the party}} itself argues that its {{earliest}} publications show {{they have remained}} consistent {{in their search for}} a way out of an impasse in Northern Ireland that satisfies nationalist desires and calms unionist fears.

25|$|The American Dream is {{the belief}} that through hard work and determination, any United States {{immigrant}} can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice. According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard. This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} this theory is that authorities were aware of Sydney being attacked {{at the time of}} or shortly after the battle, but deliberately delayed organising searches for survivors. There is no evidence <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> ashore knew of the battle until Trocas found German survivors and informed the authorities. The Sydney Research Group allege that Sydney attempted to radio Darwin to report that the cruiser was on fire and being abandoned. Other individuals or groups have made claims that they heard or witnessed the receipt of messages (either voice or morse) from Sydney, or saw transcripts of these messages. All claims state that transcripts and other evidence were later destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{its release}} he {{reportedly}} sold {{out at the}} pop-up shop, selling over 1,000 copies in less than 24 hours, effectively making 100,000 dollars. Notably, Roc Nation the label founded and owned by Jay-Z bought 100 physical copies at the $100 each price tag. Shortly after Hussle announced additional copies would be sold for $100 at the Slauson Ave Store in Los Angeles. Due to a cost of only 75 cents per unit to press the CDs, each sale of Crenshaw represents a gross profit margin of more than 99% before including recording costs. For this move he has received praise from rappers such as E-40, along with the already mentioned Jay-Z. On October 18, 2013, {{it was revealed that}} the album would be released to iTunes on October 22, 2013 with an exclusive bonus track. However, upon its release to iTunes it did not include a bonus track, but Hussle revealed <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> that messages him their receipt on Twitter will receive a bonus track.|$|E
25|$|When initial {{assessments}} {{were being}} made for the feasibility of restoring the observatory, both the telescope and observatory were in a poor condition {{as a result of}} years of neglect and an arson attempt by some local children. The telescope is made predominantly from brass and thus suffered minimal corrosion and damage. Most importantly the lens of the telescope survived unscathed allowing for restoration. This was carried out at first by several dedicated parents and governors of the school, amongst them Syd Little. Soon after the basic restoration ideas were raised for a larger project allowing the teaching of astronomy on a larger scale. After getting clearance from the original owners of the telescope {{to go ahead with the}} project, Rossall was given funds from the Lawrence House Trust, an educational charity, to go forward with their plans. The centre had an official opening on 26 September 2006 with Old Rossallian and former Astronomer Royal Sir Francis Graham Smith in attendance. The centre's motto is 'Astronomy For All' meaning that it offers courses to Rossall Students but also at a small cost to the general public. Courses also range from beginner to advanced to ensure <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> who wishes to study Astronomy can do so.|$|E

25|$|Sugihara had {{cooperated with}} Polish {{intelligence}} {{as part of}} a bigger Japanese–Polish cooperative plan. As the Soviet Union occupied sovereign Lithuania in 1940, many Jewish refugees from Poland (Polish Jews) as well as Lithuanian Jews tried to acquire exit visas. Without the visas, it was dangerous to travel, yet it was impossible to find countries willing to issue them. Hundreds of refugees came to the Japanese consulate in Kaunas, trying to get a visa to Japan. At the time, on the brink of the war, Lithuanian Jews made up one third of Lithuania's urban population and half of the residents of every town as well. The Dutch consul Jan Zwartendijk had provided some of them with an official third destination to Curaçao, a Caribbean island and Dutch colony that required no entry visa, or Surinam (which, upon independence in 1975, became Suriname). At the time, the Japanese government required that visas be issued only to those who had gone through appropriate immigration procedures and had enough funds. Most of the refugees did not fulfill these criteria. Sugihara dutifully contacted the Japanese Foreign Ministry three times for instructions. Each time, the Ministry responded <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> granted a visa should have a visa to a third destination to exit Japan, with no exceptions.|$|E

[...] Decrying the [...] "tragic" [...] conflict, he urged [...] "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time." [...] Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was [...] "morally right and necessary".|$|E
500|$|Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike {{was officially}} {{announced}} in early 2009 {{with the staff}} confirming the return of Kousuke Toriumi and Mamoru Miyano as the protagonists. Production of the movie started when Tales of Vesperia was still in plot stage. The team discarded {{the idea of making}} an adaptation of the game due to its large length. The team was also against making a sequel or a sidestory due to the required time-consuming character introductions that would make it required to play the game to enjoy. Director Kenta Kamei wanted a movie <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> would enjoy. As a result, it was decided to make it a prequel as they could explore Yuri and Flynn's background. Kamei was originally involved in the movie parts of the Tales series. When he was assigned as the movie's director, he recalls feeling [...] "honoured, surprised and a bit nervous at the same time".|$|E

500|$|Advertisements {{were issued}} {{and placed in}} newspapers. When a {{subscription}} was circulated for a medal to be struck, the copy read: [...] "The encouragers of this great national undertaking will also have the satisfaction to know, that their names will be handed down to Posterity, as the Patrons of Native Genius, enrolled with their own hands, in the same book, {{with the best of}} Sovereigns." [...] The language of both the advertisement and the medal emphasised the role each subscriber played in the patronage of the arts. The subscribers were primarily middle-class Londoners, not aristocrats. Edmund Malone, himself an editor of a rival Shakespeare edition, wrote that [...] "before the scheme was well-formed, or the proposals entirely printed off, near six hundred persons eagerly set down their names, and paid their subscriptions to a set of books and prints that will cost each person, I think, about ninety guineas; and on looking over the list, there were not above twenty names among them <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> knew".|$|E
500|$|As {{the field}} was cleared, silence descended on the arena {{following}} the King's [...] instructions <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> who interfered in the duel would be executed and that anyone who shouted or verbally interrupted the combat would lose a hand. Readying their steeds, the knights squared up and at the marshal's signal, charged towards one another. Their lances struck but failed to penetrate the thick hides covering their shields and the combatants wheeled and charged again, this time striking one another on their helms. Rounding once more, the knights charged a third time, again striking shields and this time both shattering their lances. Reeling from the impact, the warriors drew their axes and charged a fourth time. Slashing and kicking at {{one another in the}} centre of the field, they traded blows until Le Gris, the much stronger man, was able to drive his axe through the neck of Carrouges' horse. As the beheaded beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges jumped clear and lashed out with his own weapon, disemboweling Le Gris' steed in turn.|$|E
500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt <b>that</b> <b>anybody</b> who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|E
