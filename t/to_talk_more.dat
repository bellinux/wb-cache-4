5|$|Later that night, Jerry {{finds out}} from his mother that Elaine knows about the stake out. On {{the day of the}} wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was {{because it was the first}} time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to be able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about their {{relationships}} if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E
5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E
25|$|If Agnes is the fulcrum, then Tobias is {{the energy}} behind the fulcrum that works at keeping a balance in this {{dysfunctional}} family. He is constantly asking people <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> kindly about one another. Or, in the least, it is Tobias who keeps silent while fury flares around him. It is also Tobias who serves everyone drinks, {{as if trying}} to soften the edges of their grievances with alcohol.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, when Aronofsky turned 30 years old, {{his parents}} were {{diagnosed}} with cancer. He began reflecting on human mortality, [...] "That was a really heavy-duty emotional time. I know it's a very young age, but turning thirty marks when your twenties are over and you could start considering, 'Wow, {{one of these days}} I'm actually going to die.'" [...] While his parents overcame cancer, he began to focus on the concept of a young man saving a loved one from a life-threatening disease. He shared the concept with Handel, his undergraduate school roommate at Harvard University. Handel earned a Ph.D in neuroscience from New York University but was uncertain about a future in neuroscience. He recalled the discussion, [...] "Darren and I just started talking about the story. We kept wanting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about it as the story kept getting bigger. I decided to make some life choices to continue working with Darren, because it was so much fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} consideration {{to keep in}} mind is the homogeneity of the group members and settings and the nature of open-ended questions which will drive the members <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> freely from the constraints they might feel during a personal interview.

2500|$|Auditions {{were held}} in many {{locations}} around Australia. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth, the Gold Coast, Darwin and remote locations such as Dubbo, Townsville and Ballarat. Contestants were asked to cook one sausage and one egg whilst answering {{a series of questions}} about themselves and why they {{wanted to be part of}} the show. A second part of the process was a screen test where they had <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about what they would do if they had their own show and deliver a tagline or marketing slogan that summarises their personality and character.|$|E
60|$|After this Cummings {{appeared}} disinclined <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more,</b> and {{the boys}} lay down near Jake for the slumber which both needed so badly.|$|R

2500|$|They sail to Perga in Pamphylia. John Mark {{leaves them}} {{and returns to}} Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas go on to Pisidian Antioch. On Sabbath {{they go to the}} synagogue. The leaders invite them to speak. Paul reviews Israelite history from life in Egypt to King David. He {{introduces}} Jesus as a descendant of David brought to Israel by God. He said that his team came to town to bring the message of salvation. He recounts the story of Jesus' death and resurrection. He quotes from the Septuagint to assert that Jesus was the promised Christos who brought them forgiveness for their sins. Both the Jews and the [...] "God-fearing" [...] Gentiles invited them <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> next Sabbath. At that time almost the whole city gathered. This upset some influential Jews who spoke against them. Paul used the occasion to announce a change in his mission which from then on would be to the Gentiles.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the game's launch, No Man's Sky was claimed to be using the superformula based on work done by Dr. Johan Gielis in 2003, and {{subsequently}} patented by Gielis under the Dutch company Genicap which Gielis founded and serves as Chief Research Officer. Murray had mentioned the superformula while describing the procedural generation aspects of the game in an interview with The New Yorker during development. Genicap anticipates developing a software tool using the superformula for their own product that they can see being used in video game development, which Hello Games would be infringing on if they had used the superformula in the game. The company states they have attempted to reach out to Hello Games to ask them about its use for No Man's Sky but have not received anything back. Genicap said {{they did not want to}} stop the launch of No Man's Sky, considered the game to be [...] "very impressive", and that they would like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> with Hello Games to exchange knowledge with them, but [...] "if the formula is used we'll need to have a talk". Murray replied that No Man's Sky does not use the superformula, and was working to arrange a meeting with Genicap to discuss the situation and their respective mathematics.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November 2012, Thu Minh {{participated in}} Korean global concert M-Live MO.A (Most Amazing) in Vietnam to {{celebrate}} 20 years {{of relations between}} Korea and Vietnam. She shared her thoughts on it saying, [...] "Korea is {{the place of the}} ′Miracle of Hangang′, which affected its industries, economy and technology, so its determination to develop its cultural industry also is very high compared to other countries. Only such cultural exchanges like MO.A for the 20th anniversary of ties between the countries will help them become true 20-year friends". In this concert, she performed her new single [...] "Love you only/ Yêu mình anh" [...] and her big hits from her album, Body Language, in the Mega-mix version by Robin Skouteris both {{for the first time on}} stage. The first song got impressive and enormous compliments on her extremely powerful high notes from the local and international audiences. Controversially, the Mega-mix part had sound technical problems that made her voice from micro a bit smaller and weaker than that of the first performance that was realised by live audiences and the press at the back or up stage. Thu Minh was upset because it was not as good as her expectation without blaming on anyone and refusing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> on this, yet as a singer of a firm stuff, she managed well on stage, performed at her best with enthusiasm and 'burned' the whole stage for it. The Vietnamese audience was excessively shouting out her name and singing along during her performances. Her performances still brought a true pride for Vietnam after Van Mai Huong's not outstanding performance as one of the two Vietnamese representatives in MO.A.|$|E
60|$|The {{effect of}} {{prolonged}} solitude also began even to numb {{the powers of}} his mind. He was fully aware of this, and tried to shake it off, for he shuddered more {{at the thought of}} mental than of physical decay. Among other things, he took <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>more</b> frequently <b>to</b> Brownie, but although the pup was, in many respects, a most valuable and sympathetic companion, he could not prevent the conversation from being rather one-sided.|$|R
6000|$|CURTIS--[Coldly and impatiently.] I'm not to {{be persuaded}} by Big or anyone else. And I'll thank you not <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more</b> about it. [They all stiffen resentfully at his tone.] ...|$|R
6000|$|For a {{while all}} was still and Mr. Toad settled himself comfortably and began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> once <b>more.</b> [...] "No, Sir," [...] said Mr. Toad, [...] "I'm {{not afraid of}} anything." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "As many excuses," [...] {{said the}} Mouse sadly, but with evident relief; {{and then began}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> freely, and of the evil times.|$|E

6000|$|Lapham {{said this}} {{as if he}} did not care <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more</b> about it. He added casually, [...] "Pretty near {{everybody}} but the fellows that owe ME seem to expect me to do a cash business, all of a sudden." ...|$|R
60|$|But Andrew Denton did {{not care}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more</b> that day. He wanted to think, and lay quietly until Beth came on duty. To her he gave {{a smile and a}} word of thanks and again lapsed into {{thoughtful}} silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are very}} glad to see him," [...] said Catherine. And she wished <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> about him; but she hardly knew what to say. [...] "I never saw him before," [...] she went on presently.|$|E

60|$|Horror-stricken and sick, {{the boys}} shrank {{back against the}} rock behind them, and for some time sobbed bitterly over the dreadful {{massacre}} which had taken place before their eyes. But after a time they began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> quietly.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, I do {{not want}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more</b> about it,' said she; 'but if it will satisfy you, I will {{say a few words}} to you in Burmese. Do you speak into this hole?' she said as she took up the instrument.|$|R
60|$|As I {{was getting}} on the stool opposite, <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him <b>more</b> conveniently, I {{observed}} {{that he had not}} {{such a thing as a}} smile about him, and that he could only widen his mouth and make two hard creases down his cheeks, one on each side, to stand for one.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Cristie did {{not want}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> any <b>more</b> on this subject. Nothing would have pleased her better at that moment than to hear that Mr. Lodloe {{had been unable to}} find her a {{suitable}} girl and that business had called him to New York.|$|R
