2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Gibson {{said of his}} philanthropic works, [...] "It {{gives you}} perspective. It's one of my faults, you {{tend to focus on}} {{yourself}} a lot. Which is not always the healthiest thing for your psyche or anything else. If you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> out to think about other people, it's good. It's uplifting." ...|$|E
60|$|Rupert Grant {{seemed to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to collect himself; but he spoke before {{the echoes of}} the door died away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we {{must think}} of {{something}} pleasant for you to do. It may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time,</b> but I know we shall find your niche if we give our minds to it." ...|$|E
60|$|Gerald <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to re-adjust {{himself after}} this tirade.|$|R
6000|$|... "So should I, Mr. Bouncer. Do you {{remember}} the arrangements for the murder in Macbeth? That <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> in concocting;--didn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've not {{answered}} him definitely yet; I've <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> {{to think of}} it, because that seems more respectful. But I shall not accept him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> {{until the}} manumissio testamento can take effect. In the {{meanwhile}} {{we all are}} Taurus Antinor's slaves and must look after his houses until they have been sold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time,</b> Hawkins, but there's no hurry, {{none in the}} world--in the circumstances. And {{of course}} certain duties have devolved upon me now, which {{necessarily}} claim my first attention. This poor young nobleman--" ...|$|E
60|$|When he got {{the basket}} nearly full, the second time, {{he thought he was}} tired, {{and that it would be}} a good plan to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> for rest; and he would go and see Jonas a little while.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] observes Volumnia, having <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> {{to recover}} her spirits after her late castigation, [...] "I suppose Mr. Tulkinghorn has been worked to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Jockey, {{out with}} it," [...] {{continued}} Master George, observing that the Scot, as usual with his countrymen, when asked a blunt, straightforward question, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> before answering it.|$|R
6000|$|... "To edit it?" [...] His wife {{caught her}} breath, and she <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> {{to realize the}} fact, while she stared hard at her husband {{to make sure he}} was not joking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind. These things <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time,</b> {{especially}} with our soldiers, who move so slowly. I dare {{say that there}} was some delay waiting for guns or ammunition or something. I expect that we shall hear by to-night----" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} whispered: [...] "I can't {{seem to make}} out very clear. I guess I got to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to it," [...] he added, leaning back wearily in his chair. [...] "Ever seen much of the manifestations?" [...] he gasped at Westover.|$|E
6000|$|Francine smiled compassionately. [...] "My good creature, {{you have}} {{mentioned}} {{the very reason}} why I should ask. You live five-and-twenty years with your mistress--and then suddenly leave her--and {{you expect me to}} pass over this extraordinary proceeding without inquiry. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to think." ...|$|E
3000|$|... “It is {{simpler and}} less complex than the RELOAD Editor that I have used before. We are {{accustomed}} to its design. It <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to package content and create metadata.” (# 19) [...]...|$|R
60|$|Then on {{the verge}} of {{movement}} he was startled by a ripe mango that slipped from its stalk and fell out of the tree and struck his hand. It <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to understand that, and then he laughed, and his muscles relaxed, and he went on again.|$|R
60|$|Béla and his {{brother-in-law}} had started on politics, and it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> before Elsa succeeded in persuading {{him to have}} that nice walk with her before the sun went down. But now they were out again in the sunshine at last, and Elsa was once more able to breathe freely and with an infinity of relief.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Compose yourself, sir,' said Clennam, 'and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to think. To {{think of}} the {{brightest}} and most fortunate accidents of life. We have all heard of great surprises of joy. They are not at an end, sir. They are rare, but not at an end.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or expect {{too much}} from you? You feel you have borne a good deal, Charley? Well, Forster was right in one respect. We have {{something}} to say to each other, and it may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time.</b> There is a big fir he has just chopped yonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my dear," [...] said Mr. Bucket, {{with his}} head in at the window after I was shut up. [...] "We're a-going to mark this person down. It may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time,</b> but you don't mind that. You're pretty sure that I've got a motive. Ain't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Fulkerson <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to get married, {{and went}} on his wedding journey out to Niagara, and down the St. Lawrence to Quebec over the line of travel that the Marches had taken on their wedding journey. He had the {{pleasure}} of going from Montreal to Quebec on the same boat on which he first met March.|$|R
50|$|When Meakin was {{appointed}} Northwood manager in March 2011, he took Hawkins with him. Initially Hawkins <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> {{to adapt to}} playing at the higher level scoring just once in his first nine games. However, in the following two seasons, Hawkins would finish as Northwood's top scorer scoring 19 goals in all competitions in both seasons (2011-2012, 2012-2013).|$|R
6000|$|The Sorceress <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to {{consider}} this question, before she made reply. Then she said: [...] "Had you not learned {{of the existence of}} the Flatheads and the Skeezers, through my Book of Records, you would never have worried about them or their quarrels. So, if you pay no attention to these peoples, you may never hear of them again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go to {{the island}} and tell our friends to be patient, for {{we have come to}} save them. It may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to release them, for the Magic of the Isle is new to me and I shall have to experiment. But tell them I'll hurry as fast as I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] said Holmes, [...] "I should {{like you to}} offer a reward--coming from yourself, for the {{officials}} may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> before they would agree upon the sum, and these things cannot be done too promptly. I have jotted down the form here, if you would not mind signing it. Fifty pounds was quite enough, I thought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I say a thing, I mean it," [...] Mr. Crewe declared. [...] "I don't pay compliments. I'd {{make it a}} {{point to}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> off to talk to you. You see, so many men are {{interested}} in this thing from various parts of the State, and we are so busy organizing, that it absorbs most of my day." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{spite of}} the cloud that thus hung over the affair, {{every one of the}} chums was glad of the extra time in which to make up the lost lessons. Not one of them had to grind away as hard as before, and Dave <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> off, in which to send a letter to his father and another to Jessie.|$|R
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  29, for images with {{different}} scales (the difference between the left image and the right image scale is 50 %), the scale parameter between pyramid images is 1.4, and the algorithm <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> {{to increase the number of}} pyramid layers from 1 to 9. When the number of pyramid layers is 4 or 5, the algorithm <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> relatively long time.|$|R
30|$|Internal {{validity}} {{is related}} to the validity of the study within the used environment and the reliability of obtained results. The Empirical Evaluation had performed in a controlled environment, which constitutes a threat to internal validity because users were far from any interruptions, noise. However, users have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to become familiar with the environment before starting the experiment; as a result, this threat could be minimized.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Madeline, I know it is. I have {{no right}} to take you by storm in this way, but I trust you will not allow my precipitancy to weight against me. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to think it over--a week say" [...] ("by which time," [...] he reflected, [...] "I hope to be in Algiers.") [...] "Only, if you can, Madeline, tell me that I may hope." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worse and worse, Clara," [...] {{answered}} Mowbray; [...] "you are {{to remember}} {{he is my}} friend and guest, and he must not be affronted in my house. Leave things to themselves.--Besides, consider an instant, Clara--had you not better <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> for reflection in this case? The offer is a splendid one--title--fortune--and, what is more, a fortune which you will be well entitled to share largely in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish to have}} {{a private}} conference with you two," [...] said he, when he had {{surveyed}} me at his leisure. [...] "It will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time.</b> Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards; I {{have nothing to do}} with that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I get settled!' cried Tom, with an {{involuntary}} opening of his eyes. 'Oh, yes, I'll write when I get settled. Perhaps I had better write before, because I {{may find that}} it <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to settle myself; not having too much money, and having only one friend. I shall give your love to the friend, by the way. You were always great with Mr Westlock, you know. Good-bye!' ...|$|R
60|$|Yes. With some {{modifications}} of the saying, I mean that; but those modifications will <b>take</b> us <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> to express accurately.|$|R
50|$|Baillie {{learned of}} Montrose's advance almost immediately, but it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>time</b> for its purpose to become apparent. Realising that his {{opponent}} had gained an advantage and that Lanark's forces were in danger, {{he moved his}} men southward, reaching Stirling by {{the line of the}} modern A9 road. On the same night as Montrose reached Colzium, Baillie was only three miles off at Hollinbush. He arrived late and his men had little rest.|$|R
