5|$|The book's fame spread {{beyond the}} English-speaking world. R. Radau wrote a lengthy review of Un naturaliste dans l'Archipel Malais in the French Revue des Deux Mondes. Radau notes the many deaths from {{volcanic}} eruptions in the archipelago, before explaining {{the similarity of}} the fauna of Java and Sumatra with that of central Asia, while that of the Celebes carries the mark of Australia, seeming {{to be the last}} representatives of another age. Radau describes Wallace's experiences in Singapore, where goods were far cheaper than in Europe – wire, knives, corkscrews, gunpowder, writing-paper, and he remarks on the spread of the Jesuits into the interior, though the missionaries had to live on just 750 francs a year. Singapore was covered in wooded hills, and the sawn wood and rotten trunks supported innumerable beetles for the naturalist to study. The only disagreeable element was that the tigers that roared in the forest devoured on average one Chinese per day, especially in <b>the</b> <b>ginger</b> plantations.|$|E
5|$|Wooller was a {{dissident}} {{member of the}} Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 1991, Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built-in bias when it marked examinations during a recession, and used PE II (Professional Education II) results to show the bias. Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses. Wooller formed a ginger group when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in 1995. Wooller's ginger group opposed many {{of the actions of}} the ICAEW. The merger was shelved after the majority of the ICAEW members voted against it. <b>The</b> <b>ginger</b> group decided to keep fighting for democratic reforms and in June 1996, demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109,000 members of the body, instead of by the ICAEW's council of seventy members. A year later, Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard's key constitutional reform proposals, and Wooller's motion failed by 1,400 votes, including proxies.|$|E

They continued touring for several months before dissolving as unprofitable. Though the first edition of the Sonny Blount Orchestra was not financially successful, they earned positive notice from fans and other musicians. Blount afterward found steady employment as a musician in Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Richard Branson wanted Evans to {{work for}} Virgin Radio, {{so much so that}} he joined him on a Concorde flight to New York to try to persuade him to join as the drive time presenter. In the end, Virgin Radio hired Evans to present the breakfast show, {{replacing}} the incumbent Russ 'n' Jono show (presented by Russ Williams and Jonathan Coleman). His show started on 13 October 1997, the same day that Zoë Ball started as Evans' replacement on Radio 1. The initial contract would only be for ten weeks, until the MMC announced its decision on the Capital Radio takeover. Evans approached David Campbell to discuss buying the radio station and, with Michael Foster's help, they put together a deal to buy the radio station with venture capital supplied by Apax Partners and Paribas, with Virgin Group retaining a 20% stake in the business. The deal was announced on 8 December 1997, and would see the formation of <b>the</b> <b>Ginger</b> Media Group, an umbrella company overseeing Virgin Radio and producing programmes such as TFI Friday.|$|E
500|$|Several other {{references}} to previous South Park episodes are featured throughout [...] "200". It marks the reappearance of Mr. Hat, a hand puppet {{that had been}} frequently used by Mr. Garrison during the early South Park seasons, but had long been abandoned in later episodes. During {{the second half of}} [...] "200", an army of red-haired [...] "ginger kids" [...] attempt to capture Muhammad themselves. Several South Park episodes, most prominently the ninth-season episode [...] "Ginger Kids", have featured <b>the</b> <b>ginger</b> kids, which are children with fair skin, freckles and red hair. In most cases, they have been made the subject of ridicule by Cartman, who views them in an offensively stereotypical way.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gingers</b> {{appeared}} at Push Over 2006 in mid-March, the all-ages concert included Grinspoon, Frenzal Rhomb and Butterfingers. In that month Craig Mathieson of The Age described their sound as [...] "a spiky brew of punk daubed with electro impulses".|$|R

500|$|The {{fight between}} the Super Best Friends, celebrities, and Gingers spills over into <b>the</b> <b>Ginger</b> lair, and Tenorman escapes in the confusion. During the fight, Seaman leaps upon Cruise's back, leading Stan to observe, [...] "Tom Cruise has Seaman on his back." [...] The [...] "CENSORED" [...] box over Cruise disappears, and all present {{continue}} to make jokes {{based on the fact}} that the words [...] "Seaman" [...] and [...] "semen" [...] sound the same. Cruise questions why they are able to do this, which leads to a monologue from Kyle, Jesus Christ, and Santa Claus explaining that the goo does not exist, and that threatening people with violence is the only true answer. In the censored version, this explanation is completely obscured by a continuous audio bleep.|$|E
500|$|The Gingers {{contact the}} celebrities and offer to share Muhammad in {{exchange}} {{for access to the}} celebrities' [...] "goo transfer machine", which transfers Muhammad's power to remain free from ridicule to a target individual. Tom Cruise is the first subjected to the process, gaining a [...] "CENSORED" [...] box identical to Muhammad's, but further transfers are interrupted when the Super Best Friends arrive to free their comrade Muhammad. Meanwhile, Cartman is taken to <b>the</b> <b>Ginger</b> lair to meet Scott Tenorman, the Head Ginger. Depicted as a melodramatic madman, Scott has decorated his lair to represent the Chili Con-Carnival in which Cartman gained his revenge on Scott by tricking him into eating his own parents. He reveals to Cartman that they shared the same father, former Denver Broncos player Jack Tenorman, meaning that by his act of revenge against Scott, Cartman had killed his own father and fed him to his half-brother.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Cartman, as his hand-puppet persona Mitch Conner, narrating a {{flashback}} to Connor's 1972 medical discharge from his Vietnam War {{tour of duty}} in a parody of a scene from the film Apocalypse Now as the song [...] "Time of the Season" [...] by the Zombies plays in the background. Back in the present, Mr. Garrison refuses to reveal the identity of Cartman's father, and instead sends Cartman to Dr. Mephisto. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Ginger</b> Separatist Movement and the townsfolk are negotiating the handover of Muhammad when Mecha-Streisand begins to attack South Park. Muhammad, who is visually obscured throughout the entire episode by a black box superimposed with the word [...] "CENSORED", is taken by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to Dr. Mephisto's lab. The Gingers arrive and take Muhammad and Cartman captive. The Super Best Friends are called to South Park to help; after their powers fail to subdue Mecha-Streisand, they pacify her by having Krishna adopt the form of Neil Diamond and providing her the opportunity to perform a duet with him.|$|E

500|$|Written and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, [...] "201" [...] was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 21, 2010. The episode continued multiple storylines from the previous episode [...] "200", the 200th entry of the series. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone decided to celebrate their 200th episode by revisiting several subplots that had been featured throughout the show's 14 seasons. Multiple celebrities have been lampooned throughout the series' history, inspiring Parker and Stone {{to have all the}} past celebrities join in a class action lawsuit against the town of South Park. <b>The</b> <b>ginger</b> kids—children with fair skin, freckles and red hair—have been featured in several past episodes, where they were ridiculed by Cartman, who views them with prejudice. Cartman uses a hand-puppet con-artist named Mitch Conner who originally appeared in the seventh season episode [...] "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", in which Cartman pretends his hand is Jennifer Lopez and uses many Hispanic stereotypes in his portrayal of her. Cartman regards Connor as a separate entity and has conversations with him, while Stan and Kyle do not accept this idea at all.|$|E
500|$|By this time, Cartman {{arrives with}} [...] "Mitch Conner", a face painted {{on his hand}} as {{one-half}} of a ventriloquist act. Previously, Connor had successfully impersonated actress Jennifer Lopez in [...] "Fat Butt and Pancake Head", and now Cartman and Connor return to the Lopez imitation {{in order to get}} involved in the lawsuit along with the other celebrities. Connor soon secretly convinces Cartman that they should steal Muhammad's goo for themselves to sell on the black market for more than the lawsuit could offer. Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan convince the Super Best Friends to let Muhammad come to town, but only if he stays in the back of a U-Haul truck and is not seen. When the townspeople realize they must bring Muhammad to Cruise's limo, they allegedly put him inside a bear mascot outfit. South Park is about to give Muhammad to the celebrities when the exchange is interrupted by a bomb planted by <b>the</b> <b>Ginger</b> Kids, a group of fair-skinned, red-haired children who are tired of being made fun of for their physical appearance. [...] The Gingers want Muhammad for themselves, hoping to use his goo for their own means. They threaten to blow up the town if Muhammad is not turned over to them.|$|E
500|$|The {{new owners}} of RKO made an initial effort {{to revive the}} studio, hiring veteran {{producer}} William Dozier to head production. A needed cash infusion was realized in 1954 when the 89 acre RKO Encino movie ranch was sold off {{to make way for}} a new tract home development. [...] During the first half of 1956, the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. Other films included Bundle of Joy, a remake of <b>the</b> <b>Ginger</b> Rogers-starring Bachelor Mother which was re-tooled as a vehicle for star couple Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Rogers herself would make a film for the new RKO (The First Traveling Saleslady) and would later comment that [...] "coming back to RKO was like coming back to a picnic you've been on last week, and pick up the bones all around and see what the ants have taken from the lunch that you left." [...] The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific (1955) and The Conqueror (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its $6 million cost.|$|E
