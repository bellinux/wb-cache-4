5|$|Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.|$|E

25|$|Souls {{then begin}} cycles of reincarnation. It {{generally}} takes 10,000 {{years for a}} soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life {{three times in a}} row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> sort of madness, that of love.|$|E
