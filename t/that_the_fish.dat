Henderson proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> market, General Market and Red House buildings, all over a century-old, make way for restaurants, retailers and office buildings while restoring and retaining much of the Market building's original perimeter walls, with a new piazza being created in the General Market.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{religious}} {{incident occurred}} in the central region under Cẩn's rule in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of Đà Nẵng. Local Buddhists began to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> was a reincarnation of one of Gautama Buddha's disciples. As pilgrimages to the pond became larger and more frequent, so did disquiet among Cẩn's district chief and his subordinates. The local law enforcement agencies mined the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the fish again survived. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces, led by Colonel Lê Quang Tung {{under the direction of}} Nhu. The grenading of the pond finally killed the carp. The killing had the unintended effect of increasing the public profile of the carp, with newspapers across the world running stories about the miraculous fish. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he wants to do before death.|$|E

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E

50|$|Fishing {{dates back}} to the community's {{beginnings}} when fishing boats were apparently pulled up on the shore next to the earliest cottages.

25|$|The first fishing of {{the season}} was {{accompanied}} by prescribed rituals and a ceremonial feast known as ″kooyit″. Thanksgiving was offered to the Creator and to the fish for having returned and given themselves to the people as food. In this way, it was hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> would return the next year.|$|E
25|$|An {{aquarium}} must {{be maintained}} regularly to ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> are kept healthy. Daily maintenance consists of checking the fish for signs of stress and disease.

25|$|By 1987, {{water quality}} had {{improved}} sufficiently to try restocking the upper river, and {{large numbers of}} yearling trout were released into the river in April. A fish survey {{carried out by the}} Yorkshire Water Authority a year later showed that many of these were surviving. By 1992, there was evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> were breeding in the river, and naturally bred brown trout were found between Denby Dale and Clayton West in 1994, {{for the first time in}} over 100 years.

25|$|Typically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch {{in fresh}} water, {{migrate to the}} ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are {{restricted}} to fresh water through their lives. Various species of salmon display anadromous life strategies while others display freshwater resident life strategies. Folklore has it <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn; tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems. The percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.

25|$|Reviews of {{the local}} catches have seemed to show no impact of <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> {{operation}} on nearby tuna fishing.

25|$|A {{biological}} {{survey was}} carried out in 1993, near Rother Valley Country Park, and only seven types of invertebrates were found, all of which were highly tolerant to pollution. It was recognised that the straight engineered channel where the river had been re-instated after coal mining was not well suited to the support of life, and so a stone weir was constructed, to help with natural aeration of the water, and to increase the flow velocity so that the gravel below the weir was scoured clean. A bay was constructed above the weir, where fish could escape when the river was affected by flooding or pollution incidents. A trial release of fish, funded by contributions from Rhone Poulenc, Coalite Chemicals and Yorkshire Water, was made in April 1994. Half of the total of 2,500 chub and 2,500 roach were released near the new weir, and the other half at Hall Road in Staveley. It soon became clear from anglers <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> were spreading along the river, and a further 40,000 fish were released that winter. Another survey in September 1995 revealed good growth rates in the fish, and barbel were thriving. Brown trout, thought to have come from the River Hipper or the Barlow Brook, were also found in the Rother, and since these are much less tolerant to organic pollution and low oxygen levels, were a clear indicator that conditions were improving. The following year, chub and dace were released at Old Whittington, and clear evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> were breeding in the river was found. The river had become a self-sustaining fishery again, and organised angling began {{for the first time in}} over 100 years.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{instance}} of religious warfare was perpetrated by Nhu's right-hand man in 1963. A hugely oversized carp was found {{swimming in a}} small pond near Đà Nẵng.

As more people made pilgrimages to the pond, Ngô family officials mined the pond and raked it with machine gun fire, but the fish survived. Nhu's special forces grenaded the pond, finally killing the fish. This backfired, however, because it generated more publicity — newspapers across the world ran stories about the miraculous fish. ARVN helicopters began landing at the site, and paratroopers filled their bottles with water they believed to be magical.|$|E
25|$|The {{researchers}} imaged spawning Atlantic herring off Georges Bank. They found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> {{come together}} from deeper {{water in the}} evening, shoaling in a disordered way. A chain reaction triggers when the population density reaches a critical value, like an audience wave travelling around a sport stadium. A rapid transition then occurs, and the fish become highly polarised and synchronized {{in the manner of}} schooling fish. After the transition, the schools start migrating, extending up to 40 kilometres (25mi) across the ocean, to shallow parts of the bank. There they spawn during the night. In the morning, the fish school back to deeper water again and then disband. Small groups of leaders were also discovered that significantly influenced much larger groups.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} genetic {{structure}} of the North Yorkshire coast, comparing <b>the</b> traditionally insular <b>fishing</b> settlements to <b>the</b> surrounding rural populace. Specifically it was thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> villages might approximate the conditions of the stepping-stone model, which could then be tried and tested, and compared to alternative predictions of kinship from isonymy, Male-cot's migration matrix, and isolation by distance. <b>The</b> results showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> communities were highly endemic; high values of kinship were obtained and were in the order of those given for other isolates. The much more mobile rural settlements provided a marked comparison. Values of kinship predicted from the various models agreed quite well {{with the exception of the}} stepping-stone model.

50|$|Line release {{mechanism}} can {{be attached to}} any suitable RC boat. Instead of using fast electric RC boats, slower, but stronger and more durable RC boats should be used.

25|$|Analysis {{of catch}} returns from 1969 to 1985, showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> caught most often by anglers were barbel, bream, bleak, carp, chub, dace, eel, gudgeon, perch, and roach. Over {{the study period}} the returns {{revealed}} {{that there was a}} variation in the species caught, with a shift from roach and dace based catches, to one of chub and bream, a change that was perceived by anglers to represent a ‘serious detriment’ to the fishery. This led to comments that the river had become ‘too clean for its fish’, and its popularity, especially for match fishing, declined from the mid 1980s. Competition from other fisheries such as well stocked ponds and lakes with better amenities and more consistent catches of fish also meant a reduction in the appeal of fishing the Trent.|$|E
25|$|The creek {{has been}} stocked with {{non-native}} Brown trout (Salmo trutta) by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Fisheries since 1955. Stillwater {{students have been}} monitoring water quality in Brown's Creek since 1998. Recently there is a controversy where brown trout proponents are concerned that native beaver (Castor canadensis) dams are warming water temperatures and acting as an impediment to trout passage. However, the plan to set lethal traps to kill the beavers is controversial {{as the presence of}} beaver dams has been shown in scientific studies {{to increase the number of}} brown trout, their size, or both, in the Sierra Nevada and also in a study of small streams in brown trout's native Sweden, that found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> were larger in beaver ponds compared with those in riffle sections, and that beaver ponds provide habitat for larger trout in small streams during periods of drought. Deep water in beaver ponds provides critical winter refuge from ice in small streams like Brown's Creek. Also, as beaver dams raise the groundwater table, a larger hyporheic zone is created which may be important to trout spawning.|$|E
25|$|Mining {{presents}} a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharged {{into the river}} from old ganister mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill {{has also been a}} significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches is {{compounded by the fact that}} the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, restocking of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.|$|E
