5|$|<b>The</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} {{in her late}} teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes {{to focus attention on}} the sitter. It was not until Hans Memling (c.1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; {{it is likely that the}} angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.|$|E
25|$|Two {{additional}} works cited by scholars as important precedents for Le déjeuner sur l'herbe are Pastoral Concert (c. 1510, The Louvre) and The Tempest (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), {{both of which}} are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian. The Tempest is an enigmatic painting featuring a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> seated and breastfeeding a baby; {{the relationship between the two}} figures is unclear. In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman stands beside them.|$|E
25|$|The breast {{reduction}} {{performed with}} the free nipple-graft technique transposes the nipple-areola complex (NAC) as a tissue graft without a blood supply, without a skin and glandular pedicle. The therapeutic advantage is the greater volume of breast tissues (glandular, adipose, skin) that can be resected to produce a proportionate breast. The therapeutic disadvantage is a breast without a sensitive nipple-areola complex, and without lactational capability. The medically indicated candidates are: the woman whose health presents {{a high risk of}} ischemia (localized tissue anemia) of the nipple-areola complex, which might cause tissue necrosis; the diabetic woman; <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a tobacco smoker; the woman whose oversized breasts have an approximate NAC-to-IMF measure of 20cm; and the woman who has macromastia, requiring much resecting of the breast tissues.|$|E

25|$|The {{contraindications}} for mastopexy are few: aspirin use, tobacco smoking, diabetes, {{and obesity}} are medical and health conditions {{associated with increased}} incidences of nipple necrosis. In resolving the perceived ptosis {{of a woman with}} encapsulated breast implants, the surgeon determines her suitability for a breast lift procedure after explantation, which facilitates assessment of the true degree of ptosis present in the explanted breasts; likewise the assessment of the effects of a combined breast-lift and revision-augmentation procedure, featuring the removal and the replacement of breast implants. For <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> at high risk for developing breast cancer (primary or recurrent), the mastopexy might alter the histologic architecture of the breasts, which tissue change might interfere with the accurate MRI detection and subsequent treatment of cancer; the risks and benefits will be discussed in that setting.|$|E
25|$|Carlito buys train {{tickets to}} Miami {{for himself and}} Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met {{by a group of}} mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him {{throughout}} the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal, where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire. As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly dies.|$|E
500|$|At 14:57, [...] "The Ministry of Lost Souls" [...] is the album's second longest track. Throughout the song's lyrics, Petrucci {{tells of}} a person who dies in the process of saving a woman from drowning. However, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> saved is filled with [...] "regret and sorrow" [...] until she is able to re-unite with her rescuer.

500|$|Sociologist Selvaraj Velayutham {{says in his}} book, Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry, that Manju's {{characterisation}} was [...] "brought out entirely verbally by her". Velayutham {{believes the}} film to be constantly resorting to [...] "existing myths about women and relationships: that a wayward mother destroys her children; that a woman who speaks the 'truth' is always alone; that men are scared of her; that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> different is confused, not sure of herself and is only seeking love from a man but does not know it herself." [...] Velayutham further asserts that the film's only positive aspect is [...] "it does not expose the body {{of women in the}} way it is customary" [...] and that Manju could have avoided her unfortunate set of circumstances [...] "if only she had a 'proper' mother!" ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{this episode}} was to feature the {{recurring}} character Shannon McMahon. However, actress Lucy Lawless became pregnant shortly after filming the two-part episode, [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today" [...] {{and was not}} available for subsequent episodes. Actress Julia Vera {{was called in to}} play the role of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> helping the Smoking Man live in the Anasazi ruins. Vera had previously appeared in the sixth season two-part episode [...] "Dreamland". She later called the opportunity [...] "amazing" [...] and declared that [...] "my greatest experience was The X-Files". The final scene of the episode was originally going to feature the Toothpick Man, the alien leader of the New Syndicate played by Alan Dale, informing U.S. President George W. Bush, played by actor Gary Newton, of Mulder's escape. The scene was filmed, but was not included in the broadcast version; executive producer Frank Spotnitz later said that he was [...] "so happy" [...] that the producers cut the scene, noting that—despite [...] "a lot of debate about it, on both sides"—the scene was unable to top the final scene with Mulder and Scully. On the DVD's audio commentary, the producers mentioned that they had considered filming the shot on the Oval Office set created by The West Wing, a serial drama created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC. In addition, they originally wanted to have Martin Sheen appear as his character on The West Wing, Josiah Bartlet, instead of Bush, noting that the cameo would have been [...] "a nice, sort of wink" [...] to the television audience. Despite being cut from the final episode, the shot was featured as a deleted scene on the season nine video release.|$|E
2500|$|Labia {{reduction}} {{surgery is}} relatively contraindicated {{for the woman}} who has active gynecological disease, such as an infection [...] or a malignancy; <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a tobacco smoker and is unwilling to quit, either temporarily or permanently, in order to optimize her wound-healing capability; and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> unrealistic in her aesthetic goals. The latter should either be counselled or excluded from labioplastic surgery. Davison et al write {{that it should not}} be performed when the patient is menstruating to reduce potential hormonal effects and the increased risk of infection.|$|E

When the child is taken to heaven, the woman flees into the wilderness leading to [...] "War in Heaven" [...] in which the angels cast out the Dragon. The Dragon attacks <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> given wings to escape, and then attacks her again with a flood of water from his mouth, which is subsequently swallowed by the earth. Frustrated, the dragon initiates war on [...] "the remnant of her seed" [...] identified as the righteous followers of Christ.|$|E

[...] Flynt subsequently paid a sum of money to Barr's second wife, Gail Barr, after she had sworn out an affidavit.

While the two discuss the tyranny of images, the German speaking man arrives and the scene plays out as before: he accosts Ivitch, fires his gun, and leaves. As before, a man approaches the shaken woman. This time it is the man that is offscreen and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> onscreen (Ivitch behind metal bars – an image frequently used in promotion of the film).

2500|$|The Didascalia of the Apostles is the {{earliest}} document that specifically discusses {{the role of}} the male and female deacons more at length. It originated in Aramaic speaking Syria during the 3rd century, but soon spread in Greek and Latin versions. In it the author urges the bishop: [...] "Appoint a woman for the ministry of women. For there are homes to which you cannot send a male deacon to their women, on account of the heathen, but you may send a deaconess... Also in many other matters the office of a woman deacon is required." [...] The bishop should look on the man who is a deacon as Christ and <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> a deacon as the Holy Spirit, denoting their prominent place in the church hierarchy.|$|E

In 1970, Mandrell scored {{the first of many}} top-40 hits with [...] "Playin' Around With Love". In the same year, she began performing with singer David Houston, and their partnership also generated considerable chart success. Mandrell's first releases earned respect from her country peers, but her first big breakthrough with fans came in 1973 with the single [...] "The Midnight Oil"; it was the first song sung from the perspective of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> doing the cheating, which at the time was unheard of.|$|E
