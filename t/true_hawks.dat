60|$|The Falkland Islands offer {{a second}} {{instance}} of birds {{with a similar}} disposition. The extraordinary tameness of the little Opetiorhynchus has been remarked by Pernety, Lesson, and other voyagers. It is not, however, peculiar to that bird: the Polyborus, snipe, upland and lowland goose, thrush, bunting, and even some <b>true</b> <b>hawks,</b> are all more or less tame. As the birds are so tame there, where foxes, hawks, and owls occur, we may infer {{that the absence of}} all rapacious animals at the Galapagos is not the cause of their tameness here. The upland geese at the Falklands show, by the precaution they take in building on the islets, that they are aware of their danger from the foxes; but they are not by this rendered wild towards man. This tameness of the birds, especially of the waterfowl, is strongly contrasted with the habits of the same species in Tierra del Fuego, where for ages past they have been persecuted by the wild inhabitants. In the Falklands, the sportsman may sometimes kill more of the upland geese in one day than he can carry home; whereas in Tierra del Fuego it is nearly as difficult to kill one as it is in England to shoot the common wild goose.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>true</b> <b>hawks</b> are {{medium-sized}} {{birds of}} prey that usually belong to the genus Accipiter (see below). They are mainly woodland birds that hunt by sudden dashes from a concealed perch. They usually have long tails for tight steering.|$|E
50|$|The white-throated hawk, Buteo albigula, is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae, which {{includes}} the eagles, hawks and Old World vultures. In British usage, it would be called a buzzard rather than a <b>true</b> <b>hawk.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{short-tailed hawk}} (Buteo brachyurus) is an American {{bird of prey}} in the family Accipitridae, which also {{includes}} the eagles and Old World vultures. As {{a member of the}} genus Buteo, it is not a <b>true</b> <b>hawk</b> and thus also referred to as a [...] "buteo" [...] or (outside North America) [...] "buzzard". The white-throated hawk (B. albigula) is a close relative and was formerly included in the species B. brachyurus.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the downed truck ship are {{disposed}} of by the Yeerks, thus leaving no evidence for the Animorphs to show the world. Tobias is distressed {{over the death of}} the hawk, but realizes that it is this emotion that makes him human, as a <b>true</b> <b>hawk</b> would not care if another hawk had died. Tobias discusses this with Rachel, and begins to accept his newfound balance between being a hawk and being a human.|$|R

5000|$|Ridgway's hawk (Buteo ridgwayi) is a {{bird of prey}} in {{the family}} Accipitridae, native to the island of Hispaniola. Despite its common name, this bird is a Buteo buzzard and not a <b>true</b> Accipiter <b>hawk.</b> It was named after the American ornithologist Robert Ridgway. It is a brownish-grey bird with barred tail and underparts. It feeds mainly on reptiles, but also consumes small birds and mammals. It nests high in a tree in spring. Populations of this bird have been declining because of habitat {{destruction}} and human persecution, {{and it is now}} only found in the Los Haitises National Park in the Dominican Republic and is regarded as [...] "critically endangered".|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Charlie gives Mark a {{bracelet}} she made for him. Mark is alarmed: the bracelet is the same one he saw in his flash forward, indicating that the visions may be coming <b>true.</b> Elsewhere, Janis <b>Hawk</b> (Christine Woods) is checking CCTV from during the blackout. She focuses on a baseball game in Detroit and notices that as everyone blacks out, one dark figure is moving across the back of the stadium.|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} that Hawking {{radiation}} has indeed been measured and shown to posses a thermal spectrum, as predicted. This contention is based on three separate legs. The first is that the essential physics of the Hawking process for black holes can be modelled in other physical systems. The second is the white hole horizons are the time inverse of black hole horizons, and thus the physics of both is the same. The third is that the quantum emission, which is the Hawking process, is completely determined by measurements of the classical parameters of a linear physical system. The experiment conducted in 2010 fulfills all of these requirements, and is thus a <b>true</b> measurement of <b>Hawking</b> radiation. Comment: 5 fig, 10...|$|R
40|$|Prey {{typically}} {{respond to}} potential predators by taking flight. This {{results in an}} optimal flight initiation distance (FID) at which the risk of remaining {{and the cost of}} flight are equal. Thus, FID is strongly negatively correlated with susceptibility to predation by the sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus across species of small European birds. However, not everything that looks like a hawk is in fact a hawk. Aggressive mimicry arises from the resemblance between a dangerous model such as a predatory hawk and an innocuous mimic such as a cuckoo that makes errors made by individuals that encounter models and mimics potentially dangerous and life threatening. A prime example of such aggressive mimicry is the hawk-like appearance of common cuckoos Cuculus canorus and other cuckoos. If mimicry is efficient, we should expect that species of small birds that are prey of hawks and hosts of cuckoos react just as strongly to a cuckoo as to the presence of a dangerous model like a sparrowhawk. We used FID of small birds as a measure of the reaction of prey to models and mimics, predicting that FID would be negatively related to susceptibility to predation and positively to risk of cuckoo parasitism. Both susceptibility to sparrowhawk predation and rate of brood parasitism by the common cuckoo independently explained variation in FID, consistent with the expectation that both hawks and cuckoos have imposed significant selection pressures on FID and that species of small birds perceive cuckoos as <b>true</b> mimics of <b>hawks...</b>|$|R
