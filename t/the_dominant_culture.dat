Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b> Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} about cultural interactions during the Zhou period of China (c. a. 1000 - 350 B. C.) between the Suizao corridor (near the present-day Yangtze River region) and its contemporaries within {{or outside the}} Zhou realm. It mainly, but not exclusively, concentrates on bronze ritual vessels from the Suizao corridor, and discusses the underlying social and political relations between <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures</b> and <b>the</b> regional ones in this particular area (the Zeng state for example), which are central to understanding {{the ways in which}} <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures</b> joined their disparate territories into a whole. Newly excavated archaeological evidence show that there were at least three periods when people in the Suizao corridor learned about the current traditions employed elsewhere, which are: 1) Yejiashan period (from the 11 th to 10 th century B. C.); 2) post-Ritual Reform period (from the mid- 9 th to mid- 7 th century B. C.); and 3) Marquis Yiâs period (from the mid- 6 th to mid- 4 th century B. C.). In these periods, local people in the Suizao corridor were involved in networks of enormous and constantly changing complexity, in which people, objects, practices, and ideas were mixed together through interregional contacts. The choices of local people in adopting foreign materials and ideas from either <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures</b> or other places heavily depended on the subjective view of their social identity, which can be constructed, maintained, or transited to adapt to different social and political environments. </p...|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} regarding {{the beginning of}} the Ethiopian civilisation. One theory, which is more widely accepted today locates its origins in Punt, while acknowledging the influence of the Sabeans {{on the opposite side of}} the Red Sea. At a later period, Ethiopian civilisation was exposed to Judaic influence, of which the best-known examples are the Qemant and Ethiopian Jews (or Beta Israel) ethnic groups, but Judaic customs, terminology, and beliefs can be found amongst <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> of the Amhara and Tigrinya. Indian alphabets have been claimed as the example used to create the vowel system of the Ge'ez abugida.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Díaz was never sympathetic to all Indians. In fact, {{he stated that}} the Yaquis and the Mayas {{had always been a}} pest for Mexico and that they needed to be dealt with. This {{is not to say that}} Díaz loved the rest of Mexico’s Indians. Perhaps, it could be argued that Díaz’s ultimate drive was that of economic expansion. Once Díaz amassed absolute legislative power, his indigenismo went out of the picture. It was not so much about elevating the lower classes into modern society and thus integrating them, but more about the economic and power status of the nation. After all, Indians composed less than half of Mexico’s population and their unwillingness to participate in <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> made them political enemies of the state, especially those who persistently refused assimilation like the Yaqui and the Maya.|$|E
25|$|In 1600, the Delaware / Lenape Native American {{population}} in the surrounding area may have numbered as many as 20,000. Several wars, at least 14 separate epidemics (yellow fever, small pox, influenza, encephalitis lethargica, etc.) and disastrous over-harvesting of the animal populations reduced their population to around 4,000 by the year 1700. Since the Lenape people, like all Native Americans, had no immunity to European diseases, when the populations contacted the epidemics, they frequently proved fatal. Some Lenape starved to death {{as a result of}} animal over-harvesting, while others were forced to trade their land for goods such as clothing and food. They were eventually moved to reservations set up by the US Government. They were first moved to the only Indian Reservation in New Jersey, the Brotherton Reservation in Burlington County, New Jersey (1758-1802). Those who remained survived through attempting to adapt to <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture,</b> becoming farmers and tradesmen. As the Lenni Lenape population declined, and the European {{population in}}creased, the history of the area was increasingly defined by the new European inhabitants and the Lenape Native American tribes played an increasingly secondary role.|$|E

25|$|Ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{have been in}} {{dialogue}} for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting {{with the natural world}} may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, some have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan. Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture. The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike. Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity. It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem to be talking about experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.|$|E

2500|$|Also, {{the term}} is often used in {{relation}} to what is seen as prejudice within a minority or subjugated group, as {{in the concept of}} [...] "reverse racism".

From their perspective, [...] "racism" [...] is defined {{not only in terms of}} individual prejudice, but also in terms of a power structure which protects the interests of <b>the</b> <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> and actively discriminates against ethnic minorities.
