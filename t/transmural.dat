25|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory is that high <b>transmural</b> pressures lead to pulmonary capillary stress failure. There may be contributions from the bronchial circulation. Pulmonary capillary <b>transmural</b> pressure is determined by pulmonary capillary pressure and airway pressure. The horse has very high pulmonary vascular pressures during intense exercise, exceeding 100 mmHg in the pulmonary artery during intense exercise. During expiration the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are opposed by high positive airway pressures pushing back and this does not place undue stress on the thin blood vessel walls. During inspiration, the high positive pressures in the pulmonary blood vessels pushing out are met by negative pressures distending the blood vessel and placing increased stress on the walls.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{in vitro}} show that {{significant}} {{disruption of the}} pulmonary capillaries occurs at pressures of approximately 80 mmHg.

On {{the basis of this}} theory, any factor or disease that would increase pulmonary vascular pressures (e.g. hypervolaemia) or increase the magnitude of the negative pressures in the lung during inspiration (e.g. dynamic upper airway obstruction) would increase the severity of EIPH; however neither experimentally induced laryngeal hemiplegia nor dorsal displacement of the soft palate increase pulmonary capillary <b>transmural</b> pressure.|$|E

In its mildest form, mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage and edema are seen, possibly with mild necrosis or ulceration. With more severe ischemia, a pathologic picture resembling inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. chronic ulcerations, crypt abscesses and pseudopolyps) may be seen. In the most severe cases, <b>transmural</b> infarction with resulting perforation may be seen; after recovery, the muscularis propria may be replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in a stricture.

5000|$|Strain {{in three}} dimensions: Basically, any object or body is three dimensional, {{and can be}} {{deformed}} in different directions simultaneously. Strain {{can be described as}} a tensor with three principal strains (εx, εy and εz in a Cartesian coordinate system), and six shear strains components. In the heart, it has been customary to describe the three principal strain components as longitudinal (in the direction of the long axis of the ventricles), circumferential (in the direction of the ventricular circumference), and <b>transmural</b> (the deformation across the wall. <b>Transmural</b> deformation has also been called [...] "radial", but this is unfortunate as in ultrasound in general the term radial describes [...] "in the direction of the ultrasound beam"). However, as the heart muscle is incompressible, the three principal strain must balance; (εx + εy + εz = 1. As the ventricle contracts in systole, there is longitudinal shortening (negative strain), circumferential shortening (negative strain) and <b>transmural</b> (wall) thickening (positive strain). Due to this, {{and the fact that the}} left ventricle in normal conditions contract with a relatively invariant outer contour, the longitudinal strain contains the main information, while <b>transmural</b> strain (wall thickening) is a function of wall shortening, wall thickness and chamber diameter, while circumferential shortening is mainly a function of wall thickening. It has been shown clinically that longitudinal strain rate and wall thickening are diagnostically equivalent.|$|E

5000|$|Nonocclusive ischemia, {{such as that}} seen in {{hypotension}} {{secondary to}} heart failure, may also contribute, but usually results in a mucosal or mural infarct, as contrasted with the typically <b>transmural</b> infarct seen in thromboembolus of the SMA.|$|E

50|$|Ischemic {{enteritis}} is uncommon {{compared to}} ischemic colitis {{due to the}} highly vascularised nature of the small intestine, allowing for sufficient blood flow in most situations. It develops due to circulatory shock of mesenteric vessels {{in the absence of}} major vessel occlusion, often associated with an underlying condition such as hypertension, arrhythmia or diabetes. Thus it has been considered to be associated with atherosclerosis. Surgical treatment is usually required due to the likelihood of stenosis or complete occlusion of the small intestine. Ischemic damage can range from mucosal infarction, which is limited only to the mucosa; mural infarction of the mucosa and underlying submucosa; to <b>transmural</b> infarction of the full thickness of the gastrointestinal wall. Mucosal and mural infarcts in and of themselves may not be fatal, however may progress further to a <b>transmural</b> infarct. This has the potential for perforation of the wall, leading to peritonitis.|$|E

50|$|Integrated care, {{also known}} as {{integrated}} health, co-ordinated care, comprehensive care, seamless care, or <b>transmural</b> care, is a worldwide trend in health care reforms and new organizational arrangements focusing on more coordinated and integrated forms of care provision.

5000|$|In {{myocardial}} infarction, ischemia of the myocardium {{can extend}} to the endocardium, disrupting the inner lining of the heart ("transmural" [...] infarction). Less extensive infarctions are often [...] "subendocardial" [...] and do not affect the epicardium. In the acute setting, subendocardial infarctions are more dangerous than <b>transmural</b> infarctions because they create an area of dead tissue surrounded by a boundary region of damaged myocytes. This damaged region will conduct impulses more slowly, resulting in irregular rhythms. The damaged region may enlarge or extend and become more life-threatening. In the chronic setting, <b>transmural</b> infarctions are more dangerous due to the greater amount of muscular damage {{and the development of}} scar tissue leading to impaired systolic contractility, impaired diastolic relaxation, and increased risk for rupture and thrombus formation. During depolarization the impulse is carried from endocardium to epicardium, and during repolarization the impulse moves from epicardium to endocardium.In infective endocarditis, the endocardium (especially the endocardium lining the heart valves) is affected by bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|Laplace's law for {{a sphere}} states wall stress (T) is {{proportionate}} {{to the product}} of the <b>transmural</b> pressure (P) and cavitary radius (r) and inversely proportionate to wall thickness (W): In response to the pressure overload left ventricular wall thickness markedly increases—while the cavitary radius remains relatively unchanged. These compensatory changes, termed [...] "concentric hypertrophy," [...] reduce the increase in wall tension observed in aortic stenosis.|$|E
5000|$|Rival diseases: These are the {{concurrent}} nosological forms in a patient, interdependent in etiologies and pathogenesis, but equally sharing {{the criterion of}} a primary disease (for example, <b>transmural</b> myocardial infarction and massive thromboembolism of pulmonary artery, caused by phlebemphraxis of lower limbs). For practicing pathologist rival are two or more diseases, exhibited in a single patient, each of which by itself or through its complications could cause the patient's death.|$|E
5000|$|During <b>transmural</b> (subepicardial) {{ischemia}} {{the injured}} cells are [...] "relatively" [...] {{closer to the}} epicardial surface. In the case of depolarization, healthier cells will typically displace a larger amplitude and duration of depolarization. During systole, a ventricle with subepicardial ischemia will exhibit cells with higher amplitude of depolarization in the cardiac endocardium. During <b>transmural</b> ischemia, the Na+/K+ATPase {{which is responsible for}} the final stages of myocyte repolarization (-80mV to -90mV) is impaired, thus the ischemic cells will only be partially depolarized compared to surrounding healthy (non-ischemic) myocytes.The difference in membrane potential between healthy and ischemic cells causes negative charges to accumulate on their surfaces, generating a vector that points towards the normal cardiac cells (which have positive charges on their surface). This vector points away from the chest EKG leads, causing a downward deflection in the TP segment. However, since the TP segment is the baseline of the EKG, the machine corrects for this by raising TP to baseline which results in ST elevation. Also see ST depression.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of ARVD {{is largely}} unknown. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) appears {{to play a}} large role. It is unclear why only the right ventricle is involved. The disease process starts in the subepicardial region and works its way towards the endocardial surface, leading to <b>transmural</b> involvement (possibly accounting for the aneurysmal dilatation of the RV). Residual myocardium is confined to the subendocardial region and the trabeculae of the RV. These trabeculae may become hypertrophied.|$|E
5000|$|Compliance is {{the ability}} of a hollow organ (vessel) to distend and {{increase}} volume with increasing <b>transmural</b> pressure or the tendency of a hollow organ to resist recoil toward its original dimensions on application of a distending or compressing force. It is the reciprocal of [...] "elastance", hence elastance {{is a measure of the}} tendency of a hollow organ to recoil toward its original dimensions upon removal of a distending or compressing force.|$|E
50|$|Although {{one or both}} {{of these}} {{mechanisms}} may occur, a third may additionally contribute. The large negative intra-thoracic pressure increases the pressure across the wall of the left ventricle (increased <b>transmural</b> pressure, equivalent to within ventricle - outside of ventricle). This pressure gradient, resisting the contraction of the left ventricle, causes an increase in afterload. This results in a decrease in stroke volume, contributing to the decreased pulse pressure and increased heart rate as described above.|$|E
50|$|Zone 3 {{comprises}} {{the majority of}} the lungs in health. There is no external resistance to blood flow and blood flow is continuous throughout the cardiac cycle. Flow is determined by the Ppa-Ppv difference (Ppa - Ppv), which is constant down this portion of the lung. However, <b>transmural</b> pressure across the wall of the blood vessels increases down this zone due to gravity. Consequently the vessels wall are more stretched so the caliber of the vessels increases causing an increase in flow due to lower resistance.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 20% of {{the cases}} of Brugada {{syndrome}} {{have been shown to}} be associated with mutations in a gene that encodes for a sodium ion channel in the cell membranes of the muscle cells of the heart (the myocytes); this is often referred to as a sodium channelopathy. The majority of patients affected by Brugada syndrome are not found to have known genetic mutations to explain the disease, as of 2015. The gene, named SCN5A, is located on the short arm of the third chromosome (3p21). Loss-of-function mutations in this gene lead to a loss of the action potential dome of some epicardial areas of the right ventricle. This results in <b>transmural</b> and epicardial dispersion of repolarization. The <b>transmural</b> dispersion underlies ST-segment elevation and the development of a vulnerable window across the ventricular wall, whereas the epicardial dispersion of repolarization facilitates the development of phase 2 reentry, which generates a phase 2 reentrant extrasystole that captures the vulnerable window to precipitate ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation that often results in sudden cardiac death. At present time however, all the reported patients who died because of the disease and were submitted to detailed autopsy study have shown a structural right ventricular pathology underlying the syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Diarrhea is {{severe and}} may be dose-limiting and is {{exacerbated}} by co-treatment with calcium folinate. Neutropenia tends to peak about 9-14 days after beginning treatment. Thrombocytopenia tends to peak about 7-17 days after the beginning of treatment and tends to recover about 10 days after its peak. Cardiotoxicity is a fairly common side effect, but usually this cardiotoxicity is just angina or symptoms associated with coronary artery spasm, but in about 0.55% of those receiving the drug will develop life-threatening cardiotoxicity. Life-threatening cardiotoxicity includes: arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest, secondary to <b>transmural</b> ischaemia.|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{frame rate}} in B-mode {{is done by}} {{reducing}} line density, i.e. lateral resolution, and thus making the method more angle dependent. Finally, the method on some applications {{is dependent on the}} ROI (Region Of Interest) size and shape. In principle Speckle tracking is available for deformation measurement in all directions, however, due to the limitation of lateral resolution in apical images, measuring circumferential and <b>transmural</b> deformation needs parasternal cross sectional views. On the other hand, compared to Tissue Doppler, that method is mainly only available for longitudinal measures from the apical position.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling is an important regulator of vascular smooth muscle contraction. When <b>transmural</b> pressure increases, sphingosine kinase 1 phosphorylates sphingosine to S1P, which binds to the S1P2 receptor in plasma membrane of cells. This leads to a transient increase in intracellular calcium, and activates Rac and Rhoa signaling pathways. Collectively, these serve to increase MLCK activity and decrease MLCP activity, promoting muscle contraction. This allows arterioles to increase resistance in response to increased blood pressure and thus maintain constant blood flow. The Rhoa and Rac portion of the signaling pathway provides a calcium-independent way to regulate resistance artery tone.|$|E
5000|$|Cells in {{the area}} with the worst blood supply, that just below the inner surface of the heart (endocardium), are most {{susceptible}} to damage. Ischemia first affects this region, the subendocardial region, and tissue begins to die within 15-30 minutes of loss of blood supply. The dead tissue {{is surrounded by a}} zone of potentially reversible ischemia that progresses to become a full-thickness <b>transmural</b> infarct. The initial [...] "wave" [...] of infarction can take place over 3-4 hours. These changes are seen on gross pathology and cannot be predicted by {{the presence or absence of}} Q waves on an ECG. The position, size and extent of an infarct depends on the affected artery, totality of the blockage, duration of the blockage, the presence of collateral blood vessels, oxygen demand, and success of interventional procedures.|$|E
50|$|The {{protocol}} of {{loading and}} securing the tissue sample into the inspection zone helps {{understand how this}} approach acknowledges whole organ functions. After immersing the tissue segment into the loading well, the loading process is driven by a syringe withdrawing a constant flow rate of buffer solution {{at the far end}} of the loading channel. This causes the transport of the artery towards its dedicated position. This is done with closed fixation and superfusion in/outlet lines. After stopping the pump, sub-atmospheric pressure is applied through one of the fixation channels. Then after sealing the loading well shut, the second fixation channel is subjected to a sub-atmospheric pressure. Now the artery is symmetrically established in the inspection area, and a <b>transmural</b> pressure is felt by the segment. The remaining channels are opened and constant perfusion and superfusion are adjusted using separate syringe pumps.|$|E
