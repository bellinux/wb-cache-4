5|$|The {{original}} Roseville Avenue station {{dates back}} to the opening of <b>the</b> <b>Morris</b> & Essex Railroad Station in 1856, when tracks were constructed through the Roseville district of Newark.

The station was designed with two platforms, one along each line, <b>the</b> <b>Morris</b> & Essex first made use of the Montclair Branch property in April 1868 after buying the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Morris</b> Performing Arts Center, {{built in}} 1922, {{included}} the Palace Theater, {{a venue for}} vaudeville. The theatre's heyday was in 1940 with the premiere of Knute Rockne, All American, starring Ronald Reagan. A crowd estimated at 24,000 gathered outside. The theater was scheduled for demolition in 1959, when E. M. Morris purchased the facility and sold it to the city for one dollar, after which it was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Morris</b> Civic Auditorium. A total renovation was completed in 2000. <b>The</b> <b>Morris</b> Performing Arts Center also includes the Palais Royale Ballroom, on which restoration was recently completed. The center houses the Broadway Theater League and the South Bend Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's Shanghai-born conductor, Tsung Yeh, was the first conductor ever to hold music directorships of both a western symphony orchestra and a major Chinese orchestra. Marian High School holds its graduation ceremony at the theater.|$|E

No other coeducational academy spread its influence so far.|$|E

5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea {{is that there is no}} known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and <b>the</b> <b>Morris</b> dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E

5|$|At Queen Square, <b>the</b> <b>Morris</b> {{family lived}} in a flat {{directly}} above the Firm's shop. They were joined by Janey's sister Bessie Burton {{and a number of}} household servants. Meanwhile, changes were afoot at the Firm as Faulkner left, and to replace him they employed a business manager, Warrington Taylor, who would remain with them till 1866. Taylor pulled the Firm's finances into order and spent much time controlling Morris and ensuring that he worked to schedule. During these years the Firm carried out a number of high-profile designs; from September 1866 to January 1867, they redecorated the Armoury and Tapestry Room in St. James' Palace, in the latter year also designing the Green Dining Room at the South Kensington Museum (it is now <b>the</b> <b>Morris</b> Room at the Victoria and Albert Museum). The Firm's work received increasing interest from people in the United States, resulting in Morris's acquaintance with Henry James and Charles Eliot Norton. However, despite its success, the Firm was not turning over a large net profit, and this, coupled with the decreasing value of Morris' stocks, meant that he had to decrease his spending.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> new <b>Morris</b> Minor was {{launched}} at the British Motor Show at Earls Court in London on October 27, 1948.

At <b>the</b> same show <b>Morris</b> also launched <b>the</b> new <b>Morris</b> Oxford and Morris Six models, plus Wolseley variants of both cars, which were scaled-up {{versions of the}} new Minor, incorporating all the same features and designed with Issigonis' input under Oak's supervision.

5|$|After the {{takeover}} of service along the former Morris & Essex Lines by New Jersey Transit from Conrail in 1982, the service at the Roseville Avenue station remained minimal. Many trains bypassed the station in favor {{of going to the}} nearby Newark Broad Street Station. Trains continued to serve the Roseville Avenue station throughout 1982 and 1983, and service continued to be condensed during 1984. However, as of the official September 1984 timetables, service was cut from Roseville Avenue in favor of Newark Broad Street to Grove Street, East Orange (on <b>the</b> <b>Morris</b> & Essex) or Ampere (on the Montclair Branch), both of which closed in April 1991. On September 16, 1984, trains began bypassing Roseville Avenue, and the station was closed permanently. Although the station was closed, Roseville Tower, for the interlocking between the Montclair Branch and Morris & Essex Lines, remained in service for almost two more decades. In 2002, during construction of the Montclair Connection, the tower was demolished in favor of expanding the cut in Roseville for a second track of the new Montclair-Boonton Line.|$|E
