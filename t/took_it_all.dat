25|$|Bradshaw threw a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Bennie Cunningham in the third quarter, and later a 9-yard {{touchdown pass}} to Stallworth that gave the Steelers a 28-17 lead three plays into the fourth quarter. But {{this would be the}} end of his success as he completed only three of his next 11 passes in the final quarter. The next time Pittsburgh had the ball, cornerback Jeff Allen intercepted Bradshaw's pass and returned it eight yards to the Steelers 29-yard line. Pittsburgh defensive back Mel Blount intercepted a pass in the end zone on the second play of the ensuing drive, but it was eliminated by a holding penalty on linebacker Jack Ham. Five plays later, Fouts cut the score to 28-24 with an 8-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Winslow. Following six consecutive handoffs by Bradshaw, San Diego got the ball back on their own 36-yard line due to a 20-yard punt by John Goodson with four minutes left in the game. Four runs by Muncie moved the ball 33 yards to a third and 7 situation on the Steelers 12-yard line. On the next play, Fouts connected with Winslow on a screen pass, and the tight end <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way to the end zone for the game winning score with less than a minute left on the clock.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Paul Butterfield was out of the {{commercial}} mainstream. [...] Although for some, he was very much the bluesman, Maria Muldaur commented [...] "he had the whole sensibility and musicality and approach down pat...

Her next role came {{at the end of}} the year in the Manchester Royal Exchange's production of Medea.

However, in 1927 rumors began to abound campus that Field was {{going to buy a}} Model A. Field quelled the rumors with a personal interview in the last issue of the 1927 Technique. By September 1928, Field felt he could not travel as much with the dilapidated Model T. To the dismay of the student body the vehicle was discarded by Dean Field in 1928 and a Model A was purchased. Field's Model A lasted until 1934 in which he bought a Ford V8. He would drive over [...] in all three cars during his Georgia Tech tenure of 1900–1945.|$|E

After giving up smoking in 1991 following surgery, he had taken to sucking lollipops when watching games.

2500|$|The train {{had a major}} {{competitor}} in a bus route. Prinsdalsruten was established in 1928 and started serving the Prinsdal area. It continued past Hauketo and then drove Mosseveien into the city center. It took the name Oslo og Folle Busstrafikk in 1964. The patronage shifted between the bus and trains. Mosseveien was increasingly congested and the [...] could often take 40 minutes.

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his career}} he also began to act in various films. In 1963, {{director}} Otto Preminger asked if he would portray a Boston prelate in The Cardinal, and, writes author Philip Kemp, he [...] "virtually stole the picture." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role. He had a little participation (as did many others) in 1967's Casino Royale as actor and director. He acted in Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974) as the film's master villain, and as Teddy Roosevelt's secretary of state John Hay in The Wind and the Lion. Huston enjoyed acting and denied that he <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> that seriously. [...] "It's a cinch," [...] he once said, [...] "and they pay you damn near as much as you make directing." ...|$|E
2500|$|With 12:59 {{left in the}} game, Rams punter Ken Clark's 59-yard punt planted Pittsburgh back {{on their}} own 25-yard line. Then faced with 3rd down and 8, Bradshaw took the snap, faked a handoff, and then threw a pass to Stallworth, who was running a streak pattern {{down the middle of}} the field. [...] Stallworth caught the ball barely beyond the outstretched hand of Perry and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way to the end zone for a 73-yard go-ahead {{touchdown}} to make the score 24–19 for the Steelers. The NFL Films highlight film notes that safety Eddie Brown was supposed to help Perry in covering Stallworth, but for some reason, Brown ignored the Steeler receiver. On the ensuing kickoff, the Rams tried a reverse, which resulted in poor field position.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first quarter}} was scoreless. The closest either team came was Washington's drive inside the 49ers 30-yard line that ended when Joe Washington lost a fumble that was {{recovered}} by San Francisco lineman Lawrence Pillers. In the second quarter, Washington managed {{to fool the}} 49ers with a trick play when punt returner Nick Giaquinto threw the ball across the field to Darrell Green who <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the}} end zone, but Giaquinto inadvertently threw a forward pass rather than a lateral and the score was called back. Washington fans and news media at the time disputed whether this was actually a forward pass, calling it the [...] "Micrometer Play." [...] The suggestion was that one would need a high precision measuring device to determine that the play was indeed a forward pass, and that the referees got the call wrong. The Redskins still managed to drive into 49ers territory, but ended up with no points when Moseley's 45-yard field goal attempt went wide right.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 1984, The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote [...] "By 'gentlemen's agreement' (the {{statue of}} William Penn atop City Hall) remains highest. It is a {{supremacy}} {{that must be}} maintained, for philosophical and aesthetic and, indeed, economic reasons - density caused by towering skyscrapers {{is one of the}} surest ways to render a downtown ruinously overbuilt while its fringes wither." [...] In 1990, the Inquirer <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> back, noting that Rouse transformed Philadelphia's skyline to near universal acclaim. In 1987, Paul Goldberger called One Liberty Place the best skyscraper Helmut Jahn has ever designed and the best skyscraper built in Philadelphia since the PSFS Building. Goldberger noted that [...] "The skyline of Philadelphia, far from being destroyed by One Liberty Place, is in fact given new life by this building. The skyline has been transformed from one of the flattest of any American city to one of the richest." [...] He praised the shape which he said [...] "strikes a remarkable balance between dignity and verve". He was critical that the building was too busy with too many panels and stripes, but acknowledge it was more restrained than other of Helmut Jahn's buildings.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the 49ers {{started out}} their postseason by blowing out the Minnesota Vikings, 41–13. [...] Minnesota started out {{the game by}} marching 70 yards on their opening drive and scoring a field goal to take a 3–0 lead. [...] But the 49ers {{dominated}} {{the rest of the}} game. [...] On their first play from scrimmage, Montana completed a short pass to Rice, who then <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the end}} zone for a 72-yard touchdown reception. [...] The next time they had the ball, Montana led them on another touchdown drive, scoring on a short pass to tight end Brent Jones. [...] Then defensive back Chet Brooks intercepted a pass from Vikings quarterback Wade Wilson and returned it 28 yards, setting up Montana's third touchdown pass on an 8-yard toss to Taylor. [...] Then just before halftime, Montana threw another touchdown pass to Rice, giving the 49ers a 28–3 halftime lead. [...] Then in the fourth quarter, San Francisco scored two more touchdowns to put the game away: a 53-yard interception return by Lott and a 4-yard run by Craig. [...] Montana finished the game with 241 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and no interceptions. Wilson was held to just 9 completions for 74 yards, and was intercepted twice.|$|E
