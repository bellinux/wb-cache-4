2500|$|WFAA {{carries the}} {{majority}} of the ABC network schedule; however, as an affiliate that is not owned by the network itself, WFAA may occasionally preempt some of the network's prime time shows to run locally produced specials.

The station currently airs <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> <b>on</b> a half-hour delay as its Sunday morning newscast runs for 90 minutes, and airs the Saturday edition of Good Morning America one hour earlier than most ABC stations (airing it at 6:00a.m. via the live Eastern Time Zone feed rather than on tape delay).

For this competition, HouseGuests attempted to hit a hockey puck into the center of a goal, and the HouseGuest furthest away each round was eliminated.

Libra was the winner of the competition, however, chose to take a prize and allowed Jerry to win the Power of Veto. On Day 28, Jerry chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. Following this, April insisted that her alliance keep Jessie in the house, in an attempt to honor her word to Michelle. Due to Jessie's various arguments with the other HouseGuests, Keesha and Libra began plotting to evict him, thus dividing the HouseGuests into two groups.
