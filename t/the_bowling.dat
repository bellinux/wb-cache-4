5|$|Back at <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> alley, Homer and {{his friends}} enter <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> league competition, calling {{themselves}} the Pin Pals. They beat three teams before moving up into second place in their league. Meanwhile, Burns recovers from his stupor and discovers the check he wrote to Homer. Burns wants to join the team (replacing Otto in the team), but since Burns is a horrible bowler, the team is convinced they will lose the championship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Leicestershire, Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped leg before wicket by Australian {{expatriate}} left arm orthodox spinner Vic Jackson, as Australia amassed 448. He then opened <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> and castled home captain Les Berry {{for one to}} leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> of fellow Victorian Doug Ring as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win. Loxton took 1/11 and 0/12 from six and seven overs respectively.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} from <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> alley. The {{walls of}} the room are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and from his point of view, sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E

5|$|The next day, August 24, the 23rd Infantry {{continued}} {{clearing the}} rear areas and by night it {{estimated that there}} were fewer than 200 North Koreans behind the forward positions. <b>The</b> <b>Bowling</b> Alley front was quiet during the day. Shortly after midnight on August 24 the North Koreans launched what had by now become their regular nightly attack down <b>the</b> <b>Bowling</b> Alley. This attack was in an estimated two-company strength supported by a few tanks. The 27th Infantry broke up the attack and two more North Korean tanks were destroyed by the supporting artillery fire. This was the last night the 27th Infantry Regiment spent in <b>the</b> <b>Bowling</b> Alley.|$|E

25|$|Through the 1980s and 1990s, {{the weaker}} provincial teams began to {{gradually}} migrate back from <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> competition to <b>the</b> Currie Cup. At the same time, those provinces' B-teams began to contest <b>the</b> <b>Bowl,</b> which gradually turned <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> entirely into a Currie Cup seconds competition.

5|$|Maryland {{achieved}} bowl eligibility {{through its}} sixth win against NC State. The Terrapins finished {{the regular season}} with a 7–5overall record and 4–4record against ACC opponents. Maryland's conference record was identical to four other ACC teams, and the league fielded an NCAA record of ten bowl-eligible teams. For the 2008 season, there were eight non-Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl games with ACC tie-ins: <b>the</b> Gator <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Chick-fil-A <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Champs Sports <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Music City <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Humanitarian <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Emerald <b>Bowl,</b> <b>the</b> Meineke Car Care <b>Bowl,</b> and <b>the</b> EagleBank <b>Bowl.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Hot stone pot bibimbap (dolsot-bibimbap (돌솥 비빔밥)) is a {{variation}} of bibimbap served in a very hot dolsot (stone pot) in which a raw egg is cooked against the sides of <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bowl</b> is so hot that anything that touches it sizzles for minutes. Before the rice is placed in <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> is coated with sesame oil, making the layer of the rice touching <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> cook to a crisp, golden brown (누릉지).

5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. The {{omission}} generated considerable controversy. The Australians were pleased, feeling that Hutton was England's best batsman. Hutton's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett. England made three further changes. Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> department, thereby reverting from two spinners to one. Coxon, who made his debut in the previous match and opened <b>the</b> <b>bowling,</b> taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by debutant batsman Crapp. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings, with the all rounder Loxton. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat.|$|E
5|$|With the North Koreans {{turned back}} north of Taegu, Walker issued {{orders for the}} 27th Infantry to leave <b>the</b> <b>Bowling</b> Alley {{and return to the}} 25th Division in the Masan area. The ROK 1st Division was to assume {{responsibility}} for <b>the</b> <b>Bowling</b> Alley, but the 23rd Infantry was to remain north of Taegu in its support. ROK relief of the 27th Infantry began at 18:00, 25 August, and continued throughout the night until completed at 03:45 August 26. Survivors of the 1st Regiment, KPA 1st Division, joined the rest of that division in the mountains east of the Taegu–Sangju road near the walled summit of Ka-san. Prisoners reported that the 1st Regiment was down to about 400 men and had lost all its 120mm mortars, 76mm howitzers, and antitank guns {{as a result of its}} action on the east flank of the KPA 13th Division at <b>the</b> <b>Bowling</b> Alley.|$|E
5|$|As Australia won {{the series}} convincingly 4–0, {{it is not}} {{surprising}} that their players dominated the statistical rankings. Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs at a much higher average. Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian. On <b>the</b> <b>bowling</b> front, Australia's pace attack had far more success and they were a large part of the success. Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets, supported by Miller and Toshack, who took 13 and 11 respectively. For England, only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets, and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen. <b>The</b> <b>bowling</b> was dominated by pace bowling, with Laker being the only spinner on the list, with by far the worst average. This was in large part because England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, more frequently than under normal conditions. As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling, this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack, in this case Australia.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect of}} the {{secondary}} flow can be demonstrated using a circular <b>bowl.</b> Partly fill <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> with water and sprinkle dense particles such as sand or rice into <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> Set <b>the</b> water into circular motion with one hand or a spoon. The dense particles quickly sweep into a neat pile {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> This is <b>the</b> mechanism that leads to the formation of point bars and contributes to the formation of oxbow lakes. The primary flow of water in <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> is circular and the streamlines are concentric with the side of <b>the</b> <b>bowl.</b> However, <b>the</b> secondary flow of the boundary layer across the floor of <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> is inward toward the center. The primary flow might be expected to fling the dense particles to the perimeter of <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> but instead <b>the</b> secondary flow sweeps the particles toward the center.|$|R
