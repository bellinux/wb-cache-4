25|$|The longest gravity dam, and longest dam overall, impounds the Lake of Homs in Syria. Built in 284AD by emperor Diocletian for irrigation, the 2,000m {{long and}} 7m high masonry dam {{consists}} of a concrete core protected by basalt ashlar. The lake, 6miles long by 2.5miles wide, had a capacity of 90millionm³, making it the biggest Roman reservoir in the Near East and possibly the largest artificial lake constructed up to that time. Enlarged in the 1930s, {{it is still a}} landmark of Homs which it continues <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> water. Further notable dams in this category include the little-studied 900m long Wadi Caam II dam at Leptis Magna and the Spanish dams at Alcantarilla and at Consuegra.|$|E

[...] This block was particularly difficult <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> ammunition, since it lacked a hoist, and all ordnance had to be carried by the troops.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the south}} coust {{of the island}} are {{the remains of a}} small, isolated, cashel-like building, which would have been {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> provisions, except by sea. In gaelic the site is known as Sgorr nam Ban-naomha, meaning [...] "grassy slope of the holy women"; in the 19th century, local people believed it had once been a nunnery, but it is now thought to have been a hermitage, associated with the monastery at Keill. The enclosure contains three carved stones, bearing crosses, and was once believed to have had a healing spring.|$|E

2500|$|The cistern has a {{rectangular}} plan with huge dimensions, being [...] long and [...] wide: its average depth lies between [...] and [...] [...] Its capacity was about [...] of water. Its walls, [...] thick and partially still in place, were built {{according to the}} Roman constructive technique named opus listatum by alternating four courses of bricks and ten courses of stone, an elegant pattern {{similar to that used}} by the cistern of Aspar. It has been hypothesized that this reservoir was used <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> water the moat of the city walls, but it is more plausible that it was a central reservoir whence the water was distributed in the city.|$|E

60|$|Later the freedmen {{were engaged}} in cutting wood along the Mississippi River to supply {{the large number of}} steamers on that stream. A good price was paid for {{chopping}} wood used for the supply of government steamers (steamers chartered and which the government had <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> fuel). Those supplying their own fuel paid a much higher price. In this way a fund was created not only sufficient to feed and clothe all, old and young, male and female, but to build them comfortable cabins, hospitals for the sick, and to supply them with many comforts they had never known before.|$|E
60|$|Many {{thanks for}} your obliging letter. I shall be much gratified {{if you happen to}} like my translation, and thankful for any remarks with which you may honour me. I have made so much {{progress}} with the second book, that I defer sending the former till that is finished. It takes in many places a high tone of passion, which I would gladly succeed in rendering. When I read Virgil in the original I am moved; but not so much so by the translation; and I cannot but think this owing to a defect in the diction, which I have endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>with</b> what success you will easily be enabled to judge.|$|E

60|$|This {{caused the}} {{multitude}} of single people in London to be unprovided for, as also families whose living depended upon the labour of the heads of those families; I say, this reduced them to extreme misery; and I must confess {{it is for the}} honour of the city of London, and will be for many ages, as long as this is to be spoken of, that they were able <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> charitable provision the wants of so many thousands of those as afterwards fell sick and were distressed: so that it may be safely averred that nobody perished for want, at least that the magistrates had any notice given them of.|$|E
60|$|As {{has been}} said before, nobody likes to play the compulsorily generous role of scab. It is a bad {{business}} proposition {{on the face of}} it. And it is patent {{that there would be no}} capitalist scabs if there were not more capital than there is work for capital to do. When there are enough factories in existence <b>to</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>with</b> occasional stoppages, a certain commodity, the building of new factories by a rival concern, for the production of that commodity, is plain advertisement that that capital is out of a job. The first act of this new aggregation of capital will be to cut prices, to give more for less,--in short to scab, to strike at the very existence of the less generous aggregation of capital the work of which it is trying to do.|$|E

He menaced the rulers of England with all the judgments denounced on those of Moab and Assyria--he called upon the saints to be strong, to be up and doing; and promised those miracles which, in the campaigns of Joshua, and his successors, the valiant Judges of Israel, supplied all odds against the Amorites, Midianites, and Philistines. He sounded trumpets, opened vials, broke seals, and denounced approaching judgments under all the mystical signs of the Apocalypse. The {{end of the world}} was announced, accompanied with all its preliminary terrors.|$|E

60|$|What my Jealousy, on my Landlord's Relation, had suggested, happen'd accordingly: For {{about one}} in the Morning I was alarm'd with the Cry {{of one of my}} Centinels, Turn out for God's sake; which he repeated, with Vehemence, three or four times over. I took the Alarm, got up suddenly; and with no little Difficulty got my Men into their Ranks, when the Person who made the Outcry came running in, almost spent, and out of Breath. It was the Centinel, that I had luckily plac'd about a Quarter of a Mile off, who gave the Alarm, and his Musket {{flashing}} in the Pan, without going off, he endeavour'd <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> his Voice the Defect of his Piece. I had just got my Men into their Ranks, in order to receive the Enemy, when by the Moonlight, I discover'd a Party advancing upon us. My out Centinel challeng'd 'em, and as I had precaution'd, they answer'd, Hispanioli; though I knew 'em to be French.|$|E
60|$|The {{young woman}} herself {{had once been}} an invalid who was taken into the Home and nursed till she recovered, after which she {{was sent to a}} {{situation}} in a large town. Here she came in contact with a poor family in which the mother is a drunkard and the father a respectable, hardworking man, and took a great fancy to one of the children, the little girl I have mentioned. This child, who is about five years of age, it is her habit <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> clothes and more or less to feed. Unfortunately, however, when the mother is on the drink she pawns the clothes which my Salvation Army friend is obliged to redeem, since if she does not, little Bessie is left almost naked. Indeed, before Bessie was brought away upon this particular visit her protectress had to pay 14s. to recover her garments from the pawnshop, a considerable sum out of a wage of about £18 a year.|$|E

So ample was the custom, indeed, that Wallace had the consideration to send one of the ward-room servants to the light-house, in order to relieve Rose from a duty that was getting to be a little irksome. She was [...] "seeing company" [...] as a bride, in a novel and rather unpleasant manner; and it was in consequence of a suggestion of the [...] "ship's gentleman," [...] that the remains of the turtle were transferred to the vessel, and were put into the coppers, secundum artem, by the regular cooks.|$|E

6000|$|During {{the long}} winter evenings, when the farmers were idle round their hearths, Hugh was a courted guest; for none could while away the hours more skilfully than he. The winter, therefore, was his season of prosperity; in which respect he {{differed}} from the butterflies and useless insects, to which he otherwise bore a resemblance. During the cold months, a very desirable alteration for the better appeared in his outward man. His cheeks were plump and sanguine; his eyes bright and cheerful; and {{the tip of his}} nose glowed with a Bardolphian fire,--a flame, indeed, which Hugh was so far a vestal as <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> its necessary fuel at all seasons of the year. But, as the spring advanced, he assumed a lean and sallow look, wilting and fading in the sunshine that brought life and joy to every animal and vegetable except himself. His winter patrons eyed him with an austere regard; and some even practised upon him the modern and fashionable courtesy of the [...] "cut direct." ...|$|E
6000|$|My speeches {{had been}} planned upon broad lines, but they lost touch with these as the polling approached. To begin with I made a real attempt to put what was in my mind before the people I was <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>with</b> a {{political}} voice. I spoke of the greatness of our empire and its destinies, of the splendid projects and possibilities of life and order that lay before the world, of all that a resolute and constructive effort might do at the present time. [...] "We are building a state," [...] I said, [...] "secure and splendid, {{we are in the}} dawn of the great age of mankind." [...] Sometimes that would get a solitary [...] "'Ear! 'ear!" [...] Then having created, as I imagined, a fine atmosphere, I turned upon the history of the last Conservative administration and brought it into contrast with the wide occasions of the age; discussed its failure to control the grasping financiers in South Africa, its failure to release public education from sectarian squabbles, its misconduct of the Boer War, its waste of the world's resources....|$|E
60|$|The civil wars, {{the common}} purgative, Which always {{use to make}} the nation thrive, Made way for all that strolling congregation, Which throng'd in pious Charles's restoration. The royal refugee our breed restores, With foreign courtiers, and with foreign whores: And {{carefully}} re-peopled us again, Throughout his lazy, long, lascivious reign, With such a blest and true-born English fry, As much illustrates our nobility. A gratitude which will so black appear, As future ages must abhor to bear: When they look back on all that crimson flood, Which stream'd in Lindsey's, and Caernarvon's blood; Bold Strafford, Cambridge, Capel, Lucas, Lisle, Who crown'd in death his father's fun'ral pile. The loss of whom, in order <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>With</b> true-born English nobility, Six bastard dukes survive his luscious reign, The labours of Italian Castlemain, French Portsmouth, Tabby Scott, and Cambrian; Besides the num'rous bright and virgin throng, Whose female glories shade them from my song.
