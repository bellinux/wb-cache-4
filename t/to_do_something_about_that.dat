50|$|One of {{the biggest}} reasons Smeal {{decided to run for}} yet another term as President was not only due to the support of many other NOW members, but from her wish that NOW could be more outspoken, assertive, and {{publicly}} active on multiple different issues. These issues included abortion rights, on {{the role of women in}} the church, and the Vatican’s policy on reproduction. Smeal also noted that while Goldsmith was in power the organization lost its focus and membership declined and she wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Donaldson {{stated in}} Richard English's book, Armed Struggle: [...] "A {{big part of}} the {{motivation}} for me in becoming actively involved in politics was the deep sense of injustice that I felt had been perpetrated against my people and specifically against my family and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> And that's why, at the age of 18, I did two things, I joined the Ulster Defence Regiment and I joined the Ulster Unionist Party, because I wanted to pursue, through the forces {{of the state and the}} forces of law and order, the IRA and to oppose their campaign. But I also wanted to be involved politically in opposing that campaign as well".|$|E

Stan Lee (co-creator of the Fantastic Four) also expressed interest in the Fantastic Four, as well as the X-Men, returning to Marvel Studios stating, [...] "We should have all of our characters under Marvel. Remind me on my way home <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Well do our best." [...] However, Marvel Studios Kevin Feige stated in June 2017 that there were no plans of adding the Fantastic Four to the Marvel Cinematic Universe at that time.|$|E

One is to have an aggregate of the Friday and Saturday times, meaning that teams have to perform regardless, and the second is to have qualifying on Saturday only. It is just my opinion, but I'd prefer the second option. You could have timed sessions on Friday which did not count for the grid because, to me, Friday is a huge waste of time."

She becomes so strong in this resolve that she ignores all warnings and goes to meet with Ukita Naoie {{in the hopes of}} bringing him to their side to relieve Hanbei's stress, as their plan involved forcing him to surrender anyway. This fails, of course, and she is imprisoned for several days with the condition of her freedom being Yamanaka Shikanosuke's surrender before the Mōri Clan's arrival or she will be executed. She's rescued by Yoshiharu and after she and Hanbei begin to recover from their respective conditions, they become nearly as close as sisters.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, Adams {{began the}} new decade with roles in two films: the romantic comedy Leap Year and The Fighter, {{in which she}} portrayed Charlene Fleming, the {{aggressive}} and gritty girlfriend of boxer [...] "Irish" [...] Micky Ward. The Best Picture nominated film received critical praise for its actors in which Adams starred alongside Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, and Melissa Leo. Adams later said about being cast in The Fighter that the director, David O. Russell, said, [...] "'Oh you are so not a princess type - we'll have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that!</b> I just want to expose that side of you, and give {{you the opportunity to}} shed the whole princess thing, because that isn't who you are - it's just one aspect of the work you've done." [...] She won acclaim for her work. Joe Morgenstern of Wall Street Journal wrote that she's [...] "as tough, tender, smart, and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in Enchanted. What an actress, and what range!" [...] For her role in The Fighter, Adams was nominated for the BAFTA Award, Critics' Choice Movie Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, Golden Globe Award, and Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress losing the latter three awards to her co-star Leo. In 2011, she again worked with Disney, starring in the acclaimed film The Muppets alongside Jason Segel and The Muppets; in the film, she returned to singing.|$|E
40|$|Arts {{agencies}} do see a {{role for}} themselves in the rejuvenation process. With good reason. The impact of the arts can be far-reaching - where governments {{tend to focus on}} infrastructure issues, the arts are more concerned about how people in communities connect - or, in some cases, why they fail to connect. We aim <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> by promoting social cohesion and reconciliation; as a window onto deep-seated problems and how communities can start to resolve them; in boosting economies; and especially, and critically, in helping sustain local and regional identity. For the past decade, the Australia Council has worked closely with the Australian Local Government Association, promoting community arts and cultural development as a core function of local government. That dialogue is critical in determining the issues we are dealing with, in getting the disenfranchised involved, animating democracy, helping to create new identities from people and cultures who have come in from elsewhere - often {{from the other side of}} the planet...|$|E

40|$|Extract] The {{old world}} of the Atlantic seaboard is attrophying and the {{countries}} of the Pacific rim signal the dynamics of the future. That is the qualified hypothesis underlying People of the Pacific Century, a series of six programmes originally broadcast by the BBC on its domestic Radio 4 and later in the World Service. The first programme begins with former Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, alleging a lack of understanding by Europe of his part of the world whereupon Mary Goldring, the series presenter, informs listeners that the six programmes "attempt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> lack of understanding; to face the real possibility that the world's axis has shifted from the old west centred on the Atlantic to the new world centred on the Pacific. " Lest there be doubts of the shift, listeners are told by Singapore's Trade and Industry Minister that the old world looks "tired" and "directionless", by an American aircraft salesman that the former beneficent "Dad" of Europe is "a little senile now" and by a Harvard Business School don that the Japanese believe "Europe is dead" and see the United States as less vigorous now that Japan sells the most and best automobiles. Thus, through the series, does Mary Goldring alternate with the edited contributions of public and not-so-public Pacific people to develop the theme of the first programme, aptly titled "Seeds of Change"...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, Medford, Oregon, faced {{a problem}} common for cities nationwide. Upon {{treating}} sewage from nearly 200, 000 people, the city's {{wastewater treatment plant}} discharges an average of 17 million gallons of clean [...] but warm [...] water to the Rogue River every day. Here's the challenge: The historically cold Rogue River is already warming, and the water the facility is returning to the river could increase its temperature by an additional. 18 degree Celsius. Despite being indistinguishable to humans, this increase {{can have an impact}} on the salmon and steelhead calling the river home. Warmer rivers have less oxygen and cause eggs to incubate earlier, decreasing survival rates. "Very minor temperature changes in the river can have a dramatic effect on fish populations," said Eugene Weir, project manager with The Freshwater Trust. "The city needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> to meet its new permit requirement. " To comply with the Clean Water Act, the city had to offset the impact of its warm-water discharge. Fortunately, there was no shortage of options in front of plant employees like Tom Suttle. Cooling towers or chiller could be installed. Water could be held in ponds until it was at the appropriate temperature. Warm water could be reused elsewhere. The problem? "All of those were very expensive," said Suttle. Chillers and storage lagoons can cost $ 15 million. Reusing water elsewhere could cost $ 40 million. The Freshwater Trust offered the city something different; a solution that stood out next to the engineered proposals in terms of both dollars spent and benefits received. The bill for taxpayers? Approximately $ 6. 5 million [...] a more than $ 8 million savings. And the benefits of those trees would extend far beyond producing shade for fish. They filter pollutants like agricultural runoff, reduce carbon in the atmosphere, and provide essential habitat for wildlife. The proposal was accepted, and a first of its kind, regulator-approved water quality trading program was born to meet the temperature requirements. Shade generated from trees planted would be quantified and expressed as credits that the city could purchase...|$|E
