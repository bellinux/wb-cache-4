5|$|George Stratton {{was born}} on September 26, 1865 to James Thompson Stratton, {{originally}} from Ossining, New York, and Cornelia A. Smith. His parents had met and married in New York in 1854, and settled back in Clinton, now East Oakland, California. James Stratton had been to California once before during the gold rush of 1850, sailing around North America and crossing by land the Panama stretch, but finding little gold. The senior Stratton traced his ancestry to the early settlers of the British settlements of America, and Cornelia Smith had Dutch and English forebears. James Stratton would live {{the rest of his}} life in California, pursuing a civil engineering career as County Surveyor for Alameda County in 1858–59 and later as the U.S. Surveyor-General of the state, and finally as Chief Deputy State Surveyor. An expert on the big Mexican land grants, he split up several of the Spanish deeds. One of his sons, Frederick, went to the University of California, today's Berkeley, and became a lawyer, state senator, and Collector of the Port of San Francisco, before killing himself on November 30, 1915. Another, Robert Thomas, became a doctor in Oakland and died after a long illness on May 6, 1924. The couple also had a daughter, Jeanne, the later Mrs. Walter Good. George was their youngest child who lived past <b>toddlerhood.</b>|$|E

50|$|Extrinsic emotion {{regulation}} remains {{important to}} emotional development in <b>toddlerhood.</b> Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers {{to control their}} emotions and behaviors.

50|$|Early {{childhood}} {{follows the}} infancy stage and begins with <b>toddlerhood</b> {{when the child}} begins speaking or taking steps independently. While <b>toddlerhood</b> ends around age three when the child becomes less dependent on parental assistance for basic needs, early childhood continues approximately through age nine. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, early childhood spans the human life from birth to age eight. At this stage children are learning through observing, experimenting and communicating with others. Adults supervise and support the development process of the child, which then {{will lead to the}} child's autonomy. Also during this stage, a strong emotional bond is created between the child and the care providers. The children also start to begin kindergarten at this age to start their social lives.|$|E

50|$|Early {{childhood}} is {{a stage in}} human development. It generally includes <b>toddlerhood</b> and some time afterwards. Play age is an unspecific designation approximately {{within the scope of}} early childhood. Some age-related development periods and examples of defined intervals are: newborn (ages 0-5 weeks); infant (ages 5 weeks - 2 years); toddler (ages 3-4 years), play ager/Grade schooler (ages 5-12); Early adolescent (ages 13-15), Late adolescent (ages 16-19).|$|E
5000|$|Babywearing is the {{practice}} of wearing or carrying a baby in a sling or in another form of carrier. Babywearing has been practiced for centuries around the world.

5000|$|Through each {{developmental}} {{stage of a}} child’s life and throughout our lifetime motor skills gradually develop. They are first seen during a child’s development stages: infancy, <b>toddlerhood,</b> preschool and school age. [...] "Basic” fine motor skills gradually develop and are typically mastered {{between the ages of}} 6-12 in children. These skills will keep developing with age, practice and the increased use of muscles while playing sports, playing an instrument, using the computer, and writing. If deemed necessary, occupational therapy can help improve overall fine motor skills.|$|E
50|$|Pain is {{a concept}} that {{develops}} and grows more sophisticated over our lifespan. Not being able to understand or make sense of pain can also be detrimental to a child’s mental state. During infancy and <b>toddlerhood,</b> pain is external and not localized. This means that an infant cannot determine the location of pain and pain {{does not seem to be}} an internal force. During middle childhood an individual can determine the qualities of pain and have a more abstract way of thinking about pain. During adolescence an individual can describe pain, understand physiological and psychological factors/causes.|$|E
5000|$|In Tzotzil, Zinacantec infants {{communicate}} with their caregivers through nonverbal means that incorporate them into the social fabric of the community, {{and give them the}} opportunity to be a social participant in the community. [...] Young children are embedded within conversations between adults as they interpret to one another the child's non-verbal language, and are side participants and an addressees in both two-person and multiparty communications. This engagement of infants into adult conversation and social interactions influences the development of the children in those communities, as they are able to take on an active role in learning from <b>toddlerhood.</b>|$|E
50|$|Katha Pollitt {{referred}} to attachment parenting as a fad. Parents {{who follow the}} philosophy have been reproached with helplessness and unsatisfied own emotional neediness {{which may be the}} true reasons for their decision to incessantly pacify their child by breastfeeding and babywearing even into <b>toddlerhood,</b> while the belief that the child actually needs all that permanent intimacy for his healthy development may only be a subterfuge. Emma Jenner argued that parents who are in the habit of stereotypically attending to every of the child's signals with physical proximity, will not learn to perceive the child's needs in the full extend of their bandwidth and complexity.|$|E

5000|$|Childhood {{is the age}} span {{ranging from}} birth to adolescence. According to Piagets theory of {{cognitive}} development, childhood consists of two stages: preoperational stage and concrete operational stage. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of infancy and <b>toddlerhood</b> (learning to walk and talk, ages birth to 4), early childhood (play age covering the kindergarten and early grade school years up to grade 4 (5-10 years old)), preadolescence, around 11 and 12 (where puberty could possibly begin in early developers but could equally be in early childhood if the child has not reached puberty), and adolescence (puberty (early adolescence, 13-15) through post-puberty (late adolescence, 16-19) [...] ). Various childhood factors could affect a persons attitude formation.|$|E

50|$|Medical {{management}} {{of children with}} Trisomy 13 is planned {{on a case-by-case basis}} and depends on the individual circumstances of the patient. Treatment of Patau syndrome focuses on the particular physical problems with which each child is born. Many infants have difficulty surviving the first few days or weeks due to severe neurological problems or complex heart defects. Surgery may be necessary to repair heart defects or cleft lip and cleft palate. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy will help individuals with Patau syndrome reach their full developmental potential. Surviving children are described as happy and parents report that they enrich their lives. The cited study grouped Edwards syndrome, which is sometimes survivable beyond <b>toddlerhood,</b> along with Patau, hence the median age of 4 at the time of data collection.|$|E

50|$|Erik H. Erikson (1902-1994) {{explained}} the challenges throughout the life course. The first {{stage in the}} life course is infancy, where babies learn trust and mistrust. The second stage is <b>toddlerhood</b> where children around {{the age of two}} struggle with the challenge of autonomy versus doubt. In stage three, preschool, children struggle to understand the difference between initiative and guilt. Stage four, pre-adolescence, children learn about industriousness and inferiority. In the fifth stage called adolescence, teenagers experience the challenge of gaining identity versus confusion. The sixth stage, young adulthood, is when young people gain insight to life when dealing with the challenge of intimacy and isolation. In stage seven, or middle adulthood, people experience the challenge of trying to make a difference (versus self-absorption). In the final stage, stage eight or old age, people are still learning about the challenge of integrity and despair.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the eighth}} serial ("Le Grand Weekend") the Larkins' weekend getaway {{coincide}}s with Charles de Gaulle's state visit, which would date {{the events of}} the episode to April 1960 if it does indeed coincide with the real-life visit. Primrose's birthday was revealed to be in May in [...] "Stranger at the gates" [...] and she celebrates it in the ninth serial [...] "The happiest days of your life", dating the events either to May 1960 (using the retconned second series date) or 1961 (going by the date given in the first series). By the eleventh serial ("Climb the greasy pole"), when the children are older and the babies have grown to <b>toddlerhood,</b> another close-up of a calendar reveals the month to be October 1959. At the end of the final episode, Sidney is elected to the Rural District Council on 5 November 1959 (Guy Fawkes Night).|$|E
50|$|During <b>toddlerhood,</b> babies begin {{learning}} how to walk, talk, and make decisions for themselves. An important characteristic of this age period {{is the development of}} language, where children are {{learning how}} to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words. Self-control also begins to develop. At this age, children take initiative to explore, experiment, and learn from making mistakes. Caretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits, help the child become autonomous, self-reliant, and confident. If the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions, the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independence. The child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future. Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in gender roles, acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do.|$|E
50|$|Any form of intensive, obsessive {{mothering}} has, as Katha Pollitt stated, {{devastating consequences}} for the equality of treatment {{of women in the}} society. In France, Élisabeth Badinter argued that over-parenting, obsession with washable diapers and organic, home made infant food, and parenting practices as the ones recommended by Sears, with breastfeeding into <b>toddlerhood,</b> bring women inevitably back into outdated patterns of gender role. In the United States, Badinter's book The Conflict: How Modern Motherhood Undermines the Status of Women (2010) had a partially critical reception, because there is no publicly paid childcare leave in this country, and many women consider it a luxury {{to be able to be}} a stay-at-home-mom during the child's first years. Still, gynecologist Amy Tuteur (formerly Harvard Medical School) stated that attachment parenting amounts to a new subjection of the woman's body under social control - a trend that is more than questionable in the face to the hard-fought achievements of women's movement.|$|E
