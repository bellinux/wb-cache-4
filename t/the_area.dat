5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within <b>the</b> <b>area.</b> In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over <b>the</b> <b>area</b> below 4,000 feet. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within <b>the</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the tornado, {{there was}} an {{investigation}} into whether the students should have been dismissed before the tornado stuck the school. However, the National Weather Service survey from the office in Tallahassee suggested that the death toll could have been much higher due to the extreme damage {{in the parking lot}} and <b>the</b> <b>area</b> nearby. In addition, earlier thunderstorm activity in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> with two other rotating supercells tracking towards Enterprise late that morning (the first tornado warning was issued at 10:41am CST) made evacuating <b>the</b> <b>area</b> unsafe.|$|E

Finally <b>the</b> Community <b>area</b> works with setting up legal entities, creating websites and community growth. It was expected that <b>the</b> Practice <b>area,</b> <b>the</b> Education <b>area</b> and <b>the</b> Theory <b>area</b> would {{at some point in time}} integrate in a way of value to all of them: <b>the</b> Practice <b>area</b> would be a [...] "customer" [...] of <b>the</b> Theory <b>area,</b> and direct <b>the</b> research to useful results for the developer community. <b>The</b> Theory <b>area</b> would give a solid and practical platform for <b>the</b> Practice <b>area.</b> And, <b>the</b> Education <b>area</b> would communicate <b>the</b> results in proper ways.|$|R

5|$|Czech {{units were}} held up near Skoczów and a ceasefire was signed on 3 February. The new Czechoslovakia claimed <b>the</b> <b>area</b> partly on {{historic}} and ethnic grounds, but especially on economic grounds. <b>The</b> <b>area</b> {{was important for}} the Czechs as the crucial railway line connecting Czech Silesia with Slovakia crossed <b>the</b> <b>area</b> (the Košice-Bohumín Railway, {{which was one of}} only two railroads that linked the Czech provinces to Slovakia at that time). <b>The</b> <b>area</b> is also very rich in black coal.
