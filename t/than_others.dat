5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better <b>than</b> <b>others</b> because of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} of the Voyager missions, Jupiter's moons were {{arranged}} neatly into four groups of four, based on commonality of their orbital elements.

5|$|Critics had a mixed {{reaction}} to the episode, with many characterising it as somewhat weaker <b>than</b> <b>others</b> in the series, with the change in tone dividing commentators.

The writing and production, however, were praised, with the cast being commended both for their performances and their willingness to embrace the episode's concept.|$|E
5|$|Different {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} an element are called allotropes. Some allotropes, {{particularly those of}} elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside or near the notional dividing line between metals and nonmetals, exhibit more pronounced metallic, metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> The existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved.|$|E

5|$|Galactic habitable-zone {{theory has}} been criticized due to an {{inability}} to quantify accurately the factors making a region of a galaxy favorable {{for the emergence of}} life. In addition, computer simulations suggest that stars may change their orbits around the galactic center significantly, therefore challenging {{at least part of the}} view that some galactic areas are necessarily more life-supporting <b>than</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

30|$|The summary {{result in}} Table 9, Appendix 1 : Tables and Figs. 12, 13 for the {{relation}} between clusters and principal factors suggests that cluster 2, 9, 1 and 6 countries have good sustainable (Good) life (variables of PC 1, Appendix 1) <b>than</b> <b>other</b> cluster countries. This result specifiably indicates that Tunisia, Mauritius, Seychelles, Cape-Verde, Morocco, Algeria and South Africa have relatively better sustainable life <b>than</b> <b>other</b> African countries, this implies that these countries used relatively suitable policies on variables of PC 1 <b>than</b> <b>other</b> African countries used. In terms of capital (variables of PC 2, Appendix 1) cluster 9, 2 and 4 countries have a better status. This result specifiably shows that South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Morocco have relatively better capital <b>than</b> <b>other</b> African countries, this implies that these countries used relatively suitable policies on variables of PC 2 <b>than</b> <b>other</b> African countries used.|$|R
