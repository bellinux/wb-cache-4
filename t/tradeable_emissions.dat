40|$|When {{the market}} of {{tradable}} emissions permits is perfectly competitive, free allocation of permits through some discretionary rules corresponds to lump sum transfers and cannot have strategic effects. This conclusion is reversed when transactions costs are {{introduced in the}} TEP market. Transactions costs proportional {{to the value of}} permits exchanged create a gap between selling and the buying price, thus resulting in lower opportunity costs for the holder of excess permits. This can be effectively exploited by a government in order to encourage its firm to gain larger share in an international market. When costs per transaction are fixed, the above effects disappear for those firms participating in the market. For small firms, however, participation may be prohibitively expensive, turning the opportunity cost of any permits hold, equal to zero.

It deals with the intertemporal allocation of CO 2 emissions, opts for the initial distribution of CO 2 coupons by auction, stipulates the carbon content of fuel as the assessment base, selects importers and producers as the appropriate addressees of the coupon system for CO 2 and solves the (system's initial) problem with end-of-pipe technologies.

40|$|Should {{the powers}} of {{monitoring}} compliance and allocating <b>tradeable</b> <b>emissions</b> allowances be appointed to a unique supranational regulator or decentralized to several local regulators? To answer this question, we develop a two stage-two country game where environmental regulators set the amount of emission allowances {{and the level of}} monitoring effort to achieve full compliance while the regulated firms choose actual emissions and the number of permits to be held. Various, possibly conflicting, spillovers between countries arise in a decentralized setting. We show that decentralization is socially harmful if no asymmetry among institutional settings is introduced and can be suboptimal even when decentralization features lower monitoring costs than a centralized setting. Lower monitoring costs are therefore necessary, but not sufficient, to justify decentralization. Also, our analysis reveals that welfare can be higher under decentralization even if the corresponding environmental quality is worse than under centralization. Indeed, better environmental quality is sufficient but not necessary for higher welfare under decentralization.

40|$|JOHN QUIGGIN {{spells out}} the {{arguments}} for <b>tradeable</b> <b>emissions</b> permits NOW that nearly everyone is agreed {{on the need for}} a market-based policy instrument to reduce CO 2 emissions, the biggest unresolved question is whether to implement carbon taxes, <b>tradeable</b> <b>emissions</b> permits or some hybrid of the two. I support tradeable permits, but I’ve never really spelt out my reasons for doing so. It’s important before doing this to observe that {{the differences between the two}} approaches are more limited than most of the discussion suggests. Both ensure the existence of a price for CO 2 emissions and both can be set up to distribute the costs of emissions in a lot of different ways. That said, tradeable permits have some significant advantages in my view. I have three main reasons for preferring permits, which I will list in order of significance. First, while the natural starting point for both systems is one in which the government collects the entire implied value of emissions, either as tax revenue or as the proceeds from auctioning permits, the emissions trading system allows for (but doesn’t require) free allocation of some permits. Particularly in transitional stages when not all sources are covered, this can be used to offset unanticipated distributional consequences of the scheme, and thereby increase its political feasibility. * It’s important not to issue too many free permits, as was done with the first round in the European Union, but some limited issue might be beneficial. I don’t want to overstress this point as much the same outcome can be achieved by paying cash compensation out of tax revenue. Second, since we are uncertain about the elasticity of demand for emissions we are faced with a choice between allowing this uncertainty to be reflected in uncertainty about reaching the targeted level of reductions in emissions, uncertainty about the price, or some mixture of the two. Given the risk that we will fail altogether if individual countries fall short of their targets, I’d prefer some uncertainty about the price. Third, and most importantly, the ultimate solution has to be an international agreement to reduce emissions in the most cost-effective way possible. The obvious way to do this is through the creation of international markets for emissions permits. Although a full-scale global market might be some way off, regional or multiregional markets linked through something like the existing Clean Development Mechanism could be set up reasonably easily. By contrast, I can’t see how, in a world of sharply varying exchange rates, it would be possible to set up a coordinated global system of carbon taxes. I should say, though, that Warwick McKibbin had a piece arguing for something like this in the 7 July edition of the Australian Financial Review. Whether or not these arguments are conclusive, it seems pretty certain that emissions trading (perhaps with some modest hybrid elements) is the way we are going to go. At this point, it’s more important to push for urgent action than to get hung up in disputes about the details. • * Obviously, if you’re strongly opposed to any compensation of existing emitters and are prepared to risk total failure rather than concede on point, this is a disadvantage rather than an advantage.

40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to study the}} costs of achieving pollution reductions under a range of environmental policy instruments in a second-best setting with pre-existing factor taxes. We compare the costs and efficiency impacts of emissions taxes, emissions quotas, fuels taxes, performance standards, and mandated technologies, and explore how costs change with the magnitude of pre-existing taxes {{and the extent of}} pollution abatement. We find that the presence of distortionary taxes raises the costs of pollution abatement under each instrument relative to its costs in a first-best world. This extra cost is an increasing function of the magnitude of pre-existing tax rates. For plausible values of pre-existing tax rates and other parameters, the cost increase for all policies is substantial (35 % or more). The impact of pre-existing taxes is large for non-auctioned emissions quotas, the cost increase can be several hundred percent. Earlier work on instrument choice emphasized the potential reduction in compliance cost from converting fixed emissions quotas into <b>tradeable</b> <b>emissions</b> permits. Our results show the regulator's decision to auction or grandfather emissions rights can have important cost impacts. Similarly, the choice of how to recycle revenues from environmentally motivated taxes can be as important to cost as whether the tax takes the form of an emissions tax or fuel tax, particularly when modest emissions reductions are involved. In both first- and second-best settings, the cost differences across instruments depend on the extent of pollution abatement under consideration. Total abatement costs differ markedly at low levels of abatement. Strikingly, for all instruments except the fuel tax these costs converge to the same value as abatement levels approach 100 percent. ...|$|E

40|$|On {{the agenda}} of {{environmental}} problems, the enhanced greenhouse effect has nowadays acquired a prominent place. Although {{there is still much}} uncertainty about its extent and its consequences, there is an important rationale for addressing the possible problem of climate change now: whatever the specific consequences may be, they are to a large extent determined by the actions we take (or do not take) today. Emissions from greenhouse gases will determine the atmospheric concentrations of these gases for centuries to come. Because of the increase in anthropogenic CO 2 emissions, starting with the industrial revolution and the rise in the use of fossil fuels which it has caused, the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere has risen by 25 percent since 1750. If we want to limit the increase of CO 2 concentrations, action must be taken now. Within the broad area of research on climate change, one specific strand of economic research has focused on {{the problem of how to}} reduce emissions from greenhouse gases, especially the emission of carbondioxide, which is the main greenhouse gas. Taking as a starting point the assumption that a CO 2 emission reduction target has been set, the objective of these studies is to determine the optimal way of reducing these emissions. From the start, it has been pointed out by environmental economists that economic instruments are suitable for implementing a policy of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. With economic instruments, emissions will be reduced in an efficient manner, according to the theory. This has been argued and illustrated in a large number of studies which deal with economic instruments like taxes or charges and <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> permits (see e. g. Barrett 1992, UNCTAD 1992, OECD 1992 a and 1992 b, Smith 1992). In this study, the instrument of <b>tradeable</b> carbon <b>emission</b> permits (TCP’s) is studied in more detail. The central issue is: the design of a feasible system of TCP’s and the study of the consequences of implementing such a system. Up till now, the focus of research in this area has been predominantly on the efficiency of reducing CO 2 emissions by means of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> permits or taxes. Less attention has been paid to the design of such a system, which is the subject of chapter 2. In this chapter the outlines are sketched of a feasible system of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> permits for the European Union. The proposed system is in essence a system of (carbon in) fuel rationing with tradeability of quota between citizens. Points under consideration are a. o. the characteristics of the fuel permit, the distribution of the permits (either the government sells them or gives them away for free), the market allocation of the permits, the time path by which the number of permits available is reduced, monitoring and enforcement of the system and the consequences which a system of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> permits might have for business location choice. Moreover it is studied whether a system of TCP’s can operate on a national base in one member state of the European Union or if it should be implemented at the European level. Last, the requirements of a EU-wide system are sketched. A study of the implications of reducing CO 2 emissions by means of TCP’s (or any other instrument) can not be complete without studying the economic consequences of such a system. To predict some of the consequences of introducing an instrument like TCP’s in an industry a micro-economic approach is necessary in which the influence on one or more facets of economic behaviour is studied in detail. For example, attention has been given to the potential misuse of market power in the permit market (see Tietenberg 1985 and Hahn 1984). On the other hand hardly any attention has been paid up till now to the possible effects of <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> permits on entry into industries. This is especially interesting because it has been practice to grandfather permits to existing sources while new sources, potential entrants, have to buy them. Many people, and even economists have the intuition that in particular such a system of grandfathering will erect barriers to potential entrants, whereas a system of auctioning permits to all firms, established ones and entrants, would not have such an impact, or at least a much weaker negative effect on entry. In chapter 3 and 4 it is analyzed how far this idea is true. The question is addressed whether, how and to what extent a system of tradeable permits might create barriers to entry in the product market. Several forms of entry barriers which might be caused or increased by tradeable permits are identified and analyzed. Subsequently, it is studied whether these forms of entry barriers are likely to occur in the system of TCP’s which is outlined in chapter 2. An effort is made to determine to what extent entry will be affected when entry barriers are raised due to the TCP system. The above questions are important, not only from a static point of view, but also if a dynamic view is taken. If a TCP-system for reducing CO 2 emissions raises entry barriers, it will affect the whole economy, affecting long-term industry dynamics. This in turn might reduce the efforts on research and development and reduce economic activity and efficiency in the longer run in the whole economy. The approach taken here is to study the micro-economic consequences of a system of tradeable carbon permits with respect to entry barriers, both with grandfathering and with auctioning of CO 2 emission permits. The results will be compared with the results achieved under two other instruments, taxes and standards. The possible occurrence of entry barriers is analyzed both theoretically and empirically. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{abatement}} {{investment and}} location responses to environmental policy, which {{takes the form}} of <b>emission</b> taxes or <b>tradeable</b> <b>emission</b> permits and subsidies against the costs of abatement investment, under uncertainty and irreversibility. Uncertainty is associated with output price, environmental policy parameters, or technological parameters. Irreversibility is related to abatement expenses and movements to a new location. Uncertainty is modeled by It“ stochastic differential equations, and the problem is analyzed by using optimal stopping methodologies. Continuation intervals during which firms do not engage in abatement investment or relocate and intervals during which firms take the irreversible decision of undertaking abatement expenses or relocating are defined. Free boundaries are characterized for a variety of cases that include output price uncertainty expressed both in terms of continuous fluctuations of permit prices and unpredictable policy changes, and combined policy and technological uncertainty. An optimal environmental policy is defined as the combination of policy parameters that makes the free boundary corresponding to the profit maximization problem coincide with the free boundary corresponding to a social optimization problem. ...|$|R
