Nine months before filming, Avnet had Conran meet the actors and begin rehearsals {{in an attempt to}} get <b>the</b> <b>shy</b> filmmaker out of his shell. Avnet set up a custom digital effects studio with a blue screen soundstage in an abandoned building in Van Nuys, California. A group of almost 100 digital artists, modelers, animators and compositors created multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for the live action footage yet to be filmed.|$|E

Concerned about her children and parenting skills, she sought help for the family from a psychiatrist at St. Justine's Hospital in 1976; the assessment concluded {{there was nothing wrong}} with <b>the</b> <b>shy</b> and withdrawn Gamil, but recommended therapy for his sister Nadia, who was challenging her authority.|$|E

When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.|$|E

5|$|In a Victorian village, Victor Van Dort, {{the son of}} nouveau riche fish merchants, and Victoria Everglot, the {{neglected}} {{daughter of}} snobbish yet impoverished aristocrats, are preparing for their arranged marriage, which will simultaneously raise the social class of Victor's parents and restore the wealth of Victoria's penniless family. Both have concerns about marrying someone they do not know, but upon meeting for the first time, they fall for each other. After <b>the</b> <b>shy</b> Victor ruins the wedding rehearsal by forgetting his vows, he flees and practices his wedding vows in the nearby forest, placing the wedding ring on a nearby upturned tree root. The root {{turns out to be}} the finger of a murdered woman in a tattered bridal gown named Emily, who rises from the grave claiming that she is now Victor's wife. After fainting, Victor wakes up and finds himself spirited away to the Land of the Dead. The bewildered Victor learns the story of how Emily was murdered years ago by an unknown perpetrator on the night of her secret elopement.|$|E
25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for <b>the</b> <b>shy</b> to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for <b>the</b> <b>shy</b> to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E

40|$|M. A. The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between shyness and self-conscious emotions in terms of attribution style. Participants were administered questionnaires and then categorized into fearful shy, self-conscious shy, undifferentiated shy and non-shy groups. These four groups were then compared in terms of shyness, shame, guilt, embarrassment, and attribution style. Furthermore, the relationships between shame, guilt, and embarrassment and the different attribution styles were examined. <b>The</b> fearful <b>shy,</b> self-conscious shy and undifferentiated shy groups differed from the non-shy group in terms of the attribution styles of context and luck. <b>The</b> fearful <b>shy</b> group was found to score higher than the non-shy group in terms of context, in addition to <b>the</b> fearful <b>shy</b> as well as <b>the</b> self-conscious <b>shy</b> groups scoring higher than the non-shy groups in terms of luck. However no differences were found in terms of ability and effort between the four groups. With regards to experiencing self-conscious emotions, <b>the</b> fearful <b>shy,</b> self-conscious <b>shy,</b> and <b>the</b> undifferentiated <b>shy</b> groups differed from the non-shy group by scoring higher on shame. <b>The</b> fearful <b>shy,</b> self-conscious <b>shy,</b> and <b>the</b> undifferentiated <b>shy</b> groups also scored higher in terms of embarrassment from the non-shy group, with <b>the</b> fearful <b>shy</b> group scoring <b>the</b> highest followed by <b>the</b> self-conscious <b>shy</b> group and then <b>the</b> undifferentiated <b>shy</b> group. Furthermore, <b>the</b> fearful <b>shy</b> and undifferentiated shy differed from one another with <b>the</b> fearful <b>shy</b> group scoring higher in terms of embarrassment. The four groups, however, did not vary in terms of guilt. In terms of the relationship between attribution styles and self-conscious emotions, positive correlations were found between ability and shame and ability and embarrassment. A positive correlation was found between effort and guilt. Positive correlations between luck and shame and luck and embarrassment were also found. Self-conscious emotions were found to be highly correlated with shyness. Attribution styles may {{play a significant role in}} terms of an individual experiencing these emotions. Shy individuals may differ from non-shy individuals with regards to the attributions they engage in, causing them to experience self-conscious emotions to a higher extent. This may suggest a cognitive component that may be associated with self-conscious emotions. Therefore, shy individuals may be predisposed to experiencing self-conscious emotions more frequently than non-shy individuals. It is suggested that future research focus on this cognitive component in the experience of self-conscious emotions...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{leadership}} {{have focused}} either on physiological state {{as the key}} predictor (i. e. "leading according to need"), or else on temperamental asymmetries among group members (i. e. intrinsic leadership). In this paper, we explore how both factors interact in determining the emergence of leaders. We observed pairs of sticklebacks {{with varying degrees of}} temperamental difference, and recorded their movements back and forth between a safe covered area and a risky foraging area, both before and after satiating one of the two pair members (but not the other). Before satiation, when the fish had similar hunger levels, temperament was a good predictor of social roles, with the bolder member of a pair leading and <b>the</b> <b>shyer</b> member following. <b>The</b> effect of satiation depended on which fish received the additional food. When <b>the</b> <b>shyer</b> member of a pair was fed, and consequently became less active, the bolder fish did not change its behaviour but continued to lead. By contrast, when the bolder member of a pair was fed, and consequently initiated fewer trips out of cover, <b>the</b> <b>shyer</b> partner compensated by initiating trips more frequently itself. In pairs that differed only a little in temperament, feeding the bolder fish actually led to a role reversal, with <b>the</b> <b>shyer</b> fish emerging as a leader in the majority of joint trips out of cover. Our results show that leadership emerges as the consequence of multiple factors, and that their interaction can be complex...|$|R

[...] "I'd Have You Anytime" [...] is recognised as a statement of friendship between the two musicians, whose meetings from 1964 onwards resulted in changes in musical direction for both Dylan and the Beatles.
