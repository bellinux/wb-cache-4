The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the extent of agreement that existed between Illinois community college administrators and instructional staff members on selected factors associated with general education requirements. The study questionnaire was completed by 109 staff members on 34 campuses of Illinois community colleges. The questionnaire consisted of questions concerned with: general information pertaining to the personal background of the respondents, general education objectives, community college policies related to general education, general education course descriptions, questions on general education practices, and the appropriateness of general education courses to specific degrees. The responses made by the study sample were analyzed by calculating the percentages and the chi square results for each of the items used on the questionnaire.

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between <b>those</b> <b>involved,</b> <b>in</b> which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E

5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rebels}} had urban backgrounds, and the {{majority}} of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the events of London were probably local townsfolk rather than peasants.

In London, for example, the urban rebels appear to have largely been the poor and unskilled. Other urban rebels were part of the elite, such as at York where the protesters were typically prosperous members of the local community, while in some instances, townsfolk allied themselves with the rural population, as at Bury St Edmunds. In other cases, such as Canterbury, the influx of population from the villages following the Black Death made any distinction between urban and rural less meaningful.|$|E

5|$|Many of <b>those</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> {{the revolt}} used pseudonyms, {{particularly}} in the letters sent {{around the country to}} encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to allude to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E
