5|$|Born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Petry had {{an active}} youth, {{and joined the}} Army after high school. Completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program, he was {{deployed}} several times to both Iraq and Afghanistan {{as a member of}} the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. On May 26, 2008 during his seventh deployment, Petry was a member of a team on a mission to capture a Taliban target in Paktia Province. Despite being wounded in both legs by gunfire, Petry continued to fight and give orders. When a grenade landed between him and two other soldiers, Petry grabbed it and attempted <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> away from them. He saved the soldiers' lives but the grenade exploded, severing his right hand.|$|E
5|$|Navy {{received}} {{the ball from}} Washington and began <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30yards. Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.|$|E
5|$|Another bombshell is {{dropped in}} Dimitri's {{life when he}} finds out that Anton Lang, who he {{believed}} to be the son of two Marick family employees, is really his son with his maid, Corvina Lang (Margaret Sophie Stein). Dimitri had had a drunken one-night stand with Corvina which he had no memory of. Dimitri is happy to finally be a father, but Corvina convinces him not to tell Anton the truth right away. Dimitri attempts to forge relationship with Anton so it will ease the shock of the news. Nevertheless, Anton, who had believed Corvina was his sister, doesn't take the news of his parentage well and marries Kendall <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> in Dimitri's face. Eventually, Anton sees Kendall for the manipulator that she is and divorces her. Anton and Dimitri manage to work things out before Anton leaves town.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the things}} that cause the most {{confusion}} for people that are not familiar with the game are the Holding the Ball, Dropping the Ball, and Throwing rules. Confusion arises because a player being tackled is not allowed to hold onto the ball, but is not allowed <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> either.|$|E
25|$|During a field firing {{exercise}} at a rest camp in Bangalore, a rifle grenade misfired and fell only eight yards from his section.

It exploded in his hand, wounding him fatally, but his self-sacrifice saved his comrades from harm.|$|E

25|$|Is {{he going}} <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> away? Is {{he going to}} beat him with it? Or even kill him with it? Beckett’s plays often have a certain open-endedness and this sketch is no different.

25|$|It is {{occasionally}} {{alleged that}} knife throwing acts are actually a trick {{in which the}} thrower palms the knife as he pretends <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> and a knife springs out from the target, giving the illusion of perfect aim. Although this technique {{has been used by}} at least one magician to emulate knife throwing, the great majority of knife throwers perform genuine acts. There are secret tricks behind certain stunts, such as throwing while blindfolded, but they do not involve fake knives springing from the target board.|$|E

25|$|Several factors came {{together}} for Frazier in this fight. He was 27 {{years old and}} at his boxing peak physically and mentally, Ali, 29, was coming back from a three-year absence but had kept active. He had had two good wins, including a bruising battle with Oscar Bonavena, whom Ali had defeated by a TKO in 15 rounds. Frazier worked on strategy with coach Eddie Futch. They noted Ali's tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali's right hand and, at the moment Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook {{at the spot where}} they knew Ali's face would be a second later. Frazier staggered Ali in the 11th round and knocked down Ali in the 15th in this way.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb {{as she is}} cutting brownies.

Since Homer's thumb is starting to shrivel up, he stops by at Moe's, where he gets a pickle brine solution. He gets distracted when Moe offers him a beer. Homer rushes {{out the door and}} sees Marge is gone. He hitchhikes with Cletus who drives him to Dr. Nick's, but they discover the clinic is on fire. Homer asks Cletus to drive him to Shelbyville Hospital, but his truck gets stolen and Homer leaves for the hospital on foot. His thumb is almost completely shrivelled up now, and he is just about <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> away when an explosion sends Linguo's severed head flying up into the air and it lands next to him.|$|E
25|$|Bollinger {{was signed}} up by Chennai Super Kings for the 2010 Indian Premier League. He has been {{included}} in the roster after the Super Kings' all-rounder Jacob Oram confirmed his unavailability for the season due to injury. Bollinger arrived for {{the second half of the}} tournament after the end of the tour of New Zealand. Bollinger is the fourth Australian to play for the Super Kings after Matthew Hayden, Michael Hussey and George Bailey. In his IPL debut, he helped Chennai defend a total of 246 against Rajasthan by taking a catch off Yusuf Pathan which was going for a six; he backpedalled and caught the ball and had <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> up in the air before falling over the rope and then rebalancing himself to complete the catch. This earned him an award for the best catch of the match. He delivered a spell of 2/15 from four overs dismissing Shane Watson who got 60 off just 25 balls in a match which the other Chennai bowlers averaged 13 runs per over in contrast to his 3.75. Rajasthan ended their innings at 223.|$|E

5000|$|The {{foundation}} of the chapel by Pope Paschal II was maybe {{part of an effort}} to restore the safety of the area around Porta Flaminia which was ouside the inhabited core of medieval Rome and certainly infested with bandits. Another possible source of inspiration for the legend could have been the well-documented revenge of Pope Paschal II on the body of his opponent, Antipope Clement III. The pope seized the city of Civita Castellana, had Clement’s cadaver exhumed from his tomb, and ordered <b>to</b> <b>thrown</b> <b>it</b> into the Tiber. Clement III was the protégée of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV who was often called [...] "Nero" [...] by the papal party.|$|R

25|$|In 1997, the {{government}} set up TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) which reduced the interference of Government in deciding tariffs and policy making. The political powers changed in 1999 {{and the new}} government {{under the leadership of}} Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more pro-reforms and introduced better liberalisation policies. In 2000, the Vajpayee government constituted the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) through an amendment of the TRAI Act, 1997. The primary objective of TDSAT's establishment was to release TRAI from adjudicatory and dispute settlement functions in order to strengthen the regulatory framework. Any dispute involving parties like licensor, licensee, service provider and consumers are resolved by TDSAT. Moreover, any direction, order or decision of TRAI can be challenged by appealing in TDSAT. The government corporatised the operations wing of DoT on 1 October 2000 and named it as Department of Telecommunication Services (DTS) which was later named as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). The proposal of raising the stake of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by the opposite political parties and leftist thinkers. Domestic business groups wanted {{the government}} to privatise VSNL. Finally in April 2002, the government decided to cut its stake of 53% to 26% in VSNL and <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> open for sale to private enterprises. TATA finally took 25% stake in VSNL.|$|E
25|$|September: Aldershot {{continued}} their early unbeaten {{run with a}} third consecutive 1–1 draw at home to Northampton, though the Shots needed a Ben Harding volley in the 5th minute of injury time to salvage a point. The next game - away to promotion-chasing Port Vale - promised {{to be a tough}} test, and this was proved right as the club suffered its first loss of the season, Gary Roberts scoring the only goal of the game. On 16 September the management brought in winger Marlon Jackson on loan from Bristol City, a player who assistant manager Gary Owers believed would help the team in the attacking third. Wycombe were the next visitors to the Recreation Ground, which meant a return for former Shots' boss Gary Waddock, who led the club to the Football Conference championship in the 2007–08 season. The match {{failed to live up to}} expectations, ending in a dull goalless draw. This fifth low-scoring draw of the season encouraged fears that the side were not good enough up front, and were not converting the few chances being presented to them. The squad responded by taking a 2–0 lead away to Stockport in their next game, only <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> away in the final minutes to draw yet again. A win did come before the end of the month, however, Morgan again netting in the final ten minutes to snatch all three points away to Torquay.|$|E
500|$|Wilhelm {{was noted}} {{during this period}} for his {{mentoring}} of relief pitcher Wilbur Wood, {{who came to the}} 1967 White Sox in a trade. Wood sometimes threw a knuckleball upon his arrival in Chicago, but Wilhelm encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it</b> full-time. By 1968, Wood won 13 games, saved 16 games and earned a 1.87 ERA. He credited Wilhelm with helping him to master the knuckleball, as the White Sox coaches did not know much about how <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> <b>it.</b> Between 1968 and 1970, Wood pitched in more games (241) than any other pitcher and more innings (...) than any other relief pitcher.|$|E
