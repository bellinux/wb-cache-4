5|$|North Korean troops {{promptly}} set up {{a roadblock}} directly behind the 19th Infantry's line in its main route of supply along the road {{near the village of}} Tuman, just south of Yusong on Taejon's western outskirts. The roadblock quickly became a serious problem for U.S. forces <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> ammunition and wounded to and from the Kum River line. Around 13:00 on July 16, the 19th Infantry Regimental commander contacted Dean, who ordered him to break the roadblock. However, North Korean troops had {{set up a}}t least six machine-gun nests above the road at Tuman, and repeated attacks against it were unable to drive the North Korean troops away.|$|E
5|$|Some months later, {{the town}} has {{constructed}} a statue of the Giant in its memory, friendship, and heroism, and Dean and Annie are starting a relationship. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, a bolt from the Giant being the only remnant they could find. That night, Hogarth sees the bolt <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on its own, and he opens the window, letting the bolt roll free. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland. The Giant's head activates, and he smiles as he puts itself back together.|$|E
5|$|Truth Serum {{has been}} {{described}} as a pop, electropop and indie pop record. According to Lo, the tracks talk about her most intense love affair, from the happy beginning of the relationship to the part when she is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on after the break up. The EP received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who commended the production and the lyrics of the songs. The record peaked at number 13 in Sweden, and became 2014's 49th best-selling album in the country. It also reached number eight on the Norwegian Albums Chart, spending 23 weeks.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{recorded}} the album in New York City with Shep Pettibone and André Betts {{while she was}} working on her book and film projects. She began creating the album's demos with Pettibone in his apartment in October 1991. Madonna wrote the melodies and lyrics on top of the basic music which Pettibone produced in the style of his remixes. During the sessions, they had problems during sequencing, and, as a result, Pettibone kept <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> development as fast as possible as he did not want Madonna to lose interest in the music. According to him, Madonna's compositions were serious and intense, directing the creative direction of the songs into a deeply personal territory.|$|E
5|$|On September 19 the UN {{discovered}} the North Koreans had abandoned Battle Mountain during the night, and the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, moved up and occupied it. On the right, the 35th Infantry began moving forward. There was only light resistance until {{it reached the}} high {{ground in front of}} Chungam-ni where hidden North Korean soldiers in spider holes shot at 1st Battalion soldiers from the rear. The next day the 1st Battalion captured Chungam-ni, and the 2nd Battalion captured the long ridge line running northwest from it to the Nam River. Meanwhile, the North Koreans still held strongly against the division left where the 27th Infantry had heavy fighting in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> forward.|$|E
25|$|Some drive {{mechanisms}} {{such as the}} Apple II 5.25 inch drive without a track zero sensor, produce very characteristic mechanical noises when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the heads past the reference surface.

25|$|Distasteful {{though we}} find the whole idea, we think that some {{deliberate}} limitation {{of the volume of}} motor traffic is quite unavoidable. The need for it just can't be escaped. Even when everything that it is possibly to do by way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into, or within our cities than could possibly be accommodated.|$|E
25|$|A {{little after}} noon the Union {{soldiers}} {{began to move}} toward the Confederate lines, and {{at about the same time}} the rains began. The road was soon turned into mud, and the mere act of walking required great exertion. The gunners with the howitzers accompanying the infantry soon were exhausted <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their pieces, so a regiment of infantry (51st Pennsylvania) were detailed to help them. Many of those foot soldiers long remembered this as the most arduous part of the battle.|$|E
25|$|The Central Labor Council, the Building Trades Council and the Teamsters Joint Council {{approached}} Mike Johannes, the Minneapolis Chief of Police, {{to propose}} a truce, under which the local would cease picketing for twenty-four hours if {{the police and the}} employers ceased <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> trucks. The employers, the Teamsters and the building trades signed a formal truce agreement. Johannes, however, declared that the police would move trucks once the truce expired, leading the union to announce that it was resuming picketing.|$|E

25|$|Afterwards, McDonough {{was widely}} {{perceived}} as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the party toward {{the centre of}} the political spectrum, in the Third Way mould of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Union leaders were lukewarm in their support, often threatening to break away from the NDP, while Canadian Auto Workers head Buzz Hargrove called for her resignation. MPs Rick Laliberté and Angela Vautour crossed the floor to other parties during this term, to the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives respectively, reducing the NDP caucus to 19 seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{convention}} {{was held on}} February 21, 1982. This time his convention speech was better. Although not very inspiring, it was viewed as 'statesmanlike' and effective. He won on the second ballot defeating the more left-leaning Sheila Copps with 55% of the vote. In his acceptance speech Peterson {{said that he would}} move party to the 'vibrant middle, the radical centre', and stressed economic growth as a way to increase support for social services. Observers from the other parties felt he was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Liberal party more to the right, away from values that Smith promoted.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{being able}} to {{function}} within a Discourse may carry advantages in different situations. For example, {{if a person is}} raised in a family of lawyers, the Discourses of politics or business may come very easily to that person. In the United States, those are all Discourses of power and they are closely related. Another person raised in a very different Discourse community might find himself or herself at a disadvantage when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> within the Discourse of business, trying to get a loan, for instance. One Discourse community is not inherently better than another; however, power within a society may be unequally represented within different Discourses.|$|E

25|$|Directly {{north of}} Toronto, {{the town of}} Barrie was flooded, which damaged some roads and sewers. In Beeton, five people, in two cars, were killed when they were washed off a bridge. In Ottawa, a fence at Lansdowne Park was blown over; with the Rough Riders {{scheduled}} to play the Toronto Argonauts, officials were worried that many fans would get in for free as {{the hole in the}} fence could not be fixed in time.

25|$|In the {{interest}} of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the controlled system needs to be critically damped. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{it away from the}} required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a PLC or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Through many initiatives, which {{includes}} the Diversity League Table consultation, Nwokolo has led BSN to work consistently {{in the direction of}} widening meaningful participation and access to legal services in the United Kingdom. She is noted for progressive vision in the following words: “Working with our partners we’re <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> things forward in terms of creating a legal workforce drawn from the most meritorious. The inclusion of questions about the social background of lawyers, and lawyers to be, represents an important new phase of the consultation.” This crucial Diversity League Table reporting has four main diversity areas; namely: gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disabilities. Focusing on the demographic composition of law firms and chambers, results are shown as a sequence of organisation profiles and successive leagues tables; ranking participants in major areas, and also showing an overall ranking on the complete Diversity League Table.|$|E

25|$|The Cancún ministerial {{collapsed}} {{for several}} reasons. First, differences over the Singapore issues seemed incapable of resolution. The EU had retreated on few of its demands, but several developing countries refused any consideration {{of these issues}} at all. Second, it was questioned whether some countries had come to Cancún with a serious intention to negotiate. In the view of some observers, a few countries showed no flexibility in their positions and only repeated their demands rather than talk about trade-offs. Third, the wide difference between developing and developed countries across virtually all topics was a major obstacle. The US–EU agricultural proposal {{and that of the}} G20 developing nations, for example, show strikingly different approaches to special and differential treatment. Fourth, there was some criticism of procedure. Some claimed the agenda was too complicated. Also, Cancún ministerial chairman, Mexico’s Foreign Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez, was faulted for ending the meeting when he did, instead of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the talks into areas where some progress could have been made.|$|E
25|$|Hansbrough {{appeared}} in 22 of the team's first 32 games in 2010–11, averaging 5.0 points and 3.3 rebounds in 12.9 minutes per game. From that point on, he averaged 13.7 points, 6.1 rebounds and 26.1 minutes per game in 48 appearances, 29 {{of which were}} starts. His 23rd {{game of the season}} came on January 7, 2011 against the San Antonio Spurs. He made his second career start (his first of the season) and scored a game-high 23 points with 12 rebounds. Hansbrough started at power forward with the Pacers <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a smaller lineup. He also had two blocked shots and finished 10-of-10 from the field. He topped that performance on January 23, leading the Pacers with a then career-high 27 points and 10 rebounds in a loss to the Denver Nuggets. On March 15, 2011, Hansbrough posted a career high for the second game in a row against the New York Knicks. After scoring 29 points on March 13, he had a 30-point effort two nights later to help the Pacers claim back-to-back wins against the Knicks.|$|E
25|$|Reynaud and de Portes {{left the}} Hotel Splendid, Bordeaux, driving {{southeast}} {{ahead of the}} advancing German armies, intending to stop at Reynaud's holiday home at Grès, Hérault, (other sources state Sainte-Maxime) before fleeing to North Africa. On 28 June, with Reynaud at the wheel, their Renault Juvaquatre car inexplicably left the road and hit a plane tree at La Peyrade, between Frontignan and Sète; de Portes was all but decapitated, while Reynaud escaped with relatively minor head injuries. Hospitalized at Montpellier, Reynaud was arrested on his discharge on Pétain's orders and imprisoned at Fort du Portalet. Pétain decided against having Reynaud charged during the Riom Trial of 1942, but surrendered him to the Germans instead, who removed him firstly to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, thence Itter Castle near Wörgl, Austria, where he remained with other high-profile French prisoners until liberated by Allied troops on 7 May 1945. Major Josef Gangl, a Wehrmacht officer who had gone over to the anti-Nazi Austrian resistance, {{was killed by a}} sniper's bullet while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> Reynaud out of harm's way during the Battle for Castle Itter on May 5, 1945.|$|E
