5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been fast enough to make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frank Grimes' {{favorite}} television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends {{after six}} seasons {{and it is}} revealed that the entire series was just an angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, {{that he has not}} seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that he was a real cop in the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged from the force and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this is why he is so angry with the ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>car</b> Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood.|$|E
