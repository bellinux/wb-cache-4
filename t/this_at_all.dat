25|$|Napoleon {{had been}} {{planning}} an invasion of England for some time, with the first Army of England gathering on the Channel coast in 1798. Napoleon's concentration on campaigns in Egypt and Austria, and the Peace of Amiens caused these plans to be shelved in 1802. The resumption of hostilities in 1803 led to their revival, and forces were gathered outside Boulogne in large military camps {{in preparation for the}} assembling of the invasion flotilla. The Royal Navy was the main obstacle to a successful invasion, but Napoleon declared that his fleet need only be masters of the Channel for six hours and the crossing could be effected. Though the intended departure points were known and were being closely blockaded by the Royal Navy, First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Melville was short of ships. If a combined Franco-Spanish fleet were to force the Navy from its station for even a short while, the French invasion force might succeed in crossing unmolested. The French aimed to achieve at least temporary control of the Channel, while the British aimed to prevent <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> costs.|$|E
500|$|When the sagas {{were written}} down Orkney had been Christian for 200 {{years or more}} and the {{conversion}} tale itself is [...] "blatantly unhistorical". When the Norse arrived in the Northern Isles they would have found organised Christianity already thriving there, {{although there is no}} mention of <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in the sagas. Furthermore, the Norse dragon motif of the whale-bone plaque found at the Scar boat burial was found in conjunction with the grave of an elderly woman who had died by 950 AD at the latest, and the weight of archaeological evidence suggests that Christian burial was widespread in Orkney by Sigurd's time. The intention may have been to disown the influence of indigenous elements of Orcadian and Shetlandic culture and emphasise that positive cultural developments came from Scandinavia, whilst at the same time critiquing the unduly blunt method of Norwegian interference in this case. The inclusion of the tale of the raven banner in the saga material may convey the idea of a revival of heathenism in Orcadian society and a reaction to Norwegian attempts to control the islands. However, in the Orkneyinga Saga there is a vivid contrast between Sigurd's death clutching the raven banner and the later career of his son Thorfinn, who is credited with several achievements in bringing Orkney into mainstream Christendom. Taken as a whole the intention may be to draw attention to this transition.|$|E
500|$|After {{agreeing to}} rework the {{material}} that Ralbovsky had found so objectionable, Gilmour employed session musicians such as Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner. [...] Both drummers, they later replaced Mason {{on most of the}} album's songs; Mason was concerned that he was too out of practice to perform on the album, and instead busied himself with its sound effects. [...] Some of the drum parts were also performed by drum machines. During the sessions, Gilmour was asked by the wife of Pink Floyd's former keyboard player, Richard Wright, if he too could contribute to the project. [...] A founding member of the band, Wright had left in 1979, and there were certain legal obstacles to his return, but after a meeting in Hampstead he was brought back in. [...] Gilmour later admitted in an interview with author Karl Dallas that Wright's presence [...] "would make us stronger legally and musically". [...] He was therefore employed as a paid musician, on a weekly wage of $11,000, but his contributions were minimal. [...] Most of the keyboard parts had already been recorded, and so from February 1987 Wright played some background reinforcement on a Hammond organ, and a Rhodes piano, along with adding several vocal harmonies. The keyboardist also performed a solo in [...] "On the Turning Away", which was discarded, according to Wright, [...] "not because they didn't like it...they just thought it didn't fit." [...] Gilmour later said: [...] "Both Nick and Rick were catatonic in terms of their playing ability at the beginning. Neither of them played on <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> really. [...] In my view, they'd been destroyed by Roger …" [...] Gilmour's comments angered Mason, who reflected: [...] "I'd deny that I was catatonic. [...] I'd expect that from the opposition, it's less attractive from one's allies. [...] At some point, he made some sort of apology." [...] Mason did concede, however, that Gilmour was nervous about how the album would be perceived.|$|E

2500|$|According to the European Waste Incineration Directive, {{incineration}} plants must {{be designed}} {{to ensure that the}} flue gases reach a temperature of at least [...] for 2seconds in order to ensure proper breakdown of toxic organic substances. In order to comply with <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times, it is required to install backup auxiliary burners (often fueled by oil), which are fired into the boiler in case the heating value of the waste becomes too low to reach this temperature alone.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{municipal}} incinerator designs {{include a}} high-temperature zone, where the flue gas is sustained at a temperature above [...] {{for at least}} 2 seconds before it is cooled down. They are equipped with auxiliary heaters to ensure <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times. These are often fueled by oil or natural gas, and are normally only active for a very {{small fraction of the}} time. Further, most modern incinerators utilize fabric filters (often with Teflon membranes to enhance collection of sub-micron particles) which can capture dioxins present in or on solid particles.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, without {{reference}} to ancient texts on etymology, {{it has been suggested}} that it means [...] "a square tablet strewn with dust", or [...] "drawing-board covered with dust (for the use of mathematics)" [...] (the exact shape of the Latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the Greek word, ἄβακoς abakos). Whereas the table strewn with dust definition is popular, there are those that do not place credence in <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> and in fact state that it is not proven. Greek ἄβαξ itself is probably a borrowing of a Northwest Semitic, perhaps Phoenician, word akin to Hebrew ʾābāq (אבק), [...] "dust" [...] (or in post-Biblical sense meaning [...] "sand used as a writing surface").|$|E

2500|$|Codeine is {{available}} {{over the counter}} in South Africa. Certain pharmacies require people to write down their name and address to ensure they are not buying too much over a short period although many do not require <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> According to Dr Lochan Naidoo, {{the former president of}} the National Narcotics Control Board, making the drugs more difficult to obtain could lead to even worse problems where people in withdrawal would turn to illicit drugs to get their fix. [...] Although codeine is freely available, South Africa has a fairly low annual prevalence rate of opiate use at 0.3% compared to the United States at 0.57% where all opiates are strictly regulated.|$|E

On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing.

2500|$|One way or another, Nell's father {{seems to}} have been out of the picture by the time of her {{childhood}} in Covent Garden, and her [...] "dipsomaniac mother, [...] sister", Rose, were left in a low situation. She experimented with cross-dressing between 1663-1667 going under the name [...] "William Nell" [...] and adopting a false beard; her observations informed a most successful and hilarious character interpretation acting as a man on the stage in March 1667. Old Madam Gwyn was by most accounts an alcoholic whose business was running a bawdy house (or brothel). There, or in the bawdy house of one Madam Ross, Nell would spend at least some time. It is possible she worked herself as a child prostitute; Peter Thomson, in the Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre, says it is [...] "probable". A rare mention of her upbringing from the source herself might be seen to contradict the idea: A 1667 entry in Samuel Pepys' diary records, second-hand, thatHere Mrs. Pierce tells me [...] that Nelly and Beck Marshall, falling out the other day, the latter called the other my Lord Buckhurst's whore. Nell answered then, [...] "I was but one man's whore, though I was brought up in a bawdy-house to fill strong waters to the guests; and you are a whore to three or four, though a Presbyter's praying daughter!".
