5|$|Wyatt Earp was {{the last}} {{surviving}} Earp brother and the last surviving participant of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral when he died {{at home in the}} Earps' small rented bungalow at 4004 W 17th Street, in Los Angeles, of chronic cystitis on January 13, 1929, at the age of 80. His brother Newton died almost a month prior on December 18, 1928. Charlie Welsh's daughter Grace Spolidora and his daughter-in-law, Alma, were the only witnesses to Wyatt's cremation. Josephine was apparently <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> grief to assist. Wyatt was survived by Josephine and sister Adelia. He had no children.|$|E
25|$|Water: The water {{signs are}} Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. A native with mainly water signs {{will be very}} {{emotional}} and {{find it hard to}} look at anything dispassionately. They tend to respond slowly to questions and need time to grasp a new concept. Water subjects can find it difficult to explain their feelings, and so can be difficult to live with, but they are also kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see the needs of others. They may be <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people. Planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Cooper felt Creelman's {{final draft}} was slow-paced, <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition, and {{written on a}} scale that would have been prohibitively {{expensive}} to film. Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production. Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.|$|E

500|$|One concern {{addressed}} by Hazlitt is the assertion by previous critics that Macbeth {{is little more}} than a crude and violent amalgam of extremes filled with [...] "Gothic" [...] barbarisms. Hazlitt notes, however, that should anyone think Macbeth's character is so composed of contradictory extremes as to be implausible, it is, rather, the circumstances and the passions in conflict that provide the extremes, while Macbeth's character retains a strong underlying unity throughout. [...] "Macbeth in Shakespear no more loses his identity of character in the fluctuations of fortune or the storm of passions than Macbeth in himself would have lost the identity of his person." [...] Kinnaird notes that here, as if anticipating it by a century, Hazlitt argues against the view advanced by Elmer Edgar Stoll in 1933, that Macbeth's character is <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> contradictions to be plausible.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{grandeur}} of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5October that [...] "I feel so lonely, {{it is impossible for}} me to be happy" [...] and complaining of [...] "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" [...] which he considered [...] "such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26October 1816. In Paris he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere too rowdy and the studio <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} years of the Clinton administration, Moran was {{critical}} of the President: In 1998, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. He told Time magazine that [...] "This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that just became <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters." [...] Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of [...] "dishonest and illegal conduct" [...] surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.|$|E

500|$|Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film {{a score of}} C+, {{describing}} the film as a long cutscene for fans of the game rather than something equivalent to the recent Warcraft movie adaptation: {{he said that the}} visuals [...] "offer a deep dive into the Uncanny Valley", and praised the lead actors' efforts with a script he found weak. Meghan Sullivan, writing for IGN, gave the movie a score of 6/10: she called the movie [...] "gorgeous", and praised the character design despite some issues with realistic facial expressions, and found the story was bogged down by the political elements when the action side and the plot focusing on the Kingsglaive worked. In contrast, she called the voicework [...] "solid", saying that the leads brought their characters to life and prevented the script from sounding too ridiculous while the supporting cast was weaker overall. She summed up Kingsglaive as [...] "a very beautiful and very confusing movie". Andrew Barker for Variety frequently questioned whether Kingsglaive could count as a movie, as he often felt like he was watching a recorded gameplay video, praising the visuals while generally faulting the plot as rushed and <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> throwaway characters. Wired's Matt Kamen gave the film a score of 5/10. He greatly praised the movie's visuals, and was positive about the lead actors' performances and the action scenes. His criticism was leveled at its poor portrayal of the female characters, called the narrative confusing, and felt that it focused too much on setting up the events of Final Fantasy XV. His main feeling was that, while it held promise, it relied too much on character stereotypes and world building, calling it [...] "a gorgeous but over-stuffed slice of fanservice".|$|E
2500|$|The {{thesis of}} The Journalist and the Murderer is {{contained}} in its first sentence: [...] "Every journalist who is not too stupid or <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> himself to notice {{what is going on}} knows that what he does is morally indefensible." ...|$|E

He realized that the chances were we would never see each other again. He died several years ago.” ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{had really}} said {{it so that}} her friend had to take it; which the latter in fact after a moment showed herself as having done. A strange light humour in the matter even perhaps {{suddenly}} aiding, she met it with a certain accommodation. [...] "Well, say one seems to see. The point is--!"

2500|$|A Punch {{book review}} for December 1917 said: [...] "But, to be honest, the others (with the {{exception}} of one quaint little comedy of a canine ghost) are but indifferent stuff, <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> snakes and hidden treasure and general tawdriness– the kind of Orientalism, in fact, that one used to associate chiefly with the Earl's Court Exhibition. Mrs. PERRIN must not mingle her genuine native goods with such Brummagem ware".|$|E
2500|$|Wyatt died on January 13, 1929. Grace Welsh and her {{sister-in-law}} Alma were [...] the legal witnesses to Wyatt's cremation. Josephine was apparently <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> grief to assist or {{to attend the}} funeral itself. Grace was upset that Josephine didn't attend. [...] "She didn't go to his funeral, even. She wasn't that upset. She was peculiar. I don't think she was that devastated when he died." [...] After Wyatt's death, Josephine told her friends and family to stop calling her Sadie, Wyatt's name for her, and insisted they call her Josie.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbitt {{was born}} to Irish {{immigrants}} Mae (née Joyce) and Thomas Michael Rabbitt in Brooklyn, New York in 1941, and {{was raised in the}} nearby community of East Orange, New Jersey. His father was an oil-refinery refrigeration worker, and a skilled fiddle and accordion player, who often entertained in local New York City dance halls. By age twelve Rabbitt was a proficient guitar player, having been taught by his scoutmaster, Bob Scwickrath. During his childhood Rabbitt became a self-proclaimed [...] "walking encyclopedia of country music". After his parents divorced, he dropped out of school at age sixteen. His mother, Mae, explained this action by saying that Eddie [...] "was never one for school [...] his head was <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> music." [...] He later obtained a high school diploma after taking courses at night school.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here are idyls, epics, dramas {{of human}} life, written in words that [...] thrill and burn.... Each is {{a poem that}} has an immortal flavor.

60|$|However, Miss Mohun was {{announced}} almost {{as they left}} the house. She <b>too</b> was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> the bazaar, which seemed so long ago to her hearers, but with the result of which she was exceedingly delighted. The voluntary schools were secured for the present, and the gratitude of the Church folk was unbounded, especially to the Vale Leston family, who had contributed so greatly {{to the success of the}} whole.|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{expected}} for a March 2006 release, the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year. Initially {{scheduled for a}} July 11, 2006 release, the album's original draft, entitled My Story, was eventually shelved {{in favor of a}} revamped version with a different vibe. Although manager Matthew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project, Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album's direction, and thus, she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project. Speaking of the delay and the original track listing, she told Billboard: [...] "it was basically a list of songs that I put together about the past three years of my life, with love and relationships", and added: [...] "And I remember listening to the record, and I was just like, 'I don't want this to be too deep to where, you know, [...] lose people.' And the record was <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> midtempos and ballads, so I wanted to bring it up a little bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Jeffrey's writing style, Hazlitt {{transitions}} to the conversational {{abilities of the}} man in company (and it is only in [...] "mixed company" [...] that [...] "Mr. Jeffrey shines"). Again, the portrait is mostly positive but with a few faults noted in passing. [...] "Mr. Jeffrey's conversation is equally lively, various and instructive. ... Whether it be politics, or poetry, or science, or anecdote, or wit, or raillery, he takes up his cue without effort" [...] and provides [...] "an uninterrupted flow of cheerfulness and animal spirits" [...] and enormous [...] "fund of information". Yet, again, his fault is that it is all too much: [...] "If he is ever tedious, it is from an excess of liveliness". In addition, he shows too much of the lawyer: [...] "what is said by another, seems to make no impression on him; he is bound to dispute, to answer it, as if he was in Court". Jeffrey also shows a bit too much of what Hazlitt finds typical of the character of Scottish intellectuals; in Scotland, [...] "they criticise every thing, analyse every thing, argue upon every thing, dogmatise upon every thing". This makes Jeffrey [...] "too didactic, too pugnacious, <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> electric shocks, too much like a voltaic battery", and he [...] "reposes too little on his own excellent good sense, his own love of ease, his cordial frankness of temper and unaffected candour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Voldemort {{appears at}} {{the climax of the}} fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, having again plotted against Harry. In this book, Harry goes through extreme {{emotional}} stress, and according to Rowling, it was necessary to prove that Harry is emotionally vulnerable and thus human, in contrast to his nemesis Voldemort, who is emotionally invulnerable and thus inhuman: [...] " [...] a very human hero, and this is, obviously, there’s a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately dehumanised himself. [...] and Harry, therefore, did have to reach a point where he did almost break down." [...] In this book, Voldemort makes liberal use of the Ministry of Magic's refusal to believe that he has returned. Voldemort engineers a plot to free Bellatrix Lestrange and other Death Eaters from Azkaban and then embarks on a scheme to retrieve the full record of a prophecy stored in the Department of Mysteries regarding Harry and himself. He sends a group of Death Eaters to retrieve the prophecy, where the Order of the Phoenix meets them. All but Bellatrix are captured, and Voldemort engages in a ferocious duel with Dumbledore. When Dumbledore gets the upper hand, Voldemort attempts to possess Harry but finds that he cannot; Harry is <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> that which Voldemort finds incomprehensible, and which he detests as weakness: love. Sensing that Dumbledore could win, Voldemort disapparates, but not before the Minister for Magic sees him in person, making his return to life public knowledge in the next book.|$|E
60|$|I went to America curious, {{balancing}} between {{hope and}} scepticism. The European world is <b>full</b> <b>of</b> {{the criticism of}} America, and for the matter of that America <b>too</b> is <b>full</b> <b>of</b> it; hostility and depreciation prevail,--overmuch, for in spite of rawness and vehemence and a scum of blatant, oh! quite asinine folly, the United States of America remains the greatest {{country in the world}} and the living hope of mankind. It is the supreme break with the old tradition; it is the freshest and most valiant beginning that has ever been made in human life.|$|R

The absurd narrowness of world-renowned streets is so surprising--so crooked and shady as they are <b>too,</b> and <b>full</b> <b>of</b> the quaint smells of old {{cupboards}} and cellars. Walking through one of them reminds me of being at the bottom of some crevasse or gorge, the proper surface of the globe being the tops of the houses.' ...|$|R
50|$|To {{the left}} of St Martin's Church in the cellar of the former Michael's Chapel, dating from the early 12th century, is a {{so-called}} Charnel House. This was first used in the 14th century to store {{the bones of the}} dead as the graveyard itself became <b>too</b> <b>full.</b> The bones <b>of</b> about 2500 corpses can be seen behind an iron grille.|$|R
2500|$|To an extent, Mahagonny is {{an opera}} that satirizes operas. Brecht said that [...] "t attacks {{the society that}} needs operas of such a sort" [...] and Weill said that it [...] "pays {{conscious}} tribute to the irrationality of the operatic form". Both thought operas had become <b>too</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> ritual and bereft of substance, and Mahagonny in part sought to deflate the pompous arrogance of traditional opera. With this aim, many traditional operatic themes are subverted and made grotesque; love becomes a commodity, the deus ex machina tells everyone to go to hell, the law is run by criminals, etc. A traditional opera theme is true love, but in Mahagonny the closest such thing is the love between Jimmy and the prostitute Jenny. Furthermore, when given the choice to pay off Jimmy's debt and save his life, she tearfully regrets that while she loves him and will miss him dearly, she cannot part with her money. This commodification of love is brought to a grotesque apex after the hurricane spares Mahagonny; the residents now feel free {{to do what they}} want, and naturally they want to love. Consequently, in act 2 scene 3, the largely male population take turns having sex with the prostitutes. In contrast to the supposed theme of love, the scene portrays a perverse form of love; the prostitutes are carted around like giant slabs of meat and the [...] "love" [...] is regimented by the queue of men each waiting impatiently for his own turn. The [...] "Mandalay Song" [...] also heightens the ongoing tension. At no point is the music entirely tonal, and while the tune is seemingly jazzy and carefree, the tonalities betray an uneasiness about the whole business. In Mahagonny, operatic love is mutated from a grand aspiration to a mere commodity.|$|E

60|$|I {{took our}} mongrel accordingly, and left him, {{together}} with a half-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane. At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures, but very eager to hear the news. Mrs. Forrester, <b>too,</b> was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> curiosity. I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the more dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr. Sholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it. With all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze them.|$|R
