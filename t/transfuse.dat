40|$|Background: Transfusion {{of blood}} {{components}} {{and age of}} <b>transfused</b> packed red cells (PRCs) are independent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgeries. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively examined data of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institute from January 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012. Details of transfusion (autologous and allogenic), postoperative length of stay (PLOS), postoperative complications were recorded along with other relevant details. The analysis was done in two stages, in the first both <b>transfused</b> and nontransfused individuals {{and in the second}} only <b>transfused</b> individuals were considered. Age of <b>transfused</b> red cells as a cause of morbidity was analyzed only in the second stage. Results: Of the 762 patients included in the study, 613 (80. 4 %) were males and 149 (19. 6 %) were females. Multivariate analysis revealed that factors like the number and age of <b>transfused</b> PRCs and age of the patient had significant bearing upon the morbidity. Morbidity was significantly higher in the patients <b>transfused</b> with allogenic PRCs when compared with the patients not receiving any transfusion irrespective of the age of <b>transfused</b> PRCs. Transfusion of PRC of over 21 days was associated with higher postoperative complications, but not with in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, allogenic blood transfusion increases morbidity. The age of PRCs <b>transfused</b> has a significant bearing on morbidity, but not on in-hospital mortality. Blood transfusion services will therefore have to weigh the risks and benefits of providing blood older than 21 days in cardiac surgeries...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the impact of perioperative blood transfusion on postoperative complications and prognosis of patients who underwent gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma with different levels of preoperative hemoglobin value (POHb). Method. From 2003 to 2011, 1199 patients who underwent curative gastrectomy were retrospectively enrolled and followed up to December 2014. Clinicopathological features and survival outcomes were compared between <b>transfused</b> and nontransfused patients. Results. In this study, <b>transfused</b> patients had more postoperative complications than nontransfused ones (P= 0. 002).

40|$|Abstract Issues {{of nursing}} care when <b>transfusing</b> Current situation: A {{transfusion}} is putting whole blood or its complements (plasma; erythrocytes) into the bloodstream. The doctor who <b>transfuses</b> {{is responsible for}} <b>transfusing.</b> While <b>transfusing,</b> cooperation between the nurse and the doctor is important; any mistake can endanger the patient's health and life (Vyhnálek, 2003). When <b>transfusing,</b> the nurse's competencies include taking the patient's blood for blood type testing and cross testing, preparing equipment and a set, ensuring the venous access, ensuring blood compatibility and blood at the patient's bedside, monitoring the patient while <b>transfusing,</b> and keeping documents (Vokurka, 2005). The aim of the research: To determine issues of the nursing care of a patient requiring blood transfusion. In addition, to determine whether nurses observe the standard nursing procedure for patients requiring blood transfusion. Methodology: The empirical part of the bachelor's thesis was prepared {{on the basis of}} qualitative research data collection through interviews. The qualitative research was supplemented with observations of nurses using an audit technique. The results were processed using open coding. Codes were created using a pencil and paper and then divided into categories and subcategories. Participants: Interviews were intended for general nurses working at the surgical and orthopaedic departments of hospital České Budějovice, a. s. The interviews were conducted by agreement with the nurses in charge of the departments concerned. It was a deliberate choice that was influenced by the participants' willingness to cooperate. Sampling was terminated when the data obtained were theoretically saturated. An audit was carried out in the case of 5 nurses within the semester thesis. Results: It was found out {{on the basis of the}} research that the nurses had good theoretical knowledge in the area of the care of a patient requiring blood transfusion, but there were certain areas in which the nurses showed a weakness. The nurses showed their greatest weakness in the case of blood derivatives. There we found out from the research that the nurses were unable to explain what blood derivative was during the research. The results show that the nurses' knowledge in the area of patient care before <b>transfusing</b> is excellent. Another examined part of the research was to determine what duties the nurses had to perform while <b>transfusing.</b> There it was found out that not all nurses observed the recommended procedure for monitoring the patient while <b>transfusing.</b> The last part of the research was to find out what responsibilities the nurses had after <b>transfusing.</b> The research results show that the nurses know how to handle the completed transfusion and that they should keep it in a special refrigerator for 24 hours. After the end of <b>transfusing</b> all the nurses interviewed also measure the patient's physiological functions and then record them in the nursing documentation. Furthermore, it was discovered by the research that the longer practice nurses have and the more often they meet with <b>transfusing,</b> the less danger of damage to the health of the patient is. The results of the audit of <b>transfusing</b> show that the most frequent mistakes the nurses made were the insufficient identification of the patient, failure to observe the recommended time of application, and the unsatisfactory checking of the patient's condition while and after <b>transfusing.</b> Conclusions: The research results show that the nurses interviewed have relatively wide knowledge of the issues concerned. They know the nursing care of a patient requiring blood transfusion before, while and after <b>transfusing.</b> The research shows that the more often the nurse meets with <b>transfusing</b> the better her skills in <b>transfusing</b> are. The research proved that although the nurses knew the standard nursing procedure for a patient requiring blood transfusion, in practice they did not observe it fully...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to compare blood product consumption and clinical results in consecutive, unselected trauma patients during the first 6 months of year 2002, 2004 and 2007. Methods Clinical data, blood product consumption, lowest haemoglobin values on day 1 - 10 after admission, and 30 -day mortality were extracted from in-hospital trauma registry and the blood bank data base. The subpopulation of massively <b>transfused</b> patients was identified and analysed separately. Results The total number of admitted trauma patients increased by 48 % from 2002 to 2007, but the clinical data remained essentially unchanged. The mean number of erythrocyte units given day 1 - 10 decreased insignificantly from 9. 4 in 2002 to 6. 8 in 2007. New Injury Severity Score (NISS) increased in <b>transfused</b> and massively <b>transfused</b> patients, but not significantly. The number of patients <b>transfused</b> with plasma increased and the mean ratio of erythrocyte to plasma units <b>transfused</b> decreased by about 50 %. The mean haemoglobin value in <b>transfused</b> patients on day 2 after admittance was significantly lower in 2007 than in 2002, while that on day 10 was significantly higher in 2007 than in 2002 and 2004. There was no change of 30 -day survival from 2002 to 2007. Conclusions Significant changes of transfusion practice occurred during the past decade, probably {{as a result of}} increased focus on haemostasis and more precise criteria for transfusion. Despite a lower consumption of erythrocytes in 2007 than in 2002 and 2004, the mean haemoglobin level of <b>transfused</b> patients was higher on day 10 in 2007. The low number of <b>transfused</b> patients in this material makes evaluation of effect on survival difficult. Larger studies with strict control of all influencing factors are needed. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} of 60 blood <b>transfused</b> and 71 nonblood <b>transfused</b> hepatic resection patients {{was done to}} evaluate strategies for reducing blood transfusions during hepatic surgery. There {{were no significant differences}} between the two groups with regard to preoperative laboratory data, except for prothrombin time and hematocrit value. The mean operative blood loss was 1990 ml and 760 ml in the blood <b>transfused</b> and nonblood <b>transfused</b> groups, respectively. A multivariate analysis suggested that the patient’s body weight, preoperative prothrombin time, and operative blood loss independently predicted the need for intraoperative blood transfusion. Major postoperative complications developed more frequently in the blood <b>transfused</b> group than in the nonblood <b>transfused</b> group (31. 7 vs. 11. 3 %, p< 0. 005). These results suggest that the difference in operative blood loss between the two groups was related to the prolonged prothrombin time and a susceptibility for blood transfusion was found to exist particularly in patients with a lower hematocrit value as well as a lower body weight. Thus, the improvement of these preoperative laboratory data combined with avoiding the use of the hematocrit value as a determining factor for intraoperative transfusion could correspond to a reduction in operative blood loss, while curtailing the demands on blood bank facilities, and lowering the risk of postoperative complications.
