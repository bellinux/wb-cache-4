5|$|Businesses in Chinatown {{attempted}} to raise $200,000 {{to build an}} 11-story bell tower pagoda {{at the south end}} of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows many ideas from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock <b>Tower</b> <b>to</b> feel like one.|$|E
5|$|Following Llywelyn's {{death in}} 1240, Gwynedd's power {{declined}} {{and many of}} its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247. Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales. Llywelyn extended the castle with an additional <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> the south, similar to that built at Dolforwyn, probably in order to provide additional accommodation.|$|E

It was damaged by a plane in 1944 and restored in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} that a semi-circular structure or barbican was built by Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion <b>Tower,</b> <b>to</b> the immediate west of the Middle Tower.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Uxbridge and District Electricity Supply Company had been {{established}} in Waterloo Road, {{and much of the}} town was connected by 1902, although some houses still had gas lighting in 1912.

5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the {{prismatic}} core. She can make out voices coming from the core – including her father's – thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden <b>Tower</b> <b>to</b> decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden <b>Tower</b> <b>to</b> activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are long gone, having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E

It has a <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> the north west and large west window. The interior survives largely unaltered and has a barrel-vaulted ceiling. There is a Baptist church on Middleton Park Avenue.

Kain then leads the party to the Tower of Zot, where Rosa is imprisoned. At the tower's summit, Golbez takes the crystal and attempts to flee. Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process. However, the spell only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain. Kain helps Cecil rescue Rosa, who teleports the party out of the collapsing <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> Baron.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> the side of the building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Richard {{rebuilt the}} walls and the gatehouses at Launceston, {{building}} a high <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> increase the height of the keep, probably to allow guests to enjoy the view of his deer park. The bailey was cleared of its older buildings and a new great hall was constructed in the south-west corner. The castle's inhabitants ate well, enjoying a wide range of food including prime cuts of venison brought into the castle, probably mostly from the larger deer parks belonging to the earldom across the region.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928, and in 1930 {{gave the}} {{property}} to the Orford Town Trust; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards. During the Second World War the castle was refortified with barbed wire to form what was originally intended to be an anti-aircraft emplacement, with Nissen huts erected around the keep. The castle was instead used as a radar emplacement, and a concrete floor was installed in the south-east <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> support the equipment.

5|$|The British {{arrival in}} Jerusalem heralded a {{rational}} philosophy of infrastructure planning and development. It respected cultural and historic heritage {{and attempted to}} preserve such elements within the blossoming construction of the modern city. The city walls were identified as such an element, so British workers acted to clear away the stalls on their perimeter and maintain an open area between {{the walls and the}} rest of the New City in the interest of an aesthetically pleasing visual basin. By the same token, planners demolished the Ottoman clock <b>tower</b> <b>to</b> preserve a historic skyline.|$|E

Only in the fourteenth century was a layer of four storeys inserted.|$|E
