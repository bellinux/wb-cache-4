2500|$|... "I was {{completely}} smitten. I remember thinking, “Why didn’t anybody <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> instrument?” I {{knew it was}} a gift, a revelation from the universe. I knew I had to play guitar. It was my salvation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] went on Dirk, [...] "while {{you clean}} the room, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> escape, for small things amuse those who hear no tidings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I congratulate you, Frank, very heartily," [...] Julian said, when Strelinski had finished. [...] "Why {{on earth}} did you not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{have been}} having a chat with Mr. Fink-Nottle, {{and he has been}} <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Mephistopheles scheme of yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{wonderful}} {{scheme of}} your friend the professor's, to make--Menatogen, I think you said. Did you part with both your beans?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "All {{during this}} period, Dick was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> fabulous book called Planet of the Apes {{and that it}} was going to make a great movie. He said, [...] "I want you to play the ape, Dr. Zira." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, how foolish of me--to be idling {{away this}} opportunity; the only one, perhaps, which I may have! Oh, Mr. Thurnall, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> cholera!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't help it, Joe," [...] replied Edgar; [...] "they would come, and I {{had no time}} {{to shave}} on board.--But now, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> wreck." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dona Jovita. FLATTERER! Come, {{you shall}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> sad lady who died. Ah, Don Culpepero, let me hope all your {{experiences}} {{will not be}} so fatal to us! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said {{everything}} I could say {{as soon as}} I realized {{she was trying to}} avoid the topic. I said, 'It is no use your <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> walk and pretend I've been told about the ball, because you haven't. Your father has forbidden you to go!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now get back, please, to your chair," [...] she begged. [...] "You've stilled the horrible, miserable {{little doubt}} that was tearing at my heartstrings. I just had it before, once or twice, and then--isn't it foolish!--your <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> little {{typewriter}} girl! I must go and see her. We must be kind to her." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{then made}} him {{sit down and}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{singular}} game.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{worse and}} worse! Now, mother, don't get {{into one of}} your hypercritical moods, and insist on reasons for everything; but <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> wicked--this dreadful young man. What was he like?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It means nothing, worse luck," [...] he answered, [...] "except that I have twenty-four hours' leave. I am off {{back again}} {{at eight o'clock}} to-morrow morning. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> De Brensault affair. How is it going on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum! Very good sentiment, young man. Always {{strong enough}} for duty.--Hum! worthy of Nelson; said {{pretty much the}} same, didn't he? {{something}} about duty I know it was, and always thought it uncommon fine.--Now, then, what can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> business?" ...|$|E
3000|$|... “You {{mentioned}} [Symptom A]. Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this?</b> Are [Symptom A] and [Symptom B] {{the same}} or different?” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I shall," [...] she {{answered}} with a sad little smile. [...] "I look stronger than I am. Meanwhile you will come and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> talisman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} a remarkably wise thing," [...] he said, [...] "in coming to <b>me</b> and in <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> affair. The idea of {{connecting}} Mr. Morrison with the murder would, of course, be ridiculous, but, on the other hand, {{it would be very}} disagreeable to him to have his name mentioned in connection with it. You have behaved discreetly, and you have done Mr. Morrison a service in trying to find him out. You will do him a further service by adopting the second course I suggested with regard to the inquest. What do you consider that service is worth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly; she is fonder of geraniums, {{and seems}} more docile, though not so fine a figure. But {{we were talking}} of physic. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> new young surgeon, Mr. Lydgate. I am told he is wonderfully clever: he {{certainly}} looks it--a fine brow indeed." ...|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN [desperately] I daresay we {{have been}} the very {{imperfect}} children of a very perfect mother; but I do beg you to let me alone for once, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> horrible business of my father wanting to set me aside for another son.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Nugent, called {{away from}} his labours in the garden, greeted his visitor in his {{customary}} short manner {{as he entered the}} room. [...] "If you've come to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> marriage, I've heard of it," [...] he said, bluntly. [...] "Murchison told me this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you afraid}} to speak before Julia?" [...] cries the elder lady. [...] "Why, bless my soul, she is forty years old, and has heard {{everything}} that can be heard. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Kew <b>this</b> instant, Doctor H." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'A {{letter from}} the enemy,' he said. 'It is from Trant, who must be a good fellow {{as well as a}} brave soldier, as we know to our cost. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> Rignold.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I can't hear you," [...] said Mrs. Leake. She had, however, heard this. [...] "But I {{want you}} to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Caroline Waddington. Isn't it true she's got another lover already?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit {{down with}} us, young sir," [...] the earl said, kindly. [...] "You are an esquire, I hear, of {{my good friend}} Sir Henry Percy. As you eat, I pray you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> fight with the Welsh. Sir Edmund himself was not in command, I hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have a list}} somewhere--in my purse, I think--of English {{institutions}} {{which must}} be studied before one can understand your country-people. Cricket, I believe, is second on the list. Your cousin {{was kind enough to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> match, and how to get here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if you modify, you are lost!" [...] she exulted. [...] "For you {{can only}} modify in the {{direction}} of my position, which is neither so Jesuitical nor so harsh as you have defined it. But don't let us get lost in dialectics. I want to see what I can see, so <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> woman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{be ready}} in ten minutes, papa, for the fires are not lighted yet, {{but we will be}} as quick as we can; and do please make haste and come and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> dreadful business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, my dear," [...] {{said the}} Curate, turning away and {{proceeding}} with his undressing. [...] "You were <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> her only <b>this</b> afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt. But {{you seem}} to {{know a great deal}} about her. Now I wonder if you can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>this</b> beautiful young lady with an umbrella coming towards us? I should much like to know who she is--and I should like to call on her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good {{reasons for}} that. For one thing, I have just {{returned}} from a long trip into the north-western districts, and I have not been in the way of hearing news for some time. Besides, we have no newspapers in the colony. Everything comes to us by word of mouth, and that slowly. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Walk with me, Beric," [...] he said. [...] "For {{three hours}} I {{have been going}} into {{the affairs of the}} city, and hearing letters read from the {{governors}} of the provinces. It will be a change to talk of other things. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Britain of yours. I know about your wars, tell me of your life at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fumbling in {{his pocket}} to show the bright dime, he found the torn page, and remembered the thirst for {{information}} which had seized him in the morning. [...] "Look here, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> will you? What are these chaps up to? The ink has spoilt all but the picture and this bit of reading. I {{want to know what}} it means. Take it to 'em, Sanch." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having kissed him, {{she drew}} {{him to her}} sofa and said: [...] "Now, darling, come and sit down here, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> DREADFUL business." [...] And taking up an odorator she blew over him a little cloud of scent. [...] "It's quite a new perfume; isn't it delicious?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which he will {{very soon}} be, my love," [...] said Mrs Dotropy, [...] "for he {{is sure to}} be splendidly nursed, now he has got back to his old {{quarters}} with these admirable Miss Seawards. But <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> sad wreck. You say that the fisherman named Joe Davidson is safe?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In Command Centre, Maya {{explains}} that Psychons math {{is different than}} humans base 10 math, and that's why she can make calculations so much simpler than the computer. Koeing notes that, while that may be true, she still needs to convert her answers into Earth math, and with a dismissive look, brings up the conversion formula on the screen for Koenig to read. It is hopelessly complex. Koenig begins to follow Maya out of command center to question her further, but is confronted by a smiling Helena. [...] "You know, Alan's been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> women on the planet. Beautiful and naked I understand." [...] Koenig could hardly see them, he explains, though Helena is dubious. [...] "Beautiful, naked... and green?" [...] she says. [...] "Green, they were?" [...] he replies, [...] "I didn't really notice that." ...|$|R
