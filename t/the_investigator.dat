5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her. Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins explained that she had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and admitted she did not know how much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. <b>The</b> <b>investigator</b> returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E
5|$|Initially J. D. B. {{denied any}} wrongdoing. After being {{confronted with the}} stolen camera and after the urging of a school administrator, J. D. B. confessed to the break-ins. It was at this point, after the confession, that <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> {{informed}} J. D. B. that he could refuse to answer questions {{and that he was}} free to leave. J. D. B. indicated that he understood and then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the stolen property. J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request. He was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of each episode, one investigator would be appointed as <b>the</b> Lead <b>Investigator,</b> who would have specific responsibilities and powers. <b>The</b> <b>investigators</b> would be split into teams by <b>the</b> Lead <b>Investigator,</b> and sent down different lines of inquiry determined by the Chief. These lines of inquiry would involve hidden tests, which the teams would either pass or fail as judged by <b>the</b> Chief. <b>The</b> <b>investigators</b> from all <b>the</b> failing teams would be put to a group vote, where one of them would be chosen as a contestant to play the Killer's Game. All of <b>the</b> living <b>investigators</b> could cast a vote, with the exception of <b>the</b> Lead <b>Investigator.</b> <b>The</b> Lead <b>Investigator</b> would then choose a second contestant for the Killer's Game.|$|R

5000|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>investigators</b> {{were given}} a list of 15 {{suspects}} who were [...] "townspeople" [...] played by actors and actresses. A large number of improvisational actors and actresses were stationed around the real-life town, and their job was to provide clues (useful and not useful) to <b>the</b> <b>investigators.</b> Each week, <b>the</b> <b>investigators</b> were sent out on varying missions around the town in order to discover clues to clear suspects. Additionally, the murderer would strike again, clearing suspects as well.|$|R
5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{thinking}} that the Garza murder {{had taken place in}} San Antonio because Feit had trained there, Tacheny called authorities in that city and said that he could no longer keep the secret of Feit's confession. The investigation into Garza's death was reopened that year. Texas Rangers investigator Rudy Jaramillo contacted Father Joseph O'Brien, a priest who worked with Feit {{at the time of the}} Garza murder. O'Brien told a television program in 2000 that he did not know anything about Garza's death. He softened with Jaramillo, first telling <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> that he had suspected Feit at the time, then admitting that Feit had confessed shortly after the murder. In August 2002, the polygraph examiner who tested Feit in 1960 said that he questioned the reported results. Feit had been said to have passed his polygraph and documentation was later amended to show that the results were inconclusive, but the examiner felt that Feit had failed the test.|$|E

50|$|The act {{allows the}} governor, {{in person or}} through one or more persons {{appointed}} by the governor, to examine management and affairs of any department, board, bureau or commission in <b>the</b> state. <b>Investigators</b> could interview witnesses, administer oaths, hold hearings, and seize any material deemed relevant to <b>the</b> <b>investigator's</b> case. <b>The</b> <b>investigators</b> then had to use that intelligence to recommend legislative actions.|$|R

25|$|In mid 2008 {{after the}} {{indictment}} had been served, {{it was discovered}} that the main police investigator in the preliminary investigation had started working for one of the plaintiffs, Warner Brothers, before the date of the indictment. Sunde's lawyer Peter Althin questioned the neutrality and reliability of the preliminary investigation in the event that <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> had entered the new employment during the investigation, and suspected the job might have been a reward for good work in The Pirate Bay investigation. Althin believed that the investigation might have to be redone if that was the case. The prosecutor Håkan Roswall responded that it wouldn't have posed problems for the investigation because the police were working under his directive, and the investigator's superior officer brushed off the incident as nothing remarkable. Warner Brothers commented merely that <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> hadn't received any compensation during the time he worked for the Swedish police. According to Roswall, this type of concurrent employment would not be an individual incident, but that the decision of possible bias would be for the court to decide, and that <b>the</b> <b>investigator</b> is not a key witness in the case. <b>The</b> <b>investigator</b> could not be reached during the trial and was taken off the witness list.|$|E

25|$|In 1994 Nowotny helped coin {{the term}} “Mode 2” {{for a new}} mode of applied {{research}} focused on solving specific problems. By contrast, “Mode 1” is basic research done within disciplines, initiated by the interest of <b>the</b> <b>investigator,</b> not from external demand.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{newspapers}} that printed the story had relied on the Hearst article, and they immediately retracted it with apologies upon learning of the libelous error.
