25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
25|$|In early 1996, he was {{contacted}} by Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley, who informed Van Zandt {{that he was}} interested in recording and releasing an album for him on the band's Ecstatic Peace label, funded by Geffen. Van Zandt agreed, and sessions were scheduled to begin in Memphis during late December of that year. On December 19 or 20, Van Zandt fell down the concrete stairs outside his home, badly injuring his hip. After lying outside for an hour, he dragged himself inside and called his ex-wife Jeanene, who sent friends Royann and Jim Calvin to check on him.

25|$|The ADA {{provides}} explicit {{coverage for}} service animals. Guidelines {{have been developed}} not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, {{but they are not}} allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so {{it would not be a}} valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.|$|E

500|$|Mead {{noted that}} [...] "the book builds toward second chances for Miranda's motherâ€”both vocationally and relationally." [...] As the novel progresses, Miranda gives second chances to Julia, {{a girl who}}m Miranda {{initially}} hates, and Alice, a girl who always needs <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> but never does.

2500|$|While {{fighting}} {{the civil rights}} battle on the national level, Roundtree and her partner Julius Robertson undertook to represent black clients in civil and criminal matters in the segregated courtrooms of Washington, DC. At a time when black lawyers had to leave <b>the</b> courthouses <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> and black clients were routinely referred to white attorneys {{in order to maximize}} their chances in court, Roundtree and Robertson broke with tradition. [...] They pressed the cases of black clients before white judges and juries and prevailed, winning sizeable recoveries in accident and negligent cases. [...] Their 1957 victory in a negligence case against a Washington, DC psychiatric facility, which resulted in the maximum recovery allowable under the Federal Tort Claims Act at that time, was widely regarded as a turning point not only for black clients in the Nation's Capital, but for black attorneys as well.|$|R
500|$|It {{was during}} one of Jackson's calls to Presley that he {{proposed}} marriage. [...] "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?", the singer queried.

After a pause, Jackson exclaimed that he had <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine {{and she had to}} believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees.|$|E

50|$|Eleanor Parker {{recalled}} {{the film as}} the most difficult experience she ever had making a movie:It was simply a dreadful nightmare.

We were in Egypt, {{out in the desert}} filming, with no sanitary facilities, no dressing rooms to speak of, it was unbelievable. Robert Taylor and I had <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> with <b>the</b> locals, hiding behind coats. Additionally, the director (Robert Pirosh) {{had no idea what he}} was doing; the headcameraman (Robert Surtees) was directing the film. Then the crew wasnâ€™t getting paid and our great cameraman told them that we were all going out on strike until everyone got paid. Believe me, the money showed up. The film's world premiere took place simultaneously on 21 July 1954 in Cairo and Alexandria (as well as New York City). It marked the first time an American film had a world premiere in Egypt.|$|R

500|$|Ramirez {{has often}} {{attracted}} attention {{on and off}} the field for his quirky and often fun-loving behavior and attitude, which is sometimes at odds with MLB's more serious and traditional culture. These incidents are colloquially known as [...] "Manny Moments" [...] or more commonly, [...] "Manny Being Manny". Instances of this behavior include inducing his Red Sox teammates, including Ellis Burks, to drink alcohol which he had spiked with Viagra, wearing Oakley THUMP while playing the outfield, disappearing through a door in the Green Monster <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> diving to intercept a throw from teammate Johnny Damon in the outfield which had been intended for the infield, selling his barbecue grill on eBay, and high fiving a fan after a catch at the outfield wall before throwing the ball back to the infield to complete a double play.

"Give Peace a Chance" [...] {{opens with}} Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital's chief of surgery, Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) {{implementing}} a new computerized surgical scheduling system, which is disliked {{by many of}} the hospital's staff. Thereafter, Isaac (Faran Tahir), a hospital lab technician, brings Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) a scan of his tumor, which has been declared inoperable by several other physicians due to its complexity. Isaac asks Shepherd to remove it. Shepherd agrees, but Webber refuses permission for the procedure because of the high risk involved. Shepherd ignores the chief's directions and schedules the surgery. The interns and residents all want the chance to assist due to the rarity of such a tumor, so Shepherd hosts a competition in which the winner gets to join him in the operating room. After seeing Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul) make a mistake, Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is confident that she will win the competition, but loses to Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams). Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is not invited to compete because Shepherd wants her to be his caregiver in what would be a long surgery. Knowing that she will not be able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> for the entire procedure, Lexie decides to wear a diaper into the operating room; her courage and dedication impresses Yang.|$|E

Paulo kills Zuckerman by poisoning his food, and the couple steals his diamonds, which are worth $8million. The couple plan on returning to the United States on Oceanic Flight 815, encountering Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) at the airport. Upon surviving the plane crash, Nikki and Paulo realize that they have lost the bag with the diamonds. Nikki consults Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), who tells her of a spider with the ability to paralyze people. He also gives her a trajectory map which leads them to [...] and the Nigerian plane; they explore neither. When Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) mentions that she found luggage from the plane in a lake, Paulo finds the diamonds, but does not tell Nikki. Instead, he hides them in the toilet at The Pearl and overhears a conversation between Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). The two accidentally leave behind a walkie-talkie that Paulo takes. Later, when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Nikki and Paulo visit The Pearl, Paulo retrieves the diamonds by pretending <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b> Nikki figures out that Paulo has found the diamonds without telling her and decides to lure him into a trap. When he denies that he has the diamonds she unleashes one of the paralyzing spiders on him. She finds the diamonds and Paulo apologizes, claiming that he did it so that she would not end their relationship. As Nikki stands in a state of regret, the pheromones of the female spider attract a group of the male spiders of the same species and she is bitten on her leg. She buries the diamonds and sprints to the beach.|$|E
