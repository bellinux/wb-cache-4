5|$|Introduced at the {{beginning}} of the third season, the Well-Manicured Man is an English member of the Syndicate, a shadow organization within the United States government that exists <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize the Earth. He is an important member of the Syndicate, along with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and The Elder, and was a friend of William Mulder earlier in his life.|$|E
5|$|The {{abolition}} of papal authority made way not for orderly change, but for dissension and violence. Iconoclasm, destruction, disputes within communities {{that led to}} violence, and radical challenge to all forms of faith were reported daily to Cromwell—developments he tried <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> King. Once Henry knew what was afoot, he acted. Thus {{at the end of}} 1538, a proclamation was issued forbidding free discussion of the Sacrament and forbidding clerical marriage, on pain of death.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Jasienica (then, Leon Beynar) {{fought in}} the Polish Army, and later, the Home Army resistance. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was also working with the anti-Soviet resistance, which later led to him taking up a new name, Paweł Jasienica, <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{communist}} government of the People's Republic of Poland. He was associated with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly and several other newspapers and magazines. He {{is best known for his}} 1960s books on Polish historyon the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty, the Jagiellon Dynasty, and the elected kings of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Those books, still popular, played an important role in popularizing Polish history among several generations of readers.|$|E
5|$|Samantha tells Mulder {{that the}} Bounty Hunter and the clones are {{actually}} aliens, and the Bounty Hunter will begin chasing her {{as soon as}} he has killed the remaining clones. Meanwhile, Scully heads to a hotel <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bounty Hunter. Returning to the lab, she finds four more clones, who claim to be the last. Scully arranges for them to be transported to a safe place, but the Bounty Hunter follows her and watches. At her hotel room, Scully lets in a man who seems to be Mulder, only to receive {{a phone call from the}} actual Mulder soon after.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Taliban fighters.|$|E

5|$|Midway {{through the}} poem, {{there is a}} split between the two actions of the poem: the first {{attempts}} {{to identify with the}} nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The Elysian fields and the nightingale's song {{in the first half of}} the poem represent the pleasurable moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left desiring it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> loss of pleasure. Poetry does not bring about the pleasure that the narrator original asks for, but it does liberate him from his desire for only pleasure.|$|E
5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. <b>To</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, the base is destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{increased}} demands for higher wages by coffee pickers in rural areas, Salvadoran land {{owners in the}} countryside {{felt the need to}} create a special public security force to protect their interests. Previous law enforcement and task force efforts failed to yield satisfactory results. The task forces were patrolling soldiers, commanded by an army officer, scattered throughout the country. They were unprepared in the fight against crime in its various guises, and were thus incapable of stopping thefts, killings, rapes and so on. Criminals of that era were using topographical features <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> authorities.|$|E
25|$|By 1966, more of de Hory's {{paintings}} were being revealed as forgeries; {{one man in}} particular, Texas oil magnate Algur H. Meadows, to whom Legros had sold 56 forged paintings, was so outraged to learn {{that most of his}} collection was forged, that he demanded the arrest and prosecution of Legros. Angered, Legros decided <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> police at de Hory's house on Ibiza, where he asserted ownership, and threatened to evict de Hory. Coupled with this and with Legros' increasingly violent mood swings, de Hory decided to leave Ibiza. Legros and Lessard were apprehended soon thereafter, imprisoned on charges of check fraud.|$|E

Together they started the Babbar Khalsa, to take revenge from Nirankaris and others. From then, they started finding from town and cities the anti-Sikhs, and then they killed them. After that, the government started to find who was doing these actions, so the members of Babbar Khalsa started <b>to</b> <b>hiding</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> police.|$|R
5000|$|The Central Government, in {{a letter}} dated 20 December 1950, {{directed}} the State Governments not to introduce total prohibition on slaughter, stating, [...] "Hides from slaughtered cattle are much superior <b>to</b> <b>hides</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fallen cattle and fetch a higher price. In the absence of slaughter the best type of hide, which fetches good price in the export market {{will no longer be}} available.

25|$|The Zensunni wanderers, {{driven from}} planet to planet, {{eventually}} {{found their way}} to Arrakis, where they became the Fremen. They settled in artificial cave-like settlements known as sietches across the Arrakeen deserts. They also developed stillsuit technology, allowing them to survive in the open desert. By harvesting melange, they were able to bribe the Spacing Guild for privacy from observation and weather control in order <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Imperium their true population and their plans to terraform Arrakis. Much of this ecological activity took place in the unexplored southern latitudes of the planet. The best-known of the sietches is Sietch Tabr, home of Stilgar and Muad'Dib's center of operations before victory in the Battle of Arrakeen put Muad'Dib on the Imperial throne.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile in the Capital, the {{situation}} is close to panic. Everyone knows by now that Gorbovsky's Tariel II cannot take them all to space and that the nearest to Rainbow spaceship that can won't make it in time. Plans like burrowing a huge underground cave under the Capital <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wave, or jumping over it, or diving under it (in the southern ocean) are desperately developed. At this time, Gorbovsky announces that only the children will be transported onto the orbit on Tariel II, but everyone agrees {{that this is the}} best choice. Afterwards a crowd of scientists approaches him and asks to take some of their documentation on board, since they consider it too valuable to be sent directly into space with mini-rockets.|$|E
25|$|By 1790, the anticlerical Terror {{phase of}} the French Revolution forced many loyal priests <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> regime in order {{to carry out the}} sacraments in their parish. Even though to do so had been {{declared}} illegal, the Vianneys traveled to distant farms to attend Masses celebrated by priests on the run. Realizing that such priests risked their lives day by day, Vianney began to look upon them as heroes. He received his First Communion catechism instructions in a private home by two nuns whose communities had been dissolved during the Revolution. He made his first communion at the age of 13. During the Mass, the windows were covered so that the light of the candles could not be seen from the outside. His practice of the Faith continued in secret, especially during his preparation for confirmation.|$|E

25|$|Eciton burchellii raids move as a loose swarm {{over the}} leaf litter. This allows for smaller prey to take {{shelter in the}} crevices of the leaf litter <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{oncoming}} ants. Since numerous insects and other small prey can escape the swarm, the frequent raids of the ants do not desecrate an area's prey reserves. This chronic predation by the colonies will evolutionarily favor insects and other prey that possess adaptions to counteract the ants, such as chemical weaponry for defense or those that sexually mature at a smaller size. Since the larger Eciton burchellii ants require more prey for energy than other smaller ant colonies, only high biomass patches of prey will provide them with enough food. If the prey density in an area is too small, the colony {{may be forced to}} abandon the area and move on.|$|E
25|$|After {{recording}} an 8–8 {{record in}} 1988, Elway once again led {{his team to}} the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And {{when he was asked}} if he {{wanted to go back to}} the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that he wanted to go back every year, even if his team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that he would ever win a Super Bowl in his career.|$|E
25|$|Women Against Pornography's best-known tactic was {{a guided}} tour of the {{pornography}} and prostitution outlets in Times Square, which they led twice a week for a suggested contribution of $5.00. (In San Francisco, WAVPM had conducted similar tours in the red-light districts of that city.) Lynn Campbell suggested that people who did not consume pornography knew very little about the content of the pornography or the atmosphere in sex shops and live sex shows, and that actual guided tours of the sex industry in Times Square would provide an excellent educational tool. Susan Brownmiller planned an itinerary for the tour and wrote a script for the guides (with the help of information supplied by Carl Weisbrod, a police officer tasked with finding and closing down underground brothels in Midtown, and Maggie Smith, the owner of a neighborhood bar). The tours often involved unplanned encounters—being physically thrown out by enraged store managers, watching businessmen try <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tourists, or talking briefly with nude performers while they took their breaks. After a reporter for The New York Times took one of the first tours and wrote a feature article for the Style section, WAP received coverage in People, Time, The Philadelphia Inquirer, European newspapers, local TV news programs and talk shows in New York City, and The Phil Donahue Show in Chicago.|$|E
