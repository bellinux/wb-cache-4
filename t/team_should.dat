5|$|McClaren praised his goalkeeper Schwarzer for {{recovering}} from his error that allowed Bolton's goal, {{in order to}} make saves that won the match. He also said that the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> not become carried away by their qualification for Europe, and instead concentrate on the upcoming game against Birmingham City.|$|E
5|$|Cerny {{also gave}} input and {{feedback}} on the game's level-design. However, the 3DO did not perform as they had expected, and Universal suggested that the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> switched to Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation to increase sales of the game. The game originally ran on a custom engine developed by Alex Hastings, and was upgraded and converted for the PlayStation within a month. The debut title was called Disruptor, and was released worldwide in November 1996.|$|E
5|$|The team, which {{represented}} Michigan Basketball for the ninety-sixth {{season in the}} Big Ten Conference, is {{sometimes referred to as}} Team 96 or Squad 96. Although this team represented Michigan for the ninety-sixth consecutive year, there was controversy as to whether the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> in fact be marketed as Team 96 because the 1908–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team was not properly accounted for among the prior teams. The subsequent team was marketed as Team 98.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, cells <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> be {{encouraged}} {{to engage in a}} program of batch size reduction.|$|R

5|$|To further {{add to his}} confusion, he {{encountered}} a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which looks {{very similar to the}} Key West Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor's <b>team</b> <b>should</b> fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what he thought was west, but in reality was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.|$|E
5|$|Eight of {{the eleven}} member Big Ten {{institutions}} will return at least 75 percent of their offensive production during the 2009–10 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, unless underclassmen declare for the 2009 NBA Draft. Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio State will return 90 percent of their total offensive production. The Buckeyes could return 100 percent of their scoring contingent next season. All five first-team All-Conference honorees were sophomores and are all projected to return as juniors. Overall, the Big Ten could return 80.5 percent of its offensive production from 2008 to 2009, and no <b>team</b> <b>should</b> lose {{more than half of}} its total scoring unit next year.|$|E
5|$|However, {{when the}} German coordinators {{discovered}} how extensively the game dealt with Neo-Nazism, they informed LucasArts {{about the difficulty}} of marketing the game in their country. As Germany was an important overseas market for adventure games, LucasArts feared that the lower revenues would not recoup development costs, and subsequently canceled the game. The plot was later adapted into a four-part Dark Horse Comics series by Lee Marrs, published monthly from December 1994 to March 1995. In an interview, Barwood commented that the development <b>team</b> <b>should</b> have thought about the story more thoroughly beforehand, calling it insensitive and not regretting the cancellation of the title.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teams</b> <b>should</b> {{consist of}} 4-5 people and {{numerous}} management tiers. Success {{is based on}} the team, not the individual.|$|R

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> training facilities be reopened.|$|E
5|$|The Melbourne Club {{decided that}} the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> wear red, white and blue colours on their {{clothing}} for the game. Although they had {{a long time to}} prepare, the MCC had some difficulty in assembling enough men to represent Port Phillip; many potential players were unable to spare the time to travel to Van Diemen's Land. Even as the team prepared to depart, only ten people had been found, and the eleventh, Duncan Cooper, only joined as they left on the steamer Shamrock. The eleven Victorian players, accompanied by many acquaintances, both men and women, arrived in Launceston on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival, they attended a dinner at the Cornwall Hotel with 100 paying guests. The following day, the team won a match against Bishopthorpe College. There was little time to practise before the intercolonial game.|$|E
25|$|Medical care {{includes}} supportive treatment, in case any of {{the following}} complications happen, medical <b>team</b> <b>should</b> be ready. Possible complications include heart failure, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and oxygenation deficit.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two teams}} in a game. Each game {{has at least}} 4 members. Both <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> have {{an equal number of}} players.|$|R
50|$|Museum staff {{emergency}} response <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> be notified immediately. Anyone who cannot participate must find an alternate, pre-approved staff member {{to fill their}} place ASAP.|$|R
30|$|The {{experts suggest}} that medical and {{surgical}} <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> discuss and decide upon the tracheotomy technique {{to be used}} {{when there is a}} risk of complications.|$|R
25|$|A {{national}} contest resumed in 1941; Cercle {{finished the}} season last but {{one in the}} league. Usually this would have meant relegation, but the KBVB ruled that {{the circumstances of the}} war, which limited training opportunities and youth development, meant no <b>team</b> <b>should</b> be relegated.|$|E
25|$|Fred Couples, 2011 Presidents Cup U.S. team captain, stated {{he would}} use a captain's pick to select Woods for the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> he not {{automatically}} qualify. Woods had his contract discontinued by sponsor Tag Heuer, a luxury Swiss watchmaker, on August 10.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} later, Team USA was down by 12 {{points at the}} half, but VanDerveer {{turned it into a}} {{positive}} opportunity. It was only an exhibition game, but she used it as a chance to show how the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> respond if down early in an Olympic game. The USA team went on to win that game by seven points.|$|E
5000|$|A {{very simple}} and self-explanatory strategy. Late in the {{baseball}} season, {{teams that are}} winning should be more conservative regarding Pitch and Ditch and free agent pickups. Teams that have ground to make up should throw caution to the wind {{toward the end of}} the season and take more risks in hopes of moving up the standings. This also applies to late season trades where strong <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> look for consistent performance, while weak <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> try to [...] "catch lightning in a bottle." ...|$|R
50|$|In early rounds, judges mark if {{they believe}} <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> go through to the next round. In final rounds teams are ranked and the skating system applies.|$|R
5000|$|To {{minimize}} false positives, minimize test maintenance, {{and more}} effectively validate use cases across modern systems with multitier architectures, <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> emphasize API testing over GUI testing.|$|R
25|$|As of now, {{a single}} city-based {{franchise}} {{can have a}} maximum of 18 contracted players for a season. Each <b>team</b> <b>should</b> have {{a minimum of two}} rookie contracts and a maximum of two overseas players in the squad. Each team can also have a maximum of two overseas replacement players, in case the original overseas players get injured or withdraw due to particular reason.|$|E
25|$|Victoria won the toss but New South Wales captain George Gilbert {{successfully}} {{argued that}} the visiting <b>team</b> <b>should</b> decide who bats first. The MCG was a grassless desert and Gilbert, considering players fielded without boots, promptly sent Victoria into bat. Needing only 16 {{to win in the}} final innings, New South Wales collapsed to be 5 for 5 before Gilbert’s batting saved the game and the visitors won by three wickets.|$|E
25|$|At club level, Magee {{represented}} Bective Rangers, and it {{is recorded}} that at a club meeting in 1903 that he suggested the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> change strip colours to rose, green and white; the colours that the team still play in. Magee is also mentioned in James Joyce's semi-autobiographical novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man when the central character recalls watching a Bective rugby game.|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} presents key {{findings about}} the team evaluation process used in seven workplace basic skills programs in 1993 and 1994. An introduction summarizes the methodology used to develop the case studies and key findings {{about the team}} evaluation process. These key findings present the strengths and challenges of using evaluation teams, along with recommendations {{for those interested in}} trying this approach. Recommendations include the following: evaluation teams need to create time, interest, expertise, a supportive context, a code of confidentiality, and an ethic of continuous improvement; teams need to customize the process to fit it to the site's unique needs and opportunities; <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> clarify evaluation's role in the larger program planning process; <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> develop evaluation procedures consonant with the company's culture; <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> use familiar and accessible resources; and teams need to be realistic. Six case studies describe how the team evaluation process was used in seven workplace education programs...|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} some {{speculation}} that Liaoning FC would pull {{out from the}} league, and that the Chinese Football Association had prepared a schedule with only 14 <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> Liaoning have withdrawn.|$|R

25|$|According to Maritime Institute of Malaysia {{senior fellow}} Nazery Khalid, the action by PASKAL proved Malaysia's resolve in {{safeguarding}} its maritime interests and {{its commitment to}} fighting piracy. An official with the London-based International Maritime Bureau (IMB) said, prior to any operation, the rescue <b>team</b> <b>should</b> first ensure the ship’s crew was safe before boarding the vessel. On 22 January 2011, the news of this success began to spread in newspapers and international news agencies AFP and Reuters.|$|E
25|$|References {{are then}} {{occasional}} until 1785 when the Hornchurch Cricket Club, based at Langton Park, became prominent. This club {{had a very}} strong team that was representative of Essex as a county. However, the sources differed among themselves re whether the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> be called Essex or Hornchurch. But {{there is no doubt that}} Essex held important match status from 1785 until 1794, after which the county strangely and abruptly disappeared from the records for a long time.|$|E
25|$|However, {{before the}} Dutch Grand Prix, it emerged that Senna {{had signed a}} {{contract}} with Lotus despite having two years to run on his current deal. Although he had included a line in his Toleman contract allowing him to legally sever ties with the <b>team</b> <b>should</b> a better offer come along, Senna had failed to invoke this clause because he hadn't informed team principal Alex Hawkridge of the Lotus deal. He was subsequently suspended for the following race in Italy.|$|E
50|$|As {{there were}} only two teams left in the group, it was decided that the <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> play each other twice to {{determine}} a group winner. Both teams automatically qualified for the semi-final stage.|$|R
50|$|If no winner {{could be}} {{determined}} within the time allowed, two <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> have played an extra time of 10 minutes each way with an interval of 5 {{and then eventually}} a kicking competition.|$|R
50|$|Crucial to {{the success}} of any serious World Series effort is {{scouting}} for species {{in the days and weeks}} prior to the event. Most teams will have staked out desirable species (often nesting birds that can be reliably found on the day of competition) in advance to minimize the time they have to spend looking for any one species in particular. Additionally, <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> maximize the number of different habitats they visit (e.g., saltwater marshes, Canadian Zone woodlands, pine forests, beach, etc.), as different species frequent different habitats. Finally, <b>teams</b> <b>should</b> plan their route to maximize time spent birding and minimize time spent driving.|$|R
