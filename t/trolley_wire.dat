25|$|A {{series of}} mergers and leases put the Brighton Beach Line {{in the hands}} of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), a holding company which {{eventually}} controlled most of the rapid transit, streetcar, and bus lines in Brooklyn and part of Queens. The line was electrified with <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> and, for a time, trolleys from several surface routes and elevated trains operated together on the line.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the loss}} of ore traffic, the Bellefonte Central had managed to keep its {{financial}} house in good order during the 1890s. Penn State University had begun to represent {{an important source of}} freight and passenger traffic, although the railroad frequently clashed with the school over unpaid bills. In 1896, Professor John Price Jackson obtained permission from the railroad to run <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> over its tracks from State College to Struble. An old Philadelphia Traction Company trolley was operated by electrical engineering students over the line until 1905.|$|E
25|$|The New York Central Railroad (NYC) began {{planning}} electrification between Grand Central Terminal and {{the split}} at Mott Haven {{after the opening}} of the first electrified urban rail terminal in 1900, the Gare d'Orsay in Paris, France. Electricity was in use on some branch lines of the NYNH for interurban streetcars via third rail or <b>trolley</b> <b>wire.</b> An accident in the Park Avenue Tunnel near Grand Central Station that killed 17 people on January 8, 1902 was blamed on smoke from steam locomotives; the resulting outcry led to a push for electric operation in Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|Every major {{street in}} the city is served {{by at least one}} bus route. Many of these routes are doubled by a {{trolleybus}} route and have <b>trolley</b> <b>wires</b> over them.|$|R
25|$|The area {{through which}} the St. Charles Avenue Line {{traveled}} fared comparatively well in Hurricane Katrina's devastating impact on New Orleans {{at the end of}} August 2005, with moderate flooding only of the two ends of the line at Claiborne Avenue and at Canal Street. However, wind damage and falling trees took out many sections of <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> along St. Charles Avenue, and vehicles parked on the neutral ground (traffic medians) over the inactive tracks degraded parts of the right-of-way. At the start of October 2005, as this part of town started being repopulated, bus service began running on the St. Charles line.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electrification}} of the Brighton Line, {{including the}} Franklin Avenue Line, is accomplished in 1899 using <b>trolley</b> <b>wire.</b> Trains that use third rail in elevated service raise trolley poles at Franklin Avenue station. Some passenger steam operates under different circumstances {{for several more}} years. Some of these trolley poles still exist along the line. In 1905 and 1905, the last remaining grade crossings were eliminated {{in the vicinity of}} Park Place by building an elevated structure to connect the old elevated structure and the open-cut portion. In the ensuing years, some existing bridges are strengthened or replaced and some of the elevated trackage placed on concrete-retained embankment.|$|E
25|$|On July 26, 1886, the Flushing and College Point Street Railway was incorporated, {{with the}} intent of {{building}} what became the College Point Line. The then-villages of Flushing and College Point granted franchises to the company in summer 1887, with the provision of only employing overhead <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> for five years before switching to battery power. The line began operation on April 7, 1891, running on batteries instead of overhead wire. Because of the expenses of battery power, the railroad went bankrupt and was sold at auction on April 4, 1892. The line was later equipped with overhead wire, improving profits and patronage. On December 31, 1896, the line became part of the New York and Queens County Railway system.|$|E
5000|$|Aesthetics - The {{jumble of}} {{overhead}} wires {{may be seen}} as unsightly. Intersections often have a [...] "webbed ceiling" [...] appearance, due to multiple crossing and converging sets of <b>trolley</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The subway uses {{trolleys}} {{powered by}} electricity from overhead lines, {{which had been}} {{made possible by the}} invention of the trolley pole in 1880 by Frank J. Sprague. The line has been pantograph-only since the <b>trolley</b> <b>wires</b> were modified in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Utility poles {{may also}} carry other {{equipment}} such as street lights, supports for traffic lights and overhead electric <b>trolley</b> <b>wires,</b> and cellular network antennas. They can also carry fixtures and decorations specific for certain holidays or events specific to the city where they are located.|$|R
25|$|Most {{interurban}} {{cars and}} freight locomotives collected current from an overhead <b>trolley</b> <b>wire.</b> The cars contacted this wire {{through the use}} of a trolley pole or a pantograph. Others designs collected current from a third rail. Some interurbans used both: in open country, the third rail was used and in town, a trolley pole was raised. An example of this was the Chicago, Aurora, and Elgin Railroad where a trolley pole was used in both Aurora and Elgin, Illinois. Third rail was cheaper to maintain and more conductive, but it was more expensive to construct initially and it did not eliminate the need for AC transformers, AC transmission lines, and AC/DC conversion systems. In addition, third rail posed a serious danger to trespassers and animals and was difficult to keep clear of ice.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, the New York State Legislature {{created the}} Brooklyn Grade Crossing Elimination Commission (BGCEC) to {{eliminate}} grade all grade crossings on the Brighton Beach Line and the Bay Ridge Line of the Long Island Rail Road. The city {{was supposed to}} cover half of the costs, not exceeding $1,000,000, while the railroads were to cover {{the other half of}} the costs. The work started on December 30, 1905, and was completed in 1908. A short piece of two-tracked elevated railroad was built from the ramp connecting to the Fulton Street Elevated as far as Park Place, where the original 1878 open cut began. From the end of that original cut south of Church Avenue, the line was wholly rebuilt as a four-track railroad with express and local stations to a point south of Neptune Avenue at the border of Coney Island, continuing along its original right-of-way to Brighton Beach station. The portion from Church Avenue to Avenue H was placed in a depressed open cut, while the portion from Avenue H to south of Sheepshead Bay was raised onto an earthen embankment, primarily with earth excavated from the open-cut portion and from the Bay Ridge Improvement of the Long Island Rail Road. The separation of the railroad grade allowed the line's <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> north of Sheepshead Bay to be replaced with ground-level third rail.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 1883, {{the company}} was reorganized as the New York and Sea Beach Railway Company and was allowed to operate from New York Harbor to the Sea Beach Palace in Coney Island. The company went bankrupt, and a {{receiver}} was appointed on January 15, 1896, before {{the company was}} sold at foreclosure by the Sea Beach Railway, which was incorporated on August 29, 1896. The Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) bought the company's stock on November 5, 1897, along with the short elevated Sea View Railway on Coney Island, and assigned it by lease to the Brooklyn Heights Railroad. It was soon fitted with <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> for electric operation. A March 1, 1907 agreement allowed the company to operate through service from 38th Street and New Utrecht Avenue to Coney Island. Starting around 1908, electric trains began operating as {{a branch of the}} BMT West End Line from Bath Junction to Coney Island, with trains coming from Park Row in Manhattan via the Brooklyn Bridge and BMT Fifth Avenue Line. Streetcars ran over the rest of the line to Bay Ridge, from New Utrecht Avenue and 62nd Street to 65th Street and Third Avenue. In 1907, connecting tracks were built connecting to the West End Line just north of Coney Island Creek in order to bring Sea Beach trains into West End Depot. The original alignment was retained for freight service only.|$|E
50|$|To {{recharge}} the car, Fetherstonhaugh connected {{it to the}} <b>trolley</b> <b>wires</b> running {{near his}} home. He later purchased his own gasoline generator to recharge the batteries. Fetherstonhaugh kept the car until around 1912, when it was sold. Its whereabouts after 1912 are not known.|$|R
50|$|As {{in other}} cities the cable cars did not {{completely}} replace the horsecars, but they rather created a transportation backbone. In fact, even as the horse lines were being converted to trolleys, the electrical cars had to be pulled by grip cars through the downtown, {{due to the lack}} of <b>trolley</b> <b>wires</b> there.|$|R
50|$|The trolley {{was first}} put into {{operation}} in 2000. The electricity to power its electric motors comes not from overhead <b>trolley</b> <b>wires,</b> but instead from a diesel generator which also provides head end power and which is towed (or pushed) on a trailer. The car runs each year from May to September.|$|R
500|$|After raising $40,000 in donations, volunteers {{refurbished}} car 300 and repainted it {{from the}} yellow paint scheme it had worn in Portland (inherited from San Antonio) to a new red-and-green livery, with [...] "Astoria Riverfront Trolley" [...] lettered along the side, above the windows.

500|$|By 1905, {{several small}} slope mines and 15 shaft mines {{operated}} in the county. Most were along the railroad line. Large numbers {{of immigrants from}} England, Wales, and eastern Europe, looking for work, detrained at the Harrisburg Train Depot; crowding around quickly expanding mining villages directly outside the city, such as Muddy, Wasson, Harco and Ledford. The city's population quickly expanded from 5,000 to 10,000 in a few years. By 1906, the Big four/CCC Railroad became the New York Central, and Saline County was producing more than 500,000 tons of coal annually with more than 5000 miners at work. In 1915 the Ringling Brothers Circus made an appearance in Harrisburg. In 1913, the Southern Illinois Railway and Power Company operated an interurban trolley line, that ran from downtown Eldorado, into Muddy, Wasson, Beulah Heights, through downtown Harrisburg, Dorrisville, Ledford and into downtown Carrier Mills, all of which had larger residential areas than present. In 1917 there were plans to extend the line westward to Marion and Carbondale to connect to the Coal Belt Co. line, and then run it towards St. Louis. The <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> through the county was [...] high. It was an off branch of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad. The corporation erected the first electrical generating plant in Muddy, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|Cincinnati {{was one of}} {{only three}} cities in North America whose streetcars used double {{overhead}} <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> (two wires for each track) and twin trolley poles on each streetcar, the only others being Havana, Cuba, and the small Merrill, Wisconsin system. All routes used double <b>trolley</b> <b>wire,</b> the only exception being on route 78, a portion of which outside the city limits had only a single wire for each track. [...] On all other North American streetcar systems the rails served as the return path for the electric current collected via the trolley pole, but this requires proper bonding of the rails to prevent stray current from escaping and interfering with nearby utility lines, such as telephone lines. In Cincinnati, the primary early streetcar operating company, the Cincinnati Street Railway, chose to install double-wire from the beginning, to save money.|$|E
50|$|The {{cable cars}} did not {{completely}} replace the horsecars, but they rather created a transportation backbone.

2500|$|Starting in 1999 a few {{trips on}} route 1, on Saturdays only, had {{continued}} beyond Morro Dois Irmãos, to Estação Silvestre (...) , a route section previously closed in 1966. However, operation of these trips became sporadic and {{is thought to}} have ceased by 2005 or 2006; the section of tramway between Dois Irmãos and Silvestre was closed definitively in 2008, after the theft of most of the overhead <b>trolley</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Kennecott Copper ordered four 700-series {{electric}} locomotives with on-board batteries. These locomotives weighed 85 tons and operated on 750-volt overhead <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> with considerable further range whilst running on batteries. [...] The locomotives provided several decades of service using Nickel-iron battery (Edison) technology. The batteries were replaced with lead-acid batteries, and the locomotives were retired shortly afterward. All four locomotives were donated to museums, but one was scrapped. The {{others can be}} seen at the Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad, Iowa, and at the Western Railway Museum in Rio Vista, California.|$|E

2500|$|The Canarsie Railroad was {{chartered}} on May 8, 1906 as a BRT subsidiary (leased to the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad) {{and acquired}} {{the line on}} May 31, 1906. The line was partly elevated, and electrified with third rail on the elevated part and <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> on the rest, south of New Lots Avenue. The Long Island Rail Road, which had used the line north of New Lots to access their Bay Ridge Branch, built a new line just to the west. The East New York terminus was extended several blocks along a section of line formerly used for [...] "East New York Loop" [...] service to the Fulton Street Elevated and the Broadway Elevated (now the BMT Jamaica Line), at a point known as Manhattan Junction (now Broadway Junction).|$|E
2500|$|The Dolter {{company had}} {{obtained}} the Act {{and ordered the}} trams but the NECC, who had been contracted by them to lay the tracks, registered a subsidiary company in December 1907 named the Torquay Tramways Company {{to take over the}} Dolter company's operations in Torquay. This company obtained a Torquay and Paignton Tramways Act on 16 August 1909 to extend the seafront line [...] to Hyde Road, Paignton. The council in Paignton insisted that the tram's power supply in their town was to be by overhead <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> rather than the Dolter stud system. Work on erecting trolley wires above the existing tracks started late in 1910 and was completed on 6 March 1911. The new line to Paignton was opened on 17 July 1911. The Dolter tram cars were rebuilt to collect current from the overhead wire.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to passenger cars, interurban companies acquired freight locomotives and line maintenance equipment. [...] A [...] "box motor" [...] was a powered car exclusive for freight {{that looked like}} a passenger interurban without windows and had wide side doors for loading freight. A freight motor was geared for power rather than speed and could pull up to six freight cars depending upon the load and grades. Freight cars for interurbans tended to be smaller than those for steam railroads, and they had to have special extended couplers to prevent car corner contact at the very tight grinding turns at city street corners. Maintenance equipment included [...] "line cars" [...] with roof platforms for the <b>trolley</b> <b>wire</b> repair crew, snow plows and snow sweepers with rotating brushes, a car for weed control and to maintain track and ballast. In order to save money, many companies constructed these in their shops using retired or semi-wrecked passenger cars for the frame and the traction motor mounted trucks.|$|E
50|$|Power was {{initially}} {{provided for the}} tram network by three direct current turbo-generators in the Falsgrave Street powerhouse. There was also an accumulator battery in the powerhouse used during the start-up phase and for smoothing the power supply. The generators were run using superheated steam from coal-fired boilers. Electricity was supplied to the <b>trolley</b> <b>wires</b> at a nominal 600V DC.|$|R

50|$|In November 2004, bid {{costs were}} reduced by postponing the {{construction}} of a walkway between Waterfront Station and the cruise ship terminal, removing Westminster Station, and moving Richmond Center Station {{and the end of the}} line several hundred metres north. TransLink would further pay for the cost of reinstallation of the <b>trolley</b> <b>wires</b> along Cambie. As a way to further reduce the best and final offer, RAVCO no longer required that the proponent provide for 59 ticket vending machines and 38 ticket validating machines or for a police unit to operate on the RAV line. RAVCO also shifted responsibility for moving <b>trolley</b> <b>wires</b> from SNC-Lavalin to TransLink. Costs were also decreased due to decisions to single-track sections on the Richmond and airport branches. The Richmond branch was single-tracked from Ackroyd Road onward in large part due to Richmond's city council pressuring for the visual profile of the overhead line to be reduced for aesthetic reasons.|$|R
