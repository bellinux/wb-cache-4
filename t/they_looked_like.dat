5|$|In 197879, Harvey’s {{appointments}} increased. Harvey {{stood in}} all of Queensland's five home Shield matches, {{as well as their}} match against the touring Englishmen. He stood in one List A match involving Queensland and was then rewarded with his international debut in the second ODI between Australia and England at the SCG, before presiding over the next ODI at the MCG. At the end of the season, Harvey was selected for the first of his two Tests. The first, played by Australia against Pakistan at the MCG in March 1979 was dramatic. During the run-chase, the Australians were stunned by a spell of 7 wickets for 1 run by Sarfraz Nawaz, just when <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> winning. Sarfraz ended with 9/86the other wicket was run outas Australia collapsed from 3/305 to 310 all out to lose by 71 runs. Harvey’s partner was Robin Bailhache.|$|E

5|$|Large three-toed {{footprints}} {{are known}} in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly Wealden beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert {{went so far}} as to assign them to an ichnogenus he named Iguanodon, and Samuel Beckles noted in 1854 that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young Iguanodon, with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to Iguanodon. A trackway in England shows what may be an Iguanodon moving on all fours, but the foot prints are poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus Iguanodon are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil Iguanodon is known, to Spitsbergen, Svalbard, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opposition}} in the fourth round were Italian side Roma. The first leg was held at Roma's home ground the Stadio Olimpico, where Liverpool had won the European Cup twice in 1977 and 1984. Incidentally, Roma were the team Liverpool beat to win the European Cup in 1984. Liverpool were once again successful at the Stadio Olimpico, as they won 2–0 courtesy of two Michael Owen second half goals. The second leg at Anfield was a close affair. Roma scored in the 70th minute to take the lead, they now needed to score another goal to take the match into extra-time. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> they {{had the opportunity to}} do so, when the referee awarded a penalty {{towards the end of the}} match after he had adjudged that Markus Babbel had handled the ball. However, moments later, he reversed his decision and instead awarded Roma a corner-kick. Roma were unable to score the necessary goal following the incident and Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals courtesy of a 2–1 aggregate victory.|$|E

25|$|According to {{traveler}} John Muir, on {{his visit}} to Diomede Islands in the 1880s they found the natives eager to trade away everything they had. The village was perched on the steep rocky slope of the mountain which drops at once sheer into deep water. The huts were mostly built of stone with skin roofs. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> mere stoneheaps, black dots on the snow at a distance, with whalebone posts set up and framed at the top to lay their canoes beyond the dogs that would otherwise eat them.|$|E
25|$|They were relegated {{from the}} top flight {{for the first time}} in 1920, and wouldn't return until 1926, and in the 1927–28 season <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> going down again before {{securing}} a haul of 17 points from their last 10 matches to secure safety. Wednesday went on to win the League title the following season (1928–29), which started a run that saw the team finishing lower than third only once until 1936. The period was topped off with the team winning the FA Cup for the third time in the club's history in 1935. When World War Two began, the club entered non-competitive war leagues, returning to the status quo in 1946.|$|E
25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. The boats had narrow, high funnels so that the steam and thick coal smoke was released high above the deck {{and away from the}} fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed woodbines because <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E

The lead designer of consumer hardware development at Sega, Hideki Sato, disliked the original cartridges, saying <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> [...] "small black tombstones" [...] when inserted in the console, and later remarked that his proudest achievement of the SG-1000 era was replacing them with the cheerier, pocket-sized Sega Cards. Sega also employed popular comedy duo Tunnels to provide celebrity endorsement for the console.|$|E

A few days after arriving in Seattle, Novoselic and Cobain auditioned Grohl, with Novoselic later stating, [...] "We knew in two minutes that he was the right drummer".

500|$|The main U.S. {{contribution}} to the FANK effort {{came in the form}} of the bombers and tactical aircraft of the U.S. Air Force. When President Nixon launched the incursion in 1970, American and South Vietnamese troops operated under an umbrella of air cover that was designated Operation Freedom Deal. When those troops were withdrawn, the air operation continued, ostensibly to interdict PAVN/Viet Cong troop movements and logistics. In reality (and unknown to the U.S. Congress and American public), they were utilized to provide tactical air support to FANK. As a former U.S. military officer in Phnom Penh reported, [...] "the areas around the Mekong River were so full of bomb craters from B-52 strikes that, by 1973, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the valleys of the moon." ...|$|E

Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool.

500|$|During the {{training}} camp of the Pittsburgh's inaugural {{season with the}} nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism about the team's prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the [...] "ame old Steelers" [...] (SOS). After losing {{the first two games}} of the 1941 season, Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach. Bell's coaching career ended with a 10–46–2 record, his 0.179 winning percentage is second lowest in NFL history to only Phil Handler's 0.105 for coaches with at least five seasons. And at 36 games under [...]500 he held the record for futility until John McKay passed him in 1983 and Marion Campbell passed him in 1988.

500|$|Under Dunn's experience, {{the band}} instituted some traditions that the {{university}} uses to the present. In 1925, Marvin H. Mimms wrote the lyrics for an alma mater for the school. Dunn, who found the Aggie War Hymn [...] "inappropriate" [...] for social functions and solemn occasions, wrote its accompanying music and presented it to the student body titled Spirit of Aggieland. In 1926, the tradition of Elephant Walk began when two seniors in the band led a procession of seniors throughout the school grounds visiting all the important places on campus. All the seniors in one single file was [...] "quite a site to behold", and one junior commented that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a bunch of old elephants wandering around {{trying to find some}} place to die.
