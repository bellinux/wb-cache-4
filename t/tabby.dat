5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown <b>tabby)</b> and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons {{were entered}} into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon brown <b>tabby,</b> named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show. The silver collar was {{purchased}} by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation {{with the help of}} a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.|$|E

At the time, founder Jonathan Rosenberg served as unsalaried full-time executive director and Sharon Rosenberg as volunteer coordinator at <b>Tabby's</b> Place.|$|R

In the first series she mentored the 16–24s and chose Roberta Howett, Cassie Compton and <b>Tabby</b> Callaghan to {{represent}} her in the live rounds of the show. The best placed of these was <b>Tabby,</b> who finished third overall. The final was contested between Simon Cowell's act Steve Brookstein and Louis Walsh's act G4, with Steve winning.

5000|$|<b>Tabby's</b> Place houses around 100 cats in {{a single}} building, and in 2010 had plans the {{addition}} of two more buildings to increase care {{for a total of}} 500 residents. The physical design of the <b>Tabby's</b> Place building and attention to detail has received considerable media coverage. The New Jersey Monthly described the sanctuary as [...] "palatial." [...] The sanctuary is cage free and constructed of materials that allow for easy and frequent cleaning. The building includes specialized suites for cats with specific medical needs, outdoor enclosures with access to sunlight, communal living areas with areas to excercise, and a medical facility in house. [...] Focusing on serving cats scheduled for euthanasia at public shelters and rarely taking cats in from members of the public, <b>Tabby's</b> Place abides by a strict [...] "no-kill" [...] policy. <b>Tabby's</b> Place does not restrict the admission of cats on the basis of age or medical conditions, or being generally considered [...] "unadoptable" [...] by the standards of most public animal shelters. <b>Tabby's</b> Place houses many [...] "special needs" [...] cats, adopting a philosophy that even cats with serious health conditions such as diabetes, Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), neurological disabilities, cancer, blindness and paraplegia should be able to live with dignity, to have a loving home, and to be adopted. Families who are unable to adopt are offered the option of sponsoring or [...] "virtually" [...] adopting a cat.|$|R

50|$|A {{conglomeration}} {{of magnetic}} activity, i.e. sunspots, differential rotation, occasional {{changes in the}} distribution of the photosphere, and simply random variation in convective efficiency have also been postulated. But given that no other star has been observed with such a light curve, and that <b>Tabby's</b> Star is at the hot end of the stars which Kepler observes, it may be that <b>Tabby's</b> star is approaching the end of its convective lifetime, an example of selection bias, or both.|$|R
50|$|In June 2010, a USA Today article {{described}} a United States Marine stationed in Okinawa, Japan {{who had been}} caring for three stray cats when his local animal shelter was being shut down.

25|$|After several unlucky {{attempts}} {{to seek a}} new spouse, Patrick came to terms with widowerhood {{at the age of}} 47, and spent his time visiting the sick and the poor, giving sermons and administering communion, leaving the three sisters Emily, Charlotte, Anne, and their brother Branwell alone with their aunt and a maid, Tabitha Aykroyd (<b>Tabby),</b> who tirelessly recounted local legends in her Yorkshire dialect while preparing the meals. He survived his entire family, and six years after Charlotte's death he died in 1861 at the age of 84. At the end he was helped by his son-in-law, the Rev. Arthur Bell Nicholls.|$|E
25|$|He is {{also known}} to be fond of cats. As Cardinal Ratzinger he was known (according to former neighbours) to look after stray cats in his neighbourhood. A book called Joseph and Chico: A Cat Recounts the Life of Pope Benedict XVI was {{published}} in 2007 which {{told the story of}} the Pope's life from the feline Chico's perspective. This story was inspired by an orange <b>tabby</b> Pentling cat, which belonged to the family next door. During his trip to Australia for World Youth Day in 2008 the media reported that festival organizers lent the Pope a grey cat called Bella in order to keep him company during his stay.|$|E
25|$|The {{plantation}} produced oranges, {{sea island}} cotton, indigo, okra, and other vegetables. Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota {{of work to}} do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed to do what they wished. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from <b>tabby,</b> which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive although labor-intensive. The cabins were located {{about a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed to padlock their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house. Both of these features were unusual for slave quarters in antebellum America.|$|E
