Social and economic issues are vital to her not from a technical point of view but in terms of moral and ethical issues involved. Ethical considerations include the nature of private property. Within the Catholic Church several conflicting views had developed. Pope Pius XI declares private property essential for the development and freedom of the individual. Those who deny private property, deny personal freedom and development. But, said Pius, private property has a social function as well. Private property loses its morality, if it is not subordinated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good.</b> Therefore, governments have a right to redistribution policies. In extreme cases, the Pope grants the State a right of expropriation of private property.|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} Félix Luna's Breve {{historia de}} los Argentinos (...) , {{one of the}} most important societal consequences of the May Revolution was the shift in the way the people and its rulers related. Until then, the conception of the common good prevailed: while royal authority was fully respected, if an instruction from the crown of Spain was considered detrimental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good</b> of the local population, it was half-met or simply ignored. With the revolution, the concept of common good gave way to that of popular sovereignty, as theorized by Moreno, Castelli and Monteagudo, among others. This idea held that, in the absence of a legitimate authority, the people had the right to appoint their own leaders. Over time, popular sovereignty would give way to the idea of majority rule. This maturation of ideas was gradual, taking many decades to crystallize into stable electoral and political systems, but it was what ultimately led to the adoption of the republican system as the form of government for Argentina. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento stated similar views in his Facundo, and noted that cities were more receptive to republican ideas, while rural areas were more resistant to them, which led to the surge of caudillos.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tragedy of}} the commons is an {{economic}} theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently {{according to their own}} self-interest behave contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good</b> of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action. The concept and name originate in an essay written in 1833 by the Victorian economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (then colloquially called [...] "the commons") in the British Isles. The concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968.

2500|$|Another notable case {{during his}} tenure as Chief Baron was Bates's Case, also called The Case of Impositions, of 1606, {{on the power of}} the Crown to levy taxes without Parliamentary approval.

Fleming, in [...] giving judgement for the Crown, [...] held in effect that [...] the King had an unlimited power to levy taxes in any way [...] he [...] thought fit: the power of the King is both ordinary and absolute... absolute power, existing for the nation's safety, varies with the royal wisdom.

2500|$|The {{assumption}} of a liturgy is consistently an aristocratic prerogative {{and can be}} regarded as the [...] "survival of noble morality" [...] in the democratic city.

The high degree of discretion to liturgists in this case is decisive: the liturgist was assigned a task leaving him the freedom to determine how much to spend in order to achieve it. However the desire of the liturgist to conform to the ideal of a competitive elite was to the advantage of the city: no limit, upper or lower, is fixed, and [...] "the competitive mentality inherited by the ancient aristocracy" [...] ("la mentalité agonistique héritée de l'aristocratie archaïque)" [...] was enough to ensure a certain rivalry between liturgists in dedication <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E

Socialism is in itself a mere eloquent gesture, inspiring, encouraging, perhaps, but beyond that not very helpful, towards the vast problem of moral and material adjustment before the race. That problem is incurably miscellaneous and intricate, and only by great multitudes of generous workers, one working at this point and one at that, secretly devoted knights of humanity, hidden and dispersed kings, unaware of one another, doubting each his right to count himself among those who do these kingly services, is this elaborate rightening of work and guidance to be done." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{the custom}} at this period, when the {{strength}} of the feudal aristocracy controlled the rights, and frequently insulted the privileges, of the royal burghs of Scotland, that the latter, where it was practicable, often chose their provost, or chief magistrate, not out of the order of the merchants, shopkeepers, and citizens, who inhabited the town itself, and filled up the roll of the ordinary magistracy, but elected to that preeminent state some powerful nobleman, or baron, in the neighbourhood of the burgh, who was expected to stand their friend at court in such matters as concerned their common weal, and to lead their civil militia to fight, whether in general battle or in private feud, reinforcing them with his own feudal retainers. This protection was not always gratuitous. The provosts sometimes availed themselves of their situation to an unjustifiable degree, and obtained grants of lands and tenements belonging <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good,</b> or public property of the burgh, and thus made the citizens pay dear for the countenance which they afforded. Others were satisfied to receive the powerful aid of the townsmen in their own feudal quarrels, with such other marks of respect and benevolence as the burgh over which they presided were willing to gratify them with, in order to secure their active services in case of necessity. The baron, who was the regular protector of a royal burgh, accepted such freewill offerings without scruple, and repaid them by defending the rights of the town by arguments in the council and by bold deeds in the field.|$|E
