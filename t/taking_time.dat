5|$|On August 7, 2008, McCaslin {{announced}} {{in a journal}} entry on the band's site that the band was currently <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off from touring to do other things. Afterward, the group began working on the band's next studio album.

5|$|A PlayStation {{version was}} in {{development}} and {{scheduled for release}} in summer 2001, and a Dreamcast version in late 2001. Both were cancelled. PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions were due for release in 2002. Versions for the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance were proposed, but never materialised. A company called M4 was to have co-developed them alongside Lionhead, but Electronic Arts {{were not interested in}} the Game Boy versions. Molyneux stated that the Dreamcast version was cancelled because it was <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> to convert the game for the platform, and development had not progressed far enough for it to be worth continuing as interest in the platform was declining.|$|E
5|$|After WrestleMania, Massaro {{continued}} as a valet for WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In storyline, on the April 13 episode of SmackDown!, Massaro {{was attacked by}} Jillian Hall. In reality, Massaro had loosened a screw in her ankle, which had been inserted the previous year after she legitimately fractured her tibia and fibula while in a battle royal. Massaro returned on the June 1, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, helping McCool defeat Hall after she distracted her. This return was short lived when on the June 8 edition of SmackDown!, Massaro was suspended indefinitely after accidentally spilling Mr. McMahon's coffee on him. In reality, Massaro was <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off to participate on the show Survivor.|$|E
40|$|Much prior {{research}} has linked trait self-control and trait mindfulness with improved performance on overall academic metrics such as GPA. The present research expands on this literature by linking self-control, mindfulness, and closely related personality constructs {{to differences in}} the way students manage their <b>time</b> while <b>taking</b> exams. Students at two large public universities (total n = 362) completed scale measures of self-control, mindfulness, and their use of <b>time</b> when <b>taking</b> <b>timed</b> examinations. The results suggest that trait self-control (r =. 174) and trait mindfulness (r =. 311) are statistically significant predictors of effective <b>time</b> management while <b>taking</b> <b>timed</b> exams...|$|R

5|$|On October 27, 2009 it was {{announced}} that Striker would move from commentary on ECW to SmackDown, reuniting with Grisham. The move was made to help accommodate Jim Ross, who had been <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off to deal with his recent Bell's palsy attack. The following October, Striker and Grisham were joined by Michael Cole on SmackDown, forming a three-man announce team. Striker, however, was replaced in early February 2011 by Booker T.|$|E
5|$|Anthrax was {{announced}} as the headliner {{for the third}} annual Metal Alliance US tour, which endured through March and April 2013. Supporting acts included Exodus, Municipal Waste, and Holy Grail, with the headliner Anthrax performing Among the Living in its entirety. Charlie Benante has been <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off from gigs outside the US because of personal reasons. His place was filled in by drummer Jon Dette during these shows. The group filmed their performance at Santiago, Chile, with Benante on drums, for the DVD album Chile On Hell. The tour ended with a show at San Bernardino, California, at the two-year anniversary of the album's release. After finishing the tour, the band took a short break before reconvening to start work on a new album.|$|E
5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward. Gravel did focus his attention on the second 2008 vote, the New Hampshire primary. There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader. By late March, Gravel had almost no fundraising and was only on the ballot in one of the next ten Democratic primaries.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Ripley {{was cast}} in her {{breakthrough}} role of Jenny Gifford in the ITV series Cold Feet. Initially a supporting role in the pilot episode, Ripley's character was expanded when a series was commissioned in 1998. She stayed with the show for three full series before leaving to take more varied roles and {{to spend more time}} with her family. She returned for a guest appearance in the fifth series. After leaving Cold Feet, Ripley played a succession of leading roles in comedies and dramas including Green-Eyed Monster (2001), I Saw You (2002), The Stretford Wives (2002), and Dead Gorgeous (2002). Each role won her critical acclaim. In 2006, she filmed a leading role in the ITV drama Bon Voyage, before <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> away from acting after the birth of her second child. Ripley returned to television in 2009, starring as human resources manager Christine Frances in the ITV comedy drama Monday Monday, and Nicola Perrin alongside Martin Clunes in BBC One's Reggie Perrin.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off, {{he said in an}} interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
5|$|The feud between The Undertaker and Yokozuna {{began at}} Survivor Series 1993. During an {{elimination}} match, Yokozuna {{was unable to}} injure The Undertaker, despite slamming The Undertaker's head into the ring steps and performing the Banzai drop on him. A match was booked for Royal Rumble 1994, in which The Undertaker would challenge WWF World Heavyweight Champion Yokozuna for the title in a Casket match. During the match, which featured a no-disqualification clause, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, hired nine other wrestlers to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf. Yokozuna won the match after opening The Undertaker's urn, which, according to the storyline, contained the secret to The Undertaker's powers. After the match, The Undertaker appeared on the video screen and vowed {{to return to the}} World Wrestling Federation one day. He was not seen for several months, although, in reality, he was <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off wrestling to allow injuries to heal. The Undertaker returned at SummerSlam 1994, defeating an Undertaker look-alike. A rematch against Yokozuna was scheduled for Survivor Series. This was also to be a Casket match, but Chuck Norris was brought in as a special outside referee to prevent interference.|$|E

5|$|Pitt has a {{sustained}} interest in architecture, even <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> away from film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry. He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide {{efforts to build}} environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award {{in recognition of the}} project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion {{that women are more}} likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E
5|$|Vipond was an Investment Banking Analyst at CIBC World Markets Inc. in Vancouver from 2005 to 2007. He {{then worked}} in Investment Management at ScotiaMcLeod from 2007 to 2010, where he managed {{portfolios}} of high-net-worth clients that were worth {{a total of}} about $120 million. After <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> off from his career to earn a Master of Business Administration, Vipond worked in Strategy and Corporate Development at the Vancouver-based Goldcorp Inc. from 2012 to 2015 where he made a $2.6 billion unsolicited bid to buy Osisko Mining. In 2013, while working at Goldcorp, Vipond founded Mathers Pacific Capital Inc., which is based in Vancouver. Mathers Pacific Capital works with Vancouver-area companies to help them raise capital, complete mergers and acquisitions, and grow their businesses. In March 2015, Vipond became Vice President of Corporate Finance at Shoes.com, while also continuing to run Mathers Pacific Capital and the Corporate Finance Institute, which is a subdivision of Mathers Pacific Capital. Prior to joining Shoes.com, Vipond worked as a consultant for its owner, Roger Hardy and in 2014, spearheaded the firm's purchase of Shoeme.ca and OnlineShoes.com. These purchases helped bring Shoes.com into the online shoe-selling business and shortly after joining Shoes.com, he oversaw the completion of a non-brokered $45 million private placement. It was the largest such private placement ever completed by a Canadian e-commerce company. In 2014, Vipond taught a one-day course on mining valuation at Sauder School of Business that involved working through a mining acquisition opportunity and the impact on such an mining investment.|$|E
