5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an anti-aircraft gun was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in question are simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E
25|$|Maimonides {{wrote that}} it was only {{permitted}} to enter the site to fulfill a religious precept. After the destruction of the Temple there was discussion as to whether the site, bereft of the Temple, still maintained its holiness or not. Jewish codifiers accepted the opinion of Maimonides who ruled that the holiness of the Temple sanctified the site for eternity and consequently the restrictions on entry to the site are still currently in force. While secular Jews ascend freely, the question of whether ascending is permitted is a matter of some debate among religious authorities, with a majority holding that it is permitted to ascend to the Temple Mount, but not to step {{on the site of the}} inner courtyards of the ancient Temple. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> becomes whether the site can be ascertained accurately. A second complex legal debate centers around the precise divine punishment for stepping onto these forbidden spots.|$|E

500|$|Seminal {{though this}} moment was, {{it was just}} a start. As his biographer, WK Hancock, noted: [...] "All the same, [...] knew that nations are not made by {{administrative}} arrangements alone". In The Conditions of Future South African Literature, his next essay of significance, he dealt with the other significant factor in nation-building - the cultural and emotional ties needed to form a united community. Within this essay, not at first sight written on an overtly political topic, Smuts declared that a true South African literature did not and could not exist until a true South African nation had been born. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> arose - what was hindering this development? Smuts identified the inhibiting factor as the relations between Briton and Boer - particularly the effect of the influx of British emigrants to the gold mines of the Transvaal on the deeply conservative Afrikaner population. The relations between these two groups were fraught; the discover of gold and the rapid industrialisation of the Transvaal had done much to disturb the settled ways of the Boer population. With its vast mineral wealth the Transvaal was rapidly becoming the most significant economic unit of South Africa, but the sudden tide of primarily British immigrants caused a great deal of unrest, with the established population decrying the immorality and degeneracy they perceived in the new mineworkers. These divisions, though strongest in the Transvaal, existed to one degree or another throughout South Africa. Smuts, though sympathising with the concerns of the old population, fearful their established ways and traditions would be swamped in a flood of migration, urged the Afrikaners to embrace the new spirit of dynamism which he saw the new migrants injecting. Likewise he exhorted the new population to integrate with the old, to consolidate the white population both {{for the sake of a}} future South African nation but also to secure their survival in the face of the vastly greater Native population.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> arises: {{where exactly}} does the disembodied soul [...] "go" [...] at death? Theologians {{refer to this}} subject as the {{intermediate}} state.

In particular, Jesus teaches in Luke 16:19–31 (Lazarus and Dives) that hades consists of two separate [...] "sections", one for the righteous and one for the unrighteous.

[...] This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question. [...] For example, Viktor Frankl argues for [...] "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life.

2500|$|The problem {{persists}} {{in the same}} way when attempting to determine whether God is an eternal essence, or an existing being, neither of which are adequate, as traditional theology was well aware. When God is understood in this way, it becomes clear that not only is it impossible to argue for the [...] "existence" [...] of God, since God is beyond the distinction between essence and existence, but it is also foolish: one cannot deny that there is being, and thus there is a Power of Being. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> becomes whether and in what way personal language about God and humanity's relationship to God is appropriate. In distinction to [...] "theological theism", Tillich refers to another kind of theism as that of the [...] "divine-human encounter". Such is the theism of the encounter with the [...] "Wholly Other" [...] ("Das ganz Andere"), as in the work of Karl Barth and Rudolf Otto, and implies a personalism with regard to God's self-revelation. Tillich is quite clear that this is both appropriate and necessary, as it is the basis of the personalism of Biblical Religion altogether and the concept of the [...] "Word of God", but can become falsified if the theologian tries to turn such encounters with God as the Wholly Other into an understanding of God as a being. In other words, God is both personal and transpersonal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{degree of}} {{advancement}} Andrews achieved {{in her career}} as a writer, textbook author, and teacher would have been unthinkable {{had it not been for}} the collapse of her beloved antebellum estate in Washington, Georgia. <b>The</b> <b>question</b> <b>then</b> becomes whether she was motivated to advance her career and assert her independence out of want or need. A good illustration of her often contradictory nature was her desire to remain unmarried for life. This is apparent in her first novel A Family Secret (1876) which creates a vivid image of the role of women in the post war South. She remarks upon the misery inherent in marrying for money and writes at one point [...] "Oh, the slavery it is to be a woman and not a fool." [...] At the same time, Andrews believed that the domestic wife and mother was the only acceptable role for women in Southern society, and she considered teaching [...] "a mental tread-mill, a dull road traveled over and over requiring only patience." [...] On the surface, her ideas seem to be in direct conflict with her accomplishments as a teacher and scholar, but over time she seems to have become more accepting [...] that she could not rescue her beloved antebellum society. As she observed in the introduction to her Wartime Journal that “In the lifetime of a single generation the people of the South have been called upon to pass through changes that the rest of the world has taken centuries to accomplish” she had been assuming a new role in an era where society was experiencing rapid economic and social changes.|$|E
