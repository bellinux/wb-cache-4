Since 1901, a Coronation Fleet Review has also been held. To celebrate the coronation, a coronation honours list is also released before the coronation.|$|E

5|$|Many Puranas tell Krishna's {{life story}} or some {{highlights}} from it. Two Puranas, the Bhagavata Purana and the Vishnu Purana, contain <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> telling of Krishna's story, but the life stories of Krishna {{in these and}} other texts vary, and contain significant inconsistencies. The Bhagavata Purana consists of twelve books subdivided into 332chapters, with a cumulative total of between 16,000 and 18,000 verses depending on the version. The tenth book of the text, which contains about 4,000 verses (~25%) and is dedicated to legends about Krishna, {{has been the most}} popular and widely studied part of this text.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosperity}} stimulated {{a building}} boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, {{with the building}} of some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> structures the city had seen up to that point. This was cut short {{in part by the}} Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.|$|E
5|$|An era {{came to an}} end in 1668 {{with two}} events: Davenant died suddenly, leaving a messy {{ownership}} situation for the Duke's Company, and Pepys' eyesight forced him to stop keeping a diary. Thomas Betterton, though formally a minority shareholder, continued to run the Duke's Company, and, in the spirit of Davenant, commissioned <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> of the Restoration playhouses, the theatre at Dorset Garden (or Dorset Gardens), with a flat for himself on top. Although the Dorset Garden Theatre quickly became a famous and glamorous venue, very little is concretely known about the building and outfitting of it: a vague and undocumented tradition ascribes its design to Christopher Wren. The absence of Pepys' record means that performance data for the next decades are only patchily known.|$|E
5|$|From the Bronze Age {{there are}} {{extensive}} examples of rock art. These include cup and ring marks, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe {{and have been}} found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the Kilmartin district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in Kilmartin, and a boat pecked into Wemyss Cave, {{are believed to be}} the oldest known representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial cists in Lanarkshire and Kincardine.|$|E

5|$|In Toraja society, {{the funeral}} ritual is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> and {{expensive}} event. The {{richer and more}} powerful the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the aluk religion, only nobles {{have the right to}} have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called rante, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs and poems, and crying and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals for young children, and poor, low-status adults.|$|E
5|$|Krishna {{is found}} in {{southeast}} Asian history and art, but to a far less extent than Shiva, Durga, Nandi, Agastya, and Buddha. In temples (candi) of the archaeological sites in hilly volcanic Java, Indonesia, temple reliefs do not portray his pastoral life or {{his role as the}} erotic lover, nor do the historic Javanese Hindu texts. Rather, either his childhood or the life as a king and Arjuna's companion have been more favored. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> temple arts of Krishna are found in a series of Krsnayana reliefs in the Prambanan Hindu temple complex near Yogyakarta. These are dated to the 9thcentury CE. Krishna remained a part of the Javanese cultural and theological fabric through the 14thcentury, as evidenced by the 14th-century Penataran reliefs along with those of the Hindu god Rama in east Java, before Islam replaced Buddhism and Hinduism on the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>elaborate</b> and {{influential}} story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns {{the murder of}} the god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.|$|E
