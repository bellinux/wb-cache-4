5|$|Between 1999 and 2000, {{the power}} station {{was given a}} turbine upgrade. In 2000, the station's {{condensers}} were also refurbished. The condenser refurbishment {{was carried out by}} Alstom. These improvements saw an increase in the station's generating capacity, <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and MWh production.|$|E
5|$|In its time, Dunston B Power Station ranked {{consistently}} in England's leading stations, both {{in terms}} of <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and cost per unit of electricity. However, the station eventually became outdated, and notification of its partial closure was given in October 1975, with some units being closed the following October. It was then only used as a stand-by station, operating only at peak electrical demand times. Finally, after some units having been in operation for about 40years, the station ceased to generate electricity on 26 October 1981. At the time of closure, only 98MW of the station's capacity was in use.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

40|$|A verified, multi-node {{computer}} {{model of a}} flat-plate, rear-duct, air-heating solar collector is described. Results are presented of the daily averaged <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> {{for a variety of}} simulated ambient conditions pertinent to mid maritime latitudes, for a range of collectors that differ in their thermal capacitances. The smooth, diurnal cycle of insolation produces a significant spread of <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> among the collectors, indicating that simple, approximate models of flat-plate collectors might lead to significant errors in predicting performance in real conditions. Rapid fluctuations in insolation, superimposed on the diurnal cycle, lead to only a slightly greater spread of <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> The effect of thermal capacitance on air outlet temperatures is slight. ...|$|R

5|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of {{geothermal}} electric {{plants is}} low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers. The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy. Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and district heating. System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated. The global average was 73% in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The A Station {{generated}} electricity {{using three}} turbo alternators; two 69 megawatt (MW) Metropolitan-Vickers British Thomson-Houston sets, and one 105MW Metropolitan-Vickers set, totalling 243MW. At {{the time of}} its commissioning, the 105MW generating set was the largest in Europe. The B Station also had three turbo alternators, all made by Metropolitan-Vickers. This consisted of two units which used 16MW high-pressure units exhausting to a 78MW and associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving these units a total rating of 100MW. The third unit consisted of a 66MW machine associated with a 6MW house alternator, giving the unit a rating of 72MW. Combined, these gave the B station a generating capacity of 260MW, making the site's generating capacity 503MW. All of the station's boilers were made by Babcock & Wilcox, fuelled by pulverised coal from pulverisers also built by Babcock & Wilcox. There were nine boilers in the A station and six in the B station. The B station's boilers were the largest ever built in the UK at that time. The B station also had the highest <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of any power station in the country for the first twelve years of its operation.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} of test for {{residential}} <b>thermal</b> distribution <b>efficiency</b> {{is currently being}} developed {{under the auspices of}} the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). The initial version of this test method is expected to have two main approaches, or ``pathways,`` designated Design and Diagnostic.

40|$|Institute of Complex Adaptive Matters [ICAM-UCD 13 - 08291]Photovoltaic-thermoelectric {{hybrid systems}} that operate in steady state have {{attracted}} considerable attention {{due to the}} possibility of supplying more power output than the photovoltaic cell alone. In real life, however, the solar energy continually changes during a day, thus rendering the assumption of steady state unrealistic. In this study, we have investigated such time-dependent systems by following the trajectory of the sun between sunrise and sunset. Computed results of <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are parametrized in heat transfer coefficients, the thermal conductivities of the thermoelectric module, and Seebeck coefficients.

25|$|The {{power output}} of {{biodiesel}} {{depends on its}} blend, quality, and load conditions under which the fuel is burnt. The <b>thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> for example of B100 as compared to B20 will vary due to the differing energy content of the various blends. <b>Thermal</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a fuel is {{based in part on}} fuel characteristics such as: viscosity, specific density, and flash point; these characteristics will change as the blends as well as the quality of biodiesel varies.

It was noted that, as the compression ratios increased, the efficiency of all fuel types – as well as blends being tested – increased; though it was found that a blend of B40 was the most economical at a compression ratio of 21:1 over all other blends. The study implied that this increase in efficiency was due to fuel density, viscosity, and heating values of the fuels.|$|E
50|$|Some larger {{installations}} utilize {{combined cycle}} generation. Usually {{this consists of}} a gas turbine whose exhaust boils water for a steam turbine in a Rankine cycle.

In these engines the efficiency may be improved recovering the waste heat, but this recovery may have ultimately impacts on both the in cylinder fuel conversion efficiency and the efficiency of the after treatment.

The high compression ratio was proven to have high <b>thermal</b> brake <b>efficiency</b> and low NOx emission at retarded fuel injection timing. High injection pressure due to a small nozzle hole diameter restrained initial combustion, promoted diffused combustion, and increased effective combustion efficiency.
