Before their match against Leeds Rhinos in July 2009, both clubs were given the opportunity to rename one stand, with the intention of renaming them in honour to a recognised player from each club's history. The rugby league club were granted the East Stand, which they renamed 'The Boston Stand' in tribute to the Welsh winger Billy Boston, As Wigan Athletic had spent many years in the lower leagues it was recognised that most of their players were not known, so the West Stand was renamed 'The Springfield Stand' after the club's former ground.|$|E

In the early 1970s, the chemistry of unsaturated carbon configurations was studied by a group at the University of Sussex, led by Harry Kroto and David Walton. In the 1980s a technique was developed by Richard Smalley and Robert Curl at Rice University, Texas to isolate these substances.

That he should wish to do so may seem strange given <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers, such as his friend Abraham Ortelius, had forsaken Ptolemy completely. It was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another, a final epitaph for the Ptolemy who had inspired Mercator's love of geography early in his life. He compared the great many editions of the Ptolemy's written Geographia, which described his two projections and listed the latitude and longitude of some 8000 places, as well as the many different versions of the printed maps which had appeared over the previous one hundred years, all with errors and accretions. Once again, this self-imposed diligence delayed publication and the 28 maps of Ptolemy appeared in 1578, after an interval almost ten years.

40|$|Compared {{with normal}} concrete, {{high-strength}} concrete has higher strength but is generally more brittle. Its {{use in a}} reinforced concrete structure, if not properly controlled, could lead to an unsustainable reduction in ductility. However, confinement could be provided to improve the ductility of the structure. In this study, the effects of concrete strength and confinement on the flexural ductility of reinforced concrete beams have been evaluated by means of complete moment-curvature analysis of beam sections cast in different concretes and provided with different confinements. The results reveal {{that the use of}} high-strength concrete at a constant tension steel ratio would increase the flexural ductility, but at a constant tension to balanced steel ratio would decrease the flexural ductility. In contrast, the provision of confinement would always increase the flexural ductility. It does this in two ways: first, it increases the balanced steel ratio so <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tension steel ratio, the tension to balanced steel ratio is decreased; and second, it increases the residual strength and ductility of <b>the</b> concrete so <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> tension to balanced steel ratio, the flexural ductility of the beam section is increased. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
