5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by <b>the</b> <b>overlapping</b> of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

40|$|Microtubule {{organization}} in cells {{is an important}} process. An example of careful microtubule organization is the mitotic spindle. The spindle is a bipolar structure with microtubules emanating from the poles at both sides. These microtubules form antiparallel <b>overlaps</b> in <b>the</b> centre of the spindle where they are bundled by bundling proteins. <b>The</b> <b>overlaps</b> are centred in the spindle and their constant length is regulated. <b>The</b> <b>overlaps</b> are important for {{the stability of the}} microtubule network, without bundling proteins <b>the</b> <b>overlaps</b> are lost and the spindle collapses. <b>The</b> antiparallel <b>overlaps</b> are also <b>the</b> site where microtubules slide apart to induce spindle elongation. Sliding is induced by tetrameric motor proteins that can bind to two bundled microtubules. Spindle elongation also requires microtubule growth at <b>the</b> <b>overlaps.</b> All these different functions at <b>the</b> <b>overlap,</b> sliding, growth/shrinkage and bundling, have to cooperate to maintain overlap length. While sliding reduces overlap length, growth will increase overlap length. These activities have to be coordinated for the maintenance of a constant overlap length. We propose that a feedback mechanism is present where growth of the microtubules is limiting the sliding in <b>the</b> <b>overlap.</b> This would prevent sliding when <b>the</b> <b>overlap</b> decreases and helps to maintain <b>the</b> <b>overlap.</b> We designed in vitro experiments to make antiparallel overlaps in vitro.

5|$|Strikes and {{industrial}} unrest were frequent {{in the aftermath}} of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organizations like the Communist Party of Australia and the Industrial Workers of the World. The problems were made worse in Australia due to <b>the</b> <b>overlapping</b> system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination of state and federal conditions. Protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all referendums to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.|$|E
