25|$|While it is {{not usually}} taught in church it is often used as a {{reminder}} of God’s promise to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>love</b> Him, and of the benefits of avoiding sinful passions. Iconographic depictions of the Final Judgment are often portrayed on the back (western) wall of the church building to remind the departing faithful to be vigilant in their struggle against sin. Likewise it is often painted {{on the walls of the}} Trapeza (refectory) in a monastery where monks may be inspired to sobriety and detachment from worldly things while they eat.|$|E

25|$|Hinduism, in its scriptures such as chapter 7 of the Bhagavad Gita, recognizes four {{kinds of}} devotees who {{practice}} Bhakti yoga.

500|$|Eurogamer Schilling {{called the}} self-referential {{nature of the}} release a [...] "very postmodern conceit", which he thought worked well despite the dual faux pas of parodying The Matrix and overtly [...] "satirizing game mechanics". He felt that the satire was not good, though the writing was [...] "genuinely funny", and that the {{repeated}} Dominatrix fight scenes should not have felt as low budget. He recommended the pack for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>love</b> [...] "wry gags about creaky gaming tropes with the occasional belly laugh", {{and said he had}} a better time finding his own fun than playing through the missions. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that those who are looking for cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.|$|E

500|$|The {{harm done}} by Formosa lies in this,— that the {{character}} is utterly false, false to human nature and false to London life. She is a wretch, abominable almost beyond conception, {{so as to be}} odious, if known, to the most odious. She is sharper as well as prostitute,—and is false to all with whom she comes in contact, to those whom she is supposed to love and to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>love</b> her. Her peculiar profession is represented as causing her no personal remorse. And yet she is exhibited to us as a fine creature, a noble woman, one whom a man might be honoured by loving;—and at last she ends with a success! ... That which is vile and dirty, squalid and miserable,—that, of which we may say that were its horrors known such knowledge would deter more thoroughly than any ignorance,—is exhibited as a bright existence, full of danger indeed, but still open to all that is noble, and capable of final success.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Onn Ja'afar {{proposed}} to open UMNO membership to all Malayans, and renaming it the United Malayan National Organisation, {{which would have}} diluted its identity {{as a champion of}} ketuanan Melayu. Defeated in an internal power struggle, he resigned in 1951 to found the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). He was succeeded by Tunku Abdul Rahman (often known as [...] "the Tunku"), who insisted on initial Malay sovereignty. Expressing concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non-Malays, he demanded they clarify their allegiance before being accorded citizenship, going on to state: [...] "For <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>love</b> and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays." [...] Not long after, in 1952, however, he appeared to contradict himself, and insisted that Malays safeguard their special position: [...] "Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races." ...|$|E
500|$|The Food Album has {{received}} mixed reviews from most critics; many felt {{that while the}} album was amusing {{it was not an}} essential release. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus awarded the album three out of five stars and wrote that, [...] "The Food Album is an enjoyable bag of treats. Just don't eat too much, or you'll probably get sick." [...] Likewise, The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album three out of five stars. Anthony [...] of The Buffalo News gave the album a moderately positive review and wrote that, [...] "here are two kinds of people in the world: <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>love</b> Weird Al Yankovic and those who can't stand him. Count me among the Weird One's biggest fans, and that's why I flipped out when listening to The Food Album." [...] He concluded that the album was [...] "like reading Mad magazine"; he gave the record three stars out of five. Tim Grobaty of the Press-Telegram, on the other hand, wrote negatively of the album, stating [...] "Yankovic's songs {{are the kinds of things}} that are sort of funny in concept, less funny when you actually hear them once, and increasingly irritating with each subsequent listen [...] his food songs are among his worst." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1998, he {{directed}} the film <b>Those</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Love</b> Me Can Take the Train, a [...] "melodramatic, sentimental and emptily wordy... about {{the interplay of}} assorted characters {{on their way to}} the funeral of a misanthropic, bisexual minor painter (Jean-Louis Trintignant)." [...] The final scene reflects the cemetery of Limoges to the music of Mahler's Tenth Symphony. Chéreau's only English-language film, Intimacy (2001), based on short stories by Hanif Kureishi (who also wrote a novel of the same title in 1998), was played by English actors, including Timothy Spall and Marianne Faithfull, and deals with [...] "the possessiveness of a musician from London who regularly meets a woman for sexual encounters". It [...] "was a tale of sexual obsession which sparked a debate about unsimulated sex on screen. But, Chéreau said, 'It is not like a porno film, not at all erotic sometimes, but it is beautiful because it is life." [...] In 2003, {{he directed}} His Brother (Son frère), centred [...] "on the relationship between two estranged brothers, one gay, the other straight. They come together when the latter suffers from a potentially fatal blood disease. The hospital processes are shot unflinchingly, without sentimentality, which makes this meditation on mortality even more moving." [...] Koch notes the similarity of a scene when the moribund is shaved for a last futile surgery he lies on a table similar to Mantegna's Dead Christ. In 2003 Chéreau served at Cannes as president of the jury.|$|E
