GC-MS analyses showed that males from nuptial chambers (for reproduction) produced hindgut volatile profiles {{similar to those of}} maturation feeding males from the nonreproductive galleries. The known aggregation pheromone components, ipsdienol (Id) and E-myrcenol (EM) are the major constituents of this blend, followed by several minor bark beetle-related compounds: 2 -methyl- 3 -buten- 2 -ol, ipsenol, cis-verbenol, verbenone, 2 -phenylethanol, myrtenol, and trans-myrtanol. The enantiomeric composition of the Id from the male hindgut extracts was determined to be a racemic mixture (50 / 50) by enantioselective GC. GC-EAD experiments indicated that I. duplicatus antennae from both sexes responded strongly not only to the known aggregation pheromone components, Id and EM, but also to the other minor conspecific-produced compounds. The strongest antennal response was elicited by the major pheromone component, Id, which was ca. 2 - 3 times higher than that elicited by the second component, EM. Electroantennogram dose-responses indicated that antennal response threshold to Id was approximately 100 times lower than that of EM. No synergistic effects between these occurred at peripheral level. A strong and repeatable EAD response was found to a <b>trace</b> <b>compound</b> (flame ionization detection undetectable) from both hindgut and aeration samples. The compound was identified as amitinol (At) based on the retention time and a further EAD analysis of a synthetic mixture. In the field trapping experiments, At increased the attraction of I. duplicatus to the traps baited with a binary blend of EM/Id (1 : 1) in a synergistic manner when tested at a low release rate (1 : 1 : 0. 1) but had no effect on catches at the high release rate (1 : 1 : 1). This result suggests that At might {{be a part of the}} Chinese I. duplicatus aggregation pheromone system.

40|$|Stable CO 2 {{isotope ratio}} breath tests are {{established}} as a valuable tool in diagnostic and investigative medicine, {{with the potential to}} become more prominent in the future. The instrument conventionally used to measure the very small changes involved is an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer however, the expense and complexity of such an instrument severely restricts the widespread and routine use of isotopic breath tests. Hence, to realise their full potential an alternative technique is required which is reliable, insensitive to environmental and component fluctuations, uncomplicated and affordable. We present a system that satisfies these criteria using broadband, non-dispersive, ground-state absorption infrared spectroscopy. Two isotopically distinct channels are created and their basal path length ratio recorded at the condition of transmitted intensity equilibrium. The change in channel path length ratios required to restore equilibrium in the 13 C-enriched breath sample {{is directly related to the}} change in 13 CO 2 / 12 CO 2 concentration ratio. The system's novelty lies in this negative feedback loop balancing the signal by means of adjusting the path length of one of the channels. There is little evidence in the literature on infrared breath measurements that the possibility of interference from coincident infrared active breath trace compounds or various spectral effects that could lead to spurious results have been adequately assessed. Therefore, prior to the construction of a prototype instrument based upon this technique the question of its validity must be addressed. Furthermore, in addition to any instrument presenting a viable alternative it should also offer better reliability, long term stability and ideally be of lower cost than other emergent infrared instruments. Significant emphasis has therefore been placed upon evaluation of possible interferents, with the intention of providing an unambiguous assurance of the measurement's validity over a range of conceivable operating conditions and establishing operating tolerances that improve reliability over other infrared techniques. Also the prospect of using this technique to perform alternative isotope ratio breath tests was explored with the feasibility of using a novel filtering technique to enable measurement of 18 O 12 O 16 O / 13 C 16 O 2 being investigated further. These aims were accomplished through the thorough evaluation of literature on breath trace compound's infrared spectra and by a series of theoretical computer instrument simulations, using detailed modelling of a breath sample's CO 2 spectroscopy, capable of identifying, evaluating and quantifying the risks posed to a reliable measurement of 13 CO 2 / 12 CO 2 due to various spectral effects. The breath <b>trace</b> <b>compound</b> analysis revealed that 13 C 16 O 2 / 12 C 16 O 2 ratios can confidently be measured for isotopic breath tests using an instrument based on infrared absorption, the position of C 02 's n 3 absorption band precluding any discernible risk. From the instrument simulations it has been possible to establish operating tolerances required to avoid or limit the generation of a spurious results and determine parameters necessary for the instrument's construction. Thus, we conclude that through the merits of its design and compliance to operating tolerances established the instrument described presents a viable alternative for providing highly accurate, reliable and low cost breath tests capable of being performed outside of a laboratory environment...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{carbonate}} minerals calcite, aragonite and dolomite (and their rock-counterparts) precipitate {{directly from}} fluids. The mineral-yielding fluids must contain the necessary chemical constituents calcium, magnesium, carbon and oxygen. As the carbonates precipitate they inherit and incorporate chemical signatures that are ultimately {{governed by the}} nature of formation fluids. Therefore, carbonate rocks and minerals can be treated as geologic reservoirs for information concerning past fluid chemistries and very powerful geochemical databases.; All sedimentary rocks, including carbonates, form directly on or near Earth's surface typically in close spatial association with biology. It is well documented that carbonate minerals can form via the influence of organisms (biotic) or independent of biological processes (abiotic). In addition while some carbonates may precipitate abiotically, biological processes that influence fluid conditions have the possibility of being recorded in carbonate minerals. Therefore the study of carbonates is important not only in geological and chemical contexts but also in a biological context as a direct result and/or a passive recorder of such processes.; The following dissertation describes five projects that exploit this carbonate mineral geochemical reservoir across a range of geologic settings. The carbonates presented in the following chapters can be categorized based on their relative time of formation compared to the deposition of the associated geologic unit. These categories are 1) primary, or syndepositional carbonates and 2) diagenetic, or carbonates precipitated post depositionally and prior to metamorphic temperature and pressure ranges. Both sedimentary regimes are suitable for biology and diagenetic environments in particular can be strongly controlled by microbial processes.; In the following studies isotopic, trace elemental, <b>trace</b> <b>compound,</b> petrographic, stratigraphic and textural data are combined {{in order to determine the}} formation environments of carbonates and the characteristics of carbonate-yielding fluids. Given the major constituents of carbonate minerals listed above, isotopic analyses of carbon and oxygen are critical measurements and can provide a great deal of evidence regarding the sources and cycling of theses two elements. Oxygen isotopes in carbonates are influenced by a multitude of processes (discussed in detail in the following chapters) most of which are directly reflective of fluid temperatures and their isotopic compositions, both of which can help distinguish between primary or diagenetic environments. Trace element concentrations of iron, manganese and strontium are exploited in chapter 2 in order to further constrain the influence of diagenesis on primary chemical signatures.; Carbon is a major constituent of not only carbonate minerals but also organic compounds, making is isotopic characterization in carbonate minerals a valuable tracer of the sources of carbon in sedimentary environments (Claypool and Kaplan, 1974). As with carbon, sulfur is strongly influenced by biologic processes. Carbonates incorporate trace amounts of sulfate upon precipitation (Burdett et al., 1986) and this sulfate has been shown to substitute directly for the carbonate ion within the crystal lattice (Pingitore et al., 1995). This sulfate is referred to as carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and can be extracted and analyzed for not only its bulk concentration but also its isotopic composition, both of which are dictated {{by the nature of}} carbonate-yielding fluids (Burdett et al., 1986). Carbonate formation environment can be further characterized when analysis of CAS (the oxidized sulfur species) is combined with isotopic and abundance analyses of pyrite (the dominant reduced sulfur phase in geologic settings). Therefore carbonate minerals act as geologic reservoirs for sulfur systematics as well. The following chapters describe studies which employ all or some of the above geochemical measurements in addition to more traditional geologic approaches such as petrography and stratigraphy.; Chapters 1 and 2 deal with Neoproterozoic to middle Cambrian units from northwestern Mexico and eastern California. These deposits are interpreted here as largely primary, however the influence of diagenesis is identified and discussed in each. This time interval is characterized by perhaps the most extreme evolutionary radiation experienced in Earth history, the so-called "Cambrian Explosion". It has long been proposed that certain chemical conditions must have existed in order to support such a drastic radiation, in particular increased marine oxygen concentrations. The data presented here suggests that this time interval was characterized by oceans with low sulfate concentrations [...] sulfate is a redox sensitive compound and is expected to increase in tandem with oxygen. These results require a reevaluation of the Earth's oceans during such an evolutionary significant time interval.; Chapters 3 and 4 focus on carbonate concretions from the Miocene Monterey Formation and the late Cretaceous Holz Shale. Concretions have long been known to form within sediments and their distinction as diagenetic is not largely debated. In these chapters, I show that concretionary carbonates retain signatures consistent with particular microbial processes, and directly identify that sulfur cycling plays a large role in past marine sedimentary regimes. In most cases, the identified microbial processes are likely directly responsible for carbonate mineralization. Concretions of the Monterey Formation exhibit chemical characteristics consistent with formation in sediments experiencing organic matter degradation via oxidation by nitrate and/or metal oxides and sulfate. Methanogenesis and sulfide oxidation were also active in zones of concretion precipitation in sediments of the Monterey Formation. Calcitic concretions of the Holz Shale possibly formed in zones experiencing extensive sulfide oxidation. Sulfide oxidation has, until now, not been identified as a reaction associated with carbonate authigenesis.; Chapter 5 highlights the possibility of forming potentially primary-like sedimentary textures through diagenetic processes in the Beck Spring Dolomite of eastern California. In this deposit, an extensive, laminated texture is most reasonably interpreted as diagenetic when geochemical, textural and petrographic data are considered together. This study demonstrates that the distinction between primary and diagenetic must not be made solely on field-based criteria...|$|E

There were two types of experiment. <b>Trace</b> organic <b>compounds</b> have initially been introduced as pure substances. A second experiment {{has been carried out}} under the same conditions, but using wastewater treatment plant biosolids. The results clearly show a difference in behaviour of the <b>trace</b> organic <b>compounds</b> according to the part of the plant and method of introduction. Generally speaking, for the experiments using pure substances, the roots absorb higher quantities of <b>trace</b> organic <b>compounds</b> and block {{to a greater or lesser}} extent their transfer to the above ground parts of the tomato plant. However, with the biosolids filtrate, the Di-ethylhexyl phtalate and the Nonyl ethoxylate phenol can be traced all over the plant...|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} components of volcanic gases are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur either as sulfur dioxide (SO2) (high-temperature volcanic gases) or hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (low-temperature volcanic gases), nitrogen, argon, helium, neon, methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Other compounds detected in volcanic gases are oxygen (meteoric), hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen bromide, nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur hexafluoride, carbonyl sulfide, and organic <b>compounds.</b> Exotic <b>trace</b> <b>compounds</b> include mercury, halocarbons (including CFCs), and halogen oxide radicals.|$|R
30|$|Fungicidal {{properties}} {{were found}} in solvent extracts of ground S. sempervirens heartwood samples at concentrations comparable to those known {{to be present in}} intact wood. The entire acetone-soluble extracts and ethyl-acetate-soluble fraction of the ethanol extracts caused the greatest reduction in the growth of both fungi tested. Large variations in acetone-soluble or ethanol-soluble extract content and fungicidal activity among trees were found. Agatharesinol and sequerin-C appear to be <b>trace</b> <b>compounds</b> in the dried extracts of S. sempervirens.|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{generation of}} spurious results, {{arising from the}} application of infrared spectroscopic techniques to the measurement of carbon isotope ratios in breath, due to coincident absorption bands has been re-examined. An earlier investigation, which approached the problem qualitatively, fulfilled its aspirations in providing an unambiguous assurance that 13 C 16 O 2 / 12 C 16 O 2 ratios can be confidently measured for isotopic breath tests using instruments based on infrared absorption. Although this conclusion still stands, subsequent quantitative investigation has revealed an important exception that necessitates a strict adherence to sample collection protocol. The results show that concentrations and decay rates of the coincident breath <b>trace</b> <b>compounds</b> acetonitrile and carbon monoxide, found in the breath sample of a heavy smoker, can produce spurious results. Hence, findings from this investigation justify the concern that breath <b>trace</b> <b>compounds</b> present a risk to the accurate measurement of carbon isotope ratios in breath when using broadband, non-dispersive, ground state absorption infrared spectroscopy. It provides recommendations {{on the length of}} smoking abstention required to avoid generation of spurious results and also reaffirms, through quantitative argument, the validity of using infrared absorption spectroscopy to measure CO 2 isotope ratios in breath...|$|R

There she investigated reactivity and kinetics of atmospherically relevant systems using atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared and ultraviolet absorption spectroscopies. In addition, she developed methods of chemical ionization for spectral interpretation of <b>trace</b> <b>compounds.</b> Caldwell Dyson has published and presented {{her work in}} numerous papers at technical conferences and in scientific journals.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between specific molecular features of trace organic contaminants and their removal efficiencies by a laboratory scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). Removal efficiencies of 40 <b>trace</b> organic <b>compounds</b> were assessed under stable operating conditions. The reported results demonstrate an apparent correlation between chemical structures and the removal of trace organic contaminants by the laboratory scale MBR system. The removal of all 14 very hydrophobic (Log D 3 ̆e 3. 2) <b>trace</b> organic <b>compounds</b> selected in this study was consistently high and was above 85...|$|R
