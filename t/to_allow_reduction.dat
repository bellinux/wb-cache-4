50|$|The protein {{complexes}} {{responsible for}} these chemical conversions — Sat, Apr and Dsr — are found in all currently known organisms that perform dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Energetically, sulfate is a poor electron acceptor for microorganisms as the sulfate-sulfite redox couple is E0' -516 mV, which is too negative <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>reduction</b> by NADH or ferrodoxin that are the primary intracellular electron mediators. To overcome this issue, sulfate is first converted into APS by the enzyme ATP sulfurylase (Sat), {{at the cost of}} a single ATP molecule. The APS-sulfite redox couple has a E0' of -60 mV, which allows APS to be reduced by either NADH or reduced ferrodoxin using the enzyme adenylyl-sulfate reductase (Apr), which requires the input of 2 electrons. In the final step, sulfite is reduced by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr) to form sulfide, requiring the input of 6 electrons.|$|E
50|$|A {{method of}} anti-lag {{developed}} {{along the same}} technique previously mentioned, but designed only <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>reduction</b> of turbo lag when a car is initially pulling away from a standing start. These systems can {{be integrated into the}} engine management or existing anti-lag system, or can be fitted as a standalone unit. The basic method of operation is to artificially lower the engine rev limiter to hold the engine at a speed where the turbo can produce usable boost, by altering the ignition. Because the ignition is alternately cut or retarded, there is similar noise and misfires associated with other anti-lag systems.Systems for two-step launch designed to be fitted in addition to the existing engine management work by interrupting the crank position sensor signal, so that the engine develops a controlled misfire at a pre-determined RPM. The basic premise of the launch control system is to build positive boost pressure from a static engine, releasing full or increased power to the wheels when the car starts to move off. It is most commonly used in turbocharged drag cars, primarily in the US, Australia, Puerto Rico and Japan, although most WRC cars utilise launch control to ensure that the cars can get off the line much more quickly.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} role of leukotriene-receptor antagonists (LTRAs) in {{management}} of asthma. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Most data were derived from randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. MAIN MESSAGE: Leukotrienes appear to {{have an important role}} in the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway inflammation. Leukotriene-receptor antagonists are effective in improving asthma control end points, such as allergen, ASA, and exercise challenge, in clinical models of asthma. In chronic asthma, LTRA administration reduces asthma symptoms and rescue beta 2 -agonist use, changes that are paralleled by improvements in lung function. Both zafirlukast and montelukast decrease circulating levels of eosinophils and could have other useful anti-inflammatory properties. Administration of LTRAs allows doses of inhaled corticosteroids to be reduced. Currently available LTRAs are free of serious side effects and are available as oral formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Leukotriene-receptor antagonists belong to a new class of asthma medication. While inhaled corticosteroids remain first-line therapy for managing chronic asthma, LTRAs should be considered for patients with ASA-sensitive asthma; as adjunct therapy when low to moderate doses of inhaled steroid alone provide incomplete control; or as adjunct therapy <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>reduction</b> in doses of inhaled corticosteroids...|$|E
40|$|Current medical {{technology}} has advanced tremendously {{over the last}} century. Nevertheless, the world sits far away from any possible cure for cancer, and available treatments have many obstacles to overcome. Approximately 85 % of all cancer patients develop solid tumors, in which half of these cases results in death due to malignant disease. Treatment such as chemotherapy has significant issues in delivering the required dosage of drugs to the cancer site. Large amounts of drugs are required to be injected in order to overcome the circulatory system, however, due to toxicity there is a limitation on administered dosage allowed. To solve this problem, various smart drug delivery systems {{have been developed for}} cancer therapy in an attempt to heighten the drug's efficacy. Recently, a promising drug delivery method that utilizes liposomes to specifically target solid tumors has been proposed. A liposome is an artificial lipid vesicle composed of a lipid bilayer that can encapsulate anti-cancer drugs such as Doxorubicin. The overall goal of liposomal drug delivery is to selectively target tumor and other diseased tissues to allow site specific release of such drug with enhanced permeability in combination with local hyperthermia <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>reduction</b> in toxicity by limiting the systemic exposure to critical normal tissues.
