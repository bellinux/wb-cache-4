5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his <b>text</b> <b>messages,</b> particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is sick of Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) {{pointless}} <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b> After one text, Darryl tells Andy {{that he is}} one bad text {{away from}} being blocked, but Andy wagers that he is one good text from a high five, to which Darryl agrees. Darryl then gets a text from Andy telling {{him to come to}} the parking lot, where there are pigeons eating an ice cream cone. Darryl laughs and gives Andy a high five.|$|E

40|$|Look {{around on}} any bus, in any restaurant, or {{standing}} in any line {{and people are}} <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> Likewise, most teenagers in America are nearly inseparable from their cell phones, {{not because they are}} constantly talking, but because they are connecting with their friends through <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> Although cell phones are banned in most K- 12 schools, students are <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> constantly there as well. Few adults, including teachers and administrators, understand how and why adolescents and young adults are using <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> or how to harness <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> capabilities in the classroom. This literature review examines the limited amount of research on the practice of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> for adolescents and young adults (ages 11 - 21), focusing on the motivation, means, and methods of <b>text</b> <b>messaging.</b> In addition, it considers how adults have successfully engaged <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> to assess and inform youth about health-related issues. In this light, some current educational uses of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> are highlighted, along with implications for future research...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{thread in}} the DIG_REF {{listserv}} addressed {{the integration of}} <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> into mainstream reference service.

5|$|The NTSB {{added that}} {{the design of the}} Embraer's {{avionics}} is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by the flight crew. The NTSB noted:Using only static <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> to indicate a loss of collision avoidance system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots' attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.|$|E

50|$|Making a <b>text</b> <b>message</b> {{donation}} involves {{sending a}} <b>text</b> <b>message</b> with a keyword chosen by {{a nonprofit organization}} to a shortcode approved by The mGive Foundation. For example, Keep a Child Alive’s <b>text</b> <b>message</b> donation campaign uses the keyword ALIVE and the mobile giving shortcode 90999. <b>Text</b> <b>message</b> donations (SMS) use premium-rated short messages (PSMS) to bill donations to the wireless subscriber’s phone bill. SMS donations use a double opt-in process to protect donor’s security and privacy. Currently, The mGive Foundation and wireless carriers have approved $5 and $10 one-time <b>text</b> <b>message</b> donations.|$|R
5|$|In February 2012, Legacy Recordings {{signed a}} deal with Nelson that {{included}} the release of new material, as well as past releases that would be selected and complemented with outtakes and other material selected by him. With the new deal, Buddy Cannon returned to produce the recordings of Nelson. After selecting the material {{and the sound of}} the tunes with the singer, Cannon's work method consisted in the recording of the tracks with studio musicians, with the takes later completed on a separate session by Nelson with his guitar. Cannon's association to Nelson also extended to songwriting, with singer and producer composing the lyrics by exchanging <b>text</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{had become}} {{suspicious}} {{as to whether}} Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that {{the owner of the}} phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.|$|E
5|$|On June21, {{officials}} in China closed Xiamen port {{and stated that}} it would resume operations once the storm passed. Later that day 33,000 vessels sought refuge at port. Following the issuance of a land warning, government offices and schools were closed throughout the island. Officials sent 10 million <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> to residents throughout Fujian Province to warn them about the approaching storm. In Hong Kong, public warning signal number one was raised for nearly 24hours as Linfa briefly threatened the city on June20. Officials also evacuated roughly 160,000 people from coastal areas in Fujian. A total of 167 flights to and from Taiwan were canceled or delayed due to the storm.|$|E

40|$|<b>Text</b> <b>message</b> {{reminders}} {{have proven}} effective for positive behavioral changes in medicine, but {{their influence on}} oral hygiene compliance has never been tested. This study aimed to determine if <b>text</b> <b>message</b> reminders about oral hygiene have an influence {{on the level of}} compliance. In this prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, 42 orthodontic patients were assigned to a <b>text</b> <b>message</b> or control group. Parents of patients assigned to the <b>text</b> <b>message</b> group received a reminder <b>text</b> <b>message</b> one weekday each week. Oral hygiene compliance was measured using bleeding index, modified gingival index, plaque index, and visual examination of white spot lesion development at baseline (T 0), two appointments after baseline (T 1), and four appointments after baseline (T 2). Bleeding index, modified gingival index, and plaque index scores were significantly lower in the <b>text</b> <b>message</b> group than the control group at T 2. A <b>text</b> <b>message</b> reminder system is effective for improving oral hygiene compliance in orthodontic patients...|$|R

5|$|Payment is {{virtually}} always the goal, {{and the victim}} is coerced into paying for the ransomware to be removed—which {{may or may not}} actually occur—either by supplying a program that can decrypt the files, or by sending an unlock code that undoes the payload's changes. A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate <b>text</b> <b>messages,</b> pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> and phone conversations.|$|E

5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available to make that sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent <b>text</b> <b>messages</b> with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{diagnose}} hypertension, multiple {{blood pressure}} (BP) measurements are recommended. We randomized patients into three groups: EMR–only (patients recorded BP measurements in an {{electronic medical record}} [EMR] web portal), EMR + reminders (patients were sent <b>text</b> <b>message</b> reminders to record their BP measurements in the EMR), and bi–directional <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> (patients were sent a <b>text</b> <b>message</b> asking them to respond with their current BP).

40|$|<b>Text</b> <b>messaging</b> {{has been}} {{exploited}} for supporting learning {{in a variety of}} educational settings. However, evidence for its effectiveness and impact is limited. This chapter demonstrates how the use of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> can contribute towards enhanced quality of learning. In particular the chapter focuses on the use of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> as a means of improving immediacy between instructors and students in third-level education. Immediacy is defined as behaviour which increases psychological closeness between communicators. The results of research in instructional communication suggest that improved immediacy leads to more positive studentinstructor relationships engendering positive attitudes, increased interest and motivation by students as well as improved attendance, improved retention, improved student engagement and improved learning. This chapter outlines a theoretical basis for the effect of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> on instructor-student relationships, provides empirical evidence for the impact of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> on immediacy and discusses the integration of <b>text</b> <b>messaging</b> for improving immediacy in Multiplatform E-Learning Systems.
