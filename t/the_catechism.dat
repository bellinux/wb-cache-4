40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to analyse and compare pneumatology in Eftertanke in Kyrkans Tidning, in a Swedish evangelical Lutheran context, with pneumatology in Luthers Small Catechism and Luther's Large Catechism. Through a descriptive, {{inductive}} and hermenutical approach the essay intends to answer two main questions regarding how these sources 1) describe the character features and 2) {{the function of the}} Spirit.   The conclusions of this essay show that the character features of the Spirit in Eftertanke differ from <b>the</b> <b>catechisms</b> in describing <b>the</b> Spirit with words connected to nature and life, while <b>the</b> <b>catechisms</b> only describe <b>the</b> Spirit as holy. The discussion that follows implies that the Spirit in <b>the</b> <b>catechisms</b> is depicted as more personal whereas Eftertanke depicts the Spirit more as an impersonal force. There are similarities in how both <b>the</b> <b>catechisms</b> and Eftertanke depict a dialectic relationship between human beings and the Spirit. However, they differ in function: in Eftertanke the Spirit is foremost a giver of life and a creator of positive emotions as well as a giver of guidance, while in <b>the</b> <b>catechisms</b> <b>the</b> Spirit is foremost a sanctifier. There are also dissimilarities in how <b>the</b> <b>catechisms</b> emphasize that <b>the</b> Spirit works through the word, the church and the sacraments, while this is barely mentioned in Eftertanke. Eftertanke on the other hand emphasizes a more panentheistic function of the Spirit in the world. ...|$|R
5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of {{the foundational}} documents for reformed churches, including documents on <b>the</b> <b>catechism,</b> the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to unite the churches. In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E
5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children.

5|$|At {{the close}} of the 19th century the Catholic church in the Indies began {{targeting}} the majority-Muslim indigenous population. They were not alone; Protestant missionaries such as Sierk Coolsma of the Netherlands Missionary Union and Mattheus Teffer of the Netherlands Missionary Society had had some success with the Sundanese in Cianjur and Javanese in Ambarawa, respectively. Keijzer, before stepping down as head pastor in 1894, {{sent a letter to the}} Netherlands asking that men be sent to learn the Javanese language, in order to enable them to preach to the people and translate <b>the</b> <b>catechism</b> and some prayer books.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly {{had already}} done {{significant}} work on a catechism between December 1643 and January 1647 containing fifty-five questions, before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one. <b>The</b> Larger <b>Catechism</b> was intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. <b>The</b> Shorter <b>Catechism</b> was based on <b>the</b> Larger <b>Catechism</b> but intended for use in teaching the faith to children.

5|$|Church {{belief in}} {{the resurrection of the}} body led to a {{prohibition}} against cremation that was pastorally modified at the Second Vatican Council in the 1960s under limited circumstances, but those conditions have been largely ignored even by the clergy. According to <b>the</b> <b>Catechism,</b> burial of the dead is a corporal work of mercy that must treat the body with respect and love (e.g. scattering of cremated remains, burial in an unmarked grave, etc. are forbidden in the Catholic Church). Organ donation after death and organ transplants under certain terms, also autopsies for legal and scientific reasons are permitted.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after them properly. Thus, the Gurkar system came into existence. Gurkars were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted with the social and religious supervision of the community. After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers. Every farmer practised carpentry, but it was quite primitive and unskilled, and other crafts and industries were non-existent. The mass was celebrated in Latin; but the sermon, <b>the</b> <b>catechism,</b> and the explication of the mysteries were delivered to the congregation in Konkani.|$|E
5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to <b>the</b> <b>Catechism</b> of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and {{serve as the basis for}} Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} between Calvin’s Catechism of 1545 and <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Catechism</b> on their exposition of the Lord’s Prayer Several {{studies on the}} relationship between Calvin’s <b>Catechism</b> (1545) and <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Catechism</b> have already been conducted. However, the need for a study of a {{comparison between}} <b>the</b> two <b>catechisms</b> on <b>the</b> Lord’s Prayer was emphasised at the South African Calvin Research Conference in 2004. In the sixteenth century Reformation the Lord’s Prayer was a subject of considerable importance. Calvin wrote no less than eight different expositions of the Lord’s Prayer in his commentaries, catechisms of 1538 and 1545 and the different editions of his “Institutes”. In both <b>the</b> Geneva <b>Catechism</b> of 1542 / 1545 and <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Catechism</b> <b>the</b> exposition of the Lord’s Prayer forms an important part. A comparison of these expositions leads {{to the conclusion that the}} theological insights of John Calvin played a major role in the formulation of <b>the</b> Heidelberg <b>Catechism.</b> <b>The</b> Heidelberg <b>Catechism</b> is part of our Calvinist heritage and should still be used in the instruction of our children and confessed as our true and living faith.

5|$|After the child's {{father was}} allowed to visit him during August and September 1858, two starkly {{different}} narratives emerged—one told of a boy who wanted {{to return to his}} family and the faith of his ancestors, while the other described a child who had learned <b>the</b> <b>catechism</b> perfectly and wanted his parents to become Christians as well. International protests mounted, but the Pope would not be moved. After pontifical rule in Bologna ended in 1859, Father Feletti was prosecuted for his role in Mortara's seizure, but was acquitted when the court decided he had simply followed orders. With the Pope as a substitute father, Mortara trained for the priesthood in Rome until the Kingdom of Italy captured the city in 1870, ending the Papal States. Leaving the country, he was ordained in France three years later at the age of 21. Father Mortara {{spent most of his life}} outside Italy and died in Belgium in 1940, aged 88.|$|E
5|$|In 1549, Day {{opened a}} new shop in Cheapside, and the next year, he and Seres were {{successful}} enough to amicably separate their businesses. Day set up his new home and printing establishment at Aldersgate in the parish of St Anne and St Agnes and transferred from the Stringers' to the Stationers' Company. Day found Aldersgate's foreigner-friendly attributes helpful in attracting skilled Dutch workers, whom he relied on throughout his career. He soon {{established himself as a}} quality printer, and in 1551, he reprinted an elaborate edition of the Bible that he had previously produced with Seres. The next year, he secured a valuable patent to print the works of John Ponet and Thomas Beccon. This enraged one of his competitors, Reginald Wolfe, who already held a patent to print Ponet's Catechism in Latin. Eventually, a compromise patent was issued which allowed Wolfe to continue printing <b>the</b> <b>Catechism</b> in Latin and Day to print the work in English. Day reaped more benefits from the deal than Wolfe: the English printings were used far more extensively than the Latin ones, and the ABC was eventually appended with Ponet's Catechism.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand <b>the</b> <b>catechism</b> and even {{to be able to}} independently read the Bible, but most commentators of the period, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Girls were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, such as Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E

40|$|THE CATECHISMS OF MICHAEL CHONIATES. DATING AND HISTORICAL APPROACH    <b>The</b> <b>Catechisms</b> of Michael Choniates, {{archbishop}} of Athens, {{are included in}} Spyridon Lampros’ Archive, who first studied the sources in 1906 and transcribed the texts from the manuscript Mosquensis Synodalis 218 (olim 230) and 219 (olim 262). Although he prepared a critical edition, he did not proceed with publishing. Eventually, his work has been digitized and the researcher can visit the Archive online through the website of the Laboratory of Digital Recording of the Public and Private Life of the Byzantines of the University of Athens ([URL] lamprosarcheio. arch. uoa. gr).    <b>The</b> <b>Catechisms</b> are mainly, yet not exclusively, works of religious ethics; they also address the socioeconomic issues {{of the city of}} Athens {{at the end of the}} 12 th century, and thus can be used as a supplementary source for this period. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>Catechisms</b> offer a comprehensive account of the burdens endured by the Athenians, caused by the exploitative activities of state tax officers, usurers and pirates. On a different perspective, Choniates argues how adverse social conditions, such as poverty, immigration, and land tresspassing, modulate the social fabric and interpersonal relations.
