5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{from the}} Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian land mammal age, around 15–16 mya.

Other eomyids found at Eastgate include species of Leptodontomys and Pseudotheridomys.|$|E

40|$|With {{incidents}} of domestic abuse increasing and funding {{to battle the}} problem dwindling, peer-education projects like kNOw More (Know Your Limits _ No Abuse) have become increasingly important. <b>The</b> <b>kNOw</b> More program trains {{high school students to}} deliver emotional presentations about teen relationship abuse to their classmates. This study evaluates how effectively this program educates teenagers about relationship abuse and how to get help. Pre- and post-presentation data were collected from 301 teenagers who received <b>the</b> <b>kNOw</b> More presentation at schools. It was hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>kNOw</b> More program would (a) increase understanding of relationship abuse and (b) increase understanding of how to seek help for relationship abuse. A series of dependent- samples t-tests indicated that <b>the</b> <b>kNOw</b> More presentation did indeed increase teenagers?? understanding of relationship abuse and understanding of how to seek help, although effect sizes were small. Open-ended questions also indicated that participants absorbed the information presented by <b>the</b> <b>kNOw</b> More peer educators...|$|R
