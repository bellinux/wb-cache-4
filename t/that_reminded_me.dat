500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|Those reviewers who {{singled out}} the show's final segment, set after {{the return to}} Ohio, did so with compliments. Poniewozik wrote that the episode [...] "did a really fine job {{handling}} its epilogue, in which New Directions had their hopes crushed, went back to Lima—and {{found that it was}} a pretty awesome experience regardless. Brittany connected with Santana, a brief scene <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> how far both characters have come this season. Kurt didn't get a championship, but he has Blaine, and he has a taste of what life can be like for him after graduation." [...] Canning said it was a [...] "nice denouement, putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year." [...] Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene—in the epilogue with Santana—and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout. He concluded, [...] "She's the M.V.P. of the night and possibly the season." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some critics {{compared}} {{the film to}} Hayao Miyazaki's works such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. www.movies.ie called it [...] "a unique animated movie...beautifully made...has a magical other-worldly feel, with a script and visuals <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Hayao Miyazaki's movies (Spirited Away, etc.)...puts other 3D movies with bigger budgets to shame". Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "it pays homage to Celtic culture and design, together with techniques and motifs that evoke Matisse, Miyazaki and the minimalist cartoons of UPA".|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} was mostly very well received by media {{for a variety}} of reasons. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield named Meryl as his favourite character for being [...] "a hottie, plain and simple" [...] and [...] "a cute redheaded soldier with a tough-girl attitude and a husky voice." [...] She was the first [...] "gaming crush" [...] of GamesRadar's David Meikleham, who commented: [...] "This mangled mess of fugly 32-bit polygons and even fuglier textures was the equivalent of sex on a CD back in 1999. Sexy, sassy and with a strength <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Ellen Ripley, Meryl was a true pioneer for strong female gaming characters in a time when Lara Croft was a role model for lower back pain." [...] Similarly, Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com placed her {{on the top of his}} 2010 list of [...] "video game crushes". Hanuman Welch of Complex ranked Meryl and Otacon ex equo at fourth place on his 2013 list of video game sidekicks that deserve their own titles.|$|E

6000|$|The {{bystanders}} surged {{to and fro}} {{about the}} speakers in a manner <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of corraled cattle; others hurried towards them, and our broker's voice rang out: [...] "I'll trade with you at two dollars better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, Captain Wallingford," [...] cut in Jane, {{at one of}} Sarah's {{breathing}} intervals, <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> strongly of the colloquial Frenchman's [...] "s'il crache il est perdu," [...] "You {{know something}} of poor Mrs. Bradfort, I believe?" ...|$|E

60|$|The head of {{the valley}} had that half-tamed, ancient aspect <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the Romans. I could only expect the Roman legions to be encamped down there; and the white goats feeding on the bushes belonged to a Roman camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't till Steve said {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> then it burst upon me, in one awful shock, that I'd gone and left you, {{and you might}} have knocked me down with a feather," [...] said honest Mac, hiding none of his iniquity.|$|E
6000|$|To Clemantiny {{she added}} in a low, gentle tone, [...] "There's a {{look on his face}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Johnny. It came out so strong when he sat up just now that it made me feel like crying. Don't you notice it, Clemantiny?" ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{from behind}} the throne there {{appeared}} a gorgeous gentleman arrayed in a head-dress <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> faintly of a bishop's mitre, and wearing over his robes a breastplate of precious stones roughly polished, which was half hidden by a very long white beard.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You!' she says, {{with a smile}} <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{of lemon}} sherbet. I was waiting up-stairs in the slosh, then, and I was right down here by the door, putting some vinegar and cayenne into an empty bottle of tabasco, and I heard all they said.|$|E
60|$|The robber again paused with agitation. I sat musing {{upon his}} last Frightful words, which proved to what excess the passions may be carried when escaped from all moral restraint. There {{was a horrible}} verity in this story <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> {{of some of the}} tragic fictions of Danté.|$|E
60|$|And <b>that</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a {{distinction}} you suggest between Ossian and Homer. I fashion {{it in this}} way: Homer sometimes nods, but Ossian makes his readers nod.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Parker {{ordered a}} {{somewhat}} extensive dinner. Throughout the meal {{we listened to}} a series of adventures in which the hero was always Mr. Moss. We heard of wonderful hauls and wonderful escapes; detectives outwitted-- exploits <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> more of the motor bandits of Paris than of our own sober capital.|$|E
6000|$|He slipped round it, {{making a}} wide circle {{with his usual}} caution, then, seeing the snake which was, by the way, I think, the biggest immamba I ever killed, {{suddenly}} froze, as it were, in a stiff attitude <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of a pointer when it scents game. Having made {{sure that it was}} dead, he nodded and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No harm {{in looking}} at a pretty woman, you know. I'm a {{bachelor}} still, thank the Lord! <b>That</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a funny story I heard at the club." ...|$|R
