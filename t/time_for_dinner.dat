500|$|He {{promoted}} aggressive {{measures against}} the insurgents, {{and in so}} doing, he also sought to raise his own political profile. Clad in immaculately tailored battledress, he would fly by helicopter to a beleaguered army outpost; wearing dark glasses and sporting a swagger stick, deliver a rousing speech {{for the benefit of}} the troops and the TV cameras – then return to Salisbury in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> He drew heavily on Winston Churchill's oratory style for some of his inspiring speeches. As Minister of Defence, Van der Byl was known to join army counter-insurgency operations while armed with a hunting rifle (with the words [...] "I'd like to bag one of these chaps ..."), and would regularly visit army positions and entertain the troops with his own generous supply of [...] "scotch whisky and fine wines." [...] Such behaviour endeared him to many in Rhodesia: he was far more popular with the troops than his predecessor as Minister of Defence, Jack Howman. However, this popularity did not extend to senior members of the South African and Rhodesian governments.|$|E
500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> Which is pretty unrealistic, but it’s what kids can do on the internet now. They can talk to somebody anywhere".|$|E

2500|$|The society met at Covent Garden {{until the}} fire of 1808, when it moved first to the Bedford Coffee House, and thence the {{following}} year to the Old Lyceum Theatre. [...] On the burning of the Lyceum in 1830, [...] "The Steaks" [...] met again in the Bedford Coffee House until 1838, when the Lyceum reopened, and a large room there was allotted to the club. These meetings were held till the society ceased to exist in 1867. Its decline in its last twenty or so years was due to changing fashion: many of its members were no longer free on Saturdays, being either engaged in events in London's social season or else away from London at weekends, something much encouraged by the opening of railways. The customary <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner</b> had also changed. The society moved its dinner time from 4.00 p.m. in 1808, to 6.00 p.m. in 1833 and to 7.00 p.m. in 1861, and finally to 8.00 p.m. in 1866, but the change inconvenienced the members who preferred the old timing and did not attract new members. Moreover, in Victorian England, its Georgian heartiness and ritual, and old-fashioned uniform, no longer appealed. By 1867 the society had only eighteen members, and the average attendance at dinners had dwindled to two. The club was wound up in 1867, and its assets were auctioned at Christie's, raising a little over £600.|$|E

60|$|In {{the mean}} time Herbert {{spent the whole}} day over at Desmond Court, or at Clady. He found the countess delighted to see him, and both she and Lady Clara went on with him to Clady.

60|$|Alan did {{not come}} until it was <b>time</b> to dress <b>for</b> <b>dinner,</b> <b>for</b> he knew that Barbara would not appear before that meal, {{and it was her}} society he sought, not that of his host or fellow guests.

60|$|There {{had been}} some talk of their dining at Gortnaclough, because it was known that the ladies at Desmond Court dined early; but now that Clara was to return to Castle Richmond, that idea was given up, and they all {{got back to the}} house in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the family <b>dinner.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mary Louise {{unpacked}} Gran'pa Jim's trunk {{first and}} put his room in [...] "apple-pie order," [...] as Aunt Polly admiringly asserted.

60|$|I {{was burning}} to get away, {{for it was}} already {{doubtful}} if I should be in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> But {{there was something about}} the old man's honest air of bitterness that seemed to open to me the possibilities of life larger and more tragic than my own.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they were}} installed, Fleur asked suddenly: [...] "Are you {{going back to}} Robin Hill? I should like to see where you live, Jon. I'm staying with my aunt for the night, but I could get back in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> I wouldn't come to the house, of course." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was five}} o'clock {{when they reached}} the Abbey, so that there were two hours to be spent before it was <b>time</b> to dress <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b> When she had taken off her things Stella went {{straight}} to her father's room to give him his tea. By now Mr. Fregelius was much better, although the nature of his injuries made it imperative that he should still stay in bed.|$|R
6000|$|Having {{expressed}} his readiness to assist [...] "the experiment" [...] {{in every possible}} way, Father Benwell still lingered in the library.

60|$|Dorothea trembled {{while she}} read this letter; then she fell on her knees, buried her face, and sobbed.

She remained in that attitude till it was <b>time</b> to dress <b>for</b> <b>dinner.</b>|$|R
