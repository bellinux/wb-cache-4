5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> use until 1862, when the city of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E
5|$|Sports journalism expert Kimberly Bissell {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} camera angles used during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games beach volleyball games. Bissell found that 20% of the camera angles were focused on the women's chests, and 17% on their buttocks. Bissell theorized that the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> athleticism.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{directed}} {{the circuit court}} for the District of New Jersey to grant Jackalow a new trial. The Court held that, while the trial court should determine {{the description of the}} boundaries of New York and Connecticut, the ascertainment of <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> boundaries, and the application of those boundaries to the crime in question, should have been a question of fact for the jury. Jackalow was not retried and was released.|$|E
5|$|There are 37,000 known {{species in}} Croatia, but <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> number is {{estimated}} to be between 50,000 and 100,000. The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia {{in the first half of}} the 2000s (decade) alone. There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication with the outside world. Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research. He was studying {{the relationship between}} the spectral classification of stars and <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> brightness as corrected for distance—their absolute magnitude. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Paid {{promotion}} largely {{followed this}} pattern, as the HDZ and the SDP were two dominant parties {{in that field}} as well. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted in its report that the largest parties reported their advertising spending below <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> value, and the largest proportion of expenditure was for television ads. Election silence is in force {{on the day of}} the elections and the previous day, ending at 7 in the evening as polling stations close and exit polls may be published after that time.|$|E

40|$|The 2004 ocean {{population}} {{abundance of}} fall chinook salmon from the Rogue River {{is predicted to}} be 80 % of that in 2003 and 85 % of that in 2002. However, the 2004 abundance is predicted {{to be higher than}} the abundance observed in any other prior year back through 1989. Relative to the base period used in scaling the Klamath Ocean Harvest Model (1986 - 2003), the prediction for 2004 is 2. 4 -times the average of the estimated actual abundance during this 18 -year period; ranging from 24 % of <b>their</b> estimated <b>actual</b> abundance in 1987 to 582 % of <b>their</b> estimated <b>actual</b> abundance in 1999...|$|R
5|$|The filming {{was done}} at two hospitals, the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. This {{presented}} a problem because the show had to work around the real-life hospitals, with <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> doctors, patients and emergency situations. In one scene in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting squash balls behind him, and nearly hit a patient. However, some scenes, {{such as those in}} Sue's and Alan's offices, were filmed in a studio.|$|E
5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who considered themselves to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{is divided into}} an upper part depicting the halo phenomenon viewed vertically and a lower part depicting the city as it must have appeared viewed from Södermalm in the late Middle Ages. The medieval urban conglomeration, today {{part of the old}} town Gamla stan, is rendered using a bird's-eye view. The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.|$|E

5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{also seems}} to have {{suffered}} an official plundering during the virtual civil war, which started {{during the reign of}} Ramesses XI. The tombs were opened, all the valuables were removed, and the mummies were collected into two large caches. One in the tomb of Amenhotep II, contained sixteen, and others were hidden within Amenhotep I's tomb. A few years later most of them were moved to the Deir el-Bahri cache, containing no fewer than forty royal mummies and their coffins. Only tombs whose locations were lost (KV62, KV63 and KV46, although both KV62 and KV46 were robbed soon after <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> closure) were undisturbed during this period.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E

5|$|Although the Germans {{were still}} on the {{offensive}} in late July 1918, the Allied armies were growing in strength, as more American units arrived in France, and British reinforcements were transferred from the Home Army in Britain and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The German commanders realized in early August that their forces might be forced onto the defensive, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. The Germans believed the French would probably attack the Saint-Mihiel front east of Rheims, or in Flanders near Mount Kemmel, while they believed the British would attack along either the Lys or near Albert. The Allies had indeed mounted a number of local counter-offensives in these sectors, both to gain local objectives to improve their defensive positions and to distract attention from the Amiens sector. German forces began to withdraw from the Lys and other fronts in response to these theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, moving troops only at night, and feigning movements during the day to mask <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> intent.|$|E
5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} planation surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Maya stelae (singular stela) are monuments {{that were}} {{fashioned}} by the Maya civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. They consist of tall, sculpted stone shafts {{and are often}} associated with low circular stones referred to as altars, although <b>their</b> <b>actual</b> function is uncertain. Many stelae were sculpted in low relief, although plain monuments are found throughout the Maya region. The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the Classic Period (250–900 AD), and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization. The earliest dated stela to {{have been found in}} situ in the Maya lowlands was recovered from the great city of Tikal in Guatemala. During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.|$|E
