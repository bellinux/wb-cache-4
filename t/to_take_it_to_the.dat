Cedric gives Harry a tip on the egg, telling him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prefects' bathroom, but Harry refuses to listen, jealous over Cho.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it {{out of the water and}} returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

En route, T'Pol and T'Pau discuss the taboo of mind-melds, and T'Pau offers to mind-meld with T'Pol. She states the meld is safe when performed by those {{trained in the}} art, and that Pa'nar Syndrome is merely the by-product of an improperly conducted meld. The trio are then attacked by Major Talok and Vulcan commandos, and T'Pol is captured while the others escape. She tells her captors that they are headed to Mount Seleya in order to mislead them from their true destination.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Colnett arrived at Nootka Sound the Princess Royal had sailed to San Blas, {{arriving}} there about 13 November 1790. Therefore, {{it could not}} be returned to Colnett as required by the Nootka Conventions. The governments of Spain and Britain agreed that the vessel would be returned to its owners in Macau. Manuel Quimper sailed it from San Blas to the Philippines, stopping at Hawaii on the way. Another Spanish officer was to take the vessel from the Philippines to Macau. Meanwhile, Colnett, having finished trading on the North West coast also sailed to China via Hawaii. By chance both Colnett and Quimper arrived at Hawaii in March 1791. The two met. Colnett demanded that the Princess Royal be turned over at once, while Quimper explained his orders were <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines. Colnett became angry and prepared to seize the ship by force. The quarrel was calmed by John Kendrick Jr. (sometimes known as Juan Kendrick) who had come to Nootka in 1788 aboard the Columbia Rediviva with his father John Kendrick, entered Spanish service as a pilot, and was now on board the Princess Royal. Quimper slipped away at a convenient time and sailed to Manila, arriving in June.|$|E

500|$|On 11April, {{opposition}} protesters {{begin their}} march outside PDVSA's headquarters in Caracas; Chávez's supporters gather outside the presidential palace. The protest route is changed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> palace; shots ring out and civilians are killed. The private media blames Chávez's supporters, citing footage that shows them shooting at opposition protesters from a bridge. The narration states, [...] "What the TV stations didn't broadcast was , which {{clearly shows that}} the streets below were empty. The opposition march had never taken that route." [...] Later, the state television signal is cut; rumors circulate that the opposition {{has taken over the}} studio. At the palace, members of the military high command demand Chávez's resignation, threatening to bomb the building. The president refuses to resign, but submits to their custody. He is led away, and Carmona announces on television that a transitional government will be established.|$|E
500|$|While at the Times, Dunne {{may have}} made his first {{experiments}} in Irish dialect: an anonymous police reform series published in January 1889. [...] "Officer Quinn and his Friends" [...] features an Irish-American policeman who digs up a suspicious footprint in the snow. Quinn means <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station but is sidetracked at a saloon, emerging several hours later to find the evidence melted. The writer of the Quinn pieces uses unneeded Irishisms, and his spelling is often awkward. When Dunne took a new job with the Tribune later in 1889, the use of Irish dialect in stories followed him; one account of a conversation between two Irish-American members {{of the city council}} is rendered as they would have spoken it. He first signed his name to Irish dialect pieces {{in the second half of}} 1890, in a series about real-life Colonel Thomas Jefferson Dolan, a small-time Democratic hanger-on. The series, which ended when Dunne left for the Chicago Herald in late 1890, [...] contains elements of the Dooley stories, including mostly being told from a single perspective (an alter ego for Dunne), as well as painting a detailed portrait of the Irish-American scene. [...] By then, Dunne had polished his use of Irish dialect.|$|E
500|$|Hajime Isayama {{created a}} 65-page {{one-shot}} version of Attack on Titan in 2006. Originally, he also offered {{his work to}} the Weekly Shōnen Jump department at Shueisha, where he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for Jump. He declined and instead decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Weekly Shōnen Magazine department at Kodansha. Before serialization began in 2009, he had already thought of ideas for twists, although they are fleshed out as the series progresses. The author initially based the scenery in the manga on that of his hometown, which is surrounded by mountains. While working at an internet cafe, Isayama encountered a customer who {{grabbed him by the}} collar. It was this incident that showed him [...] "the fear of meeting a person I can't communicate with," [...] which is the feeling that he conveys through the Titans. When designing the appearances of the Titans, he uses several models such as martial artist Yushin Okami for Eren Yeager's Titan form as well as Brock Lesnar for the Armored Titan. George Wada, the anime's producer, stated that the [...] "Wall of Fear" [...] was influenced by the isolated and enclosed nature of Japanese culture. He also said that the inner feelings of every individual is one of the series' main influences. Isayama later would confirm that Attack on Titan was inspired in part by Muv-Luv Alternative, the second visual novel in the Muv-Luv visual novel series.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of Gowron on screen, O'Reilly {{continued}} to attend Star Trek conventions in character, often appearing on stage alongside J.G. Hertzler as Martok. One of their trademarks is a song about Klingons, and O'Reilly has had a Bat'leth created {{to look like a}} stringed guitar. He explained in an interview that [...] "We love doing Klingons. For me, it was a dream come true, it was nice to come back to it. And the fans just love it. We tried it once and the fans just went crazy." [...] The pair debuted the in-makeup appearances at a convention in the late 2000s in Germany, and after generating the longest photo op queue at the event, they decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage. Larry Nemecek praised their convention appearances, saying [...] "They are fan favourites because they are big, gregarious guys. They slap people on the back. They have a good time. They tease people back. They do it for the audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1791 Quimper took Princesa Real {{on another}} attempt to {{return it to the}} British. He sailed the vessel from San Blas to the Philippines, {{stopping}} at Hawaii on the way. Another Spanish captain would take the ship from the Philippines to China, as the Spanish and British governments had agreed that the ship would be returned to its owners in Macau. It turned out that James Colnett arrived in Hawaii in March 1791, just as Quimper was arriving. The two met. Colnett demanded that Princess Royal be turned over at once, while Quimper explained his orders were <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines.

By {{the end of the year}} Princess Royal had been taken to Macau, but the ship was in such poor condition upon arrival that the British agents refused to accept it.
