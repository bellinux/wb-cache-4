2500|$|Anthony {{was born}} in Coma in Lower Egypt in 251 to wealthy {{landowner}} parents. When he was about 18 years old, his parents died and left him with the care of his unmarried sister. Shortly thereafter, he decided to follow <b>the</b> Evangelical <b>counsel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> which reads, [...] "If {{you want to be}} perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven." [...] Anthony gave away some of his family's lands to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, and donated the funds thus raised to the poor. He then left to live an ascetic life, placing his sister with a group of Christian virgins, a sort of proto-convent.|$|R
