5|$|In 2003, Ludwick {{appeared}} as the character Yumi in thirteen, an autobiographical drama film based on American film actress Nikki Reed's {{experiences as a}} 12 and 13-year-old girl. In 2004, Ludwick appeared on Movie Surfers, a Disney Channel mini-show where four teenagers go behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> report on Walt Disney-related films. Three years later in June 2007, Ludwick began work on Teen Witch the Musical, a stage musical based on the 1989 fantasy-comedy film Teen Witch.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes.</b> <b>To</b> fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E
50|$|Whereas in a {{pinhole camera}} the hole allows rays {{of light from}} {{different}} parts of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> reach different parts of the film, the obstruction in the pinspeck camera causes the shadow of different points in <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> fall on different points on the film. The result is a negative image.|$|R

5|$|Upon release, an Islamic group protested {{against the}} film, {{claiming}} that it portrayed Muslims as terrorists and traitors. Murugadoss, S. Thanu and Vijay's father S. A. Chandrasekhar later tendered an open apology to representatives of 23 different Muslim outfits, {{and agreed to}} delete <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> which objections were raised, after activists had gathered near Vijay's residence at Neelankarai and raised slogans against him and the film in Arabic and Urdu.|$|E
5|$|Welles hired Bernard Herrmann {{to compose}} the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in {{as few as}} {{two or three weeks}} after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had {{sufficient}} time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> match their length.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking {{near the bottom of}} the screen may result in a jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without any explanation. A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said {{that they did not know}} what had happened to the original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, Frank is shot by Lucas Goodwin, in an {{assassination}} attempt, and {{falls into a}} coma. While Frank is in surgery, Claire helps guide Frank's vice president Donald Blythe through a diplomatic crisis with Russia. While Frank is receiving a liver transplant, she declines {{going to the hospital}} in favor of negotiating a treaty with Petrov, and strong-arms him into accepting the U.S.' terms. When Frank recovers from surgery, he agrees to let Claire be his vice president. He and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill {{for the sole purpose of}} creating an atmosphere divisive enough to pick off the potential running mates. In the ensuing open convention, they publicly endorse Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson) for the job, while working behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> undermine her and ensure that Claire wins enough delegates to be nominated. Meanwhile, she reluctantly honors her mother's request to help her die. She and Frank then use the public sympathy from Elizabeth's death to win the nomination; they are now running mates.|$|E
5|$|When he returns, Moody {{takes him}} to his office, and reveals himself to be Voldemort's 'faithful servant'; {{he was the one}} who put Harry's name into the Goblet of Fire, and has been guiding him through the tournament from behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> ensure that he would grab the Portkey first. Before Moody can kill Harry, Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape intervene. They learn that Moody is in fact Barty Crouch Jr., Mr. Crouch's son, {{disguised}} by Polyjuice Potion. Crouch had sentenced Crouch Jr. to life imprisonment in Azkaban over alleged ties to the Death Eaters but smuggled him out as a last favour to his dying wife. Crouch Jr. was the one who set off the Dark Mark at the Quidditch World Cup, doing it to scare the Death Eaters he felt had abandoned Voldemort. Eventually, Voldemort had gotten in contact with Crouch Jr. and had him impersonate Moody as part of his plan. Crouch Jr. also admits to killing Crouch Sr., to prevent him telling Dumbledore about Voldemort. The real Moody is found inside Crouch Jr.'s enchanted trunk and rescued. Harry is then declared the winner of the Triwizard Tournament and given his winnings.|$|E

25|$|Woll was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of craft unionism. During the debates over the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Woll portrayed himself as a conciliator and mediator, but worked behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> undercut Mine Workers president John L. Lewis and other proponents of industrial unionism.|$|E

50|$|In {{photography}} and cinematography, a wide-angle lens {{refers to a}} lens whose focal length is substantially smaller than the focal length of a normal lens for a given film plane. This type of lens allows more of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> {{be included in the}} photograph, which is useful in architectural, interior and landscape photography where the photographer {{may not be able to}} move farther from <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> photograph it.|$|R

25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{strengthen}} {{their relationship with the}} Iroquois Nation, the British organized the Albany Congress from June 19 to July 11, which Timothy attended, working behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> secure the Susquehanna purchase for Connecticut. However, this purchase was disputed, and Chief Hendrick gave the same land to Pennsylvania, which resulted in an ongoing dispute for many years.|$|E
25|$|Continuing on May 15, Romney won the {{primaries}} in Oregon and Nebraska with Paul second in Oregon and Santorum second in Nebraska. On May 22, Romney swept Kentucky and Arkansas primaries. He {{claimed to have}} exceeded the nominating threshold in Texas, May 29. In fourth, Ron Paul worked behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> secure delegates in local caucuses following state primary elections. He later surpassed Gingrich, but not Santorum, behind front-runner Romney.|$|E

50|$|In the inbetweening {{workflow}} {{of traditional}} hand-drawn animation, the senior or key artist would draw the keyframes which define the movement, then, after testing and {{approval of the}} rough animation, would hand over <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> their assistant. <b>The</b> assistant does the clean-up and the necessary inbetweens, or, in large studios, only some breakdowns which define the movement in more detail, before handing down <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> their assistant, <b>the</b> inbetweener, who does the rest.|$|R
50|$|The infamous {{night vision}} {{sequence}} {{was actually a}} re-shot version of <b>the</b> <b>scene.</b> After realizing that they shot the original version of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> look too dark, filmmakers had to return and re-shoot the entire sequence, delaying the movie's release for six months. But due to the budget issues this scene couldn't be finished properly so {{it was decided to}} add green visual tint <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>to</b> make it look like it was night vision, even though it makes no sense for why would this scene would have that look.|$|R
25|$|The AA worked behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> avoid further bloodshed and {{defuse the}} tense situation. At 9:00a.m., {{outgoing}} AA international president William Weihe {{rushed to the}} sheriff's office and asked McCleary to convey a request to Frick to meet. McCleary did so, but Frick refused. He knew that the more chaotic the situation became, {{the more likely it}} was that Governor Robert E. Pattison would call out the state militia.|$|E

25|$|Diehl {{worked with}} Castle behind <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>to</b> move {{legislation}} forward despite the Treasury's {{opposition to the}} program. However, the Treasury suggested to Castle that the department should conduct a study to determine the feasibility of the program. With Diehl's advice, Castle accepted the Treasury's offer, and the agreement was codified in the United States Commemorative Coin Act of 1996. The act also authorized the secretary {{to proceed with the}} 50 States Quarters program without further congressional action if the results of the feasibility study were favorable.|$|E
