5|$|Wellington's Spanish liaison officer, Miguel Ricardo de Álava y Esquivel, {{was hit by}} a spent bullet {{during the}} advance. As Wellington was teasing Álava, he was knocked off his horse when a bullet-sized {{canister}} shot struck his sword hilt. In pain from a badly bruised hip, the British army commander remounted and continued to direct the battle. At this time, Soult realized that Hill's column might cut off his army from the Orthez to Sault-de-Navailles road. He ordered his army to retreat, covered by Villatte, Darmagnac, Rouget and Paris. At first, <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> withdrawal was conducted in good order, though it was closely followed by British horse artillery and infantry. Because they had to retreat on narrow paths and across country, the retreating French units became badly mixed and unit cohesion was lost. Fearful of capture, the retreating soldiers became more and more confused and demoralized.|$|E

He brought in Gerry Ingram, a tall centre-forward, from Hull City; Tom White from Crystal Palace; <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> Tommy Hutchison from Alloa Athletic; and the discovery of them all, Tony Green from Albion Rovers, who went on to fill the gap left by Alan Ball's departure twelve months earlier.|$|E

25|$|In {{his later}} years, Cokayne became closely allied to Sir Richard Vernon. The Vernon family were the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} of the Derbyshire gentry, with large and widely spread estates, more {{like those of the}} local nobility. Sir Richard Vernon was too powerful to be easily absorbed into one of the aristocratic affinities but not strong enough to stand entirely alone. Cokayne, in a similar position, negotiated <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> waters of politics in the king's minority alongside Vernon and often in close aliance with him. At the county's parliamentary election in 1432 he sealed the indenture returning Richard Vernon, Sir Richard's son, and {{at about the same time}} arranged the betrothal of his heir, John, to Vernon's daughter Anne.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the losses}} {{suffered}} by the Ju 88 at that time, however, a number were due to <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> behavior of the plane, especially {{when compared to the}} proven He 111, and to the crews' lack of experience on the type – many having converted to the Ju 88 only shortly before. Of the 39 losses recorded for July 1940, for example, only 20 were due to enemy action. The others being written off in training accidents, crashes, or malfunctions over the mainland Europe. A series of field modifications were made to make the Ju 88 less vulnerable, including the replacement of the single MG 15 rear machine gun by a twin-barreled MG 81Z machine gun and the fitting of additional cockpit armour.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{developed}} successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell {{fighters and}} scored {{a surprising number}} of aerial victories over a variety of German aircraft. Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and ruggedness contributed to their effectiveness. To pilots who had once flown <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid-engined aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft were used in the Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and northern Korea. In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F. Miroshnichenko from 17th IAP/190 IAD, shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa IJAAS fighter off the coast of North Korea.|$|E

25|$|Churchill {{received}} him in trademark fashion: in bed, {{wearing an}} embroidered dressing gown, smoking a cigar. He, Joseph Stalin, and Franklin D. Roosevelt had discussed {{the matter of}} Yugoslavia at a recent conference in Teheran, and had decided to give all possible support to the Partisans. This was the turning point. The Chetniks were given a task (a bridge to blow up) and a deadline, to show whether they could still be effective allies; they failed this test and supplies were re-directed from them to the Partisans. The British government was left with <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> political and moral problem of King Peter and his royalist government in exile. But the main issues were air supplies and air support, and to help co-ordinate this, Maclean's mission was expanded. Some of the new officers included Andrew Maxwell of the Scots Guards, John Clarke of the 2nd Scots Guards, Geoffrey Kup, a gunnery expert, Hilary King, a signals officer, Johnny Tregida, and, for a time, Randolph Churchill. Some of these were SAS or otherwise known from the Western Desert Campaign the previous year.|$|E

In conclusion, Rabin gave it a C grade rating. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student opined that the show's writing [...] "is still sharp– not 'as sharp as ever,' but sharp– {{but a lot of}} the most interesting plots have already played out, and a lot of the new plots aren't interesting." [...] Sanders said that the stories featured here had [...] "a few big laughs... but they're assembled so haphazardly and put into such a bulky framework that the train just never gets enough steam to salvage the episode." ...|$|E

Todd VanDerWerff [...] of The A.V. Club gave the same grade, praising Ribisi and Black's performances and [...] "sequences that confidently walk <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> line between horror and broad comedy", and marking it as the point where [...] "the show's direction, always good, made the leap from consistently interesting to look at to consistently cinematic." [...] Jane Goldman, in The X-Files Book of the Unexplained felt like the combination of Howard Gordon's [...] "acutely observed dialogue" [...] and Ribisi's [...] "compelling performance" [...] made Darin Oswald [...] "one of season three's most memorable characters". Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi put [...] "D.P.O." [...] only behind [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose" [...] as the best standalone season 3 episode, praising Ribisi's [...] "all quiet, creepy power that eventually explodes into homicidal rage" [...] and Jack Black's [...] "weary and ultimately doomed sidekick".

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're very happy with how the movie was. Everyone is very happy with where the movie was. For us, <b>the</b> <b>tricky</b> thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done with the movie in two and a half months."
