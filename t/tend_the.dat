She arrived at New York on 30 April {{for several days}} of upkeep and liberty {{before moving on to}} her summer base. On 17 May, she sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, the summer base for the destroyer squadrons, and arrived there the following day to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> destroyers of Flotilla2.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Jarrell's {{relationship}} with his mother became closer once his father {{and one of his}} brothers left to work at a shipyard during World War II. His father died of malaria while working there. While in high school, Jarrell helped his mother <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> farm, but did not like the work. After graduating from high school, he joined the Army, was stationed at Fort Polk, Louisiana and served briefly in Korea. At Fort Polk he became company artist and made extra money designing shirts and making paintings for fellow soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in Canada, Smith and Mulder's car {{runs out}} of gas. Walking the last few miles on foot, they come across the corpse of the electrician, grossly {{decomposed}} and covered in ants. Jeremiah takes Mulder to a mysterious field where they find a group of identical children; the girls all resemble Samantha at the age when she was abducted. Jeremiah tells Mulder that the cloned children are drones, workers used to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> fields, incapable of speaking. After retrieving a gasoline can, Mulder tries {{to take one of}} the female clones with him. However, the Bounty Hunter arrives and chases them. As he corners them in a large bee hive, the Bounty Hunter is crushed and stung repeatedly in a trap set up by the trio.|$|E
5|$|The {{next morning}} {{they were unable}} to start a fire using {{friction}} due to the thin air at that altitude, and sent for matches. By this time, the naval officers and Hawaiians could not agree on terms to continue hiring porters, so sailors and marines were ordered from the ships. Dr. Judd traveled between the summit and the Recruiting Station to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> many who suffered from altitude sickness or had worn out their shoes on the rough rock. Christmas Day was spent building rock walls around the camp to give some protection from the high winds and blowing snow. It took another week to bring all the equipment to the summit, including a pendulum designed for measuring slight variations in gravity.|$|E
5|$|The fate of {{the first}} egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related royal penguin and erect-crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of {{incubating}} the egg {{is divided into three}} roughly equal sessions of around 12days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36days, and the female fasts for 42days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period. Both adults lose 36–40% of their body weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean.|$|E

25|$|Not {{known for}} his oratory (but for quiet sardonic wit), bishop White earned Philadelphians' esteem for his erudition and ongoing {{charitable}} works, especially during the multiple outbreaks of yellow fever in that city throughout the 1790s.

25|$|Walker Arboretum: Located {{along the}} {{hillside}} of Rodman Hall and the Twelve Mile Creek below, the original owner of this estate was Thomas Rodman Merritt, son of William Hamilton Merritt. In the late 19th century, an English landscape designer named Samuel Richardson {{was hired by}} Merritt to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> grounds. As a result, the arboretum is an extensive, rambling garden with rare conifers which benefit from an exceptional micro-climate. It boasts {{one of the largest}} Chinese Empress trees in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Barges {{were pulled}} by mules along the {{adjacent}} towpath, a power source employed {{even after the}} development of steam engines, since the bow wave from a faster steamboat would have damaged the channel. Children were often hired to lead the mules at first; in the canal's later years grown men were employed. They had to walk 15–20 miles (24–32km) a day, pump out the barges and <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> animals. For this they were paid about $3 a month.|$|E
25|$|The Atash Dadgah is {{the lowest}} grade of sacred fire, and can be consecrated within {{the course of a}} few hours by two priests, who alternatingly recite the 72 verses of the Yasna liturgy. Consecration may {{occasionally}} include the recitation of the Vendidad, but this is optional. A lay person may <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> fire when no services are in progress. The term is not necessarily a consecrated fire, and the term is also applied to the hearth fire, or to the oil lamp found in many Zoroastrian homes.|$|E

25|$|Even when visiting Jewish {{graves of}} someone that the visitor never knew, the custom {{is to place}} a small stone on the grave using the left hand. This shows that someone visited the gravesite, and is also a way of {{participating}} in the mitzvah of burial. Leaving flowers is not a traditional Jewish practice. Another reason for leaving stones is to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> grave. In Biblical times, gravestones were not used; graves were marked with mounds of stones (a kind of cairn), so by placing (or replacing) them, one perpetuated {{the existence of the}} site.|$|E
25|$|In May 1864, {{those who}} tended these double locks wanted higher pay for them, but were unsuccessful. As a result, {{one of the}} lockkeepers, S. C. Rogers, {{abandoned}} his post (Locks 45 – 46) in protest, {{and was replaced by}} Obadiah Barger. Later in November 1864, Obadiah complained that he had been removed as locktender of the same locks (45-46) without just cause, and the locktender Susan Newcomer was never present but hired a youth without approval of the company, to <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> locks. After an investigation showed it to be true, she was sacked and Obadiah was reinstated as locktender again.|$|E
25|$|Tan {{was born}} into a Chinese {{immigrant}} family in 1919 in Cheras, Selangor. His parents were Tan Chin Ghee and Tay Kim Siew. On weekends, Tan rose at 5.30 a.m. to feed livestock, and then cycled five miles to tap rubber. When he returned at 4 in the afternoon, he would <b>tend</b> <b>the</b> vegetable patch and fruit trees in his garden. The Tans were devout Methodist Christians, and attended Cantonese-language services regularly. At the age of 13, Tan lost his left eye in an accident when he tried to carve his name into a rubber tree with a knife.|$|E
