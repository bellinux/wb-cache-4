60|$|Although, {{however, the}} Protestant laity do not often admit the absolving {{power of their}} clergy, they are but too apt to yield, in some sort, to the {{impression}} of their greater sanctification; and from this <b>instantly</b> <b>results</b> the unhappy consequence that the sacred character of the Layman himself is forgotten, and his own Ministerial duty is neglected. Men not in office in the Church suppose themselves, on that ground, in a sort unholy; and that, therefore, they may sin with more excuse, and be idle or impious with less danger, than the Clergy: especially they consider themselves relieved from all ministerial function, and as permitted to devote their whole {{time and energy to}} the business of this world. No mistake can possibly be greater. Every member of the Church is equally bound to the service of the Head of the Church; and that service is pre-eminently the saving of souls. There is not a moment of a man's active life in which he may not be indirectly preaching; and throughout a great part of his life he ought to be directly preaching, and teaching both strangers and friends; his children, his servants, and all who in any way are put under him, being given to him as special objects of his ministration. So that the only difference between a Church officer and a lay member is either a wider degree of authority given to the former, as apparently a wiser and better man, or a special appointment to some office more easily discharged by one person than by many: as, for instance, the serving of tables by the deacons; the authority or appointment being, in either case, commonly signified by a marked separation {{from the rest of the}} Church, and the privilege or power[146] of being maintained by the rest of the Church, without being forced to labor with his hands, or incumber himself with any temporal concerns.|$|R
40|$|The {{stress-strain}} behaviour of a soil {{is crucial}} to the recognition of the mechanism of slope failure. Triaxial tests, composed of isotropically consolidated drained (ICD) and undrained compression (ICU) tests and anisotropically consolidated constant deviatoric stress path (CQD) tests, were carried out with the aim of investigating the stress-strain behaviour of loosely compacted volcanic-derived soils. The fact that the critical states are the same for ICU, ICD and CQD tests may show that the critical state is independent of the above three stress paths. The critical state line, as defined in critical state soil mechanics, is obtained from the e-log p' and q-p' plots {{based on the results of}} the above tests. The initial state of the consolidated specimens at initiation of failure may be classified as dilative or contractive in the light of the locations of the soil state relative to the critical state line. For contractional soils, the increased pore water pressure generated by rainfall infiltration leads to a contractive failure in a drained manner, giving rise to high excess pore water pressure. The excess pore water pressure caused by contraction cannot be dissipated <b>instantly,</b> <b>resulting</b> in a decrease in the shear resistance of the soil. The failure process is rapid. The failed soil mass is prone to flow after failure under the action of gravity due to its high moisture content and inflow of surface runoff and rainwater. For dilational soils, the increased pore water pressure resulting from infiltration leads to dilation, which reduces pore water pressure and thus increases the shear resistance of the soil. However, continued rainfall infiltration may be able to equilibrate the reduction in pore water pressure caused by dilation and, therefore, the dilation or displacement can continue. In Hong Kong, volcanic-derived soil is characterized by high permeability. Both the high permeability of volcanic-derived soil and a shallow failure surface make it possible for the reduction in pore pressure to equilibrate relatively quickly. Therefore, the failure is also rapid, at least for poorly compacted fill slopes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

In an early design phase, we consider geomantic information, a kind of technical information crucial for design decision, which can be gathered by a survey.

In present day, GPS technology presents various tools to use in survey. However, a high precision GPS device is extremely costly. In this paper we propose low cost devices that give information precise enough to use in an early design phase.

This study investigates these three ways of providing feedback to find which results in the shortest completion time, which results in the lowest number of gaze revisits to input fields, and which type of feedback the users prefer. This was investigated through development of prototypes that were tested with 30 participants in a within-group design after which they were interviewed about their experiences. Providing feedback instantly or after form submission resulted in significantly shorter completion times than providing feedback after users left a field. Providing feedback <b>instantly</b> also <b>resulted</b> in significantly fewer revisits to input fields compared to providing feedback after leaving a field. Through a thematic analysis, users’ experiences were shown to be the most negative when given feedback after form submission, while the most positive experiences occurred when users were given feedback immediately. The results indicate that providing feedback immediately may be an equally good or better alternative to earlier research recommendations to provide feedback after form submission and that revisits to areas of interest may, with further research, be a measurement of optimal scanpath disruption...|$|R
