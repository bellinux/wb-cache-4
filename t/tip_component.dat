40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical investigation is presented of contact phenomena {{for the case}} of a fully-dense copper gas path seal segment which is rubbed by a single steel blade tip at room temperature. The experiments were executed on a pendulum-type test device, with forces, rub energy, surface temperature and residual deformation being determined for each single-path rub test. The thermal and mechanical factors influencing single-pass rub surface temperatures were modeled analytically. It is found that large plastic strains occurred on or near the contact surface of the copper rub specimens. A study of the influence of various material properties on surface temperature showed that increased thermal conductivity of the stationary component played a role in lowering contact temperatures.

Traditional direct injection fuel systems operate at roughly 3,000 psi at the injector tip while the modern common rail fuel system operates upwards of 30,000 PSI at the injector <b>tip.</b> <b>Components</b> are designed to operate at a great temperature range, from below freezing to over [...] Diesel fuel is expected to burn efficiently and produce as few emissions as possible. As emission standards are being introduced to diesel engines the need to control harmful emissions is being designed into the parameters of diesel engine fuel systems. The traditional inline injection system is more forgiving to poorer quality fuels {{as opposed to the}} common rail fuel system. The higher pressures and tighter tolerances of the common rail system allows for greater control over atomization and injection timing. This control of atomization as well as combustion allows for greater efficiency of modern diesel engines as well as greater control over emissions. Components within a diesel fuel system interact with the fuel in a way to ensure efficient operation of the fuel system and so the engine. If an out-of-specification fuel is introduced to a system that has specific parameters of operation, then the integrity of the overall fuel system may be compromised. Some of these parameters such as spray pattern and atomization are directly related to injection timing.|$|R
40|$|Filopodia are finger-like protrusive {{structures}} of cells, comprised of actin bundles, which {{can serve as}} sensory organelles. To probe their pathway of assembly we have reconstituted filopodia-like structures (FLSs) by applying frog egg extracts to supported lipid bilayers containing phosphatidylinositol(4, 5) bisphosphate, PI(4, 5) P 2. The FLSs recapitulate important characteristics of filopodia - they assemble parallel actin bundles from the lipid membrane and they form {{in the presence of}} capping activity. Known filopodial <b>tip</b> <b>components</b> such as Diaphanous-related formin and VASP localize to the membrane base of the structures, and bundling protein fascin to the shaft. Actin subunits assemble at the tip and translocate into the shaft. FLS assembly requires negativelycharged lipid membranes, with specific requirements for PI(4, 5) P 2 and, for maximal efficiency, phosphatidyl-serine. The focal nature of FLSs is not a result of templating by PI(4, 5) P 2 microdomains but instead by the self-organization of tip complex assembly on uniform PI(4, 5) P 2 -enriched regions. BAR domain protein toca- 1 recruits N-WASP then the Arp 2 / 3 complex and actin assembly follow. Elongation proteins Diaphanous-related formin, VASP and fascin are recruited later. The Arp 2 / 3 complex is absolutely required for FLS initiation but is not required for elongation, which may involve multiple factors including formins. We propose a model for filopodia formation involving an initial clustering of Arp 2 / 3 complex regulators, self-assembly of filopodial tip complexes on the membrane, resulting in the outgrowth of parallel actin bundles. by Kwonmoo Lee.

Kolasa 3; 1 Nutrition Science, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, 2 East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, 3 Family Medicine and Pediatrics, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC Learning Outcome: Participants will be able to explain how to apply strategies to help food donors promote food safety practices and to prepare nutritional and cost-conscious meals. “Helping Hands” is a 32 -page practical resource for volunteer meal donors. The objective of this project was to develop a useful tool for volunteers providing prepared meals to soup kitchens, homeless shelters, Ronald McDonald House, and a cancer lodge. It was created in response to requests from local agencies that expressed concerns regarding the food safety practices and nutritional quality of meals being donated. They desired a document that would include basic nutrition and food safety principles for populations at risk for malnutrition and/or infection. Additionally, they desired recipes for budget-friendly meals that could be prepared by busy volunteers. A literature and internet search and a query to dietitians on several Listserves found no existing documents to fulfill these needs. The content was outlined, and food safety information and recipes were gathered from sources including the USDA and CDC websites. The guide includes over thirty recipes with nutrition information, basic food safety guidelines, time and cost-saving <b>tips,</b> <b>components</b> of healthy meals, and testimonials from volunteers and agency personnel. Nine food, nutrition, and food safety specialists on the FNSPEC Listserve responded to a request for reviewers and provided comments on accuracy, format, and readability. A two-page brochure was developed to promote the guide. The success of “Helping Hands” will be evaluated by the comparative number of nutritionally balanced meals served, the implementation of proper food safety practices, and the overall cost of meals to volunteers.

Experimental results obtained from two different tanks of diameter 15. 25 cm and 29. 21 cm with a Rushton turbine operating at {{a wide range of}} rotational speed, is considered for the scaling analysis. The resulting Reynolds number of the flow ranges from 4000 to about 80000. Phase locked stereoscopic PIV measurements have been performed in order to obtain all three components of velocity on three different vertical planes close to the impeller. The scaling of plane-averaged mean flow was explored in the companion Part I of the paper. The scaling of rms and skewness of fluctuation about the mean is investigated here.

First, the study describes, connects, and operationalizes the concepts of critical consciousness, sustainability transition, and grassroots innovations. Then, it analyses two cases of grassroots innovations (two online sharing platforms), using these operationalized concepts. The results show that learning and critical consciousness development inside grassroots niches are much more connected to previous experience, such as participation in the protest event Euromaidan, than to inner niche learning interactions.

40|$|With {{the overall}} {{increase}} in oral {{health of the}} young, the number of fully dentate (or mostly dentate) seniors has increased. This group of patients poses a series of new challenges for the practicing dentist. Tooth fractures are most common in the restored teeth of senior patients and {{may be due to}} specific structural changes in dentin that take place with aging. This dissertation aims to develop a mechanistic understanding of crack growth in dentin, the major hard tissue of the human tooth, and to identify the effects from the age-dependent microstructure on fracture, energy dissipation and the mechanisms of toughening in human dentin. To achieve this understanding, a hybrid evaluation of crack extension in human dentin was employed where experimental measurements of crack extension and near-tip displacement fields were used as the solution for a finite element model simulating crack growth. The experiments consisted of an evaluation of stable crack growth in compact tension (CT) specimens of human dentin and use of micro Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to document the full-field displacement field with crack extension. A Nonlinear Finite Element Model (NLFEM) for the fracture process was developed to account for the intrinsic (ahead of the crack tip) and extrinsic (behind the crack <b>tip)</b> <b>components</b> of energy dissipation observed from experiments. Results from investigation show that the fracture resistance of dentin increases with crack extension, that dentin exhibits rising R-curve behavior and that this behavior is a function of patient age. When quantified in terms of specific age groups, there was a 25 % increase in the crack growth resistance for the young dentin (18 <age< 29) from initiation (Ko = 1. 35 MPam 0. 5) {{to the development of a}} plateau toughness (Kp = 1. 60 MPam 0. 5). In contrast, the increase in crack growth resistance of the old dentin (50 ?age) from initiation (Ko = 1. 10 MPam 0. 5) to plateau (Ko = 1. 20 MPam 0. 5) was less than 10 %. The difference in fracture toughness between the two age groups was approximately 30 %. In young dentin toughening was found to result from crack bridging by unbroken ligaments, as well as microcracking of the peritubular dentin and separation between the intertubular and peritubular aspects. Toughening in old dentin was comprised of the same mechanisms as in young dentin, but occurred to lower extent than in the young tissue. The reduction in the fracture toughness with increasing patient age was found to be highly correlated with the degree of mineral filling the tubule lumens; the lowest toughness was obtained when the lumens were fully occluded by deposited mineral. Results from the NLFEM showed that the extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms played equal roles in the degree of toughening achieved with crack extension. These findings indicate that strategies aimed at increasing the toughness of old dentin should focus on the development of methods for preventing deposition of mineral within the dentin tubules with age...|$|R

In particular, issues involving incompatibility with silicone oil and a stability-based approach for selection of PFS barrel and <b>tip</b> cap <b>components</b> have been discussed. Silicone spiking studies followed by exposure to agitation stress or accelerated temperature conditions were used to check for incompatibilities of the mAb with silicone oil, a necessary product contact material in PFS. In addition, screening studies to compare various closure materials as well as syringe barrel processing methods were used to select the optimum closure materials as well as the correct syringe processing method. Results indicate that the model mAb formulation used was sensitive to high levels of silicone oil especially under accelerated temperature conditions resulting in formation of protein–silicone particles in the solution for samples that were spiked with the silicone oil. Agitation stress did not have any significant impact on the quality attributes tested. Samples stored in syringe barrels that were processed with sprayed-on silicone had higher levels of subvisible particles as compared to those that were processed with the baked-on process. The tip cap comparability study resulted in one tip cap material having superior compatibility among the three that were tested.

Harmonin-b {{is located in the}} region of the upper insertion point of the tip link that joins adjacent stereocilia from different rows and that is believed to gate transducer channel(s) located in the region of the tip link's lower insertion point. In Ush 1 c (dfcr- 2 J/dfcr- 2 J) mutant mice defective for harmonin-b, step deflections of the hair bundle evoked transduction currents with altered speed and extent of adaptation. In utricular hair cells, hair bundle morphology and maximal transduction currents were similar to those observed in wild-type mice, but adaptation was faster and more complete. Cochlear outer hair cells displayed reduced maximal transduction currents, which may be the consequence of moderate structural anomalies of their hair bundles. Their adaptation was slower and displayed a variable extent. The latter was positively correlated with the magnitude of the maximal transduction current, but the cells that showed the largest currents could be either hyperadaptive or hypoadaptive. To interpret our observations, we used a theoretical description of mechanoelectrical transduction based on the gating spring theory and a motor model of adaptation. Simulations could account for the characteristics of transduction currents in wild-type and mutant hair cells, both vestibular and cochlear. They led us to conclude that harmonin-b operates as an intracellular link that limits adaptation and engages adaptation motors, a dual role consistent with the scaffolding property of the protein and its binding to both actin filaments and the <b>tip</b> link <b>component</b> cadherin- 23...|$|R

The underlying molecular mechanisms for such coordination and coupling are not well understood. The cyclin E-Cdk 2 substrate NPAT has been shown to play an essential role in the transcriptional {{activation of}} histone genes at the G 1 /S-phase transition. Here, we show that NPAT interacts with <b>components</b> of the <b>Tip</b> 60 histone acetyltransferase complex through a novel amino acid motif, which is functionally conserved in E 2 F and adenovirus E 1 A proteins. In addition, we demonstrate that transformation/transactivation domain-associated protein (TRRAP) and <b>Tip</b> 60, two <b>components</b> of the <b>Tip</b> 60 complex, associate with histone gene promoters at the G 1 /S-phase boundary in an NPAT-dependent manner. In correlation with the association of the TRRAP-Tip 60 complex, histone H 4 acetylation at histone gene promoters increases at the G 1 /S-phase transition, and this increase involves NPAT function. Suppression of TRRAP or Tip 60 expression by RNA interference inhibits histone gene activation. Thus, our data support a model in which NPAT recruits the TRRAP-Tip 60 complex to histone gene promoters to coordinate the transcriptional activation of multiple histone genes during the G 1 /S-phase transition...|$|R

One hip underwent acetabular revision because of breakage of polyethylene liner, and the well-fixed femoral component was left in situ. Thigh pain developed in 1 patient (6. 2 %). Kaplan-Meier survival was 81 % at 64 months, with radiographic loosening as an end-point when two hips were at risk. Conclusion: Satisfactory results of midterm clinical and radiographic follow-up can be achieved using S-ROM modular femoral stem for revision of femoral stem in ankylosing spondylitis...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{the concept}} of going to market is fraught with misinterpretation, doubt, and anxiety. In Canada, the term "go to market" {{typically}} means the task of readying a product for market. In this context, it is interchangeable with "commercialization," which is another concept suffering in Canada from a definition that generally does not go beyond a software maker's front door. In {{other parts of the}} world, and specifically in the U. S., the term "go to market" is clearly interpreted as meaning all the activities required to successfully launch a product into the marketplace and realize both market share and profit. Going to market is about bringing the right benefit to the right market at the right price through the right channels. Ideally, the entire go-to-market process begins with the identification of a problem or sought-after benefit that a market segment has deemed a priority. More realistically, though, it begins with identifying the segment that best suits the software offering and then determines the business model, positioning and message, pricing, channels, and engagement techniques that will work best in building share in that segment. This issue attempts {{to take some of the}} doubt and anxiety from what seems to be the daunting task of pushing a product out of the door and into the harsh realities of a demanding market. It provides clear-eyed discussions of some of the main <b>components,</b> <b>tips</b> and advice from the "battle-scarred," and useful tools that can be readily used...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a multicellular organism is programmed by complex patterns of gene expression. In eukaryotic cells, genes are packaged by histone proteins into chromatin. Chromatin regulators often function as transcription co-factors. In this study, we have investigated the function of four co-factors, dAda 2 b, Reptin, Ebi and Brakeless during {{development of}} the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. dAda 2 b and Reptin belong to histone acetyl transferase (HAT) complexes, a SAGA-like complex and the Tip 60 complex, respectively. We generated dAda 2 b mutants and found that lack of dAda 2 b strongly affects global histone acetylation and viability. We further propose that Ada 2 {{may be involved in}} DNA repair. Our studies revealed new roles of Reptin and other <b>Tip</b> 60 complex <b>components</b> in Polycomb Group mediated repression and heterochromatin formation, thereby promoting generation of silent chromatin. During embryogenesis, transcriptional repressors establish localized and tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. In this thesis, we identified two novel co-repressors in the early embryo, Ebi and Brakeless. Ebi genetically and physically interacts with the Snail repressor. The Ebi-interaction motif in the Snail protein is essential for Snail function in vivo and is evolutionarily conserved in insects. We further demonstrated that Ebi associates with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC 3) and that histone deacetylation is part of the mechanism by which Snail mediates transcriptional repression. We isolated Brakeless in a genetic screen for novel regulators of gene expression during embryogenesis. We found that mutation of brakeless impairs function of the Tailless repressor. Brakeless associates with Atrophin, another Tailless corepressor, and they function together in Tailless-mediated repression. In summary, transcription co-factors, including chromatin regulators, are selectively required in distinct processes during development...|$|R
40|$|Elastic-plastic {{crack tip}} {{constraint}} {{has been estimated}} for the common planar crack geometries. These include single edge cracked bars in tension and bending, centre cracked panels, and double edge cracked bars. The description of the stress field has been modified from a one parameter characterisation, based on K or J, to include a second term. The second parameter is a non-singular term, described either {{in terms of an}} elastic T-stress or a Q field. The limits of one and two parameter characterisation are discussed for single edge bars in tension and bending and for centre cracked panels. For the single edge geometries the two parameter characterisation was found to extend the characterisation well beyond the one parameter approach. For the centre cracked panels the two parameter characterisation in terms of a J-Q approach was found to be more accurate than a J-T approach at high levels of deformation. For the single edge cracked bending and tension geometries the second parameter Q is divided into two components named QT and QP. QT is an elastic term which depends on the elastic T stress and is independent of the distance from the crack <b>tip.</b> The second <b>component,</b> QP, arises from global bending on the uncracked ligament. This is a distance dependent term which depends on the level of deformation and can either be expressed {{as a function of the}} load normalised by the limit load or as a function of the plastic component of the J-integral. For single edge bend bars the constraint estimation provides a basis for a method of predicting fracture toughness using local failure approach, where the failure criterion is expressed in terms of the stress level ahead of the crack tip. Finally the constraint of mixed mode problem has been analysed and compared with that of pure Mode I problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a micro-force displacement system was completed to test the force-displacement characteristics of square silicon diaphragms with side lengths of 4 mm, 5 mm, and 7 mm with a thickness of 10 um. The system utilizes a World Precision Instruments Fort 10 g force transducer attached to a World Precession Instruments TBM 4 M amplifier. A Keithley 2400 source meter provided data acquisition of the force component of the system. A micro prober tip was utilized as the testing probe attached to the force transducer with a tip radius of 5 um. The displacement of samples was measured using a Newport M 433 linear stage driven by a Newport ESP 300 motion controller (force readings at constant displacement intervals). An additional 3 linear stages were used to provide X and Y-axis positioning of samples beneath the probe <b>tip.</b> The system <b>components</b> were mounted to an optical bench to provide stability during testing. C# was used to deliver the code to the individual components of the system. In addition the software provides a graphic user interface for future users that includes a calibration utility (both X/Y and force calibration), live force-displacement graph, motion control, and a live video feed for sample alignment. Calibration of the force transducer was accomplished using an Adam Equipment PGW 153 e precision balance to assign force values to the voltage data produced from the transducer. Displacement calibration involved {{the use of a}} microscope calibration micrometer. The system was characterized with an equipment variability of ± 1. 02 mg at 1. 75 um, and ± 1. 86 mg at 3. 5 um with the ability to characterize samples with stiffness less than 279 mg/um. The displacement resolution of the system was determined to be 35 nm per step of the linear stages. The diaphragms created to test the machine were fabricated from 10 um thick device layer SOI wafers. An etch consisting of 38 g/l silicic acid, 7 g/l ammonium persulfate, and 5...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} on Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) {{has shown that}} the viral capsid protein (CP) is both a virulence factor as well as the elicitor of a hypersensitive resistance response (HR) to the virus in Arabidopsis. Initially, we identified a protein from Arabidopsis that specifically interacted with the viral CP using a yeast two-hybrid screen. This protein, designated TIP for TCV-Interacting Protein, {{is a member of the}} NAC family of plant transcription factors implicated in the regulation of development and senescence. When TCV CP was mutated to eliminate its ability to interact with TIP, the corresponding virus mutants broke the HR-mediated resistance conferred by the HRT resistance (R) gene in Arabidopsis ecotype Dijon (Di) - 17. This result suggested that <b>TIP</b> is a <b>component</b> of the signal transduction pathway that leads to the genetically specified TCV resistance. We next confirmed that TIP and the viral CP interact in plant cells and that this interaction prevents nuclear localization of this transcription factor. We demonstrated that TCV CP suppresses post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), a newly discovered RNA-mediated defense system in plants. Together these results suggest that the CP is a virulence factor that could well be functioning through its interaction with TIP. We have proposed a model involving the role of TIP and CP in triggering HR mediated plant defense that fits with the current thinking about how gene-for-gene resistance may function. A unique component of our system is the opportunity to link R-gene function with the newly discovered RNA silencing pathway that is not only a potent defense against viral pathogens, but also regulates early development in plants. In the current funding period we made several significant findings: First, we completed an array analysis comparing gene expression in Arabidopsis infected with TCV and a mutant virus unable to bind TIP. Second, we produced transgenic lines that over-express and inducibly under-express TIP. These accomplishments now form the basis for our continued effort towards providing a complete understanding of molecular events leading to susceptible and resistant interactions between TCV and Arabidopsis plants. Our data strongly suggest that TIP is involved in activating the SA-mediated defense pathway and that TCV CP acts to repress this role of TIP...|$|R
40|$|Subduction of tectonic plates {{limited in}} lateral extent {{and with a}} free-trailing tail, i. e., "free subduction,'' is modeled in a {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) geometry. The models use a nonlinear viscoplastic rheology for the subducting plate and exhibit {{a wide range of}} behaviors depending on such plate characteristics as strength, width, and thickness. We investigate the time evolution of this progressive rollback subduction, measure the accompanying return flow in the upper mantle, and quantify the plate kinematics. Due to the 3 -D geometry, flow is allowed to accompany slab rollback around the lateral edges of the slab (the toroidal component), as opposed to 2 -D geometry, where material is forced to flow underneath the slab <b>tip</b> (the poloidal <b>component).</b> A simple force balance is provided which relates the speed of backward trench migration to the resistive forces of generating flow and weakening the plate. Our results indicate most of the gravitational energy of the system (i. e., the negative buoyancy of the subducting slab) is converted into a toroidal flow (∼ 69 %), a much smaller amount goes into weakening the plate (∼ 18 %), and the remaining amount goes into driving flow parallel to displacement of the slab (∼ 13 %). For the trench widths (W) we investigate (≤ 1500 km), a maximum trench retreat rate occurs for trenches 600 km wide, which is attributed to the interaction between a plate of finite width and the induced flow (which has a lengthscale in the horizontal direction). These numerical results quantitatively agree with comparable 3 -D laboratory experiments using analogue models with a purely viscous plate material (Schellart, 2004 a, 2004 b), including correlations between increasing retreat rate with increasing plate thickness, trench width for maximum retreat rate (500 km), and estimated amount of slab buoyancy used to drive rollback-induced flow (∼ 70 %). Several implications for plate tectonics on Earth result from these models such as rollback subduction providing a physical mechanism for ephemeral slab graveyards situated above the more viscous lower mantle (and endothermic phase transition) prior to a flushing event into the lower mantle (mantle avalanche) ...|$|R
40|$|As implant {{survival}} extends {{into the}} second and third decades focal osteolysis around cemented femoral components in total hip replacement is emerging as an important failure mechanism. Whilst the problem of focal osteolysis is well recognised, there are many aspects of its development which are poorly understood. The broad aim of this thesis is to try to provide some insights into how, why and where focal osteolysis develops around the cemented femoral component. There are broadly two sections to this thesis, chapters 2 - 5 present clinical and geometrical studies and chapters 6 - 10 a series of experimental studies. The aim of the first section was to establish what is observed in clinical practice, the aim of the second to try to explain these findings. A mid-term clinical study showed that focal osteolysis is more common with rough than polished stems that differed in no aspect other than their surface finish. Further studies established that focal osteolysis is probably always associated with defects in the cement mantle. These defects occur anteriorly at the mid-stem of the prosthesis and posteriorly at the <b>component</b> <b>tip.</b> The distribution of focal osteolysis and its strong association with cement mantle defects suggests the importance of the stemcement interface as a pathway for fluid and debris to reach the distal femur. However, at 15 - 25 years, osteolysis rarely develops with the polished Exeter stem even in the presence of confirmed defects in the cement mantle, suggesting that the stem seals the stem-cement interface against fluid and debris. In an attempt to explain the clinical findings a series of bench top experiments were undertaken. These studies showed that the behaviour of fluid and dye at the stemcement interface was significantly influenced by component surface finish. Bonded and debonded stem-cement interfaces of rough stems provided an incomplete barrier to fluid movement along this interface. In contrast, polished stems both bonded and debonded were able to provide a seal at the stem-cement interface. The seal at this interface was improved with component subsidence in the presence of rotational stability. It is believed that this thesis provides a rationale explanation for why focal osteolysis rarely develops around the Exeter stem in clinical practice. It also explains how, where, and why osteolysis develops around certain designs of cemented femoral components used in total hip replacement. </p...|$|R
