Virginia Tech quarterback Michael Vick completed 15 of 29passes for 225passing yards and one passing touchdown. Vick also ran the ball 23times for 97yards in his performance as the game's leading rusher.

5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a <b>team</b> <b>effort</b> saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in the thirties from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E

By the spring of 1932, King's laboratory had proven this, but published the result without giving Szent-Györgyi credit for it, leading to a bitter dispute over priority claims (in reality it had taken a <b>team</b> <b>effort</b> by both groups, since Szent-Györgyi was unwilling to do the difficult and messy animal studies).|$|E

By this stage other South Africans were also contributing substantially, such as the all-rounder Aubrey Faulkner and his fellow leg-spinners Reggie Schwarz, Bert Vogler and Gordon White, and the 4–1 series victory was a <b>team</b> <b>effort.</b> Sinclair continued to play Test cricket until 1911, but with only moderate success.|$|E

He also holds the distinction of being the only player to have bowled in a five wicket (1 caught, 2 bowled, 2 run-outs) maiden over in T20 cricket, doing so against Australia in 2010. This was the only time in cricketing history that 5 wickets had fallen in an over of any international format and that happened in the final over of a T20 World Cup clash.

The fast bowler Ray Lindwall took 15 wickets (22.93), his new-ball partner Keith Miller 17 wickets (17.70), Bill Johnston 22 wickets (19.18) and the mystery spin of Jack Iverson 21 wickets (15.23) in his only Test series.

25|$|Auburn {{traveled}} to Starkville for the fifteenth {{time to meet}} SEC-West foe Mississippi State {{under the direction of}} third-year coach Sylvester Croom. The Bulldogs hoped to shut down Auburn's rushing game and force Auburn QB Brandon Cox to beat them. While State did manage to hold Irons to 79 yards, Cox responded passing for 249 yards completing 18-of-27 and two touchdowns, including Rodgeriqus Smith's first. Kicker John Vaughn had a career-long 55-yard field goal and tailback Brad Lester added 41 yards rushing and two touchdowns to the offensive <b>team</b> <b>effort</b> to help Auburn to a 34–0 shutout over the Bulldogs. Croom had yet to beat Auburn and Auburn is now 56–22–2 all-time against Mississippi State with a current six-game streak.|$|E

Leicestershire fought back well on the third day, though, having lost Maddy before stumps {{on the second day}} to be 57 for 1. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman all passed 30, and Claude Henderson chipped in with a fine 55 from number 9, as Leicestershire made their way to a lead of 190. Only Gough showed consistent threat, taking four wickets for 60, while Steyn again became too inconsistent - he conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although he did get the wickets of Robinson and Ottis Gibson.|$|E

25|$|A great <b>team</b> <b>effort,</b> despite Martin Bicknell {{being out}} of form, {{resulted}} in Surrey winning their third {{game of the season}} and sharing third place in the table with Hampshire. A healthy opening partnership between Scott Newman and Richard Clinton worth 100 was to be the highest of the entire match, and despite Chris Tremlett taking wickets regularly, he also conceded a lot of runs, as he ended with four for 106 off twenty overs. Newman eventually finished with 111 and Australian David Thornely made 73 to see Surrey to a final score of 361 - in just 81.4 overs. The first two days at The Rose Bowl were hampered by rain, but amid the showers, Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh took six for 36 as Hampshire crumbled in a rather unimpressive heap for 146. Only two batsmen passed 20, and seven were out in single figures. Hampshire's second innings began with the first ball of the third day, and Jason Ormond ripped out two wickets quickly, Mohammad Akram got a five-for, and only John Crawley's 67 - off 62 balls with thirteen boundaries, slightly out of place in the situation - passed 25. Thus, the two teams were tied on 100 points in the Championship, allowing Warwickshire and Kent to run away further on the table.|$|E
25|$|Highlander Scoring: The points awarded {{function}} slightly {{differently than}} in conventional Spades. Highlander Scoring merges partnership playing with individual <b>team</b> <b>effort.</b> Sandbagging {{does not apply}} {{with this type of}} game play, although sandbagging could be included. Each partner makes a bid of the tricks they think they can win. Each partner must win the total they individually bid; if not, that player's bid value is deducted from the team's score even if their partner took enough trick to make up the difference. :For example, if Tom bids 5 tricks and wins 4 tricks, and Harry (his partner) bids 3 tricks and wins 4 tricks, 80 points is deducted from the partnership's total score even though the team won their promised 8 tricks, because Tom did not make his bid. However, Harry is awarded five points per overtrick, so they are −75 points instead of −80 points. If the contract is broken and no overtricks were taken, the team is down the full amount of the bid. If both made their contract and have won overtricks, they are awarded five extra points per overtrick. Team that wins seven or more tricks per round is given 10 points the first time, 20 points the second, and each time thereafter the points increase by 10. This encourages race-style play where players set out to take as many tricks as they can {{as long as they do}} not steal tricks their partner needs.|$|E
25|$|India made up {{for their}} early losses with a very convincing win over Kenya at Bristol by 94 runs four days later. India scored a massive 329/2 through centuries from Tendulkar (140 not out from 101 balls, 16 fours, 3 sixes), who had rejoined the team, and Dravid (104 not out from 109 balls, 10 fours). The pair scored 237 in 29 overs at a run rate of 8.17 before medium pacer Debashish Mohanty wiped up the Kenyan batsmen with a 4-wicket haul (4/56). Tendulkar, {{declared}} Man of the Match, later dedicated his ton to his late father. India followed this victory with a record win against Sri Lanka at Taunton by 157 runs. Ganguly (183 from 158 balls, 17 fours, 7 sixes) and Dravid (145 from 129 balls, 17 fours, 1 six) picked up two centuries at over a run a ball to get India to a mammoth total of 373/6, sharing a partnership of 318 runs in 44.9 overs. Sri Lanka were then rattled due to Robin Singh's 5/31, crashing to 216 all out. India {{then went on to}} seal a place in the Super Six stage with a win against hosts England at Edgbaston in Birmingham by 63 runs; in a match extended by a day due to rain, once again Ganguly (40 from 59 balls, 6 fours) and Dravid (53 from 82 balls, 6 fours) starred with the bat to score 238/2, while a strong <b>team</b> <b>effort</b> with the ball, led by Ganguly's 3/27, got England all out for just 169.|$|E
