40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} historical and theological context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in <b>the</b> theology of John Wesley {{with the aim of}} identifying its central role in his soteriology. Examining <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in its historical context requires locating <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in <b>the</b> English theological lexicon prior to Wesley and tracing Wesley's own inheritance of that tradition. The task <b>of</b> placing <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace within <b>the</b> context of Wesley's broader theological framework involves explaining how <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace, as disciplined practices engaged within the community of faith, {{lie at the heart of}} his soteriology as it finds expression in the Christian life. It is argued that the best way to conceive <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology is as the "sacramental grammar" of his thought, grounded in the Wesleyan idea of social holiness, which names both the communal arena in which <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace are practiced and the salvific reality experienced by those joined together in such practice. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and explains the thesis. It describes the plan and scope of the dissertation, which is to locate John Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in its historical and theological context. It lays out the approach, method, and sources for the project with reference to major scholarly texts that are engaged as well as the primary source material utilized. The chapter concludes by noting that, in addition to elucidating aspects of John Wesley's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace not present in scholarship up to this point, it also intends to serve as a way to bring discipline to the use of Wesleyan language for <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in contemporary Wesleyan scholarship. Chapter 2 - "The History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace: 16 th and 17 th Centuries" - analyzes the emergence of <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in <b>the</b> Church of England after the period of the Reformation. The chapter argues that <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace emerged as a way to describe the way God can be experienced through activities of devotion and worship, specifically after the loss of the full Roman Catholic sacramental system. It traces the particular use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Puritan practical divinity and examines its inclusion in the Book of Common Prayer. The chapter concludes with a study of John Norris' use of "means of grace" as an example of doctrinal development at the beginning of the 18 th century. Chapter 3 - "The Reception and Development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace in John Wesley" - demonstrates Wesley's reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace during <b>the</b> period of Oxford Methodism. It then goes on to trace Wesley's development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace specifically in relation to the influences of mysticism and Moravianism. The period it covers is from 1731 to 1746, at which time, it is argued, Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace had reached a level of maturity as embodied in his publication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sermon, "The <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace. " Chapter 4 - "The Content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace in John Wesley's Theology" - analyzes <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology with respect to two main considerations: the nature of grace and <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> themselves as "practices. " It also examines Wesley's categories <b>of</b> instituted <b>means,</b> prudential means, and general <b>means,</b> noting aspects <b>of</b> Wesley's distinctive understanding of each category. Chapter 5 - "The Character and Context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Means</b> <b>of</b> Grace" - brings the preceding work of the dissertation into a consideration of the nature of salvation in Wesley, specifically in relation to Wesley's understanding of present salvation as the recovery of holiness of heart and life. It then argues that Wesley's doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace is best characterized through an intersection of the notion of "social holiness" as the environmental context in which <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace are practiced and holiness becomes manifest in the Christian community. Conclusion - The dissertation ends with a conclusion that summarizes the preceding chapters and underscores the significance of social holiness in understanding <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> <b>of</b> grace in Wesley's theology and practice of ministry.

25|$|A {{more precise}} result {{is true for}} the C*-algebra of all bounded linear {{operators}} on a Hilbert space: If T is such an operator and ||T|| < 1nbsp&minus&nbsp&2/n for some integer n > 2, then T is <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>of</b> n unitary operators.|$|E

25|$|Angles, {{times of}} day, and other {{cyclical}} quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, {{there will not}} be a unique mean.

Consider a color wheel -- there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful.
