The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even <b>though</b> <b>all</b> their choices were predestined.|$|E

The season also set many records for the earliest date for a numbered storm, <b>though</b> <b>all</b> were surpassed by the extreme activity of the 2005 season.|$|E

Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.|$|E
