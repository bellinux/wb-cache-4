40|$|The {{expanded}} use of {{longwall mining}} systems has led, in particular, to different <b>installation</b> <b>arrangements</b> and combinations of ground wire monitors and ground wire devices {{for the purpose}} of monitoring <b>the</b> grounding circuit-These <b>installation</b> <b>arrangements</b> and combinations of ground wire monitors and ground wire devices were not evaluated at the time MSHA originally tested and accepted the ground wire monitor. Although these installation schemes differ from the accepted scheme, they can provide equivalent protection when their operation is coordinated with other electrical power system components. For this reason MSHA’s Approval and Certification Center developed an application procedure to evaluate these <b>installation</b> <b>arrangements.</b> To differentiate <b>the</b> procedure from the standard ground wire monitor or ground wire device application procedure, MSHA has identified this application procedure as the Monitor and Power System (MAPS) Program. This program includes tests and analyses to evaluate and assess various arrangements and combinations of proposed ground wire monitor and ground wire device installations...|$|R

Since wind is an unlimited source of energy the exploitations of wind farms is of great interest. This report describes a conceptual design of an innovative offshore wind turbine installation vessel for inland sea conditions, with highest possible energy efficiency and environmental friendly performance in every detail. The customer, Blekinge Offshore, main requirement is to receive a concept with an as low installation cost as possible. The final concept Optimus Pråm includes one installation vessel, which is a semi-submersible barge, and one support vessel that supply <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> vessel with power and propulsion. The power is distributed from the support vessel to <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> vessel through a power cable. <b>The</b> <b>installation</b> vessel will be self-propelled during <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> phase using electrical motors and thrusters. <b>The</b> <b>installation</b> vessel shall be able to handle gravity foundations and fully assembled wind turbines, transported vertically to <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> site. Foundations and windmills will be fully assembled in Karlshamn port before transit to site. During transit <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> and support vessel are connected to each other in all motions except pitch.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} to calibrate <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> errors of SINS.

By the multi-position combinations, <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> errors of <b>the</b> gyro and accelerometer are modulated into the sine and cosine functions, which can be identified respectively based on the least squares. In order to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis, the SINS is experimented by a three-axis turntable, and <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> errors of <b>the</b> gyro and accelerometer are identified respectively according to the proposed method.
