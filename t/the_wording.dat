5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wording</b> of the {{declaration}} was thus incorporated into the British Mandate for Palestine, a legal instrument that created Mandatory Palestine with an explicit purpose of putting {{the declaration}} into effect and was finally formalized in September,1923. Unlike the declaration itself, the Mandate was legally binding on the British government.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{consistency}} in Freemasonry. Because each Masonic jurisdiction is independent, each sets its own procedures. <b>The</b> <b>wording</b> of the ritual, the number of officers present, {{the layout of the}} meeting room, etc. varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|This, {{and similar}} issues {{pertaining}} to <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> inhibiting {{the use of}} decltype in the declaration of a derived class and in a destructor call, were addressed by David Vandevoorde, and voted into the working paper in March 2010.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> Allhallowtide {{was first}} used in 1471, and is derived from two words: <b>the</b> Old English <b>word</b> halig, meaning saint, and <b>the</b> <b>word</b> tide, meaning time or season (cf. Christmastide, Eastertide). The latter part of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Hallowmas is derived from <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Mass. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> hallow and saint are synonyms.|$|R
50|$|The term awe {{stems from}} <b>the</b> Old English <b>word</b> ege, meaning “terror, dread, awe,” {{which may have}} arisen from <b>the</b> Greek <b>word</b> áchos, meaning “pain.” <b>The</b> <b>word</b> awesome {{originated}} from <b>the</b> <b>word</b> awe in <b>the</b> late 16th century, to mean “filled with awe.” <b>The</b> <b>word</b> awful also originated from <b>the</b> <b>word</b> awe, to replace <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Old English word egeful (“dreadful”).|$|R

5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the {{resolution}} of independence, Congress turned its attention to the committee's draft of the declaration. Over several days of debate, they made a few changes in wording and deleted nearly a fourth of the text and, on July 4, 1776, <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the Declaration of Independence was approved and sent to the printer for publication.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Sussex Wilfrid was {{reconciled}} with Archbishop Theodore; the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury. Wilfrid {{may have been involved}} in founding monasteries near Bath as well as in other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved.|$|E
5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only says {{that he has}} {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius did not get the tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors. Whatever the case, <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the passage shows that Eusebius is unenthusiastic about his subject and skeptical of its significance. Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> halawa (حلاوة) in Arabic means 'sweetness', while <b>the</b> <b>word</b> halwa (حلوى) means sweets or candy. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> halva {{comes from}} <b>the</b> Arabic <b>word</b> halwa; <b>the</b> root <b>word</b> is hilwa meaning sweet.|$|R

5|$|In 1981, actor James Garner claimed {{responsibility}} for <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine. Garner, who narrated the original commercial, stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him. However, as noted above, the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television, which cast doubt on Garner's claim.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the 1963 statute {{came under}} {{criticism}} because it states {{the sun in}} the state seal is setting rather than rising. A thorough investigation by the Indiana Historical Bureau {{into the history of}} the seal led to the discovery that original seal was created with the intention that the sun should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality {{published}} the general scheme of a Marriage Bill 2015. The bill {{set out the}} changes {{to be made to}} legislation if the proposed amendment was approved. These changes included removing the existing legislative bar on same-sex couples marrying (though <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the amendment is self-executing and designed to invalidate it irrespective of legislative delay), addressing the situation of civil partnership, and updating terminology of existing legislation to reflect the new provision.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> {{has become}} {{something}} of a catchphrase for actor Samuel L. Jackson, who frequently utters <b>the</b> <b>word</b> in his movies. His use of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> helped him overcome a lifelong stuttering problem.Historically in India, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'Madarchodh' is used for Motherfucker, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Madar being of Persian origin, as Madare Jendeh.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> [...] "calender" [...] {{itself is}} a {{derivation}} of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> κύλινδρος kylindros, <b>the</b> Greek <b>word</b> that is also the source of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "cylinder".|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> femme {{is taken}} from <b>the</b> French <b>word</b> for woman. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> butch, meaning [...] "masculine", may have been coined by abbreviating <b>the</b> <b>word</b> butcher, as first noted in George Cassidy's nickname, Butch Cassidy. However, the exact origin of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> is still unknown.|$|R
5|$|In the {{alternative}} image for this stage, produced as a woodcut by Bell, Tom is shown {{with his hands}} free. There are also differences in <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the letter and some items, like the lantern and books, are larger and simpler while others, such as the man {{to the left of}} Tom and the topiary bush, have been removed. The owl has become a winged hourglass on the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|The Act of Uniformity 1558, which forced {{people to}} attend Sunday service in an Anglican church {{with a new}} version of the Book of Common Prayer, passed by only three votes. The Bill of Uniformity was more {{cautious}} than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws proposed against Roman Catholics, it removed the abuse of the pope from the litany and kept <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial beliefs in the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The board {{claimed that}} the Goebel Election Law did not give them the power to hear proof of vote fraud or call witnesses, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of their decision implied {{that they would have}} invalidated Taylor votes if they had been empowered to do so. Taylor was inaugurated on December 12, 1899. Days later, the Democratic-dominated General Assembly convened in Frankfort. They claimed the power to decide disputed elections, and formed a partisan commission (ten Democrats and one Republican) to examine the election results.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>words</b> used in <b>the</b> Shema prayer {{are similar}} to <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of Sura 112 (Al-Tawhid or Monotheism) in Quran. <b>The</b> <b>words</b> [...] "أَحَدٌ" [...] in Arabic is {{identical}} to <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "אֶחָד" [...] in Hebrew.|$|R

5|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's feeding tube was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed that Michael Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of all the polls.|$|E
5|$|Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, {{royal assent}} can be {{granted by the}} {{sovereign}} in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly {{for the purpose of}} receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act ("... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...").|$|E
5|$|After the {{conviction}} for manslaughter in 1967 of the Christian Scientist mother of five-year-old Lisa Sheridan, who died without medical care in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, the church lobbied the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) {{to add a}} religious exemption to the Code of Federal Regulations. Added in 1974, this stated that parents who did not provide medical treatment for a child for religious reasons would not be considered negligent. States were thereafter obliged to include exemptions or lose funding; <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> of the exemptions made clear that they referred to Christian Science.|$|E
50|$|Actually, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'victorious' in Minangkabau Language is 'manang', not 'minang'. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> 'minang' {{actually}} means consuming pinang. But there hasn't {{been any}} popular explanation on <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'minang' {{that relates to}} consuming pinang to <b>the</b> <b>word</b> water buffalo.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> absement is a {{portmanteau}} of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> absence and displacement. Similarly, absition is a portmanteau of <b>the</b> <b>words</b> absence and position.|$|R
