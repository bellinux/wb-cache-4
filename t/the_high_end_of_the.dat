Some argue that the number is probably higher and that clinicians underdiagnose PBA. However, the prevalence estimate of 2million is based on an online survey. Self-selected computer-savvy patients in at-risk groups evaluated their own symptoms and submitted their self-diagnoses. No doctor or clinic confirmed the data. Motivation to participate could have been influenced by the presence of symptoms, which would have skewed the results. The actual prevalence could very well be quite a bit lower than estimated.|$|E

25|$|Though both {{manufacturers}} {{have a broad}} product range in various segments from single-aisle to wide-body, their aircraft do not always compete head-to-head. Instead they respond with models slightly smaller or bigger than the other in order to plug any holes in demand and achieve a better edge. The A380, for example, {{is designed to be}} larger than the 747. The A350XWB competes with <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 787 and {{the low end of the}} 777. The A320 is bigger than the 737-700 but smaller than the 737–800. The A321 is bigger than the 737–900 but smaller than the previous 757-200. Airlines see this as a benefit since they get a more complete product range, from 100 seats to 500 seats, than if both companies offered identical aircraft.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} hoard had a {{group of}} 72 pieces with similar patination and soil crusting, suggesting common burial. There were 7 Mkporo; 19 Nkobnkob-round foot; 9 Nkobnkob-oval foot; and 37 Popo-square foot. The lightest 'Nkobnkobs' in the hoard were 108 gm and 114 gm, while they are routinely found (called Onoudu) under 80 gm, this implies that the group was buried {{at a certain point}} in the size devolution of the manilla. Mkporo are made of brass. The weight correspondence of the oval-foot Nkobnkob with <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> round-foot range suggests that it is either the earlier variety, or contemporary with the earliest round-foots. The exclusive presence of the 'square-foot' variety of French Popo, normally scarce among circulation groups of Popos, suggests that this is the earliest variety. The earliest French manillas as likely to be contemporaries of the earliest British pieces.|$|E
25|$|In energy {{dispersive}} analysis, dispersion and detection are a single operation, {{as already mentioned}} above. Proportional counters or various types of solid-state detectors (PIN diode, Si(Li), Ge(Li), Silicon Drift Detector SDD) are used. They all share the same detection principle: An incoming X-ray photon ionises {{a large number of}} detector atoms with the amount of charge produced being proportional to the energy of the incoming photon. The charge is then collected and the process repeats itself for the next photon. Detector speed is obviously critical, as all charge carriers measured have to come from the same photon to measure the photon energy correctly (peak length discrimination is used to eliminate events that seem to have been produced by two X-ray photons arriving almost simultaneously). The spectrum is then built up by dividing the energy spectrum into discrete bins and counting the number of pulses registered within each energy bin. EDXRF detector types vary in resolution, speed and the means of cooling (a low number of free charge carriers is critical in the solid state detectors): proportional counters with resolutions of several hundred eV cover {{the low end of the}} performance spectrum, followed by PIN diode detectors, while the Si(Li), Ge(Li) and Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) occupy <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance scale.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the best}} known is Miguel Santiago, who sells about forty pieces a year. Some of these sales are {{individual}} pieces and others are multiple sets such as Frida Kalo surrounded by monkeys. Sets are usually sold to foreign buyers for between $300 and $800 USD and have been sent to Europe, Japan and the United States. Sets often take more than a month to make and his work is considered to be in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market. Santiago’s orders extend more than two years in advance. Santiago used to work with a brother and later with a nephew, but today he works mostly solo with his father to help. Another {{of the best}} known {{is one of the few}} female entrepreneurs in the market, Olga Santiago. She does not carve or paint, rather she hires others to do the work while she administrates. However, she signs all the pieces. Many of her carvers and painters are young men who leave quickly to form workshops of their own. While her workshop is not the only one run in this manner, hers is the newest and most successful. Olga’s client base is tourists, which are often brought to her by tour guides, taxi drivers and the like for a commission, and wholesalers.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, American {{companies}} were producing simple home computer kits {{such as the}} MITS Altair and IMSAI 8080. This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices and lower disposable income reduced {{the appeal of the}} American products. New Scientist stated in 1977 that [...] "the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain". Off-the-shelf personal computers were also available for <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> market but were extremely expensive; Olivetti's offering cost £2,000, and the Commodore PET, launched in 1979, sold for £700.

500|$|Two {{radiocarbon}} datings to {{find the}} age of the bones suggested dates of 1430–60 and 1412–49—both too early for Richard's death in 1485. Mass spectrometry carried out on the bones found evidence of much seafood consumption, which is known to make radiocarbon dating samples appear older than they are. [...] A Bayesian analysis suggested there was a 68.2% probability that the true date of the bones was between 1475 and 1530, rising to 95.4% for between 1450 and 1540. Although by itself not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard's, it was consistent with the date of his death. The mass spectrometry result indicating the rich seafood diet was confirmed by a chemical isotope analysis of two teeth, a femur and a rib. From the isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the teeth and bones the researchers discovered the diet included much freshwater fish and exotic birds such as swan, crane and heron, and a vast quantity of wine— all items at <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> luxury market. Close analysis of the soil immediately below the skeleton revealed that the man had been infested with roundworm parasites when he died.|$|E

500|$|The 1940s and 1950s are {{generally}} regarded as the [...] "classic period" [...] of American film noir. While City Streets and other pre-WWII crime melodramas such as Fury (1936) and You Only Live Once (1937), both directed by Fritz Lang, are categorized as full-fledged noir in Alain Silver and Elizabeth Ward's film noir encyclopedia, other critics tend to describe them as [...] "proto-noir" [...] or in similar terms. The film now most commonly cited as the first [...] "true" [...] film noir is Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), directed by Latvian-born, Soviet-trained Boris Ingster. Hungarian émigré Peter Lorre—who had starred in Lang's M—was top-billed, {{though he did not}} play the lead. He later played secondary roles in several other formative American noirs. Though modestly budgeted, at <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B movie scale, Stranger on the Third Floor still lost its studio, RKO, $56,000, almost a third of its total cost. Variety magazine found Ingster's work [...] "too studied and when original, lacks the flare to hold attention. It's a film too arty for average audiences, and too humdrum for others." [...] Stranger on the Third Floor was not recognized as the beginning of a trend, let alone a new genre, for many decades.|$|E
500|$|On May24, 2012, NOAA {{released}} their {{forecast for}} the season, predicting a near-normal season, with nine to fifteen named storms, {{four to eight}} hurricanes, and one to three major hurricanes.

Gerry Bell, lead seasonal forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, added the main uncertainty in the outlook was how much below or above the 2012 season would be, and whether <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predicted range is reached dependent on whether El Niño develops or stays in its current Neutral phase. That same day, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) issued a forecast of a below-average season. They predicted 10named storms with a 70% chance that the number would be between 7 and 13. However, they do not issue forecasts {{on the number of}} hurricanes and major hurricanes. They also predicted an ACE index of 90 with a 70% chance that the index would be in the range 28 to 152. On May30, 2012, the Florida State University for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU COAPS) issued its annual Atlantic hurricane season forecast.
