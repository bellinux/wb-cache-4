500|$|Midnight Sun {{was known}} for his calm disposition; it wasn't {{uncommon}} for stablehands at his home, Harlinsdale Farm near Franklin, Tennessee, to let visiting children ride him bareback, so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> they rode a two-time world grand champion. In 1956 he was bought by Eleanor and Geraldine Livingston at the Harlinsdale Farm dispersal sale, for $50,000. The Livingstons stipulated that Midnight Sun be kept at Harlinsdale under the same routine he had had for most of his life. He continued to stand at stud on the farm until his death, and was handled and groomed nearly all his life by Red Laws, who died within a year of the horse's death. Midnight Sun was never turned out, and Laws once said, [...] "Somebody had hold of him all his life." [...] In all, he lived at Harlinsdale Farm for 21 years. Midnight Sun died of colic on November 7, 1965, and was buried at Harlinsdale Farm, where his grave is still visible today.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was until}} {{recently}} {{thought that the}} Maya may have adopted writing from the Olmec or Epi-Olmec culture, who used the Isthmian script. However, murals excavated in 2005 have pushed back the origin of Maya writing by several centuries, and it now seems possible that the Maya {{were the ones who}} invented writing in Mesoamerica. Regardless, it is [...] that the Maya developed the only complete writing system in Mesoamerica, meaning that they were the only civilization that could write everything <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Scientology {{administrator}} Peggy Crawford said in {{a statement}} to The Commercial Appeal: [...] "We definitely believe in God and we believe in individuals as spiritual beings." [...] Professor Paul Blankenship of the Memphis Theological Seminary studied Scientology and commented on this view, saying [...] "They do not do a lot of talking about God or Jesus. It's more getting your mind cleared, and I could see how <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that that could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition. They may very well develop." ...|$|E

2500|$|I had polio, and I {{was totally}} paralyzed, and the {{inflammation}} {{was so great}} that I had a sensory paralysis too. I could move my eyes and my hearing was undisturbed. I got very lonesome lying in bed, unable to move anything except my eyeballs. I was quarantined on the farm with seven sisters, one brother, two parents, and a practical nurse. And how could I entertain myself? I started watching people and my environment. I soon learned that my sisters could say [...] "no" [...] when they meant [...] "yes." [...] And <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> [...] "yes" [...] and mean [...] "no" [...] at the same time. They could offer another sister an apple and hold it back. And I began studying nonverbal language and body language.|$|E
2500|$|A {{small number}} of clergymen at Dachau were held in private cells in the bunker. These {{included}} high profile inmates Dr. Johannes Neuhäusler, a Catholic auxiliary Bishop from Munich and the Protestant pastor Reverend Martin Niemöller. In 1940, [...] "the German bishops and the Pope had persuaded Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler to concentrate all the priests imprisoned in the various concentration camps into one camp, and to house them all together in separate blocks with a chapel where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> Mass. In early December 1940, the priests already in Dachau were put into Barracks Block 26 {{near the end of}} the camp street. Within two weeks, they were joined by around 800 to 900 priests from Buchenwald, Mauthausen, Sachsenhausen, Auschwitz and other camps, who were put into Blocks 28 and 30. Block 30 was later converted into an infirmary barrack".|$|E
2500|$|Upon ordination, she {{was interviewed}} by some synagogues for her “public value, so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> they were first”, as she says, but others would not speak to her, {{and she was the}} last of her class to get a job. She was offered a {{position}} at Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in New York City, where she served for seven years under Rabbi Edward Klein, first as Assistant Rabbi and then as Associate Rabbi, leaving the congregation in 1979, when she realised that she would not succeed Klein as senior rabbi. Not able to find a full-time position, she served as part-time rabbi of Temple Beth El in Elizabeth, New Jersey and as Chaplain at Manhattan's Lenox Hill Hospital till 1981, when she became rabbi of Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls, New Jersey. She originally thought her “obligation was to get a bigger ...|$|E

60|$|Turnbull and MacIan {{looked at}} each other, and said more than <b>they</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>say</b> with tongues or swords. Among other things they said that to that {{particular}} Head of the institution it {{was a waste of}} time to appeal, and they followed Dr. Quayle out of the room.|$|R
2500|$|On December 28, the day {{the game}} was shipped to stores, Bungie's head-office was {{contacted}} by their Japanese publisher, who informed them a woman working on the Asian translation of the game had discovered a major bug in the Windows version. She had installed {{the game in the}} root directory of her hard drive, and then used the uninstall program to uninstall it. The game was successfully uninstalled, but much of the contents of her hard drive were also erased. Jason Jones attempted to replicate the problem, quickly discovering what was wrong, and figuring out how to correct the faulty code. However, roughly 200,000 copies of the game were already in transit to major retail stores across North America. Jones, Alex Seropian, Doug Zartman, Diane Donohue, and David Joost (sales and marketing director) quickly convened a meeting to decide what to do. The team essentially had two choices. On the one hand, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> nothing, and quietly fix the bug in a patch that would be immediately made available for download on their website. In favor of this course of action, it was argued that installing a game to the root directory of a hard drive was an unusual thing to do, something there was little chance of anyone repeating, and so it was unlikely anyone would ever encounter the bug. The other option was to publicly announce the problem and recall the game. This is what they did. According to Jones, ...|$|E

50|$|Health {{officials}} <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> {{that the}} contaminated water from Crestwood's municipal well caused any illness. They {{also said that}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> the water did not cause any of the cancers identified. The officials said that {{they will continue to}} monitor the incidence of cancer in the village and that in many cases the cancers caused by contaminated water may take ten to twenty years to develop.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} {{there came a}} message from the banking house: Mr. Wraxton had gone to Brussels that morning. Fuguet did not live in Paris, and the captain had never seen him. There were clerks whom he had met in Marseilles, but, of course, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only <b>say</b> that he was the man known as Captain Horn.|$|R
60|$|Not {{more than}} a minute had elapsed after her {{withdrawal}} when Tess woke, and then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed them, though <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> what; and the uneasy feeling which it engendered grew stronger. As soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned the lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.|$|R

5000|$|... "I {{wanted it}} to be a faceless entity, because I didn’t want to be 'Dhani Harrison and the Uncles', or whatever. There was just too much flak around the name 'Harrison' at the time. I started the band so I could send anyone to a meeting, and when they were asked who <b>they</b> were, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> simply <b>say</b> 'The New No. 2.'" ...|$|R
60|$|It was all <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say.</b> The {{situation}} was new, unheard of, incredible; {{they could not}} understand it, {{they did not know}} how to take hold of it, it approximately paralyzed speech.|$|E

5|$|When Obsidian were {{preparing}} to present Knights of the Old Republic II at E3 2004, they tried to fit {{as much information as}} <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>saying</b> that it would need to be a duration of 30 minutes as it was the only E3 event it would be showcased at; however, due to the limited time frame, they would have to cut it down to a five- to ten-minute presentation. During this time, none of the levels Obsidian designed were ready to be shown, so they picked three levels, and put them through a schedule to finish them on time. The demo was finished {{a few days before the}} event, and the game was presented in May 2004. The first trailer for Knights of the Old Republic II was later unveiled in July 2004, and the official website was launched in October.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} of the fifth day that the lads observed a sail in the distance. It was indeed so far away that, as the light was fading, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>say</b> with absolute certainty that it was the longed-for ship. They both felt convinced, however, that they had seen a sail; and watched intently, as night darkened, for some sign of its passage.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} Thursday of Whitsun-week when Lady Adela and Bertha {{came down}} from their visit of inquiry, a little more hopeful than on the {{previous}} day, though <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not yet <b>say</b> that recovery was setting in.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} I rose {{up and told}} them I could not stand it, and I was going home. Nothing <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> availed, and my uncle {{went down to the}} stage-office with me and took my passage back.|$|E
