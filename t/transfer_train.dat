40|$|Organisations {{wishing to}} enhance their return on {{investment}} from training must understand the variables associated with <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> {{so that they can}} promote those which enable transfer and intervene to limit those which inhibit transfer. In the international literature on <b>training</b> <b>transfer,</b> researchers and practitioners have acknowledged that <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> will occur only when trainees have the desire or motivation to <b>transfer</b> <b>training</b> to the job. In Malaysia, despite increasing investment in public sector training, there has been very little research on <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> This thesis contributes to a greater understanding of <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> variables and how they affect trainees’ motivation to <b>transfer</b> their <b>training.</b> Further, as the role of training has progressively changed from a focus on programs to a broader focus on learning, creating and sharing knowledge, this thesis tests the hypothesis that knowledge sharing behaviour influences a trainee’s motivation to <b>transfer</b> their <b>training.</b> Using a research framework constructed from an adaptation of two key Human Resource Development models (Holton 1996; Holton et al. 2000) and the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen 1991), this thesis explores the contention that trainees’ motivation to <b>transfer</b> <b>training</b> is influenced by a number of secondary influence variables, expected utility variables, transfer climate variables, enabling variables and ability variables as well as the variables associated with sharing behaviour. Through a questionnaire administered to 437 government employees attending training programs in the National Institute of Public Administration, a central training organisation for government employees in Malaysia, the thesis created an empirical database from which to study the phenomenon of <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> This work culminated {{in the development of a}} structural model for motivation to <b>transfer</b> <b>training</b> which incorporates knowledge sharing behaviour and extends our understanding of the operation of the precursors to motivation to transfer. The findings of this thesis impact on HRD functions in the Malaysian public sector at two broad levels: pre training and post training. The thesis makes a contribution to both HRD practice by detailing the sorts of HRD activities which will enhance <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> and secondly, makes a contribution to theory through the creation of a new model of motivation to <b>transfer</b> <b>training</b> which features knowledge sharing behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Discriminative {{tracking}} methods use binary classification {{to discriminate}} between the foreground and background and have achieved some useful results. However, the use of labeled training samples is insufficient for them to achieve accurate tracking. Hence, discriminative classifiers must use their own classification results to update themselves, which may lead to feedback-induced tracking drift. To overcome these problems, we propose a semisupervised tracking algorithm that uses deep representation and transfer learning. Firstly, a 2 D multilayer deep belief network is trained with {{a large amount of}} unlabeled samples. The nonlinear mapping point {{at the top of this}} network is subtracted as the feature dictionary. Then, this feature dictionary is utilized to <b>transfer</b> <b>train</b> and update a deep tracker. The positive samples for training are the tracked vehicles, and the negative samples are the background images. Finally, a particle filter is used to estimate vehicle position. We demonstrate experimentally that our proposed vehicle tracking algorithm can effectively restrain drift while also maintaining the adaption of vehicle appearance. Compared with similar algorithms, our method achieves a better tracking success rate and fewer average central-pixel errors...|$|E

One way to facilitate <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> is to perform a post-training intervention designed to increase <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> This dissertation has four main purposes. The first purpose was to test the effects of two post-training interventions, relapse prevention and transfer enhancement, in a 2 x 2 experimental design. The two interventions were designed to increase <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> by increasing self-efficacy for the training task, or a person's belief {{in his or her}} ability to perform the training task. Subjects were 147 nurses from one hospital who participated in a two day workshop. Self-efficacy and <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> were measured by both self-reports and supervisor reports at two and six months following training. Contrary to prediction, the two post-training interventions did not result in higher <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> than the control group. It is suggested that the training itself was effective in increasing self-efficacy and in leading to <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> in control subjects, making post-training interventions redundant for this training program. The second purpose was to test the effect of "motivation to learn" on <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> Strong support was found for the hypothesis that "motivation to learn" is positively related to <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> The third purpose of the dissertation was to examine the process by which <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> occurs.

40|$|In {{response}} to ever changing business demands, business organisations invest heavily in training programs, {{with the expectation}} that training will update employees’ knowledge and skills and improve their performance. For training to be beneficial it needs however to be transferred back to the workplace. This entails that trainees effectively apply what they have learned in training in their job and that this leads to meaningful changes in work performance (Blume, Ford, Baldwin, & Huang, 2010; Newstrom, 1986). Research, however, indicates that <b>training</b> <b>transfer</b> outcomes are low and suggest minimal return on investment in <b>training.</b> Therefore, <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> has become a critical issue in research. Numerous empirical studies have examined <b>training</b> <b>transfer</b> and the factors that affect the <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> One of such factors is support of the supervisor, which has been established {{as one of the most}} critical work environment factors that affect <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> (e. g. Brinkerhoff & Montesino, 1995; Chiaburu, Van Dam, & Hutchins, 2010; Clarke, 2002; Colquitt, LePine, & Noe, 2000; Cromwell & Kolb, 2004; Hawley & Barnard, 2005; Lim & Johnson, 2002). In general terms, supervisor support can be described as the extent to which supervisors reinforce and support the use of training on the job (Holton et al., 1997). Yet, there continue to be gaps in the literature regarding the specific supervisory behaviours that influence transfer (Baldwin & Ford, 1988; Hawley & Barnard, 2005; Van Der Klink, Gielen, & Nauta, 2001). For the most part supervisory support has indeed been studied as a generic construct, and little is known about specific supervisory behaviours that increase <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> (McSherry & Taylor, 1994). It proves therefore interesting to further examine the content of the supervisor’s role in <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> (Van Der Klink et al., 2001). The aim of this doctoral project is therefore to expand the theoretical grounding underpinning empirical work on the role of the supervisor in <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> and to provide further insight into the relationship between supervisory support and <b>training</b> <b>transfer.</b> More specifically, the focus will be on investigating the role of the supervisor in <b>training</b> <b>transfer</b> at a deeper level of specificity: in terms of specific behaviours and attitudes adopted by supervisors to support <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Advisors: Dr. Kristen McMaster, Dr. Stanley Deno. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 265 pages, appendices A-G. The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the effects of explicitly teaching for transfer of PALS, and to examine whether <b>transfer</b> <b>training</b> helped participants maintain the strategy taught. Sixty-two participants from two third-grade classrooms and one fourth-grade classroom participated in the study. A pretest-posttest-maintenance control group design was used, in which participants within classroom were matched on their one-min oral reading scores and assigned randomly to receive PALS plus <b>transfer</b> <b>training</b> (n = 31) or PALS practice only (n = 31). Proximal and distal measures were used to assess transfer. Proximal measures were defined as measures closely aligned to the intervention and included main idea identification of narrative and informational text. Distal measures assessed general reading competence and were not closely aligned to the strategy taught. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted with time (pretest, posttest, and maintenance) as the within-subject factor, and treatment (PALS vs. PALS plus <b>transfer</b> <b>training)</b> as the between-subjects factor. On the main idea identification of narrative text, there was a significant main effect of time, but the main effect of condition and the interaction of time by condition was non-significant. On the main idea identification of informational text, there was a significant main effect of time, and the interaction of time by condition approached significance, with participants receiving PALS plus <b>transfer</b> <b>training</b> correctly identifying and producing more main idea statement (ES =. 04). On the distal measures, there were significant main effects of time, but no significant effects of condition, or interactions of time by condition. Implications for educational practice and future research directions are discussed...|$|R

A midsize nonprofit {{blood bank}} {{organization}} {{is experiencing a}} high percentage of supervisors and managers not transferring skills taught in leadership development training programs back to the workplace. The purpose of this mixed methods, sequential, explanatory study was to understand the relationship between supervisor support or opposition and trainees 2 ̆ 7 perception on factors that influence <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> and to identify strategies to improve <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> in the organization. Baldwin and Ford 2 ̆ 7 s Model of the <b>training</b> <b>transfer</b> process laid the framework for this study. Quantitative data were collected from trainees (N = 60) who attended leadership development programs between January 2012 and June 2014 and were analyzed using descriptive analysis, correlational analysis, and multiple regression. The correlation analysis indicated positive relationships between <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> and supervisor support. Qualitative data, collected during interviews (N = 8) that focused on trainees 2 ̆ 7 perceptions on how to enhance <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> in the organization, corroborated the quantitative results. According to thematic analyses of the interview data, supervisor support, training design, opportunity to use skills on the job, and performance coaching and mentoring have the potential to improve <b>training</b> <b>transfer.</b> Policy recommendations were created to increase <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> back to the workplace. The findings of the study could help supervisors and managers increase <b>training</b> <b>transfer,</b> which could improve the organization 2 ̆ 7 s profits and create collaborative learning environments that benefit the participants and the communities where these participants live and work...|$|R

The work environment was operationalized in terms of <b>transfer</b> of <b>training</b> climate and continuous-learning culture. Climate and culture were hypothesized to have both direct and moderating effects on posttraining behaviors. Accounting for pretraining behaviors and knowledge gained in training, the results {{from a series of}} LISREL analyses showed that both climate and culture were directly related to posttraining behaviors. In particular, the social support system appeared to {{play a central role in}} the <b>transfer</b> of <b>training.</b> Moderating effects were not found.
