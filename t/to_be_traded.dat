5|$|Helped by Gilchrist's {{running and}} quarterback Kemp's passing, the Bills {{finished}} the 1964 {{season with a}} 12–2 record and won the AFL championship. The team won despite drama involving Gilchrist, who came into conflict with Saban frequently and asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded</b> on numerous occasions. The Bills released him on waivers in November 1964, but canceled the move when Gilchrist apologized. After the 1964 AFL championship win over the Chargers, Saban was named the league's coach of the year.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, the Lakers won 26 {{of their first}} 39 games, but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40. They were eliminated {{in the first round}} by Phoenix again. Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded</b> in the offseason. Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.|$|E

On February 21, 2001 Miller was sent to the Los Angeles Kings by the Colorado Avalanche with Adam Deadmarsh, a player later to be named (Jared Aulin, who would be traded on March 22, 2001) and Colorado's 1st round choices in the 2001 (Dave Steckel) and 2003 (Brian Boyle) Entry Drafts for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht.

5|$|Despite lack of run support {{contributing}} to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a Cy Young candidate. On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter {{in the top of}} the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, and 108 pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was frequently mentioned as a candidate <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded</b> in the offseason to bolster the Phillies' lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{also made}} his NHL debut during the 1997–98 season.

5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded</b> after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{missed the}} first month of the season with a {{hamstring}} injury, and continued to harbor ill feelings toward La Russa that had developed after spring training ended. In a closed-door meeting in mid-May, La Russa asked Smith if he would like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded.</b> Instead, Smith and his agent negotiated a compromise with Cardinals management, agreeing to a buyout of special provisions in his contract in conjunction with Smith announcing his retirement. The agreement prompted a press conference at Busch Stadium on June 19, 1996, during which Smith announced he would retire from baseball at season's end.|$|E

5|$|The Blue Jackets {{began the}} year with the worst start in {{franchise}} history and the worst by any team in an NHL season in 19 years. After an 11–25–5 start, Head Coach Scott Arniel was fired and replaced by Assistant Coach Todd Richards. The poor season prompted several personnel changes including the trade of All-Star forward Jeff Carter, who was acquired with much fanfare during the off-season. With the prospect of another rebuild looming the Blue Jackets' captain and best player, Rick Nash, requested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded,</b> though he would remain with the team for the entire season.|$|E

Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and woven into valuable textiles in order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded.</b>|$|E

5|$|The team {{started the}} 1977–78 {{season with a}} 50–10 mark, and some {{predicted}} a dynasty in Portland. However, Bill Walton suffered a foot injury that ended his season and would plague him over {{the remainder of his}} career, and the team struggled to an 8–14 finish, going 58–24 overall. In the playoffs, Portland lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the 1978 conference semifinals. That summer, Walton demanded <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded</b> to a team of his choice (Clippers, Knicks, Warriors, or 76ers) because he was unhappy with his medical treatment in Portland. Walton was never traded, and he held out the entire 1978–79 season and left the team as a free agent thereafter. The team was further dismantled as Lucas left in 1980.|$|E
5|$|At the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, the Islanders traded Brewer, Josh Green {{and their}} second round {{selection}} (Brad Winchester) {{in the same}} draft to the Edmonton Oilers for Roman Hamrlík. Although surprised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded,</b> Brewer was excited {{at the prospect of}} playing for the Oilers, who saw Brewer as a top-four defenceman. However, Brewer's Oiler career began on a sour note as he suffered a bruised left hip and tailbone in his first game with the team. Brewer missed the next four games before returning to the lineup. Brewer scored his first goal as an Oiler on November 7, 2000, against the New York Rangers. Brewer finished his first Oiler season with career highs in goals, assists and points, as well as the best plus/minus rating on the Oilers team, a plus-15. Further, Brewer gained his first NHL playoff experience, a quarterfinal series versus the Dallas Stars. Brewer had six points, but the Oilers were eliminated four games to two by the Stars.|$|E
5|$|Off the field, {{the season}} was one of much {{conflict}} for Ramirez. Persistent trade rumors (generally involving the New York Mets) dogged him all season. After the Red Sox were eliminated {{in the first round}} of that year's playoffs by the eventual World Series champion Chicago White Sox, Ramirez once again expressed a wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>traded.</b> This included a threat to not show up for spring training if his latest demand was not met by Red Sox GM Theo Epstein. Toward this end, in December 2005, Ramirez put his Ritz-Carlton condominium up for sale. Trade rumors circulated with Ramirez possibly going to the Baltimore Orioles or the New York Mets, but no deal was reached. By January 5, 2006, Ramirez changed his mind, stating that he was dropping the demand. His agents, in turn, insisted their client was still open to a trade. But no deal materialized.|$|E
