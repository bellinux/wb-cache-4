40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} research {{carried out}} using a quadded logic cell (QLC) structure {{with the purpose}} of creating a fault tolerant strategy for stuck-at faults. In order to create the tolerant built-in behaviour, the basic logic elements must have resilience against transistor level stuck-at failures. To achieve this, we add fine-grained redundancy to the transistor structure of the individual logic gates. In our research NAND gates which are been used throughout the QLC design. Simulation data shows that the chosen enhanced NAND gate structure can cope with single random stuck-at fault and if not indicates it through a distinct current indication. The QLC design contains four individual <b>logic</b> <b>units</b> which can be configured to perform four different types of two input logic functions. The QLC contains an interconnection structure that links three <b>logic</b> <b>units</b> to form a logic structure with four inputs and one output. This fixed internal structure revolves clockwise in four steps in a “round-robin” time redundancy scheme to create a set number of results. Through a majority voting a combined overall output result gets generated. Individual comparison of each clock cycle result against the voted result reveals the cycle and <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> combination in which the faulty result has been generated. In this case alteration of the individual <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> configuration has been used to generate another set of results for pattern mapping to identify the single <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> within the QLC. After identification a self-initiated <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> replacement with a spare unit happens. An additional detection method based on power rail grading of the individual <b>logic</b> <b>units</b> is devised to enable built-in classification of the stuck-at fault occurring within the unit and subsequently to trigger self-repair. These features are intended to be self-coordinated without requiring outside influence, making this resulting design capable of autonomous self-healing under specific failure conditions...|$|R

30|$|The drastic shift also {{occurred}} in the technological landscape. The <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> experienced a technology transition: from hard-wired logic to soft-wired <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> based on microprocessor unit (MPU). In 1975, Fanuc possessed a stable technology and a dominant share of the NC market, based on its hard-wired NC system: the <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> implemented with transistors, diodes, and other integrated circuits. In this system, however, at each run of the work process, a paper-tape has to be mounted into the tape-reading device. For example, 100 mountings into the reader has to be repeated in order to process 100  units of works. It is obvious, therefore, that this system is not viable since the paper tape will wear out after 100 repetitions. In contrast, the use of MPUs means that logic operations are carried out by software. Therefore, if the soft-wired NC becomes available, it would mark a significant transition.|$|R

This paper presents an efficient way to realize reversible arithmetic circuits especially targeting toward reversible arithmetic <b>logic</b> <b>unit</b> (RALU).
