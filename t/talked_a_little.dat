500|$|Boyd has {{previously}} {{written about the}} 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: [...] "I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost as real as the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on—a long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century." [...] Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depiciting Mountstuart as swept along {{in the flow of}} history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes [...] "Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than I." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E

2500|$|During initial {{interrogation}} {{without a}} lawyer, the police used suggestive question techniques to introduce Andersen {{to the idea}} that Viggo Kristiansen was a participant and even the leading force of the crime. The interrogator wrote the following in the police rapport: [...] "I explained for Andersen that the police now knew {{he was one of the}} perpetrators. I also told Andersen about the advantages he would get by explaining everything", and furthermore: [...] "I asked Andersen if he himself could be a victim in some sense since his best buddy Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant. When I said this, it was obvious that Andersen got something to think about. We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit back and forth about the relationship between Andersen and Kristiansen, and there was no doubt that Kristiansen was the strong one, the one in charge".|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, {{the couple}} were seen rowing out on Big Moose Lake near Covewood Lodge. Gillette had entered the {{pseudonym}} [...] "Carl Grahm" [...] in the hotel register (Gillette's suitcase was monogrammed [...] "C.E.G.", and he was careful to choose a name with the same initials). Gillette {{is believed to have}} struck Brown over the head with a tennis racket, as the result of which she fell out of the boat and drowned. Gillette returned alone, and gave varying explanations for what had occurred. Brown's body was found the next day, and Gillette was arrested in the nearby town of Inlet. The defense at trial attempted to explain that Grace was perplexed and at a point just jumped out of the boat, and into the water. Gillette testified, [...] "We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more, then she got up and jumped in the water, just jumped in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E
