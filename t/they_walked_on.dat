5|$|In August 1870, Seward {{embarked}} on another trip, this time westbound around the world. With him was Olive Risley, {{daughter of a}} Treasury Department official, to whom he became close in his final year in Washington. They visited Japan, then China, where <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> the Great Wall. During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus {{putting an end to}} gossip and the fears of his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.|$|E
25|$|Wellnhofer {{studied the}} range of motion in the hip and hind limbs of three-dimensionally {{preserved}} pterosaur fossils from the Crato Formation of Brazil for insight into their terrestrial gait. He concluded that <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> all fours.|$|E
25|$|Gummo Marx, {{the fifth}} of the Marx brothers, who quit the act during the family's {{vaudeville}} days and thus never appeared in a Marx Brothers film, was nicknamed by Art Fisher based on his habit of always wearing gumshoes. While all the other performers wore street shoes, and thus made a loud noise when <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> a hardwood stage, Milton (Gummo) was known for startling people by appearing suddenly from out of nowhere, because the gumshoes on his feet gave him a nearly soundless footfall.|$|E

25|$|Eurypterus did not swim to hunt, {{rather they}} simply swam {{in order to}} move from one feeding site to another quickly. Most of the time <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> the {{substrate}} with their legs (including their swimming leg). They were generalist species, equally likely to engage in predation or scavenging. They hunted small soft-bodied invertebrates like worms. They utilized the mass of spines on their front appendages to both kill and hold them while they used their chelicerae to rip off pieces small enough to swallow. Young individuals may also have fallen prey to cannibalism by larger adults.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} of Houston knew a powerful storm had blown through {{and had made}} ready to provide assistance. Workers set out by rail and ship for the island almost immediately. Rescuers arrived to find the city completely destroyed. It is believed 8,000people—20% of the island's population—had lost their lives. Estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000. Most had drowned or been crushed as the waves pounded the debris that had been their homes hours earlier. Many survived the storm itself but died after several days being trapped under {{the wreckage of the}} city, with rescuers unable to reach them. The rescuers could hear the screams of the survivors as <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> the debris trying to rescue those they could. A further 30,000 were left homeless.|$|E
25|$|When Aeschylus {{first began}} writing, the theatre {{had only just}} begun to evolve, {{although}} earlier playwrights like Thespis had already expanded the cast to include an actor {{who was able to}} interact with the chorus. Aeschylus added a second actor, allowing for greater dramatic variety, while the chorus played a less important role. He is sometimes credited with introducing skenographia, or scene-decoration, though Aristotle gives this distinction to Sophocles. Aeschylus is also said to have made the costumes more elaborate and dramatic, and having his actors wear platform boots (cothurni) to make them more visible to the audience. According to a later account of Aeschylus's life, as <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> stage in the first performance of the Eumenides, the chorus of Furies were so frightening in appearance that they caused young children to faint, patriarchs to urinate, and pregnant women to go into labour.|$|E
60|$|Finding him so ignorant, the Frogman {{proposed}} that <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> and seek Cayke's dishpan elsewhere. Wiljon the Winkie {{did not seem}} greatly impressed by the great Frogman, which seemed to that personage as strange as it was disappointing. But others in this unknown land might prove more respectful.|$|R

5000|$|Entrance/West Plaza paving: Pathways paved on {{the west}} {{entrance}} plaza of the stadium are created by Venezuelan-born and Parisian-based kinetic-op artist Carlos Cruz-Diez. It's entitled Chromatic Induction in a Double Frequency and uses 1-inch tiles to form a rhythmic pattern that perceptibly changes for visitors as <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> it and at times almost seems to vibrate.|$|R
25|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{pterosaur}} biology invited controversy from the beginning. Samuel Thomas von Soemmering ignited a multi-century {{debate over how}} pterosaurs walked on the ground by suggesting they crawled on all fours like bats. August Quenstedt, by contrast, argued that <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> their hind limbs. In the early 20th century, Hankin and Watson in the first major study of pterosaur flight biomechanics concluded that on the ground these reptiles were altogether helpless and could only scoot along on their stomachs like penguins. The debate gained steam in 1957 when William Stokes reported unusual tracks left by a four-footed animal he suspected was a pterosaur walking along the ground. In 1984, Kevin Padian, who had recently argued that pterosaurs walked on their hind legs, dismissed Stokes's tracks as those of a crocodilian. However, in the mid-1990s, Jean-Michel Mazin and others reported that fossil footprints in Crayssac, France {{were similar to those}} reported by Stokes from the US. Mazin's tracks were more obviously pterosaurian in origin and settled the debate in favor of pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E
500|$|Like other theropods, dromaeosaurids were bipedal; that is, <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> <b>on</b> their hind legs. However, {{whereas most}} theropods walked with three toes {{contacting}} the ground, fossilized footprint tracks confirm that many early paravian groups, including the dromaeosaurids, held the second toe {{off the ground}} in a hyperextended position, with only the third and fourth toes bearing the weight of the animal. This is called functional didactyly. The enlarged second toe bore an unusually large, curved, falciform (sickle-shaped, alt. drepanoid) claw (held off the ground or 'retracted' when walking), which is thought to have been used in capturing prey and climbing trees (see [...] "Claw function" [...] below). This claw was especially blade-like in the large-bodied predatory eudromaeosaurs. One possible dromaeosaurid species, Balaur bondoc, also possessed a first toe which was highly modified in parallel with the second. Both the first and second toes on each foot of B. bondoc were also held retracted and bore enlarged, sickle-shaped claws.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{said that}} the twin sons of Jóhonaaʼéí descended from the sky {{to the top of}} , the Blue Bead Mountain, and came down the {{mountain}} on its south slope.

[...] "We have come to find , the Big Giant," [...] said the twins. [...] "He is huge, and very powerful," [...] said Holy Boy. [...] "Each day he comes late in the day to , to drink from the lake." [...] The next day at dawn the brothers walked to [...] and stood beside the large lake. [...] They took one of the chain lightning arrows their father had given them and shot it at a slab of high rock overhanging the base of Tsoodził. [...] The arrow struck the rock with such force that it shattered and fell where it remains today. [...] "With such weapons as these we cannot fail," [...] they said.|$|E

5000|$|One very {{distinguishing}} {{habit of}} marsh rabbits is that <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> all fours, placing each foot down alternately like a cat.

[...] The major characteristic of the footprint pattern not seen in other rabbits is widely spread toes.|$|R
