40|$|Abstract: In recent years, <b>the</b> <b>programming</b> {{learning}} {{has been widely}} applied to support the training of the problem solving skill in universities and senior high schools. With our observations, there is a learning gap from a novice who can recognize <b>the</b> <b>program</b> statement <b>to</b> a well-trained programmer who can write a correct <b>program</b> <b>to</b> solve a given problem. The experience of problem solving is important for learners to understand the different expression of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> syntax. <b>To</b> aid <b>the</b> novice learner learn <b>the</b> <b>programming,</b> our idea {{is to use the}} mastery learning theory with “learning by example ” strategy. <b>The</b> <b>programs</b> of classical problems are collected and novice learners are asked to trace the problem solving process of <b>the</b> <b>programs.</b> <b>To</b> collect <b>the</b> learning feedbacks from learners, the buggy patterns relating <b>to</b> different <b>programming</b> capabilities are embedded in <b>the</b> original sample <b>programs</b> <b>to</b> facilitate <b>the</b> error detection assessment. If the detection of the embedded bugs can not correctly done by novice learners, these symptoms are recorded as portfolio for further misconception analysis.

5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, some major units were disbanded {{and a lot}} of {{equipment}} was phased out or scrapped due to a severe shortage of funds. The whole land forces structure was reorganized from armies into territorial corps, and from regiments into battalions. In the mid-1990s, the situation of the land forces was critical: the military budget was three times lower than in 1989 (636 million dollars), 50% of the equipment was older than 30 years, and 60% of the armoured vehicles and 85% of the missile units were non-operational. Due to lack of fuel and training, the level of combat readiness and military capability was extremely low (only about 30% of the entire land forces were operational). However, after 1996 the government took serious action; the military budget was increased greatly, and modernisation of equipment commenced. Officially, <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>to</b> modernize and restructure the armed forces began on 11 April 2000.|$|E

Option 2 was to restructure <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>to</b> provide 23 Increment I aircraft; at an additional cost of $6.4billion and would be operational by 2012. Option 3 was a restructure to provide 19 Increment I aircraft to replace the current fleet; the additional cost for this option was estimated at $5.6billion and the entry into service by 2012. The last option was to upgrade and extend life of current fleet {{at a cost of}} $1.4billion; however this would not meet the standards required for future presidential helicopters, and would require replacement sooner.|$|E
5|$|In April 1955, a Caltrans {{official}} {{announced that}} US 80 {{would be built}} as a freeway for its entire length in California, {{as it was to}} be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further along on US 101, the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Hegland raised the issue in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego. State Senator Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking the delay to damaging <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>to</b> develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built.|$|E
