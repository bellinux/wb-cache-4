The chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was fairly well known, although it did yield a few surprises, but that of plutonium was almost completely unknown. The element had only been discovered a short time before, and existed only in microgram amounts. Educated guesses about its chemistry tended to be wrong, and as research progressed it was found to have unusual properties, including no less than six allotropes. There was rivalry between its discoverers, with Wahl and Kennedy's group at Los Alamos competing with Seaborg's in Chicago to produce the best process for purifying the metal. This competition ended abruptly when Segrè's group at Los Alamos discovered that high levels of a hitherto undiscovered plutonium-240 isotope in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, and a high degree of purity was therefore unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium <b>tamper</b> which would reflect the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E

Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Food <b>tampering</b> in foodservice facilities, {{especially}} with self-serve foods, {{can result in}} consumer illness or injury and adversely affect the foodservice organization. This study explored foodservice managers' awareness and perceptions of risk and evaluated a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) -based program of food <b>tampering</b> hazard reduction developed for managers. The study had two phases, descriptive and experimental. The purpose of phase one was to determine food <b>tampering</b> awareness and opinions, to obtain descriptive information about foodservice managers and their facilities, and to identify the population for phase two. The purpose of phase two was to evaluate an educational workbook, which had been developed by the researcher, using a post-test for the experimental and control samples. One thousand foodservice managers in commercial and non-commercial foodservices were contacted by mailed questionnaires in phase one; 376 continued on to phase two, one-half received both a food <b>tampering</b> risk reduction self-instructional workbook and a post-test; 238 completed the study. The post-test included a food <b>tampering</b> hazard inspection form used to evaluate facilities. The managers' changes in opinions and actions to reduce food <b>tampering</b> hazards and their understanding of a HACCP-based program were identified and comparisons made through chi square analyses. More non-commercial foodservice managers than commercial managers had college degrees, {{but there was no}} significant association between education level and food <b>tampering</b> concern. Managers with self-serve foods reported greater concern than those without; managers aware of food <b>tampering</b> reported greater concern. Managers who had received the self-instructional workbook had greater ability to identify food <b>tampering</b> hazards through floor plan evaluation. No significant changes in food <b>tampering</b> concern or intent to take action to reduce risk were found after the post-test. However, increased awareness led to a trend of increased concern. It was concluded that the questionnaire and post-test both had educational effects on the participants.

5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were enough for two sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the <b>tamper.</b> Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated.
