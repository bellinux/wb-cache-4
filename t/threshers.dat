5|$|In the United States, a drift gillnet fishery for {{the common}} {{thresher}} developed in southern California in 1977, beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger-sized mesh. Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels, and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1,091 metric tons. The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing, with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population. Common <b>threshers</b> are still taken commercially in the United States, with about 85% coming from the Pacific and 15% from the Atlantic. The largest catches remain from the California-Oregon gillnet fishery, which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish (Xiphius gladius) but still take <b>threshers</b> as bycatch. Small numbers of Pacific <b>threshers</b> are also taken by harpoons, small-mesh driftnets, and longlines. In the Atlantic, <b>threshers</b> are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna.|$|E
5|$|Immature common <b>threshers</b> {{fall prey}} to larger sharks. Aside from {{observations}} of killer whales feeding on common <b>threshers</b> off New Zealand, adults have no known natural predators. Parasites documented from the common thresher include the protozoan Giardia intestinalis, the trematodes Campula oblonga (not usual host) and Paronatrema vaginicola, the tapeworms Acanthobothrium coronatum, Anthobothrium laciniatum, Crossobothrium angustum, Hepatoxylon trichiuri, Molicola uncinatus, Paraorygmatobothrium exiguum, P. filiforme, and Sphyriocephalus tergetinus, and the copepods Dinemoura discrepans, Echthrogaleus denticulatus, Gangliopus pyriformis, Kroeyerina benzorum, Nemesis aggregatus, N. robusta, N. tiburo, Nesippus orientalis, and Pandarus smithii.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>threshers</b> are active, strong swimmers; {{there are}} {{infrequent}} reports of them leaping {{completely out of}} the water. Like the fast-swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae, the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time. In addition, they have slow-oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ("wonderful net"), allowing them to generate and retain body heat. The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2°C (3.6°F) above that of the ambient seawater, though there is significant individual variation. Unlike the pelagic and bigeye <b>threshers,</b> the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes.|$|E

He finished the year by receiving the Paul Owens Award, given to the best pitcher in the Phillies' minor league system.|$|E
5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail, often in pairs or small groups. <b>Threshers</b> are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common <b>threshers</b> feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common <b>threshers</b> are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E

5|$|He {{converted}} from a starting pitcher to a reliever in 2009, {{along with several}} other Phillies pitching prospects. Around that time, he also, {{at the suggestion of}} the same minor league pitching coaches who converted him to relief, lowered his release point to his current low angle. Success did not manifest itself immediately, as he still posted a 4.04 ERA in 2009, his first season in relief, but in 2010, he cut his ERA to 2.91 while splitting time between Lakewood and the Clearwater <b>Threshers,</b> the Phillies High-A affiliate. At the end of the 2010 season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League. He spent the 2011 season with the Double-A Reading Phillies, accruing a 0–1 record and a 3.05 ERA and 3 saves in 53 games. Thereafter, the Phillies added him to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{mackerel}} sharks, common <b>threshers</b> are aplacental viviparous. They {{give birth}} to litters of two to four (rarely six) pups in the eastern Pacific, and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic. They are believed to reproduce throughout their range; one known nursery area is the Southern California Bight. Breeding occurs in the summer, usually July or August, and parturition occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months. The developing embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother. The teeth of small embryos are peg-like and non-functional, being covered by a sheath of soft tissues. As the embryos mature, their series of teeth become progressively more like those of adults in shape, though they remain depressed and hidden until shortly before birth.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} is migratory, {{moving to}} higher latitudes following warm water masses. In the eastern Pacific, males travel further than females, reaching {{as far as}} Vancouver Island {{in the late summer}} and early fall. Juveniles tend to remain in warm nursery areas. There appear to be separate populations with different life history characteristics in the eastern Pacific and western Indian Ocean and possibly elsewhere; this species is not known to make transoceanic movements. In the northwestern Indian Ocean, males and females segregate by location and depth during the pupping season from January to May. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has revealed substantial regional genetic variation within common <b>threshers</b> in all three oceans. This could support the idea that, despite being high mobile, sharks from different areas rarely interbreed.|$|E

The pelvic fins are almost {{as large as the}} first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of <b>threshers,</b> measuring about as long {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|His steady {{advancement}} {{through the}} minor league system continued in 2010, when he pitched with the Lakewood BlueClaws of the South Atlantic League (Single-A). With Lakewood, he allowed three or fewer earned runs {{in all but}} four of his 23 starts, and had a particularly strong {{second half of the}} season, posting a 2.41 ERA. Cumulatively, he finished ninth in the league with a 3.49 ERA, posted a win-loss record of 8–6, and threw a total of 131 innings. He pitched for the Clearwater <b>Threshers</b> of the Florida State League (Single-A advanced) the next year, and had a strong season – he led the league in innings pitched (161, tied for second in starts (27), and finished with the fifth-best ERA (2.96). He also was named a league all star, and the Phillies' minor league pitcher of the week in late April. At the conclusion of the season, Baseball America rated him the Phillies' fourth-best prospect. He split 2012 between the Double-A Reading Fightin Phils (Eastern League) and the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs (International League), earning a promotion to the latter in July. He posted an aggregate ERA of 3.10, to complement his 13–8 record in 159 innings pitched. Again, Baseball America ranked him as the Phillies' fourth-best prospect {{at the conclusion of the}} season, his last spent solely in the minor leagues.|$|E
