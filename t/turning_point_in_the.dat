40|$|Leading {{indicators}} is {{a popular}} way to predict <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business cycle. However, since the leading time of these indicators differ, those with a longer lead could potentially {{also be used to}} predict <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other leading indicators. This paper empirically explores the leeway of using leading indicators to predict the <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> of an index of commercial shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). Although share prices are leading the business cycle, other leading indicators that lead the business cycle by a longer period should lead share prices and could therefore potentially be useful <b>in</b> predicting <b>the</b> direction of share price movements. The objective of this study is twofold. First, it evaluates and compares the performance of different leading indicators <b>in</b> leading <b>the</b> commercial share price index and to use this information to construct a leading index that can predict <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> commercial share price index. Second, the estimated model is used to develop trading rules for investing in commercial shares. Different potential trading rules are explored, and their profitability is compared...|$|R
