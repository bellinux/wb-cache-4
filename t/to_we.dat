5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties <b>to,</b> <b>we</b> cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

25|$|George Orwell {{believed}} that Brave New World {{must have been}} partly derived from the novel We by Yevgeny Zamyatin.

500|$|The bombing came {{five days}} after the {{beginning}} of the peace talks in Belfast, and represented the IRA's opposition to talks which excluded republicans. The attack was part of a political strategy by the IRA to be included in negotiations on the IRA's own terms. According to historian Richard English: [...] "What they were doing with their return to bombings like the Manchester bomb was saying, 'We can still return to war if we want <b>to.</b> <b>We</b> can still put off a huge bomb in your cities and devastate them and therefore {{you have to deal with}} us'".|$|E
500|$|In August 2007, Sanctus Real {{returned}} to the studio to record a fourth album, which was finished {{by the end of}} the year.

It was later changed <b>to</b> <b>We</b> Need Each Other, and was released in February 2008, through Sparrow Records. The title track [...] "We Need Each Other" [...] was released earlier as the album's lead single in November 2007.

500|$|Both the soundtracks {{and their}} {{associated}} albums {{have been well}} received by reviewers, who have cited the [...] "catchiness" [...] and [...] "quirkiness" [...] of the music as their most notable features. The soundtrack to Katamari Damacy won both IGN's and GameSpot's [...] "Soundtrack of the Year 2004" [...] awards, while the theme song <b>to</b> <b>We</b> Love Katamari was awarded Best Original Vocal/Pop Song at the 4th Annual Game Audio Network Guild awards in 2006. None of the other soundtracks have been nominated for any awards. They were still well received by reviewers, with {{the music of the}} PlayStation Portable game Me & My Katamari receiving the weakest reviews due to its extensive reuse of songs from previous games in the series.|$|E
500|$|Black Sabbath {{began work}} on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, {{this time with a}} decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. [...] "We could've {{continued}} and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want <b>to.</b> <b>We</b> took a look at ourselves, and we wanted to do a rock album â€“ Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really." [...] Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating [...] "Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that [...] "the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate".|$|E
500|$|The Dykeenies' musical {{style has}} been noted {{primarily}} as indie rock, with influences including The Cribs, Bloc Party and The Futureheads.

[...] <b>to</b> <b>We</b> Are Scientists. Dykeenies have also stated that David Bowie is a major influence of the band, releasing a cover version of Starman {{as part of their}} Live at the Apple Store, Glasgow EP. One particular live review even linked the band to the short-lived [...] "New Rave" [...] genre, as well as comparing lead singer Brian Henderson's vocals to that of Brian Molko.

500|$|By 2003, only 18people at 3D Realms {{were working}} on the game. One former {{employee}} said that Broussard and Miller were still operating on a [...] "1995 mentality", before games became large-team, big budget development affairs. Because they were financing the project themselves, the developers could also ignore pressure from their publisher; their standard reply to when Duke Nukem Forever would ship was [...] "when it's done". In 2003, Take-Two CEO Jeffrey Lapin reported that the game would not be out that year. He further said the company was writing off $5.5million from its earnings due to Duke Nukem Forevers lengthy development time. Broussard shot back that [...] "Take-Two needs <b>to</b> ... <b>We</b> donâ€™t want Take-Two saying stupid-ass things in public for the sole purposes of helping their stock. It's our time and our money we are spending on the game. So either we're absolutely stupid and clueless, or we believe in what we are working on." [...] Later that year, Lapin said 3D Realms had told him that Duke Nukem Forever was expected to be finished by the end of 2004, or the beginning of 2005.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near {{collapse}} of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors {{to call in}} their loans <b>to</b> <b>W.E.</b> The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000 a year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it were even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, {{if he did not}} meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to [...] "deal with the bankers" [...] to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse would purchase Tesla's patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison, and Thompson-Houston).|$|E

Ice-T also replied {{that he had no}} personal problem with him but just [...] "thought I could beat him rapping anyways". Ice-T stated that he recorded [...] "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F."

[...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap.
