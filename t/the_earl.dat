5|$|After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel {{defied the}} king. The bishops' castles refused to {{surrender}} to the king, therefore Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into the custody of Robert, <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody.

5|$|By 1166, Foliot {{had been}} {{presented}} with a petition for annulment of the marriage of Aubrey de Vere, <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> of Oxford, and Agnes of Essex. On the couple's third appearance before the bishop in his episcopal court on 9May 1166, Countess Agnes appealed to the pope to affirm the validity of her marriage. Foliot enclosed her appeal in his own surviving letter setting out the salient features of the case. While the case was under papal consideration, Foliot reprimanded <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> for his treatment of his wife, reminding him that until the pope had ruled otherwise, Agnes was to be considered his wife in bed and board. When Pope Alexander III wrote to the bishop concerning the countess's maltreatment, and requiring Foliot to threaten <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> with excommunication, he also chastised the bishop for {{his handling of the}} case.|$|E

5|$|In 1952–3, Brooke-Little {{served on}} the staff {{assembled}} by <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> Marshal to plan the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. He was appointed a Gold Staff Officer for the Coronation and held a key co-ordination role during planning {{as well as on}} the day. It was his abiding interest in heraldry that led to this appointment, and this work with <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> Marshal and the officers of arms led to his first heraldic appointment. He joined the College of Arms as Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1956. The rank of pursuivant is the junior of the three levels an officer of arms can attain, and Brooke-Little related the story of his appointment in an editorial. In 1956, Sir George Bellew, the Garter King of Arms, had recommended Brooke-Little and Colin Cole for the open position of Bluemantle. The two were asked to meet with <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> Marshal in London. <b>The</b> <b>Earl</b> Marshal was not usually faced with two candidates for an opening; he offered the position to Cole, who turned it down as his wife was expecting a child. Brooke-Little was made Bluemantle. Several months later when Sir Gerald Wollaston died, in the ensuing shuffle Cole was finally given his appointment as Portcullis Pursuivant.|$|E
5|$|In December, Edward led {{his army}} across the River Severn and {{advanced}} into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered.

Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at Burton-on-Trent. Lancaster, outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north.

William Paget and <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> of Arundel rode to Framlingham to beg Mary's pardon, and Arundel arrested Northumberland on 24 July. Northumberland was beheaded on 22 August, shortly after renouncing Protestantism.

5|$|Maulay {{remained}} in office {{under the new}} king, Henry III, who succeeded to the throne in late 1216. While at Corfe, he had custody of William of Lancaster, who had been captured by the royalist side at Rochester in 1215. Ranulf de Blondeville, <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> of Chester, attempted to secure William's freedom but was rebuffed by Maulay, leading <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> to threaten to depart England and the king's cause and go on crusade. In early 1217 Maulay was ordered by the regent, William Marshal, to surrender control of Sherborne Castle and Somerset to William Longespee, <b>the</b> <b>Earl</b> of Salisbury, to help secure the return of Longespee to the royal cause. But Maulay refused to do so. In October 1217, Maulay was summoned to the royal court to answer charges that he had waged a private war against <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> over control of Somerset, {{and that he had}} broken a truce that had held between the two men. The dispute was finally solved in February 1218 when Maulay was confirmed by the regent as custodian of Sherborne Castle and in the office of Sheriff of Somerset. Maulay compensated Longespee for his loss with a payment of 500 pounds, and a further payment of 1000 pounds by the government and custody of a royal ward.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} the thesis {{is to provide a}} total picture of <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> in Henry II's reign. Chapter One looks at the history of earldoms in England, before and after the Norman conquerors brought with them Carolingian and Norman traditions of local government. Chapter Two {{examines}} the duties, rights and perquisites of <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> as local officials, how their position changed {{in the course of the}} eleventh and early twelfth centuries, and how, except in certain special cases, their practical role as local officials became insignificant early in Henry Ins reign. Chapter Three looks at various aspects of the lives of Henry II I s earls: their constant travelling; their residences; their military lifestyle and culture, and their religion. Chapter Four describes the complex structure of the earls' honours, and the financial and administrative problems that <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> faced. Chapters Five and Six examine the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> and royal government. Chapter Five looks at the role of <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> in central government, both as individuals and as a group, the impact on <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> of royal justice and the increasing dependence of <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> on a favourable position at the royal court. Chapter Six deals specifically with taxation: the role of <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> in forming taxation policy; the impact of taxes on <b>the</b> <b>earls,</b> and <b>the</b> growing dependence of taxation on individual feudal and political relationships between king and subject. Chapter Seven examines the revolt against Henry II in 1173 - 4, the greatest crisis of the reign, in which many earls were involved, both for and against the king. Chapter Eight looks at the region comprising Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, showing <b>the</b> <b>earls</b> in their role as powerful local landlords and Henry II's efforts to establish effective royal control in the area...|$|R

5|$|Once Edward's {{force had}} {{gathered}} sufficient strength, {{he dropped the}} ruse and headed south towards London.

He {{was waiting for the}} arrival of Clarence, who wanted to use their combined strength to overwhelm the Yorkists. When he learned of this, Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence to return to the House of York, an offer that Clarence readily accepted. Reconciled, the royal brothers moved towards Coventry, and Clarence urged Warwick's surrender. Infuriated with his son-in-law's treachery, Warwick refused to speak to Clarence.

5|$|Some historians, such as Frank Barlow and Emma Mason, {{state that}} Stigand {{supported}} Earl Godwin in his quarrel with Edward the Confessor in 1051–1052; others, including Ian Walker, hold {{that he was}} neutral. Stigand, {{whether or not he}} was a supporter of Godwin's, did not go into exile with <b>the</b> <b>earl.</b> The quarrel started over a fight between Eustace of Boulogne, brother-in-law of the king, and men of the town of Dover. The king ordered Godwin to punish the town, and <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> refused. Continued pressure from Edward undermined Godwin's position, and <b>the</b> <b>earl</b> and his family fled England in 1051. <b>The</b> <b>earl</b> returned in 1052 with a substantial armed force, but eventually reached a peaceful accord with the king.
