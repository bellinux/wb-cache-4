Methods: A total of 809 patients with AMI were retrospectively assessed (mean age: 63. 2 ± 12. 87 yrs) and prospectively and consecutively included in a specific database. Results: a) At the intrahospital phase, the mean values were compared between patients that died and those who survived: Leukocytosis: 12156 ± 5977 vs 10337 ± 3528 (p= 0. 004, 95 %CI = 976 - 2663); Glucose 176 ± 105 mg/dl vs 140 ± 72 mg/dl (p< 0. 001, 95 %CI = 19. 4 – 52. 6), respectively. b) With the adjusted mode, the same pattern was observed [p values: 0. 002 (<b>t-ratio</b> 3. 05), 0. 04 (<b>t-ratio</b> 2. 06), respectively]. c) Long-term follow-up: the univariate analysis showed P values of 0. 001 (<b>t-ratio</b> 3. 3), < 0. 001 (<b>t-ratio</b> 4. 16), respectively.

Reasoning that greater day-to-day cortisol variability could reflect a dysregulation of the HPA axis, we hypothesized that it would predict higher levels of CRP, above and beyond inter-individual differences in cortisol levels. Methods: A 10 -year longitudinal study of 130 older adults examined diurnal cortisol secretion on three different days across each of the 6 waves of data collection and levels of CRP during the last 3 waves. Indicators of mean cortisol levels, short-term cortisol variability, and long-term cortisol variability were analyzed. Results: Hierarchical linear modeling showed significant main effects, linking baseline mean cortisol levels, <b>T-ratio</b> = 2. 25, p =. 03, and long-term cortisol variability, <b>T-ratio</b> = 2. 63, p =. 01, with higher CRP values six to ten years after study entry.

Finally, a three-way interaction, <b>T-ratio</b> = 2. 24, p =. 03, suggested that the effect of long-term cortisol variability on CPR became stronger over time among participants who secreted high average levels of cortisol, whereas it became weaker among their counterparts who secreted low average levels of cortisol.

An important strategy in determining how activity modifies oscillatory properties of hippocampo-diencephalic circuitry comprises investigations of anterior thalamic responses to their main inputs: the descending dorsal fornix and the ascending mammillothalamic tract. Here, we show that the amplitude of thalamic theta spectral power selectively increases after plasticity-inducing stimulation of the dorsal fornix, but not of the mammillothalamic tract in urethane-anaesthetized young male rats. Furthermore, we show that low-frequency stimulation (LFS) significantly augments the fornix-driven theta ratio (theta over delta power, <b>T-ratio),</b> in parallel with depressing thalamic synaptic responses. However, the mammillothalamic synaptic response after LFS did not correlate with the slow band of theta oscillation (low <b>T-ratio),</b> but did correlate positively with the fast band of theta oscillation (high <b>T-ratio).</b> Our data demonstrate that the descending direct fornix projection is a pathway that modulates theta rhythm in the hippocampo-diencephalic circuit, resulting in dynamic augmentation of thalamic neuronal responsiveness.

It is shown that this distribution displays a striking bimodality for all sample sizes and that the bimodality persists asymptotically. An asymptotic theory is developed in terms of bivariate stable variates and the bimodality is explained by the statistical dependence between the numerator and denominator statistics of the <b>t-ratio.</b> This dependence also persists asymptotically. These results are {{in contrast to the}} classical t statistic constructed from a normal population, for which the numerator and denominator statistics are independent and the denominator, when suitably scaled, is a constant asymptotically. Our results are also in contrast to those that are known to apply for multivariate spherical populations. In particular, data from an n dimensional Cauchy population are well known to lead to a <b>t-ratio</b> statistic whose distribution is classical t with n- 1 degrees of freedom. In this case the univariate marginals of the population are all standard Cauchy (0, 1) but the sample data involves a special form of dependence associated with the multivariate spherical assumption. Our results therefore serve to highlight the effects of the dependence in component variates that is induced by a multivariate spherical population. Some extensions to symmetric stable populations with exponent parameter alpha does not equal 1 are also indicated. Simulation results suggest that the sampling distributions are well approximated by the asymptotic theory even for samples as small as n = 20. ...|$|E

We {{address this problem}} by deriving the limiting distribution of GEL under alternative asymp-totics where the number of moments grows {{at the same rate}} as the concentration parameter. We obtain an asymptotic variance that is larger than the usual one and give a ”sandwich ” estimator of it. In Monte Carlo examples we find that this variance estimator leads to a better Gaussian approximation to <b>t-ratios.</b> We also show that the Kleibergen (2005) confidence intervals are correct under these asymptotics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three {{procedures for}} testing specications of regression models. The rst procedure is parametric and it tests the specication of an unconditional moment restriction model against a nonnested unconditional moment restriction model. The second procedure is nonparametric and it tests the specication of a conditional moment restriction model against a nonnested conditional moment restriction model. The third procedure also is nonpara-metric but it tests the specication of a conditional moment restriction model against all alternative specications. All procedures permit heteroskedasticity of unknown form and are {{shown to be}} consistent. The test statistics of the rst two procedures are simply the <b>t-ratios</b> of a 2 SLS estimator while that of the third procedure is computable from LS output via auxiliary LS regressions. ...|$|R
