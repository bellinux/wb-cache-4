The English Magna Carta of 1215 inspired the right to petition and to trial by jury, for example, while the English Bill of Rights of 1689 provided an early precedent for the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms (although this applied only to Protestants) and prohibited cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States held in District of Columbia v. Heller {{that the}} city's 1976 handgun ban {{violated}} the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms as protected under the Second Amendment. However, the ruling does not prohibit {{all forms of}} gun control; laws requiring firearm registration remain in place, as does the city's assault weapon ban. In addition to the District's own Metropolitan Police Department, many federal law enforcement agencies have jurisdiction in the city as well; most visibly the U.S. Park Police, founded in 1791.|$|E
5|$|These {{conspiracy}} theorists, {{who are all}} strong {{believers in}} a right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms, are extremely fearful that the passing of any gun control legislation will be later followed by the abolishment of personal gun ownership and a campaign of gun confiscation, and that the refugee camps of emergency management agencies such as FEMA {{will be used for}} the internment of suspected subversives, making little effort to distinguish true threats to the New World Order from pacifist dissidents.|$|E
5000|$|Tennessee State Constitution, Article I, Section 26, reads:That the {{citizens}} of this state have a right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> arms for their common defense; but the Legislature shall have power, by law, to regulate the wearing of arms with a view to prevent crime.State supreme court rulings and state attorney general opinions interpret Section 26 to mean regulation cannot and should not interfere with the common lawful uses of firearms, including defense of the home and hunting, but should only be aimed at criminal behavior. Andrews v. State (1870) and Glasscock v. Chattanooga (1928) defined the meaning of regulating arms. [...] "Going armed", carrying any sort of weapon for offense or defense in public, is a crime, except carrying a handgun for defense is allowed with a state-issued permit.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is the National Rifle Association (NRA), an {{interest}} {{group in the}} USA. The aim of the thesis is to analyze NRA's influence on American politics. To achieve that it describes NRA's membership, organization, public image and financing. It describes NRA's functions and political goals and analyzes the method it uses to achieve them on the U. S. federal level. The thsis concludes that the NRA sees any regulation of the ability <b>to</b> buy, <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms as a breach of constitutional rights. It states that any further regulation is a step towards {{the creation of a}} national arms registry and towards weapons confiscation. It succesfully prevents stricter regulations by efficient voter mobilization, lobbying and financial contributions to election campaigns. Although it claims to be bipartisan, it mainly contributes to Republicans...|$|R
5000|$|The Fifth Circuit {{engaged in}} an {{extensive}} analysis {{of the text and}} history of the Second Amendment and its attendant caselaw (including many state supreme court decisions), and it ultimately determined that the Second Amendment [...] "protects the right of individuals <b>to</b> privately" [...] <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms. Nonetheless, the court held that the particular deprivation of {{the right to bear arms}} in the case before it did not violate the Constitution, while also acknowledging the federal government's sharp limitations on disarming of individual Americans. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review of the Fifth Circuit's decision.|$|R
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms. The concept {{of such a}} right existed within English common law long before {{the enactment of the}} Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic {{is quite}} liberal. It is mostly caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms and these needs resulted in passing quite liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to quite massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Gun {{rights activists}} {{in recent decades}} have {{sometimes}} argued for a fundamental natural right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms in the United States that both predates the U.S. Constitution and is covered by the Constitution's Ninth Amendment; according to this viewpoint, the Second Amendment only enumerates a pre-existing right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms.|$|E

50|$|The {{film is a}} character-driven documentary, {{which also}} reveals and explores a {{subculture}} of large wild animal keeping and breeding across the United States.

And, that it is legal in half of the United States <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> a tiger or other big cat. The Tiger Next Door follows {{the story of a man}} named Dennis Hill who has been keeping and breeding tigers from his backyard in Flat Rock, Indiana for over 15 years. When the film begins, Hill has recently lost his federal USDA license <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> breed tigers, <b>bears</b> <b>and</b> cougars and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is threatening to shut him down citing dangerous and inhumane conditions. Hill has five days remaining to upgrade his facilities and place all but three of his 24 tigers, three <b>bears,</b> six leopards <b>and</b> one cougar in alternate homes—before the Indiana DNR will consider issuing licenses for the remaining three animals.|$|R

25|$|State level laws vary {{significantly}} in their form, content, {{and level of}} restriction. Forty-four states have a provision in their state constitutions similar to the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms. The exceptions are California, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York. In New York, however, the statutory civil rights laws contain a provision virtually identical to the Second Amendment. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court held in McDonald v. Chicago that the protections of the Second Amendment <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms for self-defense in one's home apply against state governments and their political subdivisions.|$|E

25|$|The Second Amendment {{was based}} {{partially}} {{on the right}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms in English common law and {{was influenced by the}} English Bill of Rights of 1689.

25|$|The Second Amendment (Amendment II) to the United States Constitution {{protects the}} right of the people <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms and was adopted on December 15, 1791, as part of the first ten {{amendments}} contained in the Bill of Rights. The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that the right belongs to individuals, while also ruling that the right is not unlimited and does not prohibit all regulation of either firearms or similar devices. State and local governments are limited to the same extent as the federal government from infringing this right per the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.|$|E

25|$|Hitchens philosophically {{supported}} gun {{rights and}} was generally opposed to gun control.

Although Hitchens repeatedly stated a broad support for the right <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>and</b> <b>bear</b> arms, he was not an enthusiastic advocate and he rarely publicly discussed his views.|$|E

The Court stated that this was because the statute amounted to a wholesale statutory ban on the exercise of a personal right that was specifically named in and guaranteed by the United States Constitution, as construed by the United States Supreme Court.
