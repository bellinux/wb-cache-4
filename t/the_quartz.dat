5|$|When {{the bust}} was first discovered, no piece of quartz to {{represent}} the iris of the left eyeball was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £5 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that <b>the</b> <b>quartz</b> iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection, and actually lost her left eye, though {{the presence of an}} iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.|$|E
5|$|At Parc Cwm long cairn {{a variety}} of {{mortuary}} practices was evident and the deliberate ordering of skeletal parts noticeable. Whittle and Wysocki (1998) note cremated human remains were placed only in the front, right (southeast) chamber, where females and males, and all age ranges were represented. The southeast chamber was also unusual in that it contained nearly {{three times as many}} individuals as in each of the other chambers, which contained the remains of all representative groups except younger children and infants. At the forecourt entrance Atkinson recorded finds, deposited in groups, including: flint debitage, lithic cores and a bladelet (burnt and unburnt); a leaf-shaped arrowhead (burnt); pieces of quartz; pieces of stalactite (now missing); sherds of Neolithic pottery; and cremated bone fragments. Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of <b>the</b> <b>quartz</b> too.|$|E

40|$|DE 102005054745 A 1 UPAB: 20071015 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} charging an oscillating quartz resonator with an {{electromagnetic radiation}} with a wavelength {{of less than}} 2. 5 nano meter, such that an operating frequency of <b>the</b> oscillating <b>quartz</b> is reduced. A dose of 1 gray to 30 gray is doped on <b>the</b> oscillating <b>quartz.</b> <b>The</b> oscillating <b>quartz</b> is inserted into a quartz oscillator (1) before the irradiation, where the oscillator is installed in an electronic circuit carrier before the irradiation. USE - Used for influencing an operating frequency of an oscillating quartz of a quartz oscillator that is utilized in a vehicle control system, personal computer, mobile telephone and control and regulating device of machines and plants.

25|$|Some {{types of}} quartz {{crystals}} have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon {{the application of}} mechanical stress. An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. One {{of the most common}} piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. <b>The</b> <b>quartz</b> clock is a familiar device using the mineral. The resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in <b>the</b> <b>quartz</b> crystal microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors.|$|E

The road continues through <b>the</b> <b>Quartz</b> Mountains, passing in between Williams Peak and King Mountain. The route then follows {{the south shore}} of Lake Altus-Lugert, passing between the lakeshore and Mount Lugert. As SH-44 leaves the mountains, it passes through the unincorporated place of Lugert, from which both the lake and the mountain get their name. The highway then heads north-northwest until it reaches SH-9 {{on the east side}} of Lone Wolf. It follows SH-9 to the east before splitting off along a due north course.

The motion provides a rate of change of flux, which results in some induced emf on the coils. The concept is simply related to Faraday's Law.|$|E
