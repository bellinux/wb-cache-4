5|$|The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System {{was built}} entirely with unionized labor. Because {{construction}} was slumping in the United States at large, the pipeline drew workers {{from across the}} country. These workers had to follow a strict hiring process based on union seniority and the labor that was needed. Priority was given to hiring Alaska residents and Alaska Natives, and no strikes were permitted by a labor agreement between Alyeska and the unions. In exchange for abiding by these restrictions, workers were paid extremely well and received fringe benefits. According to the labor contract, every worker was guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week, even if weather made work impossible. In addition, subcontractors had cost-plus contracts with Alyeska for staffing, {{so there was no}} incentive to keep staffing levels low. These factors often led to more people being assigned to a job <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> work to do in an attempt to make up time lost to weather delays. At the peak of construction in fall 1975, more than 28,000 people were working on the pipeline. Fourteen to 19 percent of the workers were minorities, and 5 to 10 percent were women. Because of the high turnover on the project, more than 70,000 people worked on at least a part of the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|The force {{reached the}} Bulganak River that day, where skirmishers found {{a force of}} Cossacks and Russian {{infantry}}, with a light battery of artillery. The infantry and artillery had been hidden in {{a dip in the}} terrain while the British formed up, and their placement put the British cavalry in heavy danger. Raglan decided to withdraw, and sent a troop forward to cover the retreat; this body's confidence deceived the Russians into thinking that there was a larger British force <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>was,</b> and they failed to pursue the retreating cavalry. A day later, the British force, together with the French under General St Arnaud, defeated the Russians at the Battle of Alma. Nolan spent the battle as a liaison due to his fluent French, and was often galloping between the two allied armies. They resumed marching on 26 September and entered the plains of Balaclava, near Sevastopol.|$|E

Kalat, author of Homicide: Life on the Street [...] The Unofficial Companion, credited NBC Entertainment president Warren Littlefield with that move, although Levinson claimed NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer was behind the decision. Ohlmeyer said he believed a better timeslot, less dense stories and less hand-held photography would attract more viewers and help the show succeed better: [...] "For it to succeed long-term, there's a humanity {{that needs to be}} brought to the characters.

2500|$|The {{simultaneous}} battles stretched German resources. In {{the north}} Dietl's force was attacked on 2 July by the 72 SAP which flew 45 operations and dropped 400 bombs in three hours. [...] failed to interdict Soviet naval forces and airfields which supported the landing at Rybachiy, {{not least because}} of VVS fighter defences. The Germans' response was to bring in elements of JG 77, a Bf 109-equipped unit. Supported by Freya radar {{with a range of}} 128 to 160 kilometres (the only instant it was used on the Eastern Front), increasing numbers of Bf 109s and Bf 110s put the VVS under pressure. In what may be described as psychological warfare, the German pilots practiced [...] "helter-skelter" [...] tactics, whereby German fighters attacked bombers and fighters singly but relentlessly to create the impression there were more Axis fighters in combat <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>was.</b> They inflicted fearsome losses on the VVS. 147 IAP lost 33 out of 53 I-153s by the 9 July.

2500|$|Crime writer Colin Wilson speculates the Axeman {{could have}} been Joseph Momfre, a man {{shot to death in}} Los Angeles in December 1920 by the widow of Mike Pepitone, the Axeman's last known victim. Wilson's theory has been widely {{repeated}} in other true crime books and websites. However, true crime writer Michael Newton searched New Orleans and Los Angeles public, police and court records as well as newspaper archives, and failed to find any evidence of a man with the name [...] "Joseph Momfre" [...] (or a similar name) having been assaulted or killed in Los Angeles. Newton also was not able to find any information that Mrs. Pepitone (identified in some sources as Esther Albano, and in others simply as a [...] "woman who claimed to be Pepitone's widow") was arrested, tried or convicted for such a crime, or indeed had been in California. Newton notes that [...] "Momfre" [...] was not an unusual surname in New Orleans {{at the time of the}} crimes. It appears that there actually may have been an individual named Joseph Momfre or Mumfre in New Orleans who had a criminal history, and who may have been connected with organized crime; however, local records for the period are not extensive enough to allow confirmation of this, or to positively identify the individual. Wilson's explanation is an urban legend, and there is no more evidence now on the identity of the killer <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> at the time of the crimes.|$|E
2500|$|Sima also broke {{new ground}} by using more sources like {{interviewing}} witnesses, visiting places where historical occurrences had happened, and examining documents from different regions and/or times. Before Chinese historians had tended {{to use only}} reign histories as their sources. The Shiji was further very novel in Chinese historiography by examining historical events outside of the courts, providing a broader history than the traditional court-based histories had done. Lastly, Sima broke with the traditional chronological structure of Chinese history. Sima instead had divided the Shiji [...] into five divisions: the basic annals which comprised the first 12 chapters, the chronological tables which comprised the next 10 chapters, treatises on particular subjects which make up 8 chapters, accounts of the ruling families which take up 30 chapters, and biographies of various eminent people which are the last 70 chapters. The annals follow the traditional Chinese pattern of court-based histories {{of the lives of}} various emperors and their families. The chronological tables are graphs recounting the political history of China. The treatises are essays on topics such as astronomy, music, religion, hydraulic engineering and economics. The last section dealing with biographies cover both famous people, both Chinese and foreign. Unlike traditional Chinese historians, Sima went beyond the androcentric, emperor-focused histories by dealing with the lives of women and men such as poets, bureaucrats, merchants, assassins, and philosophers. The [...] treatises section, the biographies sections and the annals section relating to the Qin dynasty (as a former dynasty, there was more freedom to write about the Qin <b>than</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> about the reigning Han dynasty) that make up 40% of the Shiji have aroused the most interest from historians and are the only parts of the Shiji that have been translated into English.|$|E
