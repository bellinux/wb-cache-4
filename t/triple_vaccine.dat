5000|$|With Per Askelöf and Stefan B.

This model is now used to produce other safe acellular vaccines. They also showed that ‘toxoidation’ of whole bacteria with formaldehyde — the method all manufacturers used to produce the highly neurotoxic pertussis vaccine — did not work on Bordetella pertussis because there are no free amino groups on the toxin of over 200 amino acids. This is both surprising and unlikely, but obviously can happen. Statistically, there should be at least ten lysines, but, there are none.|$|E

Wakefield said, [...] "I can't support the continued use of these three vaccines given in combination until this issue has been resolved." [...] In a video news release issued by the hospital to broadcasters in advance of {{the press conference}}, he called for MMR to be [...] "suspended in favour of the single vaccines". In a BBC interview Wakefield's mentor Roy Pounder, who was not a coauthor, [...] "admitted the study was controversial".

Many of the properties of the Cx-reactive protein were defined at the time of its initial description by Anderson and McCarty (1).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the persistence of}} antibody to diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in children receiving an accelerated schedule of primary immunisation. DESIGN [...] Controlled study of antibody testing of blood samples from children immunised according to various schedules: three doses of <b>triple</b> <b>vaccine</b> completed at 8 - 13 calendar months, 6 - 7 calendar months, before 6 calendar months, or three doses followed by diphtheria/tetanus before age 2. SETTING [...] Plymouth Health Authority. SUBJECTS [...] 129 children aged 4 years who had received three doses of diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis vaccine {{with or without a}} diphtheria/tetanus booster. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Diphtheria and tetanus antitoxin concentrations and antibody titres to pertussis toxin, filamentous haemagglutinin, and agglutinogens 2 and 3. RESULTS [...] All children had protective concentrations of antitoxin to diphtheria and tetanus (greater than or equal to 0. 01 IU/ml). There was no evidence of a significant difference in diphtheria or tetanus antitoxin concentrations and pertussis antibody titres in children immunised with an accelerated course (third dose of <b>triple</b> <b>vaccine</b> before 6 months) compared with those who received a longer course (third dose at 8 - 13 months) with no booster (geometric mean antitoxin concentration 0. 411 (95 % confidence interval 0. 273 to 0. 618) v 0. 426 (0. 294 to 0. 616) for diphtheria and 0. 358 (0. 231 to 0. 556) v 0. 299 (0. 197 to 0. 453) for tetanus; geometric mean antibody titres 903 (500 to 1631) v 1386 (848 to 2266) for pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin, 179 (130 to 248) v 232 (167 to 322) for pertussis toxin, and 2002 (1276 to 3142) v 3591 (2220 to 5809) for agglutinogens 2 and 3).

Here, we investigated a polyplex micelle encapsulating genes encoding the tumor-associated antigen {{squamous cell carcinoma}} antigen recognized by T cells- 3 (SART 3), adjuvant CD 40 L, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as a DNA vaccine platform in mouse tumor models with different types of major histocompatibility antigen complex (MHC). Intraperitoneally administrated polyplex micelles were predominantly found in the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Compared with mock controls, the <b>triple</b> gene <b>vaccine</b> significantly prolonged the survival of mice harboring peritoneal dissemination of CT 26 colorectal cancer cells, of which long-term surviving mice showed complete rejection when re-challenged with CT 26 tumors. Moreover, the DNA vaccine inhibited the growth and metastasis of subcutaneous CT 26 and Lewis lung tumors in BALB/c and C 57 BL/ 6 mice, respectively, which represent different MHC haplotypes. The DNA vaccine highly stimulated both cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cell activities, and increased the infiltration of CD 11 c+ DCs and CD 4 +/CD 8 a+ T cells into tumors. Depletion of CD 4 + or CD 8 a+ T cells by neutralizing antibodies deteriorated the anti-tumor efficacy of the DNA vaccine. In conclusion, a SART 3 /CD 40 L+GM-CSF gene-loaded polyplex micelle can be applied as a novel vaccine platform to elicit tumor rejection immunity regardless of the recipient MHC haplotype...|$|R

The {{catalyst for the}} research was the sense of confusion over the Measles, Mumps and Rubella triple vaccination.

All rights reservedThe {{immunogenicity}} of pertussis antigens in an acellular and a whole-cell <b>triple</b> antigen <b>vaccine</b> {{used for}} childhoodvimmunisation was assessed in murine models after storage of vaccines below 0 °C. Swiss outbred and Balb/c mice received DTPa or DTPw vaccine or placebo. Vaccines were stored at 2 – 8 °C (ideal), or at − 3 °C for 24 h. Pre and post immunisation IgG responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) were measured using enzyme immunoassays (EIA). In Balb/c mice, responses to pertactin after receiving adversely stored DTPa were significantly reduced (P= 0. 005, difference in GMCs 145. 9 % [24. 6 – 385. 4 %]). A reduction in GMC to pertactin was also seen {{in response to}} adversely stored DTPw (P= 0. 190, 224. 1 % [83. 8 – 599. 2 %]). Outbred mice receiving adversely stored DTPa had lower IgG antibody responses to FHA than those receiving correctly stored vaccine (P= 0. 002, 522. 2 % [26. 1 – 2155. 6 %]).

40|$|The knowledge, {{attitude}} {{and practice of}} mothers toward childhood immunization was surveyed in 2 neighborhoods in greater Bombay, India. The areas were a slum of 75, 000 called Malavani, and a nearby area called Kharodi. Measles and triple (DPT or DPV) vaccines were available at local health centers, 1. 5 km away at the most; oral polio vaccines were given by field workers to the Malavani community to children in their homes, {{but only in the}} center for those in Kharodi. BCG tuberculosis vaccinations were available to all, but from a center 5 km away. Malavani mothers had significantly better knowledge of <b>triple</b> and measles <b>vaccines,</b> but knowledge about BCG was similar in the 2 groups. Slightly more women from Kharodi expressed negative attitudes toward immunization. Coverage of children, established from clinic records, was significantly better in the Malavani area: 91 &#x 0025; vs. 58 &#x 0025; for polio; 71 &#x 0025; vs 61 &#x 0025; for BCG (n. s.); 85 &#x 0025; vs. 55 &#x 0025; for triple vaccine; and 21 &#x 0025; vs 1 &#x 0025; for measles. Evidently, visitation by field teams with polio vaccinations affected mothers&#x 2032; knowledge and practice for other immunizations available only at the center...|$|R
40|$|The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation {{supports}} {{an ambitious}} portfolio of novel vaccines, drug regimens, and diagnostic tools for tuberculosis (TB). We elicited the expected efficacies and improvements {{of the novel}} interventions in discussions with the foundations managing their development. Using an age-structured mathematical model of TB, we explored {{the potential benefits of}} novel interventions under development and those not yet in the portfolio, focusing on the WHO Southeast Asia region. Neonatal vaccination with the portfolio vaccine decreases TB incidence by 39 % to 52 % by 2050. Drug regimens that shorten treatment duration and are efficacious against drug-resistant strains reduce incidence by 10 – 27 %. New diagnostics reduce incidence by 13 – 42 %. A triple combination of a portfolio vaccine, drug regimen, and diagnostics reduces incidence by 71 %. A short mass vaccination catch-up campaign, not yet in the portfolio, to augment the triple combination, accelerates the decrease, preventing > 30 % more cases by 2050 than just the <b>triple</b> combination. New <b>vaccines</b> and drug regimens targeted at the vast reservoir of latently infected people, not in the portfolio, would reduce incidence by 37 % and 82 %, respectively. The combination of preventive latent therapy and a 2 -month drug treatment regimen reduces incidence by 94 %. Novel technologies in the pipeline would achieve substantial reductions in TB incidence, but not the Stop TB Partnership target for elimination. Elimination will require new delivery strategies, such as mass vaccination campaigns, and new products targeted at latently infected people...|$|R
