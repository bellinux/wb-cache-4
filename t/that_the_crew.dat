Jim, Doppler, Amelia, and Morph abandon the ship, but Morph {{has left the}} map behind. Thinking that Jim has the map, Silver {{has a chance to}} blast Jim, but hesitates because of his {{attachment}} to the boy. The fugitives are shot down by a mutineer during their escape, injuring Amelia.|$|E
5|$|In March 2002, a {{book titled}} The Spirit of Lagaan – The Extraordinary Story of the Creators of a Classic was published.

5|$|Meanwhile, an {{independent}} trader, Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams), arrives {{on the station}} with some tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the feeling is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E

5|$|The {{rearward}} {{of the two}} ports {{was fitted}} with plumbing to allow the station to be refueled by unmanned Progress spacecraft. These freighters, which brought supplies and extra equipment to keep the station replenished, helped ensure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> were always {{able to carry out}} useful scientific work aboard the station. In all, twelve Progress flights delivered over 20tonnes of equipment, supplies and fuel.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{reportedly}} {{killed three}} {{people on the}} island. An unidentified schooner capsized off Port Antonio with all hands lost, in spite of efforts to rescue the imperiled crew.

5|$|When Slayton {{submitted}} the proposed crew assignments to NASA headquarters, George Mueller turned {{them down on}} the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> was too inexperienced. So Slayton asked Jim Lovell, {{who had been the}} backup commander for Apollo 11, and was slated to command Apollo 14, if his crew would be willing to fly Apollo 13 instead. He agreed to do so, and Shepard's inexperienced crew was assigned to Apollo 14.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} {{more substantial}} repairs over the winter, De Soto sailed to Venezuela on 3 March 1868, {{to secure the}} release of crewmen from the whaling schooner Hannah Grant, who had been captured on the peninsula of Paraguano. At Curaçao, Capt. Boggs learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> had already been released, but he remained in Venezuelan waters {{in support of the}} American minister during interviews with the Venezuelan vice-president and other officials of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is scant. What is known is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of the ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; {{and that it was}} performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E

5|$|Glatter has praised MacLachlan's {{involvement}} in his role, believing that he fully embraced and explored {{the character of}} Cooper; she noted that he was as devoted to the character's comedic elements as to his dramatic side and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> had difficulty completing takes featuring Cooper without laughing at his comic delivery. She has also noted that although the writers and directors on the series tended to emphasize the rapport between Cooper and Fenn's character Audrey Horne, {{there was never any}} intention to bring the characters together as a couple.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E

The Kraken drags Jack and the Pearl to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover the heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett {{the heart and the}} Letters of Marque meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The Pearls crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain that will guide them: the resurrected Captain Barbossa.|$|E

5|$|SOE agent Richard Lippett had {{obtained}} employment with the shipping company John Holt & Co (Liverpool), which had business offices on the island.

He became aware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of Duchessa d'Aosta were {{in the habit of}} accepting invitations to parties ashore and had held their own party aboard ship on 6 January 1942. Under the guise of a party-goer Lippett managed to gain information about the readiness of the ship for sea, crew numbers, and the watch arrangements.|$|E

Doggett and Mulder leave the radio room, and jump off the rig when they realize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> are going to destroy it. They are rescued by the helicopters Kersh has sent to break the quarantine. Later, at the FBI, Mulder tells Doggett {{that he has been}} dismissed from the bureau.|$|E

The {{material}} injected into the cows and children {{is found to be}} an unknown substance. All the children who were inoculated came down with a flu-like illness while those in the Church of the Red Museum did not, causing her to think they were a control group. Scully declares the case open and unsolved.|$|E
25|$|The Laurentic had two {{collisions}} {{during her}} career. The first occurred on 3 October 1932 with Lurigethen of the HE Moss Line. Both vessels remained afloat following the collision.

The second occurred on 18 August 1935 with Napier Star of the Blue Star Line, leaving six dead among <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> of Laurentic.|$|R

5|$|The {{report on}} the crash in Dryden criticised {{approaches}} to deicing. It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II deicing fluid rather than Type I, deicing trucks near the runway {{rather than at the}} gate, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> should inspect their wings not only from the cockpit, but also the cabin. The report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry’s sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations.|$|E
5|$|The season {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Scully's former partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), {{who work on}} X-Filescases linked to the paranormal.

They soon discover <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> has been infected with the black oil, an alien virus that Mulder and Scully have encountered many times before. Despite their dislike for each other, Mulder and Doggett team up and escape before the infected crew members are able to capture and kill them.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} Vengeur du Peuple {{was used as}} {{propaganda}} by the National Convention and Bertrand Barère, who {{gave birth to the}} legend <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>crew</b> had gone down with the ship fighting, rather than surrender. The Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle repeated the tale in his , yielding a rebuttal by Rear-Admiral John Griffiths, who had witnessed the events. Although discredited in naval history circles, the legend lived on as a folk tale, inspiring numerous representations and a fictional account by Jules Verne in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea.|$|E
