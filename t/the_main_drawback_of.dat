25|$|Finally, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> {{the theory}} {{turned out to}} be the result that {{particles}} are not self-interacting. Indeed, as demonstrated by Hans Bethe, the Lamb shift necessitated a self-energy term to be explained. Feynman and Bethe had an intense discussion over that issue, and eventually Feynman himself stated that self-interaction is needed to correctly account for this effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> Flexible Defence is {{that these}} lines are {{effective}} only when they lie next to natural barriers. In addition to man-made obstacles Bar Lev Line and Mannerheim Line used water bodies (Suez Canal, numerous lakes) and Árpád line adopted escarpments and benches as anti-tank blockade too. The methodology is quite useful next to great forests and marshland too, but at completely flat terrain its efficacy is low.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> {{the transit}} timing method is that usually not {{much can be}} learned about the planet itself. Transit timing {{variation}} can help to determine the maximum mass of a planet. In most cases, it can confirm if an object has a planetary mass, {{but it does not}} put narrow constraints on its mass. There are exceptions though, as planets in the Kepler-36 and Kepler-88 systems orbit close enough to accurately determine their masses.|$|E
500|$|The {{first book}} {{published}} by Ace {{was a pair}} of mysteries bound tête-bêche: Keith Vining's Too Hot for Hell, backed with Samuel W. Taylor's The Grinning Gismo, priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01. A tête-bêche book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "Ace Double" [...] format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag [...] "Complete and Unabridged" [...] on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.|$|E
500|$|In general, the {{decision}} between clipping and coiling is {{made on the}} basis of the location of the aneurysm, its size and the condition of the person. Aneurysms of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping. Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management. These approaches are based on general experience, and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well people with small (less than 10mm) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery (together the [...] "anterior circulation"), who constitute about 20 percent of all people with aneurysmal SAH. This trial, the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT), showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced (7.4 percent absolute risk reduction, 23.5 percent relative risk reduction) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach. In ISAT, 8.3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term. Hence, people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early. Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> {{carboplatin}} is its myelosuppressive effect. This {{causes the}} blood cell and platelet output of bone marrow {{in the body}} to decrease quite dramatically, sometimes as low as 10% of its usual production levels. [...] The nadir of this myelosuppression usually occurs 21–28 days after the first treatment, after which the blood cell and platelet levels in the blood begin to stabilize, often coming close to its pre-carboplatin levels. This decrease in white blood cells (neutropenia) can cause complications, and is sometimes treated with drugs like filgrastim. The most notable complication of neutropenia is increased probability of infection by opportunistic organisms, which necessitates hospital readmission and treatment with antibiotics.|$|E
2500|$|Diesel-powered cars {{generally}} {{have a better}} fuel economy than equivalent gasoline engines and produce less greenhouse gas emission. Their greater economy {{is due to the}} higher energy per-litre content of diesel fuel and the intrinsic efficiency of the diesel engine. While petrodiesel's higher density results in higher greenhouse gas emissions per litre compared to gasoline, the 20–40% better fuel economy achieved by modern diesel-engined automobiles offsets the higher per-litre emissions of greenhouse gases, and a diesel-powered vehicle emits 10–20 percent less greenhouse gas than comparable gasoline vehicles. [...] Biodiesel-powered diesel engines offer substantially improved emission reductions compared to petrodiesel or gasoline-powered engines, while retaining most of the fuel economy advantages over conventional gasoline-powered automobiles. However, the increased compression ratios mean there are increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from diesel engines. This is compounded by biological nitrogen in biodiesel to make NOx emissions <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> diesel versus gasoline engines.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{abundantly clear}} that the army that the Kaiser had {{referred}} to as a [...] "contemptible little army" [...] would need thousands more recruits. Young Britons answered the call, for King and Country, and voluntarily joined the British Army. By early 1915 much of the regular army had been killed and were now replaced by the part-time volunteers of the Territorial Force and Kitchener's new volunteer army. A feature of the volunteer army was the Pals battalions, recruited from single communities or even factories, who were allowed to serve together. The Kitchener recruitment campaign had proved to be very successful, as on September 1, 1914, over 30,000 men enlisted. With each day passing, thousands more were clamouring to be taken. The British Government soon realized <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>drawback</b> <b>of</b> this campaign, as opposed to the French and German conscriptions, which selected each individual men, a high proportion of men from skilled industries left their works, which would prove to be costly in the war effort. A better-controlled enlistment program would be required.|$|E
