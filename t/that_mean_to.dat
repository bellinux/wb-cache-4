2500|$|While in {{the process}} of {{creating}} Saint Seiya, Masami Kurumada initially gave Seiya the name Rin, intending to title his manga [...] However, as he continued developing the story, he changed the name to Seiya, which he felt was more fitting. First he used the name with the Japanese characters <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> , <b>to</b> relate it to Seiya's condition as a Saint, but later decided to spell it as [...] "star arrow", to emphasize the constellation and mythological motif. Finally, he changed the title of the manga to Saint Seiya, once the concept of the Saints was fully developed. Kurumada stated that one of the first ideas he had for Saint Seiya was the [...] "Pegasus Meteor Fist". Since his manga was going to use the constellations as a very important and ever-present theme, he wanted his protagonist to have a special move that would be like a shower of meteors.|$|E

5000|$|But [...] "how" [...] did Abraham act? He {{walked for}} 3 days {{step by step}} trusting in God. That {{is an example of}} keeping {{expectancy}} alive when any ethicist would say it should have died before he left home. What would have happened to his expectancy had he told Sarah? Or Isaac? He would have to explain himself but he couldn't. So he ventured for the truth of what he understood as the highest good. He kept his resolution intact. [...] To have faith in God-does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> think about how glorious it must be to have faith, to think about what peace and security faith can give? Not at all. Even to wish, where the interest, the subject’s interest, is far more evident, is not to have faith, is not to act. The individual’s relation to the thought-action is still continually only a possibility that he can give up. It is not denied that with regard to evil there are cases in which the transition is almost undetectable, but these cases must be explained in a special way. This {{is due to the fact}} that the individual is so in the power of habit that by frequently having made the transition from thinking to acting he has finally lost the power for it in the bondage of habit, which at his expense makes it faster and faster. Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 339-340 [...] If I, acting, am truly to venture and truly to aspire to the highest good, then there must be uncertainty and, if I may put it this way, I must have room to move. But the greatest space in which I can move, where there is space enough for the most rigorous gesture of infinite passion, is uncertainty of knowledge with regard to an eternal happiness, or that choosing it is lunacy in the finite sense-see, now there is room, now you can venture. Therefore eternal happiness, as the absolute good, has the remarkable quality that it can be defined only by the mode in which it is acquired, whereas other good, just because of the mode of acquisition is accidental or at any rate relatively dialectical, must be defined by the good itself. Money, for example, can be acquired by work and can also be obtained without work, and in turn both are different in many ways, but money still remains the same good. Knowledge, for example, is acquired differently according to talent and outward circumstances and therefore cannot be defined by the mode of acquisition. But nothing else can be said of eternal happiness than that it is the good that is attained by absolutely venturing everything. Any description of the gloriousness of this good is already an attempt, as it were, to make various modes of acquisition possible-an easier way, for example, and a harder way, which shows that the description is not describing the absolute good but only fancies doing it and essentially is talking about relative goods. Venture everything. There are no anecdotes to tell how Peter became rich by working, and Paul by playing the lottery, and Hans by inheritance, and Matthew by monetary reform, and Christopher by purchasing a piece of furniture from a secondhand dealer. But in another sense the discourse is long, indeed, the longest of all discourses, because to venture everything demands a transparency of consciousness that is acquired only very slowly. Right here is the task of the religious discourse. Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 426-427 ...|$|E

We {{argue that}} there will be an {{increasing}} future need for the design and implementation of declarative languages that can aggregate trust evidence and therefore inform the decision making of IT systems at run-time. We first present requirements for such languages. Then we discuss an instance of such a language, Peal+, which extends an early pro-totype Peal that was researched by others in collaboration with us. Next, we formulate the intuitive semantics of Peal+, present a simple use case of it, and evaluate to what extent Peal+ meets our formulated require-ments. In this evaluation, particular attention is given to the usability aspects of declarative languages <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> aggregate trust evidence. ...|$|E

In so doing, it addresses a relatively new area in leadership. The study focuses on four main questions: Are there parallels between feminist leadership styles and a new evolving field for leaders in technology?

What does <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> women entering the field now?Six women administrators, interviewed over a three-month period spoke {{on such issues as}} formal and informal relationships, collaborative team building, and getting the job done.

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} an {{extension}} of the process algebra ACP with rational time and integration. We determine a proper subdomain of the regular processes for which an elimination theorem holds, namely, for each pair of processes p 0; p 1 in this class there is a process q in this class such that p 0 kp 1 and q are bisimilar. Some simple examples show that if this subdomain is enlarged, then the elimination result is lost. The subdomain is equivalent to the model of timed automata from Alur and Dill. 1 Introduction In recent years, process algebras such as CCS, CSP and ACP, have been extended with constructs <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> describe some notion of either discrete or dense time. This chapter is based on the approach of Baeten and Bergstra [3], which extends ACP with real time. They introduced the notion of integration, which expresses the possibility that an action occurs somewhere within a time interval. The construct R v 2 V p executes the process p, where the behaviour of p may depend on [...] ...|$|E
