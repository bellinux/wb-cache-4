25|$|Blood Bowl is a two-player, turn-based {{board game}} that {{typically}} uses 28 mm miniatures {{to represent a}} contest between two teams on a playing field. A board containing a grid overlay represents the field. Using dice, cards, and counters, the players attempt to score higher <b>than</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by entering the opponent's end zone with a player who possesses the ball.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} success that Courtney and his Cornell varsity rowing team was having, both Harvard University and Yale University refused to race. It was {{believed}} that the snub was because Cornell was a relatively young school and was not considered up to the class or academic standards. Others speculated that Courtney’s crews were too fast and losing to them would be unbearable. The snub had its history {{dating back to the}} collapse of the Rowing Association of American Colleges. After repeated losses to what they thought were lesser schools, including losing to Cornell at the 1875 National Rowing Association of American Colleges Regatta, Yale and Harvard virtually stopped rowing against any one other <b>than</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Yale pulled out of the association before the 1876 regatta while Harvard waited until the following year. The loss of these two schools caused the association to collapse. Both schools decided to concentrate on meets between each other based on the Cambridge and Oxford model in England.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{surreal number}} is a game, {{but not all}} games are surreal numbers, e.g. the game [...] 0 } is not a surreal number. [...] The class of games is more general than the surreals, and has a simpler definition, but lacks some of the nicer {{properties}} of surreal numbers. [...] The class of surreal numbers forms a field, but the class of games does not. [...] The surreals have a total order: given any two surreals, they are either equal, or one {{is greater than the}} other. [...] The games have only a partial order: there exist pairs of games that are neither equal, greater than, nor less <b>than</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> [...] Each surreal number is either positive, negative, or zero. [...] Each game is either positive, negative, zero, or fuzzy (incomparable with zero, such as {1|−1}).|$|E

60|$|Paul {{looked up}} mechanically. It was true. Whether from some occult sympathy, {{from a human}} {{tendency}} to admire obvious fitness and symmetry, or the innocent love with which the world regards innocent lovers, they were all observing Yerba and himself with undisguised attention. A good talker, he quickly led the conversation to other topics. It was then that he discovered that Yerba was not only accomplished, but that this convent-bred girl had acquired a singular breadth of knowledge apart from the ordinary routine of the school curriculum. She spoke and thought with independent perceptions and clearness, yet without the tactlessness and masculine abruptness that is apt to detract from feminine originality of reflection. By some tacit understanding that had the charm of mutual confidence, they both exerted themselves to please the company rather <b>than</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and Paul, in the interchange of sallies with Dona Anna, had a certain pleasure in hearing Yerba converse in Spanish with Don Caesar. But {{in a few moments}} he observed, with some uneasiness, that they were talking of the old Spanish occupation, and presently of the old Spanish families. Would she prematurely expose an ignorance that might be hereafter remembered against her, or invite some dreadful genealogical reminiscence that would destroy her hopes and raze her Spanish castles? Or was she simply collecting information? He admired the dexterity with which, without committing herself, she made Don Caesar openly and even confidentially communicative. And yet he was on thorns; at times it seemed as if he himself were playing a part in this imposture of Yerba's. He was aware that his wandering attention was noticed by the quick-witted Dona Anna, when he regained his self-possession by {{what appeared to be a}} happy diversion. It was the voice of Mrs. Judge Baker calling across the table to Yerba. By one of the peculiar accidents of general conversation, it was the one apparently trivial remark that in a pause challenged the ears of all.|$|E
