5|$|In 2001, Corzine coauthored (with Bob Graham) a tax-cut {{proposal}} {{aimed at}} lowering the marginal <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> from 15% to 10% {{on the first}} $19,000 of taxable income. In 2002, he proposed a tax cut that exempted the first $10,000 of income from the $765 of Social Security taxes for both employers and employees. Corzine also proposed making dividend payments tax deductible to companies {{as a form of}} economic stimulus.|$|E
5|$|The Curia of Other Municipalities {{consisted}} of 8764 electors from amongst small-scale rural landowners. There were {{two stages of}} voting for this curia. In the first stage, the suffrage was determined {{in the same manner}} as with the Curia of the Cities: those in the two-thirds highest <b>tax</b> <b>bracket,</b> with a high level of education, or an important office, were eligible. These voters elected the electors, who then elected seventy-four deputies to the Diet, each holding a constituency equivalent to a rural district.|$|E
5|$|During Reagan's presidency, {{federal income}} tax rates were lowered {{significantly}} with {{the signing of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. Other tax increases passed by Congress and signed by Reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 18.2% of GDP as compared to 18.1% over the 40-year period of 1970–2010. Then, in 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act of 1982 was signed into law, initiating one of the United States' first public–private partnerships and {{a major part of the}} president's job creation program. Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Labor and Chief of Staff, Al Angrisani, was a primary architect of the bill.|$|E

50|$|The United States {{federal income}} tax system is progressive, meaning, the higher the income the higher {{percentage}} of that income is paid to {{the government in the}} form of a tax. The progressivity of the income tax system encourages income redistribution, which is the shifting of income from individuals in high <b>tax</b> <b>brackets</b> to others in lower <b>tax</b> <b>brackets.</b>|$|R
25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a higher <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in higher tax brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E
25|$|After {{the court}} ruling, as the 2010 {{legislative}} session {{drew to a}} close, Pawlenty vetoed a budget which would fix a $2.9-billion deficit by adding a new <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> for six-figure incomes. In response to the proposal, he criticized Democrats for attempting to raise taxes {{in the midst of}} an extremely difficult economic situation. Eventually, due in part to the efforts of House Speaker Margaret Kelliher, who was running for the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor of Minnesota, the General Assembly passed legislation approving nearly all the original unallotments.|$|E
25|$|Fiscal {{conservatism}} was rhetorically promoted {{during the}} presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–1989). During Reagan's tenure, the top personal income <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> dropped from 70% to 28%, while payroll taxes and the effective tax rates on the lower two income quintiles increased. Real GDP growth recovered strongly after the 1982 recession, growing {{at an annual rate}} of 3.4% for the rest of his time in office. Unemployment dropped after peaking at over 10.7% percent in 1982, and inflation decreased significantly. Federal tax receipts nearly doubled from $517 billion in 1980 to $1,032 billion in 1990. Employment grew at about the same rate as population.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{capital gains}} tax rates {{decreased}} significantly for both the bottom two and the top two income <b>tax</b> <b>brackets.</b> The top two income <b>tax</b> <b>brackets</b> have had a net decrease in their long-term {{capital gains tax}} rates of 13% since 1988, while the lowest two income tax brackets' long-term capital gains tax rates have changed by 10% and 13%, respectively, in that time. The difference between income and long-term capital gains taxes for the top two income <b>tax</b> <b>brackets</b> (5% in 1988 and 18% and 20%, respectively, in 2011), however, {{is larger than the}} difference between the income and long-term capital gains tax rates for the bottom two income <b>tax</b> <b>brackets</b> (0% in 1988 and 5% and 10%, respectively, in 2011). As of the 2013 tax year, all investment income for high earning households will be subject to a 3.8% surtax bringing the top capital gains rate to 23.8%.|$|R

25|$|In 1751, Friedemann married Dorothea Elisabeth Georgi (1721–1791), who was 11 {{years his}} junior and who outlived him by seven years. Dorothea was the {{daughter}} of a tax collector. The landed estates she inherited caused the family to be placed in a high <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> by Halle authorities, who were raising taxes to meet the revenue demands of the Seven Years' War. To raise cash for these payments, she sold part of her property in 1770. The couple produced two sons and a daughter, Friederica Sophia (born in 1757), who {{was the only one of}} their offspring to live past infancy. The descendents of Friederica Sophia eventually migrated to Oklahoma.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives {{argued that}} the GST cuts would benefit all Canadians, {{including}} low-income earners and those outside the workforce who do not pay income tax. The first GST cut went into effect on July 1, 2006, and no provinces have raised provincial sales tax yet. In addition, the Conservatives rolled back the income tax cut on the lowest <b>tax</b> <b>bracket,</b> restoring it back to 15.5% from 15%, increased and added tax exemption rates and introduced a $100 monthly child care allowance for families with children at or {{under the age of}} six. The Liberals and NDP voiced disapproval over the Conservatives following through on their election promise to replace the Liberal's proposed child care policy with their own, and for replacing Canada's $4 billion environmental policy with a $2 billion Conservative plan. The budget passed third reading without dissent on June 6, 2006 when the members of the Opposition accidentally failed to stand after the Deputy Speaker of the House called for debate.|$|E
500|$|The Curia of the Cities {{consisted}} of 2264 electors from important cities. The position of [...] "elector" [...] was granted based on status: those within the two-thirds highest <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> were eligible, and others became eligible {{on the basis}} of their education, or because they held an important office. Electors usually were members of the clergy, office workers, doctors, teachers at the high schools, and directors of primary schools. These electors had the right to elect twenty-three (increased to 26 in 1863; 31 in 1900) deputies to the Diet.|$|E

500|$|Conversely, Congress {{passed and}} Reagan {{signed into law}} tax {{increases}} of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), Social Security, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA). Despite the fact that TEFRA was the [...] "largest peacetime tax increase in American history," [...] gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovered strongly after the early 1980s recession ended in 1982, and grew during his eight years in office {{at an annual rate}} of 7.9% per year, with a high of 12.2% growth in 1981. Unemployment peaked at 10.8% monthly rate in December 1982—higher than any time since the Great Depression—then dropped during the rest of Reagan's presidency. Sixteen million new jobs were created, while inflation significantly decreased. The Tax Reform Act of 1986, another bipartisan effort championed by Reagan, simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing a number of tax breaks. The top rate was dropped to 28%, but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20% to 28%. The increase of the lowest <b>tax</b> <b>bracket</b> from 11% to 15% was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption, standard deduction, and earned income tax credit. The net result was the removal of six million poor Americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels.|$|E

50|$|In a {{proportional}} tax, the {{tax rate}} is fixed and the average tax rate equals this tax rate. In case of <b>tax</b> <b>brackets,</b> commonly used for progressive taxes, the average tax rate increases as taxable income increases through <b>tax</b> <b>brackets,</b> asymptoting to the top tax rate. For example, consider a system with three <b>tax</b> <b>brackets,</b> 10%, 20%, and 30%, where the 10% rate applies to income from $1 to $10,000, the 20% rate applies to income from $10,001 to $20,000, and the 30% rate applies to all income above $20,000. Under this system, someone earning $25,000 would pay $1,000 for the first $10,000 of income (10%); $2,000 for the second $10,000 of income (20%); and $1,500 for the last $5,000 of income (30%). In total, they would pay $4,500, or an 18% average tax rate.|$|R
