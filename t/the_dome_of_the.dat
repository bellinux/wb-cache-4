5|$|A coastal fort {{was erected}} by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik, the builder of <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock, {{at or near}} the former Azotus Paralios, which was later reconstructed by the Fatimids and Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid {{period in}} Jerusalem {{following}} its conquest by Saladin {{was marked by}} a huge investment {{in the construction of}} houses, markets, public bathes, and pilgrim hostels. Numerous works were undertaken at the Temple Mount. Saladin ordered all the inner walls and pillars of <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock to be covered in marble and he initiated the renovation of the mosaics on the dome's drum. The mihrab of the al-Aqsa Mosque was repaired and in 1217, al-Mu'azzam Isa built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates. <b>The</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ascension was also built and restoration work was done to the existing free-standing domes of the Temple Mount.|$|E
5|$|The Fountain of Qasim Pasha, {{built by}} the Ottomans in 1526 and located north of the mosque on the {{platform}} of <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock, was used by worshipers for ablution and for drinking until the 1940s. Today, it stands as a monumental structure.|$|E
50|$|He {{produced}} several 360-degree panoramas for projection in <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planetariums at Stuttgart, Winnipeg, and Lucerne, {{and exhibited}} in Washington, D.C., Boston, Nashville, Stuttgart, Berne, Lucerne, Zurich, and other venues.

50|$|From the courtyard, the {{architecture}} seems dour except for <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church. <b>The</b> interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church in Greek Cross layout, is decorated by Giovanni Manfredini with Grotteschi, an ornamentation then utilized in cemetery churches {{due to their}} prevalence in Roman catacombs.|$|R

5|$|Two {{years later}} he was awarded an Honorary Grand Prix at the Salón Nacional and co-founded a mural {{workshop}} with fellow artists Spilimbergo, Juan Carlos Castagnino, Demetrio Urruchúa, and Manuel Colmeiro. The artists decorated <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Galerías Pacifico.|$|E
5|$|In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was {{foremost}} {{in studying the}} remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering was building <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} a century after the capture of Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} the construction of <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
50|$|Extant temple architecturally {{represents}} a striking example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national style <b>of</b> Russian architecture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 17th century, characteristic features <b>of</b> which are <b>the</b> five <b>domes,</b> <b>the</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arch building, <b>the</b> framing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church. The upper temple {{was built on}} the ground floor and has two tiers of Windows framed with frames consisting of two columns connected at the top brace. The steepled bell tower, and <b>the</b> verge <b>of</b> its third tier is oriented to the cardinal.|$|R

50|$|By 2010, the basilica's {{interior}} {{should have}} undergone a complete restoration. It will then celebrate a double jubilee: 350 years since <b>the</b> laying <b>of</b> its conerstone in 1660, and 300 years since its completion in 1710. The interior's last restoration was around 50 ago; the exterior was restored in 1982, and in 1998, <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two towers were re-covered.|$|R
5|$|Palestine was conquered by the Islamic Caliphate, {{beginning}} in 634 CE. In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim {{conquest of the}} Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as Jund Filastin within the province of Bilâd al-Shâm (Greater Syria). In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem. <b>The</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock, completed in 691, was the world's first great work of Islamic architecture.|$|E
5|$|The East Side is {{also home}} to the First Baptist Church in America, which was founded by Williams in 1638, as well as the Old State House which served as the state's capitol from 1762 to 1904. Nearby is Roger Williams National Memorial. <b>The</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State House is the fourth-largest {{self-supporting}} marble dome {{in the world and the}} second-largest marble dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The Westminster Arcade is the oldest enclosed shopping center in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The mosque's main {{ablution}} fountain, {{known as}} al-Kas ("the Cup"), is located {{north of the}} mosque between it and <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock. It is used by worshipers to perform wudu, a ritual washing of the hands, arms, legs, feet, and face before entry into the mosque. It was first built in 709 by the Umayyads, but in 1327–28 Governor Tankiz enlarged it to accommodate more worshipers. Although originally supplied with water from Solomon's Pools near Bethlehem, it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem's water supply. In the 20th-century, al-Kas was provided taps and stone seating.|$|E
50|$|Andrea Vassallo (2 January 1856 - 28 January 1928) was {{an eclectic}} Maltese architect. He {{designed}} buildings in various styles, including Neoclassicism, Rococo Revival, Neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau and Neo-Romanesque. His masterpiece is <b>the</b> basilica <b>of</b> Ta' Pinu in Gozo, while other notable works include <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ħamrun and Siġġiewi parish churches, Villa Rosa and the now-demolished Casa Said.|$|R
25|$|The word cereals {{derives from}} Ceres, commemorating her {{association}} with edible grains. Statues <b>of</b> Ceres top <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri State Capitol and the Vermont State House {{serving as a}} reminder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> agriculture in <b>the</b> states' economies and histories. There is also a statue of her on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Board <b>of</b> Trade Building, which conducts trading in agricultural commodities.|$|R
25|$|Mosaic was a {{favourite}} form <b>of</b> decoration in <b>the</b> Byzantine {{period and}} richly decorated churches in this style {{can be seen}} throughout Greece, in Turkey, Italy, Sicily, Russia and other countries. In the 19th century, gold mosaics were applied to <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chancel <b>of</b> St Pauls Cathedral in London, illustrating the creation. In Western Europe, however, it was rare north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alps.|$|R
5|$|After the Ottomans assumed {{power in}} 1517, {{they did not}} {{undertake}} any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself, but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole. This included {{the building of the}} Fountain of Qasim Pasha (1527), the restoration of the Pool of Raranj, and the building of three free-standing domes—the most notable being <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prophet built in 1538. All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves. The sultans did make additions to existing minarets, however. In 1816, the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al-Adil after having been in a dilapidated state.|$|E
5|$|Bartholdi and Laboulaye {{considered}} {{how best}} to express the idea of American liberty. In early American history, two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation. One of these symbols, the personified Columbia, {{was seen as an}} embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France. Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess, which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans. The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty, derived from Libertas, the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome, especially among emancipated slaves. A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time, and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art, including Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom (1863) atop <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Capitol Building.|$|E
5|$|During the {{periodic}} renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate constructed {{additions to the}} mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its minbar, minarets and the interior structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock as a church, but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by Saladin in 1187. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is under Israeli control, but the mosque remains under {{the administration of the}} Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.|$|E
25|$|Russian domes {{are often}} gilded or brightly painted. A {{dangerous}} technique of chemical gilding using mercury had been applied on some occasions until the mid-19th century, {{most notably in}} <b>the</b> giant <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> Saint Isaac's Cathedral. <b>The</b> more modern and safe method of gold electroplating was applied {{for the first time}} in gilding <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral <b>of</b> Christ <b>the</b> Saviour in Moscow, the tallest Eastern Orthodox church in the world.|$|R

5|$|In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Creswell, while {{referring}} to the Aphrodito Papyri, claims that Abd al-Malik's son, al-Walid I, reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque {{over a period of}} six months to a year, using workers from Damascus. Most scholars agree that the mosque's reconstruction was started by Abd al-Malik, but that al-Walid oversaw its completion. In 713–14, a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem, destroying the eastern section of the mosque, which was subsequently rebuilt during al-Walid's rule. In order to finance its reconstruction, al-Walid had gold from <b>the</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock minted to use as money to purchase the material. The Umayyad-built al-Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people. They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E
50|$|Despite <b>the</b> {{official}} statements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architect about <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Library <b>of</b> Kosovo {{there are}} many other controversies when it comes to <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building and its meaning.One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most famous versions is the one that connects <b>the</b> <b>domes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building with the national Albanian hat “plisi”.This was the reason why Serbian politicians reacted very strongly about <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan (1603–1618), perhaps [...] "the quintessential Persian <b>dome</b> chamber", blends <b>the</b> square {{room with}} <b>the</b> zone <b>of</b> {{transition}} and uses plain squinches like those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Seljuq period.

Safavid domes were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as <b>the</b> Mughal architecture <b>of</b> India.|$|R
5|$|The glass {{industry}} in Hebron was established during Roman rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE). As the ancient Phoenician {{glass industry}} shrank from the exposed cities {{along the eastern}} Mediterranean coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular. Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit {{as part of the}} Drake Collection. Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the Cave of Machpelah, which served as a church during the Crusader era in Palestine. Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning <b>the</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem.|$|E

A dove with a white halo, representing the Holy Spirit, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the Trinity. Above Jesus fly four cherubim. Seated to Jesus' right is Mary, his mother, and to his left Saint John the Baptist. On the same cloud as Jesus, three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging censers. Under the entire scene, a banner displays Gloria in Excelsis Deo.|$|E
5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque but today it is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied kiosk, was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are scalloped on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. <b>The</b> <b>dome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kiosk is framed by a battlement decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. The quinches at the corners of the dome are covered with muqarnas. The kiosk has motifs of pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves which are also replicated in the Ben Youssef Madrasa.|$|E
