Tacitus says this shows the true grief {{that the people}} of Rome felt, and this also shows that by this time the people already knew <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to commemorate dead princes without an edict from a magistrate. At his funeral, there were no procession statues of Germanicus. There were abundant eulogies and reminders of his fine character and a particular eulogy was given by Tiberius himself in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|According to Danish tradition, burning is <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> {{to dispose}} of a worn Dannebrog flag.

25|$|Mammals are a clade, and {{therefore}} the cladists are happy to acknowledge the traditional taxon Mammalia; and birds, too, are a clade, universally ascribed to the formal taxon Aves. Mammalia and Aves are, in fact, subclades within the grand clade of the Amniota. But the traditional class Reptilia is not a clade. It is just {{a section of the}} clade Amniota: the section that is left after the Mammalia and Aves have been hived off. It cannot be defined by synapomorphies, as is <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way.</b> Instead, it is defined by a combination of the features it has and the features it lacks: reptiles are the amniotes that lack fur or feathers. At best, the cladists suggest, we could say that the traditional Reptilia are 'non-avian, non-mammalian amniotes'.|$|E
25|$|Veeck {{once again}} came to Paige's rescue when, after {{taking control of}} the Phillies' triple-A farm team, the Miami Marlins of the International League, he signed Paige to a {{contract}} for $15,000 and a percentage of the gate. Marlins manager Don Osborn did not want Paige and said that he would only use him in exhibition games. Veeck made a deal with Osborn that he could line up his best nine hitters, rotating them in from their positions in the field, and Veeck agreed to pay ten dollars to any of them who get a clean hit off of Paige. Paige retired all nine and Osborn agreed to make Paige a roster player. In Paige's first game as a Marlin, he pitched a complete-game, four-hit shutout. Osborn, a former minor league pitcher, taught Paige <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to throw a curveball, which allowed Paige to tear through the International League. Paige finished the season 11–4 with an ERA of 1.86 with 79 strikeouts and only 28 walks. This time, when Veeck left the team, Paige was allowed to stay on, for two more years.|$|E

In the case of Zeus, for instance, it was clear that building more fallout shelters would both be less expensive and save more lives than Zeus. A major report on the topic by PSAC in October 1961 made this point, suggesting that Zeus without shelters was useless, and that having Zeus might lead the US to [...] "introduce dangerously misleading assumptions concerning the ability of the US to protect its cities".|$|E
500|$|The Linga Purana also {{mentions}} {{the visit of}} Bhikshatana-Shiva to Deodar Forest to entice the wives of sages, who had taken up austerities [...] "detrimental to the perpetuation of a healthy social order." [...] The scripture mentions Bhikshatana-Shiva's deformed but attractive nude black-red form, his seduction of the sages' wives, and the sages' resulting curse. However, the curse proves fruitless in this version.

The gadgery {{was seen as a}} useful gameplay feature, with AllGame noting that players need to figure out <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to use each gadget. Although GameZone highlighted the multiplayer mode for its replay value and teamplay options, critics agreed that the game felt short in comparison to Perfect Dark. The artificial intelligence of multiplayer bots was also a frequent criticism. According to GameSpot, [...] "they generally amount to nothing more than fragging".

500|$|Janeway Lambda one was {{originally}} scheduled to {{debut in the}} teaser of the first-season episode [...] "". Episode director Winrich Kolbe, and visual effects producer Dan Curry, collaborated to create the Gothic novel setting {{through the use of}} second unit blue screen sequences. During a pre-production meeting, Kolbe and Taylor met with special effects coordinator Dick Brownfield, and unit production manager Brad Yacobian, to finalize the set design and to clarify the special effects. Their discussion covered minor actions and effects, such as how much rainwater would be coming through an open window, and whether or not the raindrops on Janeway's clothing would disappear when the simulation ended. Kolbe meticulously planned actors' performances in the teaser sequence, such as researching <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> of pouring and serving tea according to 1840s customs. According to Poe, attention to such small details in the script was common in the production of Star Trek episodes.|$|E
500|$|Lords Bingham and Mance, dissenting, {{took the}} view that the Order in Council was {{unreasonable}} and therefore invalid. Bingham noted that <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to interpret an exercise of the royal prerogative was to look at how it had been exercised previously, and that he could not find any previous record of the prerogative being used to [...] "exile an indigenous population from its homeland". [...] He argued that this prerogative power did not exist: [...] "he Crown has never had a prerogative power to prevent its subjects from entering the Kingdom, or to expel them from it". Accordingly, the Order was ultra vires. Bingham also maintained that it was irrational, since visits to the outer islands did not threaten US security, and unacceptable, in that no consideration had been given to the Chagossians. On the subject of legitimate expectation, the dissenters maintained that the statement should be [...] "construed according to the ordinary meaning that would be attached to it by those, principally the Chagossians and their supporters, to whom it was directed"; Bingham saw the ordinary meaning as being that the Chagossians would be allowed to return home.|$|E

500|$|Football is a full-contact sport, and {{injuries}} are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players. To {{try to prevent}} injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment. At a minimum players must wear a football helmet {{and a set of}} shoulder pads, but individual leagues may require additional padding such as thigh pads and guards, knee pads, chest protectors, and mouthguards. Most injuries occur in the lower extremities, particularly in the knee, but a significant number also affect the upper extremities. The most common types of injuries are strains, sprains, bruises, fractures, dislocations, and concussions. Repeated concussions can increase a person's risk in later life for chronic traumatic encephalopathy and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet or upper-body contact between opposing players, although helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Various programs are aiming to reduce concussions by reducing the frequency of helmet-to-helmet hits; USA Football's [...] "Heads Up Football" [...] program is aiming to reduce concussions in youth football by teaching coaches and players about the signs of a concussion, <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to wear football equipment and ensure it fits, and proper tackling methods that avoid helmet-to-helmet contact. However, a study in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine found that Heads Up Football was ineffective; the same study noted that more extensive reforms implemented by Pop Warner Little Scholars and its member teams were effective in significantly reducing concussion rates.|$|E
500|$|A very {{significant}} change in Swedish occurred in the late 1960s, with the so-called du-reformen, [...] "the you-reform". Previously, <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of herr ("Mr" [...] or [...] "Sir"), fru ("Mrs" [...] or [...] "Ma'am") or fröken ("Miss") was considered the only acceptable mode of initiating conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be {{referred to in the}} third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ni (the standard second person plural pronoun), analogous to the French Vous. (Cf. T-V distinction.) Ni (plural second person pronoun) wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of du (singular second person pronoun) used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s, these previously significant distinctions of class became less important, and du became the standard, even in formal and official contexts. Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decrees, but rather a sweeping change in social attitudes, it was completed {{in just a few years}} from the late 1960s to early 1970s. The use of ni as a polite form of address is occasionally encountered today in both the written and spoken language, particularly among younger speakers.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the beliefs}} held by Han-era {{physicians}} {{are known to}} modern historians through such texts as the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (Huangdi neijing) medical corpus, which was compiled from the 3rd to 2nd century BCE and was mentioned in the Book of Later Han. It is clear from this text and others that their metaphysical beliefs in the five phases and yin and yang dictated their medical decisions and assumptions. The Han-era Chinese believed that each organ in the body was associated {{with one of the}} five phases (metal 金, wood 木, water 水, fire 火, earth 土) and had two circulatory qi channels (任督二脉). If these channels were disrupted, Han medical texts suggest that one should consume an edible material associated with one of these phases that would counteract the organ's prescribed phase and thus restore one's health. For example, the Chinese believed that when the heart—associated with the fire phase—caused one to become sluggish, then one should eat sour food because it was associated with the wood phase (which promoted fire). The Han Chinese also believed that by using pulse diagnosis, a physician could determine which organ of the body emitted [...] "vital energy" [...] (qi) and what qualities the latter had, in order to figure out the exact disorder the patient was suffering. Despite the influence of metaphysical theory on medicine, Han texts also give practical advice, such as <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>way</b> to perform clinical lancing to remove an abscess. The Huangdi neijing noted the symptoms and reactions of people with various diseases of the liver, heart, spleen, lung, or kidneys in a 24-hour period, which was a recognition of circadian rhythm, although explained in terms of the five phases.|$|E
