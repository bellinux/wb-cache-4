5|$|Napkin {{psoriasis}} is a subtype of psoriasis {{common in}} infants characterized by red papules with silver scale in <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> area that may {{extend to the}} torso or limbs. Napkin psoriasis is often misdiagnosed as napkin dermatitis (diaper rash).|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>diaper,</b> but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{features}} of disposable diapers include {{one or more}} pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool {{which has not been}} absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> is wet.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>diapers</b> used on primates, canines, etc. {{are much}} like <b>the</b> <b>diapers</b> used by humans. <b>The</b> <b>diapers</b> used on equines are {{intended}} to catch excretions, as opposed to absorbing them.|$|R
50|$|The {{producers}} {{had intended}} for the DriveSHAFT video to be a remake of the Beatles Abbey Road album cover, only with <b>the</b> bandmembers wearing <b>diapers.</b> However, {{they were unable to}} get permission to reproduce the scene, so instead used <b>the</b> <b>diapers</b> in a different way, singing inside of a crib while they wore <b>the</b> <b>diapers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the name}} of Emporio Armani Wodkins {{produced}} fake Armani Diapers, marketing it on a specially created web page for Russian Armani.

This until Armani denied being part of <b>the</b> <b>diapers,</b> threatening to take legal action.|$|R
25|$|A {{disposable}} diaper {{may also}} include an inner fabric {{designed to hold}} moisture against the skin {{for a brief period}} before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. Most materials in <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> are held together {{with the use of a}} hot-melt adhesive, which is applied in spray form or multi lines, an elastic hot melt is also used to help with pad integrity when <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> is wet.|$|E
25|$|Some {{disposable}} diapers include fragrance, lotions or {{essential oils}} {{in order to}} help mask the scent of a soiled diaper, or to protect the skin. Care of disposable diapers is minimal, and primarily consists of keeping them in a dry place before use, with proper disposal in a garbage receptacle upon soiling. Stool is supposed to be deposited in the toilet, but is generally put in the garbage with the rest of <b>the</b> <b>diaper.</b>|$|E
25|$|A diaper (American English) or a nappy (British English) {{is a type}} of {{underwear}} that allows the wearer to defecate or urinate without the use of a toilet, by absorbing or containing waste products to prevent soiling of outer clothing or the external environment. When diapers become soiled, they require changing, generally by a second person such as a parent or caregiver. Failure to change a diaper on a sufficiently regular basis can result in skin problems around the area covered by <b>the</b> <b>diaper.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{disposable}} <b>diaper,</b> in {{its original}} form invented by Victor Mills of Procter & Gamble, required a core of thick rolls of paper in order to adequately contain fluid and guard against diaper rash. This made <b>the</b> <b>diapers</b> undesirably heavy and bulky. In 1966, Harmon and Harper each independently discovered that {{a small amount of}} a highly absorbent polymer could be more effectively used in place of rolls of paper in <b>the</b> <b>diaper's</b> core. <b>The</b> two men each filed substantively identical patents on the polymer at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Michelstadt {{was granted}} these arms in 1541 {{along with its}} new seal by Count Georg of Erbach. <b>The</b> <b>diapering</b> in <b>the</b> {{lower half of the}} {{escutcheon}} is unhistoric, and only appeared in the 17th century. Indeed, the escutcheon on the Town Hall, pictured in this article, does not show it.

50|$|<b>The</b> Los Angeles <b>Diaper</b> Drive is {{non-profit}} organization founded in 2005 by Caroline Kunitz and Melissa Ratcliff.The charity {{was created to}} provide diapers to low-income families in the Los Angeles area {{with an emphasis on}} fostering safe and healthy environments through education. The all-volunteer charity is supported 100% by donations. <b>The</b> <b>diapers</b> are distributed through Los Angeles based community organizations that work with low income families. These organizations often use <b>the</b> <b>diapers</b> as incentive to take important life skills classes aimed at improving lives and promoting safe and healthy families. The classes range from GED prep classes to basic parenting skills.|$|R
25|$|The {{walls of}} the Memorial Chamber are divided into 17 niches {{designed}} by Ira Lake and A. Fortescue Duguid. Each contain a marble slab under a gothic blind arch topped with a gablet and finial, and decorated with various badges and insignia, including those of, on the mouldings: Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments; in the pierced quatrefoil panels: cavalry, and non-infantry field units; in <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> background: pre-Confederation French and British regiments and colonial forces; on the gablet crockets: reinforced battalions; on the gablet springers: all branches of the Canadian Corps; on the arch quatrefoil and cusps: Badges and insignia of Canada's 178 pre-1914 militia regiments: The Royal Canadian Dragoons, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians), The Governor General's Body Guard, 1st Hussars, 2nd Dragoons, 3rd The Prince of Wales' Canadian Dragoons; on the arch spandrels: medals and war decorations of the allied countries; on the shield: coats of arms appropriate to the relevant historical context; and on the low relief panel: historical scenes of Canadians during World War I. The marble panels themselves originally described the various campaigns and battles in the theatres of war between 1914 and 1918. These, however, were replaced in 1982 with panels illustrating the Canadian Forces' engagements from the Fenian Raids to the Korean War, along with excerpts from the Bible, poems, and other literature.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{variation}} of omorashi play is omutsu omorashi, less commonly called oshime omorashi, {{both of which}} translate as [...] "to wet oneself in a diaper." [...] This omutsu variation {{is essentially the same}} as the standard omorashi, except that the participants are wearing a diaper. Diapers may be favorable for public wetting because they render it more discreet and eliminate mess, and their use is not limited specifically to those with a diaper fetish. However, omorashi fetishists specifically interested in this aspect of the subculture could be considered a Japanese {{variation of}} <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> lover community.|$|E
2500|$|The Middle English word diaper {{originally}} {{referred to}} a type of cloth rather than the use thereof; [...] "diaper" [...] was the term for a pattern of repeated, [...] rhombic shapes, and later came to describe a white cotton or linen fabric with this pattern. The first cloth diapers consisted of {{a specific type of}} soft tissue sheet, cut into geometric shapes. This type of pattern was called diapering and eventually gave its name to the cloth used to make diapers and then to <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> itself, which was traced back to 1590s England. This usage stuck in the United States and Canada following the British colonization of North America, but in the United Kingdom the word [...] "nappy" [...] took its place. Most sources believe nappy is a diminutive form of the word napkin, which itself was originally a diminutive.|$|E
50|$|Early in {{the century}} the old {{conventional}} treatment of landscape still held its own; nor did <b>the</b> <b>diapered</b> and gilded background pass out of use. Indeed, {{in some of the}} finest French specimens of <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>diapered</b> patterns are more brilliant than ever. But natural scenery {{in the second quarter of}} the century asserts itself more decidedly, although with faults in perspective. It was not until another generation had arisen that there was a true appreciation of the horizon and of atmospheric effect.|$|R

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few decades, the {{disposable}} diaper industry boomed and the competition between Procter & Gamble's Pampers and Kimberly Clark's Huggies resulted in lower prices and drastic changes to diaper design. Several improvements were made, {{such as the use}} of double gussets to improve diaper fit and containment. As stated in Procter & Gamble's initial 1973 patent for the use of double gussets in a diaper, “The double gusset folded areas tend to readily conform to the thigh portions of the leg of the infant. This allows quick and easy fitting and provides a snug and comfortable diaper fit that will neither bind nor wad on the infant…as a result of this snugger fit obtained because of this fold configuration, <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> is less likely to leak or, in other words, its containment characteristics are greatly enhanced.” Further developments in diaper design were made, such as the introduction of refastenable tapes, the [...] "hourglass shape" [...] so as to reduce bulk at the crotch area, and the 1984 introduction of super-absorbent material from polymers known as sodium polyacrylate that were originally developed in 1966.|$|E
6000|$|... 24. I {{wish you}} {{especially}} to notice these points, because the false theory that ornamentation should be merely decorated structure is so pretty and plausible, {{that it is}} likely to take away your attention from the far more important abstract conditions of design. Structure should never be contradicted, and in the best buildings it is pleasantly exhibited and enforced: in this very porch the joints of every stone are visible, and you will find me in the Fifth Lecture insisting on this clearness of its anatomy as a merit; yet so independent is the mechanical structure of the true design, that when I begin my Lectures on Architecture, the first building I shall give you as a standard will be one in which the structure is wholly concealed. It will be the Baptistery of Florence, which is, in reality, as much a buttressed chapel with a vaulted roof, as the Chapter House of York;--but round it, in order to conceal that buttressed structure, (not to decorate, observe, but to conceal,) a flat external wall is raised; simplifying the whole to a mere hexagonal box, like a wooden piece of Tunbridge ware, on the surface of which the eye and intellect are to be interested by the relations of dimension and curve between pieces of incrusting marble of different colors, which have no {{more to do with the}} real make of the building than <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> of a Harlequin's jacket has to do with his bones.|$|E
5000|$|Cloth Diaper Liners {{are useful}} {{in order to keep}} your diapers cleaner. Just lay them on top of <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> to use. They can be made of paper or {{cellulose}} which are degradable, or polyester fleece which is washable and being non-absorbent will dry out as baby's body heat evaporates any moisture through to <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> so it dries out and acts as a stay-dry layer in <b>the</b> <b>diaper.</b> For diaper rash, silk or silver liners have a soothing and antibacterial action.|$|E
5000|$|Some are aroused from [...] "wetting" [...] (urination) their diapers, {{others like}} [...] "messing" [...] (defecation) their diapers. Some {{do not use}} <b>the</b> <b>diapers</b> at all (beyond wearing), for arousal, or bladder and bowel movements.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>diaper</b> bank {{movement}} {{began in}} 1994 when Resolve, Inc., a small {{consulting firm in}} Tucson, held a diaper drive {{during the holiday season}} to assist a local crisis nursery. Encouraged by the enthusiastic response, and the subsequent demand for emergency diaper assistance, the firm gained an understanding of how the community could come together and help solve a problem. The executives at Resolve made the December Diaper Drive an annual tradition, and within five years they were collecting 300,000 diapers during drive and distributed the diapers to families at 30 local social service agencies. In 2000, <b>the</b> <b>diaper</b> drive effort was spun off into an independent nonprofit organization, <b>the</b> <b>Diaper</b> Bank of Southern Arizona, the nation’s first diaper bank.|$|E

5000|$|Because diapers are a low-margin product, it {{was deemed}} {{economically}} unfeasible to put Harmon and Harper's idea into mass production while the polymer {{was still under}} their patent protection. After the patent expired in the mid-1980s, however, manufacturers began to introduce [...] "superabsorbent" [...] disposable <b>diapers,</b> made with <b>the</b> polymers in place of excess paper in <b>the</b> <b>diaper's</b> core. <b>The</b> size and weight of disposable diapers then dropped substantially. This resulted in significant savings, both {{with regard to the}} cost of shipping large quantities of diapers from manufacturers to stores, and in the shelf space needed for <b>the</b> <b>diapers</b> in those stores.
