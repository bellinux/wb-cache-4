500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this still seems to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry {{to be able to talk}} about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{preparations}} complete, Cochrane {{ordered the}} attack {{for the evening}} of 11 April, although Gambier was reluctant to allow his sailors to support Cochrane in the operation, saying [...] "if you choose to rush to self-destruction <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> own affair [...] [...] [...] but it is my duty {{to take care of}} the lives of others, and I will not place the crews of the fireships in palpable danger". Cochrane was furious and after a bitter argument Gambier relented and gave permission for the attack to go ahead. He stationed Imperieuse near the Boyart Shoal to the north of the boom, approximately [...] from the French fleet, supported by frigates HMS Aigle, HMS Unicorn and HMS Pallas. This force would collect the crews of the fireships as they abandoned their blazing charges and rowed back towards the British line, and sloops HMS Redpole and HMS Lyra were equipped as light ships to guide the fireships into the channel. [...] With these ships were the schooner HMS Whiting and cutters Nimrud and King George, all converted into floating rocket batteries. Aetna and two brigs anchored north of the forts on Île-d'Aix, while frigate Emerald and five smaller warships were to launch a diversionary attack to the east of the island. Gambier, with the main body of the fleet, moved closer to the entrance to Aix Roads, eventually anchoring [...] distant; it has been suggested by one historian that he may have done so in order that he could retreat out to sea easily should the French fleet attempt to attack him in the aftermath of a failed fireship assault.|$|E

No one could answer her. On one occasion, Eliyahu asked her how he was to her during her days of white garments — the seven days after her menstrual period — and she reported that they ate, drank, and slept together without clothing.

2500|$|After the {{completion}} of binary fission or cell reproduction involving mitosis, each daughter cell has {{the same amount of}} DNA (Z) as what the parental cell had before it replicated its DNA. These two types of cell reproduction produced two daughter cells that have the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Chromosomes duplicate prior to cell division when forming new skin cells for reproduction. After meiotic cell reproduction the four daughter cells have half the number of chromosomes that the parental cell originally had. This is the haploid amount of DNA, often symbolized as N. Meiosis is used by diploid organisms to produce haploid gametes. In a diploid organism such as the human organism, most cells of [...] the body have the diploid amount of DNA, 2N. Using this notation for counting chromosomes we say that human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (2N = 46) while human sperm and eggs have 23 chromosomes (N = 23). Humans have 23 distinct types of chromosomes, the 22 autosomes and the special category of sex chromosomes. There are two distinct sex chromosomes, the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. A diploid human cell has 23 chromosomes from that person's father and 23 from the mother. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>your</b> body has two copies of human chromosome number 2, one from each of your parents.|$|E

[...] Abrabanel deduced that [...] (20:14 in NJSP) {{mentions}} the things that might be coveted in the order that a person has need of them, and what it behooves a person to try to acquire in this world. Therefore, the first coveted item mentioned is a person's house, then the person's spouse, then the person's servants, and lastly the person's animals that do not speak. [...] (5:18 in NJPS), however, mentions them {{in the order of}} the gravity of the sin and evil. The most evil coveting is that of another person's spouse, as in David's coveting of Bathsheba. Next in magnitude of evil comes coveting the house in which one's neighbor lives, lest the person evict the neighbor and take the neighbor's home. Next comes the neighbor's field, for although a person does not live there as in the house, it {{is the source of the}} neighbor's livelihood and inheritance, as in the affair of Ahab and the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. After the field [...] (5:18 in NJPS) mentions servants, who Abrabanel valued of lesser importance than one's field. Next come the neighbor's animals, who do not have the faculty of speech, and lastly, to include the neighbor's inanimate moveable property, [...] (5:18 in NJPS) says [...] "and anything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> neighbor's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What {{do you want me to}} do? [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - to point out that the condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances.
