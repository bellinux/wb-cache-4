5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers.

5|$|Henry {{restored}} {{many of the}} old {{financial institutions}} of his grandfather Henry I and undertook further, long-lasting reforms of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> English currency was managed; one result was a long-term increase in the supply of money within the economy, leading to a growth both in trade and inflation. Medieval rulers such as Henry enjoyed various sources of income during the 12th century. Some of their income came from their private estates, called demesne; other income came from imposing legal fines and arbitrary amercements, and from taxes, which at this time were raised only intermittently. Kings could also raise funds by borrowing; Henry did this far more than earlier English rulers, initially through moneylenders in Rouen, turning later in his reign to Jewish and Flemish lenders. Ready cash was increasingly important to rulers during the 12th century to enable the use of mercenary forces and the construction of stone castles, both vital to successful military campaigns.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Standards for {{exchange}} of purchasing information, such as ANSI X- 12 for EDI, {{have been used}} by large industries (e. g. retail and auto) for almost 30 years. Newer web-based tools and new standards hold the promise of reduced cost and wider applicability. For many small to medium sized enterprises, the cost and rigidity of existing tools out weight the prospective gains, which must be amortised over comparatively few transactions. In this paper, we describe the development of an N-tiered, object-oriented, architecture for interacting with suppliers based on emerging web tools. We explore <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which <b>the</b> project was required to adapt to existing purchasing systems and <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project evolved during its development.

Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming of the disease in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{electric}} field was introduced by Michael Faraday. An electric field is created by a charged body in the space that surrounds it, and results in a force exerted on any other charges placed within the field. The electric field acts between two charges {{in a similar manner}} to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gravitational field acts between two masses, and like it, extends towards infinity and shows an inverse square relationship with distance. However, there is an important difference. Gravity always acts in attraction, drawing two masses together, while the electric field can result in either attraction or repulsion. Since large bodies such as planets generally carry no net charge, the electric field at a distance is usually zero. Thus gravity is the dominant force at distance in the universe, despite being much weaker.|$|E
5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same fate. In addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing {{was not meant to}} be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically {{in the same way that}} the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E
