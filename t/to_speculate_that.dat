5|$|In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian {{mechanics}} {{to predict}} {{the position of the}} then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.|$|E

5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but {{he noted that the}} much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} that smaller-sized P. rebeli from Hungary {{normally}} eclose {{at the end of}} June or mid-July; however, when these populations are studied in laboratories, they do not eclose until late August. This has led researchers <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> P. rebeli larvae that do not receive adequate food can still fully develop in one year and act as a functioning adult. However, they are unlikely to be bivoltine (producing two broods in one season). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that certain researchers claim that P. rebeli larvae can have continuous development.|$|E

5|$|The {{burden on}} Miller and Lindwall {{increased}} when Johnston {{broke down in}} an early tour game. Miller was wicketless against Worcestershire, but succeeded with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 220 in just over six hours. He then scored 159notout against Yorkshire. At this point, Miller had scored 421runs in the week of May, and the media began <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> he could score 1000runs in one month, something {{that had been done}} on a tour only by Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Valérie is repulsed by her ugly {{husband and}} has gone five years without kissing him. She {{explains}} bluntly that her {{position as a}} married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Valérie jockeys for position between Hulot and Montés (while also sleeping with Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who offers the most wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers' devotion, and this wickedness– not to mention her gruesome demise– has led some critics <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> she is actually the focus of Balzac's morality tale.|$|E
5|$|In Week 3, Vick {{was brought}} into action against the St. Louis Rams when Ben Roethlisberger {{sustained}} a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. Vick played decently in that stretch, going 40–66 with 2 TDs and 1 INT, while also rushing for 104 yards on 15 carries (his other five carries were kneel downs). Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals, being replaced by Landry Jones, which led to him missing six games, and by then Roethlisberger was healthy enough to play. Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season, Vick would be inactive {{the remainder of the}} season, leading some sports commentators <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Vick's playing career may be over.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, the Order {{stated that it}} was {{entering}} {{the second stage of}} its development, in which it would leave behind its prior focus on recruitment and public outreach within the occult community and that it would instead focus on refining its teachings; its resulting quietness led some occultists <b>to</b> erroneously <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> the ONA had become defunct.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 Hyakuta's novel [...] "The Eternal Zero" [...] was published. It {{became a}} best-seller, with four million copies sold. It {{was made into}} a popular 2013 movie.

50|$|The term as used by archaeologists is vague {{in regard}} to denomination. A single coin buried with the dead and made of silver or gold is often {{referred}} to as a danake and presumed to be a form of Charon's obol. Numismatists have also found the danake an elusive coin <b>to</b> identify, <b>speculating</b> <b>that</b> the Greeks used the term loosely for a demonetized coin of foreign origin.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain {{of the life of}} Hieronymus Bosch or of the {{commissions}} or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost to history.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Sviatoslav's family life. It is {{possible}} {{that he was not}} the only (or the eldest) son of his parents. The Russo-Byzantine treaty of 945 mentions a certain Predslava, Volodislav's wife, as the noblest of the Rus' women after Olga. The fact that Predslava was Oleg's mother is presented by Vasily Tatishchev. He also speculated that Predslava was of a Hungarian nobility. George Vernadsky was among many historians <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Volodislav was Igor's eldest son and heir who died at some point during Olga's regency. Another chronicle told that Oleg (? - 944?) was the eldest son of Igor. At the time of Igor's death, Sviatoslav was still a child, and he was raised by his mother or under her instructions. Her influence, however, did not extend to his religious observance.|$|E
5|$|Capcom also {{announced}} North American and European releases of the game, and showcased {{it at the}} 2002 edition of the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). The North American version was to be titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, while the European version was announced to be titled GioGio's Bizarre Adventure in August 2002. This change in naming was on the request of Araki, who wanted an Italian spelling {{in order to stay}} true to the title character. The game was shown at Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's PlayStation Experience expo in August 2002, and was available for the public to play. At E3 2002, it was announced for an October 2002 release in the West, but was delayed to December 2002, and then again to February 14, 2003. By May 2003, it had not been released outside Japan, and was not listed as part of Capcom's game lineup for E3 2003, leading Eurogamer <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> the Western release had been cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{common theme}} is sex, which is {{frequently}} juxtaposed against the squeaky-clean {{stereotype of the}} innocent-looking Japanese girl. In the title song from Pregnant Fantasy, the unborn baby of a pregnant teenager asks why her mother will bear her when she is not wanted.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of an {{interstitial}} subtelomeric 10 q 26 deletion in a male child with moderate developmental delay and minor dysmorphic features. Using array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH), we have detected an interstitial deletion at 10 q 26. 2 q 26. 3 encompassing a 5. 8 [*]Mb region and spanning 24 genes. Interestingly, losses of this chromosome 10 region have not been previously associated with a phenotype outcome. According to an in silico evaluation, we have suggested that PPP 2 R 2 D and BNIP 3 losses are likely a cause of developmental delay in the index patient. Our data allow <b>to</b> <b>speculating</b> <b>that</b> haploinsufficiency of these two genes in 10 q 26. 3, which is usually ignored in the context of chromosome 10 q deletions, has a phenotypic effect...|$|R

5|$|Deinonychus teeth {{found in}} {{association}} with fossils of the ornithopod dinosaur Tenontosaurus are quite common in the Cloverly Formation. Two quarries have been discovered that preserve fairly complete Deinonychus fossils near Tenontosaurus fossils. The first, the Yale quarry in the Cloverly of Montana, includes numerous teeth, four adult Deinonychus and one juvenile Deinonychus. The association of this number of Deinonychus skeletons in a single quarry suggests that Deinonychus may have fed on that animal, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Deinonychus might have lived and hunted in packs. The second such quarry is from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma. The site contains six partial skeletons of Tenontosaurus of various sizes, along with one partial skeleton and many teeth of Deinonychus. One tenontosaur humerus even bears what might be Deinonychus tooth marks. Brinkman et al. (1998) point out that Deinonychus had an adult mass of 70–100 kilograms, whereas adult tenontosaurs were 1–4 metric tons. A solitary Deinonychus could not kill an adult tenontosaur, suggesting that pack hunting is possible.|$|E
5|$|Structure C8 is a {{residential}} compound that was accessed from the alley {{running to the}} East Plaza from behind Pyramid C1. The entrance opened onto the alley from a patio situated in the southern portion of the compound. This patio was surrounded on the east, west and north sides by rooms, with the alley to the south. It was floored with stucco and Structure C8 was the only stuccoed residential building {{in the whole of}} the city. The north range of rooms backed directly onto the ravine immediately to the north of Group C; the lower portion of the walls of the west room and of half of the north room still stand. The west room was square while the north room was narrow and probably extended the entire width of the patio. Wear marks in the stucco floor indicate that a door once accessed the north room from the west. The workmanship of Structure C8 was of very high quality and indicates that it was the residence of a member of the city's elite. Its proximity to the large pyramid-temple C1 has led archaeologist Henri Lehmann <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> it was once the house of the high priest.|$|E
5|$|The {{biology is}} poorly known; {{the male and}} female {{reproductive}} castes were described {{for the first time in}} 2012. The genus is known mainly from isolated workers found in Winkler or Berlese samples. Tatuidris workers have peculiar mandibular brushes and a powerful sting, which led Brown & Kempf <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Tatuidris might be specialist predators of active or slippery arthropod prey. Until 2011, no observations of live specimens were registered. Details of a first collection event of a small live colony (3 workers and 4 gynes) by Thibaut Delsinne in a mid-elevation forest in southeastern Ecuador suggest that Tatuidris may well be a highly specialized predator, as colonies kept in captivity did not accept any food item offered to them. Food items rejected by the ants included live and dead termites, millipedes, mites, various insect parts, sugar water, tuna, biscuits, live and dead fruit flies (Drosophila), live springtails, live myriapods (Chilopoda and Diplopoda), live and dead Diplura, small live spiders, small live pseudoscorpions, one small snail, uncooked hen egg (i.e. piece of cotton wool soaked with fresh whisked hen egg), ant larvae (Gnamptogenys sp.), and live ant workers (Cyphomyrmex sp., Brachymyrmex sp.). Potential food items (arthropods) for Tatuidris were taken from soil samples and Winkler samples collected at the site where Tatuidris was a priori determined to be present.|$|E

5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but {{it may have been}} Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Marie Eline was cast in the film, likely as the newspaper boy. Eline had previously played a newspaper boy in Not Guilty. The role of the flower girl has been claimed to be Frances Gibson by an answer column in Motion Picture Story Magazine. This is disputable because Gibson is known only to have a single credit with the Thanhouser Company, in the 1912 release of Nicholas Nickleby. Around this time Gibson was appearing in Solax Studios productions. Both immediate before and after her only Thanhouser credit, Gibson was employed by Solax, leading Bowers <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> her appearance in that one film may have been as a special project. A different film still shows William Russell and opens the possibility of identifying the other actors. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E
5|$|Yet such flaws {{were not}} {{immediately}} obvious {{and by the}} second half of 1967 the Viet Cong in Phuoc Tuy Province seemed to have melted away, abandoning many of their bunker systems and avoiding the main roads and towns. The Battle of Long Tan and Operation Bribie had weakened the communist forces in the province, while further operations had restricted their movement and logistics. This prompted Graham <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> the Viet Cong may have fled to the border, perhaps leaving the province altogether. He reasoned that a succession of operations in the south-east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single, sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy. Meanwhile, despite allegations of corruption and ballot rigging by the ruling military junta, South Vietnam's presidential elections in September had been unhampered by security concerns and were largely considered successful, with 83 percent of eligible voters turning out nationwide; in Phuoc Tuy this number was higher still at over 90 percent. Graham believed that the large public turnout in Phuoc Tuy had been due to the long-term effects of Australian operations in the province which had increased the population's sense of security. During his tour of duty the task force had conducted 32 operations before he handed over command in October 1967. He was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO).|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} threat of the Darkness – {{revealed}} {{over the course of the}} series to be God's 'sister', sacrificed to create the world – Castiel agrees to act as Lucifer's vessel when Lucifer claims to be the only one with the power to defeat the Darkness, since God is absent and all other archangels are dead or insane. After killing Rowena, apparently the only person capable of re-opening the Cage, Lucifer spends some time re-establishing his power base in Hell while acting as Castiel to interact with the Winchesters and follow their research into Amara, but his true identity is revealed after the Winchesters attempt to travel back in time to recover a Hand of God from a submarine before it sank in 1943. Castiel is able to regain control long enough to explain the situation to Sam and stop himself killing his friend, Dean subsequently banishing Lucifer and vowing to find a way to free Castiel from his control. Crowley, forced to act as Lucifer's slave, is forced on the run after he fails to kill Lucifer with another salvaged Hand of God. The Winchesters manage to get through to Castiel when preparing for a new confrontation with Amara, but Castiel resolves to remain as Lucifer's Vessel until her defeat, only for the Hand of God to fail against Amara's power. With Castiel/Lucifer now Amara's prisoner, she decides to torture an archangel to try and lure God out, leaving the Winchesters <b>to</b> <b>speculate</b> <b>that</b> Lucifer couldn't use the Hand of God due to the fact that he is a fallen archangel. Lucifer is eventually rescued when God returns – revealed to be Chuck, the author who wrote the Winchester Gospels – with God/Chuck healing Lucifer and apologising for his past actions. Although Lucifer is apparently killed in the later confrontation with Amara, Castiel is healed and returned to control of his body, although he is then banished when a member of the London branch of the Men of Letters attacks the bunker to punish Sam's past actions.|$|E
