500|$|Weber's magnum opus Economy and Society is a {{collection}} of his essays which he was working on {{at the time of his}} death in 1920. [...] After his death, the final organization and editing of the book fell to his widow Marianne Weber. [...] The final German form published in 1921 reflected very much Marianne Weber's work and intellectual commitment.

He geometrically arranged abstractions of feet, hands, and elbows in shapes such as cubes, church windows and ships.

500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>that</b> was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing.

[...] In addition to Petula Clark's [...] "Downtown", [...] "Down Town" [...] used elements of the distinctive bassline to Harold Faltermeyer's 1984 # 1 single [...] "Axel F". [...] Indeed, the labels of the record claimed that: [...] "All sounds on this recording have been captured by The KLF.

500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in <b>the</b> <b>papers</b> <b>that</b> I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach â€” there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E
