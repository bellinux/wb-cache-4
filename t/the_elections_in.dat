5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 1864 the state's Republican {{legislative}} majority {{arrived at}} a critical turning point, as the North was slowly tightening its blockade of the South. The new Republican-controlled legislature fully supported Morton's policies and worked to meet the state's commitments to the war effort. In 1865 the Indiana General Assembly validated the loans Morton had secured to run the state government, assumed them as state debt, and commended Morton for his actions during the interim.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{successful}} defense against calls for his removal, Powell continued speaking {{against what he}} saw as violations of constitutional rights. In 1864, he condemned General Order No. 11, an edict of Ulysses S. Grant that barred Jews from the Department of Tennessee, which included regions of Kentucky. In the same speech, he rebuked federal military interference with <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky. In 1864, he opposed a constitutional amendment aimed at freeing the slaves.|$|E

5|$|Shepton Mallet {{is in the}} Mendip local {{government}} district {{which is part of}} the county of Somerset. In the 80 years prior to 1974, the town had lain within Shepton Mallet Urban District. The town elects one councillor to Somerset County Council; at the last election in 2012, a conservative was elected. Shepton Mallet has four councillors on Mendip District Council, two elected by each of the two wards that make up the town.

The other parties in parliament historically refused any formal governmental cooperation with the Progress Party, but after a long period of work to unite the political right in Norway, helped by Siv Jensen devising a more moderate liberal leadership, the party entered into a coalition with the Conservative Party, which from 2013 makes up the current Norwegian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{term for}} the {{president}} is five years, but due to a 1996 referendum, the election {{that was supposed to}} occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, the president could only serve for two terms as president, but due to a change in the constitution, term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in 1994, 2001, 2006, 2010 and on 11 October 2015. Alexander Lukashenko has been the only person who has served as president since <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 1994.|$|E
50|$|French cantonal {{elections}} are usually paired with another election; for example, they were paired with <b>the</b> regional <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 1998, <b>the</b> municipal <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 2001, <b>the</b> regional <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 2004, and <b>the</b> municipal <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 2008. <b>The</b> 2011 <b>elections</b> were <b>the</b> first cantonal <b>elections</b> since 1992 {{not to be}} paired with another election.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Loi Cadre by the French National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold {{elections}} to increase the self-determination of their territories. In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African Democratic Rally (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA) won <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E
5|$|Kumbakonam {{is a part}} of the Kumbakonam Legislative Assembly {{constituency}} and elects {{a member}} to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly once every five years. Despite being a hub of militant Communism in the 1950s, Kumbakonam voted for the Indian National Congress in the first five state elections held between 1952 and 1977. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam won <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> 1977 and between 1977 and 1989, the seat was alternatively held by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or the Indian National Congress. Since 1989, barring an interregnum of five years between 1991 and 1996, the seat has been held by Ko. Si. Mani of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Kumbakonam was a part of the Kumbakonam Lok Sabha constituency from 1952 till 1977, when the constituency was disbanded. The assembly segments in the erstwhile Kumbakonam Lok Sabha constituency were included in the Mayiladuthurai Lok Sabha constituency and have remained so ever since.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{attempted}} {{to influence the}} outcomes of <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> the Holy Roman Empire, which would appoint a new King of the Romans. When the more prominent German candidates failed to gain traction, Henry began to back his brother Richard's candidature, giving donations to his potential supporters in the Empire. Richard was elected in 1256 with expectations of possibly being crowned the Holy Roman Emperor, but continued {{to play a major}} role in English politics. His election faced a mixed response in England; Richard was believed to provide moderate, sensible counsel and his presence was missed by the English barons, but he also faced criticism, probably incorrectly, for funding his German campaign at England's expense. Although Henry now had increased support in the Empire for a potential alliance against Louis of France, the two kings were now moving towards potentially settling their disputes peacefully; for Henry, a peace treaty could allow him to focus on Sicily and his crusade.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet propaganda-motivated {{support for}} Polish-language {{cultural}} activities, however, {{clashed with the}} official policy of Russification. The Soviets at first intended to phase out the Polish language and so banned Polish from schools, street signs, {{and other aspects of}} life. This policy was, however, reversed at times—first before <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> October 1939; and later, after the German conquest of France. In November 1940, the Poles of Lwów observed the 85th anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz's death. Soon, however, Stalin decided to re-implement the Russification policies. He reversed his decision again, however, when a need arose for Polish-language pro-Soviet propaganda following the German invasion of the Soviet Union; as a result Stalin permitted the creation of Polish forces in the East and later decided to create a Communist People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> {{the fall}} of 1862, Governor Morton feared that the legislature's Democratic {{majority}} would attempt to hinder the war effort, reduce his authority, and vote to secede from the Union. After the legislative session convened in 1863, all but four Republican legislators stayed away from Indianapolis to prevent the general assembly from attaining the quorum it needed to pass legislation, including funding the state government or making tax provisions. This rapidly led to a crisis as the state government began {{to run out of}} money to conduct its business and was nearly bankrupt. Going beyond his constitutional powers, Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans to avert the crisis. To obtain funds to run the state government, Morton turned to James Lanier, a wealthy banker from Madison, Indiana. On two occasions, Lanier provided the state with more than $1 million (USD) in unsecured loans. Morton's move was successful, he was able to fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana. There was little the legislature could do but watch.|$|E
5|$|The Dissenters {{proposed}} Robert Webb, who {{had previously}} served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. The recent history of <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>in</b> Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. That however proved {{not to be the}} case, and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb did not want the expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving the Dissenters without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund.|$|E
