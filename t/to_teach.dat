40|$|Approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> {{primary school}} {{mathematics}} Abstract: The main {{goal of this}} thesis is to clarify the differences between two distinct approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> mathematics at primary school, the transmissive approach and so called genetic constructivism. The theoretical part of the thesis describes main features of these two approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> mathematics. The practical part shows approaches of two concrete teachers of the first grade, which are investigated by observation, analysis of videorecordings from mathematics lessons and interviews with the teachers. The videorecordings analysis shows didactic aspects of each teacher's approach <b>to</b> <b>teaching.</b> Dealing with pupil's error has been chosen as leading didactic aspect and is analysed in more detail. Furthermore, the author's development of her own approach <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> mathematics is analysed. Key words: approach <b>to</b> <b>teaching,</b> method, technique, constructivist approach, transmissive approach, dealing with errors, individualisation, teacher's professional developmen...|$|R

40|$|Low {{commitment}} <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> amongst {{teachers is}} a problem facing the teaching profession in many countries. Gender might {{be an important factor}} in explaining what kinds of prospective teachers are attracted <b>to</b> <b>teaching.</b> This empirical study examined the relationship between student-teachers&# 039; gender, gender roles and commitment <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> {{within the context of a}} large, university-based teacher education program in Tanzania. A self-report questionnaire was administered, comprising commitment <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> items, gender as a demographic variable and items from Bem sex role inventory (BSRI). Cluster analysis on the masculine and feminine scale of the BSRI indicated three clusters: (1) highly androgynous students with high scores on both masculine and feminine scales, (2) medium androgynous students with relatively high scores on both masculine and feminine scales, and (3) low androgynous students with low scores in relation to the other two groups on both masculine and feminine scales of the BSRI. More female than male student-teachers reported to be highly androgynous. Covariance analysis showed that gender roles were significantly related <b>to</b> commitment <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> and <b>to</b> intention <b>to</b> enter the <b>teaching</b> profession. Highly androgynous student-teachers reported significantly more commitment <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> and higher intentions <b>to</b> enter the <b>teaching</b> profession compared <b>to</b> medium and low androgynous student- teachers. No significant relationships were found between gender, on the one hand, and commitment <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> and the intention <b>to</b> enter the <b>teaching</b> profession, on the other hand. Findings are discussed in the context of teacher and teacher education in Tanzania...|$|R

40|$|Two related {{studies are}} {{reported}} in this article. The first aimed to analyse how academic discipline is related to university teachers' approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching.</b> The second explored the effects of teaching context on approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching.</b> The participants of the first study were 204 teachers from the University of Helsinki and the Helsinki School of Economics and Business Administration and 136 teachers from the University of Oxford and Oxford Brookes University who returned university teaching inventories. Thus, altogether there were 340 teachers {{from a variety of}} disciplines in Finland and the UK. The second study involved only the Finnish sample. The results showed that there was systematic variation in both student- and teacher-focused dimensions of approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> across disciplines and across teaching contexts. These results confirm the relational nature of teachers' approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> and illustrate the need, in using inventories such as the Approaches <b>to</b> <b>Teaching</b> Inventory, <b>to</b> be explicit about the context...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} how approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> relate <b>to</b> the concept of communities of practice and to monitor teacher satisfaction as a function of approach <b>to</b> <b>teaching.</b> Following interviews with art, design and communication teachers, a slightly revised ATI, with the inclusion of teacher satisfaction and communities of practice items, was distributed to teachers in the UK, USA and Australia. 130 returned questionnaires were analysed. The results show; (a) that the ATI has validity in design-related areas, (b) that teacher satisfaction is related strongly and positively to student-focused approaches <b>to</b> <b>teaching,</b> and (c) that all teachers aim to develop students‟ skills, but those with a student-focused approach are more likely to also focus on the practice and the real world problems of the profession. The positive correlations between an emphasis on development for the professions and a student-focused approach <b>to</b> <b>teaching,</b> and teacher satisfaction and a student-focused approach <b>to</b> <b>teaching,</b> offer insight for those involved in the further development of teaching practice...|$|R

The {{findings of this study}} identify that student-centered approach <b>to</b> <b>teaching</b> encourages students ‟ engagement in teaching-learning activities focusing on individual interaction to achieve common objectives.
