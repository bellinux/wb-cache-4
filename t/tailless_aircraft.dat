5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included <b>tailless</b> <b>aircraft</b> designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E

25|$|The P.40 is a <b>tailless</b> <b>aircraft</b> with a swept, cantilever, low wing. In plan, {{the wing}} has a {{rectangular}} centre section and straight tapered outer panels with elevons. There are wing tip fins and outward opening rudders which extend a little below the wing.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't until Dunne {{left the}} Balloon Factory and {{started his own}} company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd., that a {{monoplane}} could be built. The D.6 was finished in 1911, with a 60hp (45kW) Green in a pusher configuration. Three A-frames supported the wing engine, pilot and undercarriage. All Dunne's <b>tailless</b> <b>aircraft</b> had swept wings with marked washout (reduction of angle of incidence) at the tips. Since sweepback placed the tips well behind the centre of gravity, they provided longitudinal (pitch) stability in just {{the same way as}} a conventional tailplane, mounted at lower incidence than the wing. The wing camber increased outwards, causing the outer leading edge to droop further. The inherent design of the wing provided some directional (yaw) stability, which was augmented on the D.6 using down-turned wingtips. The wing had wingtip elevons for control, though because of the down-turned tips these also provided some rudder-like forces. The D.6 was tested at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain in January 1911 but failed to take off.|$|E

50|$|A flying wing is a <b>tailless</b> {{fixed-wing}} <b>aircraft</b> {{that has}} no definite fuselage.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of dihedral layout on lateral–directional dynamic {{stability of the}} <b>tailless</b> flying wing <b>aircraft</b> is discussed in this paper. A <b>tailless</b> flying wing <b>aircraft</b> with a large aspect ratio is selected {{as the object of}} study, and the dihedral angle along the spanwise sections is divided into three segments. The {{influence of}} dihedral layouts is studied. Based on the stability derivatives calculated by the vortex lattice method code, the linearized small-disturbance equations of the lateral modes are used to determine the mode dynamic characteristics. By comparing 7056 configurations with different dihedral angle layouts, two groups of stability optimized dihedral layout concepts are created. Flight quality close to Level 2 requirements is achieved in these optimized concepts without any electric stability augmentation system...|$|R
50|$|His father {{appointed}} Petter to {{the board}} in May 1934, making him technical director (at the age of 26) in preference over more experienced engineers such as Arthur Davenport and Geoffery Hill. This was not welcomed by the older members of the management, ultimately prompting Bruce and Hill to resign, and placing the older and more experienced Davenport in an intolerable position as his subordinate. One of his first actions as technical director was to terminate development of Hill's Pterodactyl, a pioneering <b>tailless</b> swept-wing <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R

50|$|Because it is a <b>tailless</b> delta-wing <b>aircraft,</b> Concorde cannot use {{the normal}} flaps or slats to assist takeoff and landing, and {{requires}} {{a significantly higher}} air and tyre speed during the takeoff roll than an average airliner. That higher speed increased the risk of tyre explosion during takeoff. When the tyres did explode, much greater kinetic energy was carried by the resulting fragments, increasing the risk of serious damage to the aircraft. A thicker skin on the bottom side of the wings could have prevented serious damage from an exploding tyre, {{but that would have}} added too much weight, therefore requiring an even higher speed to become airborne.|$|R

The drones were to be fitted in 15-cell containers with wings folded; the sides of the container would open to allow for launch on a rail using a solid-fuel rocket booster. The aircraft would then follow a pre-programmed route, and could either use electronic countermeasures to suppress air defense systems, or use a small warhead to directly destroy them.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1946 and 1956 the Fabrica Miitar de Aviones of Córdoba, Argentina {{was known}} as the Instituto Aerotecnico (I.Ae.).

Both types were equipped with a single 1,750lbf (7.8kN) Armstrong-Siddeley Viper as the auxiliary turbojet engine; on the Avro design, airflow for the Viper engine was provided via a small chin inlet installed under the aircraft's nose.

Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von Kármán solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the elevons. Control of the aircraft was achieved {{through the use of}} a system of elevons and wingtip rudders. The elevons served in <b>tailless</b> type <b>aircraft</b> both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.|$|R
