5|$|Solid ionic {{compounds}} {{have long}} been used as paint pigments, and are resistant <b>to</b> <b>organic</b> solvents, but are sensitive to acidity or basicity. Since 1801 pyrotechnicians have described and widely used metal-containing ionic compounds as sources of colour in fireworks. Under intense heat, the electrons in the metal ions or small molecules can be excited. These electrons later return to lower energy states, and release light with a colour spectrum characteristic of the species present.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{molecules}} exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1μm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead <b>to</b> <b>organic</b> chemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself <b>to</b> <b>organic</b> farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the Hellenic Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{demand for}} {{selenium}} by the electronics industry is declining, despite {{a number of}} continuing applications. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although {{it was still a}} large end-use) as more and more copiers switched <b>to</b> <b>organic</b> photoconductors. Though once widely used, selenium rectifiers have mostly been replaced (or are being replaced) by silicon-based devices. The most notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal oxide varistors.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the organophilic {{property}} of MCM- 41 was studied and compared with hydrophobic silicalite-l using adsorption and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) methods. The surface heterogeneity of MCM- 41 was evaluated {{in terms of}} activation energy for desorption (E-d) and isosteric heat of adsorption (q(st)). Results show that MCM- 41 has a higher affinity <b>to</b> polar <b>organic</b> compounds than <b>to</b> non-polar <b>organics</b> while silicalite-l has a higher affinity <b>to</b> non-polar <b>organic</b> compounds than <b>to</b> polar <b>organics.</b> This organophilic behaviour of MCM- 41 is attributed to its surface heterogeneity.

5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can procure various weapons, {{including}} melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break {{if they are}} not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is most damaging to a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to anti-personnel rounds, while mechanical foes are weak against armor-piercing rounds. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful <b>to</b> <b>organic</b> targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available <b>to</b> <b>organic</b> farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the variables affecting the consumer attitude <b>to</b> buy <b>organic</b> food that in turn affects the purchasing intention. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used to explain this. The study variables include health consciousness, environmental consciousness, organic food price, attitude, subjective norm, intentions <b>to</b> purchase <b>organic</b> food and gender. Survey method was used, with the sample containing 200 respondents intending <b>to</b> purchase <b>organic</b> food in Surakarta City, Indonesia. The analysis method employed was structural equation model (SEM). The results of research showed that health consciousness and environmental consciousness were the determinants of an individual’s positive attitude <b>to</b> buy <b>organic</b> food. The effect of gender difference on attitude, intention, and behavior of purchasing organic food confirmed the previous studies descriptively stating that gender affects the organic food purchasing behavior. The implication of study is that in the future, the marketers should expose the usefulness of organic food for health and environmental maintenance to make the target consumer more motivated <b>to</b> buy <b>organic</b> food. In addition, market segmenting should be carried out based on gender...|$|R
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due <b>to</b> <b>organic</b> decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E

40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to use a positive-ion {{atmospheric}} pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometer ((+) APCI-MS/MS) <b>to</b> detect <b>organic</b> peroxide products formed during β-pinene ozonolysis experiments. Detection was based on utilizing the neutral-loss scan (NLS) analysis mode of the APCI-MS/MS to observe ion signals exhibiting unique mass losses of 34 u. This mass loss was considered exclusive <b>to</b> protonated <b>organic</b> peroxides containing a hydroperoxy moiety. Given this observation, the NLS analysis mode was used <b>to</b> selectively detect <b>organic</b> peroxides formed during β-pinene ozonolysis experiments. Overall, six organic peroxide structures were proposed. Further product-ion scan analysis on the six proposed structures revealed additional unique mass losses of 32 u and 62 u that could be use in combination with 34 u NLS analysis <b>to</b> selectively detect <b>organic</b> peroxides. The results from this study can assist in ascertaining <b>organic</b> peroxide contribution <b>to</b> secondary <b>organic</b> aerosol for future ozonolysis experiments...|$|R
