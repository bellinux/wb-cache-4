5|$|<b>The</b> <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s had rapidly {{declined}} by {{the start of}} the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1960s, {{administrative}} {{review of}} student publications was considered routine {{at both the}} high school and collegiate level. However, with the rise of <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s, student publications began to explore social issues with greater fervor, focusing on the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, sexual orientation, and other topics considered controversial at the time.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 â€“ November 27, 1978) was an American {{politician}} {{and the first}} openly gay elected official {{in the history of}} California, where {{he was elected to the}} San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Although he was the most pro-LGBT politician in the United States at the time, politics and activism were not his early interests; he was neither open about his sexuality nor civically active until he was 40, after his experiences in <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> movement of the 1960s.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his book}} The Better Angels of Our Nature, Steven Pinker {{discusses}} the song {{as an illustration}} of his thesis that <b>the</b> 1960s <b>counterculture</b> [...] "pushed against" [...] the Civilizing Process (identified by Norbert Elias), which, Pinker argues, had been reducing violence over many centuries, and that <b>the</b> <b>counterculture's</b> [...] "glorification of dissoluteness shaded into indulgence of violence.... Personal violence was sometimes celebrated in song, {{as if it were}} just another form of antiestablishment protest." [...] He says that [...] "Midnight Rambler" [...] "acted out a rape-murder by the Boston Strangler..." [...] and he sees this {{as an example of how}} in <b>the</b> 1960s <b>counterculture</b> [...] "the control of women's sexuality was seen as a prerequisite" [...] of men.|$|R
5|$|Romney {{attended}} Stanford University {{during the}} 1965-66 academic year. He {{was not part}} of <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s then taking form in the San Francisco Bay Area. As opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War grew, a group staged a May 1966 sit-in at Stanford's administration building to demonstrate against draft status tests; Romney joined a counter-protest against that group. He continued to enjoy occasional pranks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>counterculture</b> was a youth {{movement}} that included political activism, especially {{in opposition to}} the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the folk-rock and country rock of people like Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, and the psychedelic rock of bands like Jefferson Airplane and The Doors. This movement was very closely connected to the British Invasion, a wave of bands from the United Kingdom who became popular throughout much of the 1960s. The British Invasion initially included bands like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Zombies who were later joined by bands like the Moody Blues and The Who. The sound of these bands was hard-edged rock, with the Beatles originally known for songs that resembled classic black rock songs by Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, The Shirelles and the Isley Brothers. Later, as <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> developed, The Beatles began using more advanced techniques and unusual instruments, such as the sitar, as well as more original lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E

Members were directly connected to many of <b>the</b> <b>counterculture's</b> primary leaders, such as Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, Allen Ginsberg, Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead, Timothy Leary, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Mick Farren and Tom Wolfe.

5|$|Fonda was {{a visible}} {{political}} activist in <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> era during the Vietnam War {{and later became}} involved in advocacy for women. She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on an anti-aircraft gun on a 1972 visit to Hanoi. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist. In 2005, she, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices {{of women in the}} media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves {{on the board of the}} organization.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with <b>the</b> <b>counterculture.</b> <b>The</b> <b>counterculture</b> was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which will follow the trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
50|$|Although Crass {{initially}} espoused pacifism, this is {{not necessarily}} the case for all anarcho-punks. Despite the broader punk subculture's antagonism towards hippies, the ideals of <b>the</b> hippie <b>counterculture</b> were an influence on anarcho-punk. Crass were explicit regarding their associations with <b>the</b> hippie <b>counterculture,</b> and this influence has also carried over to crust punk.|$|R

5|$|Lennon's former {{personal}} assistant Fred Seaman (who was earlier convicted for and admitted stealing from Lennon's personal belongings) has claimed that by this time, however, Lennon had also quietly renounced <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> views {{which he had}} helped promote during the 1960s and 1970s and became more aligned with conservatism and was supportive of Ronald Reagan, though whether he had actually aligned to a more conservative world view is disputed. Some commentators noted that Seaman's claims have low credibility, considering {{that he was a}} thief who had abused his position to steal from Lennon, and had also earlier released a book with dubious allegations about Lennon which had largely been ignored.|$|E
5|$|Born in Watts, Los Angeles, to {{a middle-class}} African-American family, Sylvester {{developed}} {{a love of}} singing through the gospel choir of his Pentecostal church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship {{among a group of}} black cross-dressers and transgender women who called themselves The Disquotays. Moving to San Francisco in 1970 at the age of 22, Sylvester embraced <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> and joined the avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, producing solo segments of their shows which were heavily influenced by female blues and jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. During the Cockettes' critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere. He came to front Sylvester and his Hot Band, a rock act that released two commercially unsuccessful albums on Blue Thumb Records in 1973 before disbanding.|$|E
5|$|The I Ching {{has been}} {{translated}} into Western languages dozens of times. The most influential edition is the 1923 German translation of Richard Wilhelm, later translated to English by Cary Baynes. The earliest complete published I Ching translation in a Western language was a Latin translation done in the 1730s by Jesuit missionary Jean-Baptiste RÃ©gis that was published in Germany in the 1830s. Although Thomas McClatchie and James Legge had both translated the text in the 19th century, the text gained significant traction during <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s, with the translations of Wilhelm and John Blofeld attracting particular interest. Richard Rutt's 1996 translation incorporated {{much of the new}} archaeological and philological discoveries of the 20th century. Gregory Whincup's 1986 translation also attempts to reconstruct Zhou period readings.|$|E

5|$|The NWOBHM {{involved}} both {{musicians and}} fans who were largely young, male {{and white and}} shared class origin, ethic and aesthetic values. American sociologist Deena Weinstein, in her book Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture, describes the rise and growth of the movement as the achievement of maturity for heavy metal, after its birth in the early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in the following years. British heavy metal fans, commonly known as muthas, metalheads or headbangers for the violent, rhythmic shaking of their heads {{in time to the}} music, dismissed the simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> of the 1960s and the psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in the 1970s, updating the shared principles and codes of the heavy metal subculture and definitely separating it from mainstream society.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of <b>the</b> <b>counterculture</b> movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury {{neighborhood}} in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the Summer of Love. In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the high-tech industry. Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E
