40|$|Small-scale area {{effect on}} species {{richness}} and nesting occupancy of cavity-nesting bees and wasps. The {{research was conducted}} in an urban forest remnant in southeast Brazil. We tested the predictions of the following hypotheses: (1) larger areas present higher species richness of bees and wasps, (2) solitary bees and wasps occupy more nests in larger areas, (3) rare species occupy more nests in smaller areas. We sampled Aculeate bees and wasps using <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> from February to November 2004. We placed <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> in sampling <b>units</b> (SU) with different size (25, 100 and 400 m²) located in 6 ha of secondary mesophytic forest. One hundred and thirty-seven <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> were occupied by seven species of bees and four species of wasps. We found an increase in wasp, but not bee species richness following increase in SU size. Hymenoptera richness (i. e. bees plus wasps) was also greater in larger SU. Both the number and density of occupied nests increased with SU size. The wasp Trypoxylon lactitarse responded significantly to area size, larger SU having more occupied nests. The same pattern was exhibited by the wasp Auplopus militaris, the Megachile bee species, and the bee Anthodioctes megachiloides. Only Trypoxylon sp. was not affected by SU size. Our results show that cavity-nesting bee and wasps respond differently to the area effects. Such findings must be complemented by information on the frequency and dynamics of area colonization and nest occupancy by species of solitary Hymenoptera...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline of}} managed honeybees and the rapid {{expansion}} of mass-flowering crops increase the risk of pollination limitation in crops and raise questions about novel management approaches for wild pollinators in agroecosystems. Adding artificial nesting sites, such as <b>trap</b> <b>nests,</b> can promote cavity-nesting bees in agroecosystems, but effectiveness could be limited by the availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape and by natural antagonists. In two European regions, we exposed artificial <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> in paired field boundaries adjacent to oilseed rape (OSR) fields or non-flowering crops for 2 years within 32 landscapes covering two independent gradients of OSR cover and semi-natural habitat (SNH) cover in the landscape. We analysed the effects of local and landscape-wide floral resource availability, land-use intensity, landscape complexity and natural antagonists on community composition and population dynamics of trap-nesting bees. Numbers of brood cells showed a strong, three-fold increase in response to the additional nesting sites. Species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting bees that were active during OSR flowering increased significantly with increasing amounts of early season landscape-wide floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of OSR. Later foraging species benefited instead from the availability of late-season alternative flower resources or SNH cover once the mass-flowering had ceased. Density-dependent parasitism increased following mass-flowering, while no density-dependent effect was found during mass-flowering. Structural equation modelling revealed that the influence of floral resource availability on community growth rate was mediated by community size. Community size showed a strong negative effect on community growth rate. Despite positive density-dependent parasitism, antagonists had only weak regulating effects on community growth rate. Synthesis and applications. Trap-nesting bee populations grow markedly with the increasing availability of food resources in the landscape and effectiveness of <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> is only marginally limited by natural antagonists. Thus, <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> could be a simple pollinator-supporting strategy to accompany the current expansion of mass-flowering crops and to ensure pollination services for insect-pollinated crops. <b>Trap</b> <b>nests</b> benefit, not only early season active generalist bees during oilseed rape flowering, but also species with later phenology if accompanied by other pollinator-supporting practices. </p...|$|R

40|$|Bee pollinators are {{currently}} recorded with many different sampling methods. However, the relative performances {{of these methods}} have not been systematically evaluated and compared. In response to the strong need to record ongoing shifts in pollinator diversity and abundance, global and regional pollinator initiatives must adopt standardized sampling protocols when developing large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes. We systematically evaluated the performance of six sampling methods (observation plots, pan traps, standardized and variable transect walks, <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> with reed internodes or paper tubes) that are commonly used across {{a wide range of}} geographical regions in Europe and in two habitat types (agricultural and seminatural). We focused on bees since they represent the most important pollinator group worldwide. Several characteristics of the methods were considered in order to evaluate their performance in assessing bee diversity: sample coverage, observed species richness, species richness estimators, collector biases (identified by subunit-based rarefaction curves), species composition of the samples, and the indication of overall bee species richness (estimated from combined total samples). The most efficient method in all geographical regions, in both the agricultural and seminatural habitats, was the pan trap method. It had the highest sample coverage, collected the highest number of species, showed negligible collector bias, detected similar species as the transect methods, and was the best indicator of overall bee species richness. The transect methods were also relatively efficient, but they had a significant collector bias. The observation plots showed poor performance. As <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> are restricted to cavity-nesting bee species, they had a naturally low sample coverage. However, both <b>trap</b> <b>nest</b> types detected additional species that were not recorded by any of the other methods. For large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes with surveyors with different experience levels, we recommend pan traps as the most efficient, unbiased, and cost-effective method for sampling bee diversity. <b>Trap</b> <b>nests</b> with reed internodes {{could be used as a}} complementary sampling method to maximize the numbers of collected species.

40|$|Although {{agricultural}} habitats {{can provide}} {{enormous amounts of}} food resources for pollinator species, links between agricultural and (semi-) natural habitats through dispersal and foraging movements have hardly been studied. In 67 study sites, we assessed the interactions between mass-flowering oilseed rape fields and semi-natural grasslands at different spatial scales, and their effects {{on the number of}} brood cells of a solitary cavity-nesting bee. The probability that the bee Osmia bicornis colonized <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> in oilseed rape fields increased from 12 to 59 % when grassland was nearby, compared to fields isolated from grassland. In grasslands, the number of brood cells of O. bicornis in <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> was 55 % higher when adjacent to oilseed rape compared to isolated grasslands. The percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval food was higher in oilseed rape fields and grasslands adjacent to oilseed rape than in isolated grasslands. In both oilseed rape fields and grasslands, the number of brood cells was positively correlated with the percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval food. We show that mass-flowering agricultural habitats—even when they are intensively managed—can strongly enhance the abundance of a solitary bee species nesting in nearby semi-natural habitats. Our results suggest that positive effects of agricultural habitats have been underestimated and might be very common (at least) for generalist species in landscapes consisting of a mixture of agricultural and semi-natural habitats.

We obtained average climate data (1970 - 2000) from Worldclim v 2 for altitudes at each sampling site. Nest traps captured 17 bee and wasp species from six families, and Moericke traps captured 124 morphospecies from 13 families. We found a negative correlation between altitude and species richness and abundance. Temperature, precipitation, water vapor pressure, and wind speed influenced species richness and abundance, and were correlated with altitude. β-diversity was primarily determined by species turnover as opposed to nestedness, and Aculeate community similarity was higher for more similar altitudinal ranges. Moericke traps {{seem to be more}} efficient for altitudinal surveys compared to <b>nest</b> <b>traps.</b> We found high occurrence of singleton and doubleton species at all altitudes, highlighting the need for long-term studies to efficiently assess hymenopteran diversity in these environments...|$|R

C.) e estudar o efeito da introduÃÃo de ninhos povoados da abelha coletora de Ãleo, Centris (Heterocentris) analis Fabricius, na produtividade desta cultura. A pesquisa foi realizada de agosto a outubro de 2010, em Ubajara, CearÃ, Brasil. A metodologia constou do monitoramento, coleta e identificaÃÃo dos visitantes florais em dois nÃcleos com quatro variedades de acerola sem e com a introduÃÃo de 242 ninhos povoados por C. analis, estimativa da diversidade, freqÃÃncia, equabilidade e anÃlise da produÃÃo de frutos entre os nÃcleos. As abelhas foram contadas e coletadas com rede entomolÃgica em transectos entre as fileiras dos plantios. Para estimar a diversidade de espÃcies de abelhas visitantes das flores da acerola, utilizou-se o Ãndice de Shannon-Weaner (Hâ), a frequÃncia foi determinada pela quantidade de cada espÃcie de abelha presente ao longo do dia e a equabilidade pelo Ãndice de Pielou (Jâ). Oito espÃcies de abelhas foram coletadas visitando as flores da acerola, quatro comuns aos dois nÃcleos (Apis mellifera, C. (Centris) aenea, C. (Centris) flavifrons e Trigona spinipes) e quatro exclusivamente no nÃcleo onde foram introduzidas as abelhas (C. analis, C. (Trachina) fuscata, C. (Ptilotops) sponsa e Xylocopa cearensis). As abelhas do gÃnero Centris foram os visitantes florais mais frequentes e representaram 64 % no nÃcleo com introduÃÃo dos ninhos povoados e 11 % no nÃcleo sem introduÃÃo, estando presentes nos pomares das 6 : 00 as 15 : 00 h, mas em grandes quantidades somente atÃ as 9 : 00 h. As demais espÃcies de abelhas, alÃm de estarem presentes em pequenos nÃmeros sÃ visitavam as flores entre 6 : 00 e 9 : 00 h. Os Ãndices de diversidade e equabilidade diferiram entre os nÃcleos (p< 0, 05), tendo o nÃcleo com abelhas apresentado valores significativamente maiores (1, 85 e 0, 89, respectivamente) do que o nÃcleo onde nÃo foram introduzidos abelhas (0, 92 e 0, 66, respectivamente). Durante os trÃs meses de experimento, a quantidade de ninhos povoados por C. analis aumentou 38 %, chegando a outubro com 391 ninhos. No que se refere Ã produÃÃo, houve aumentos significativos (p< 0, 05) na produÃÃo de frutos tanto por Ãrea, quanto por variedade e por planta no nÃcleo que recebeu os ninhos de C. analis em relaÃÃo aquele sem a introduÃÃo de abelhas. Concluiu-se ser possÃvel usar cultivos de acerola para multiplicar populaÃÃes de C. analis para uso na polinizaÃÃo; aumentar a quantidade de abelhas C. analis e reduzir dÃficits de polinizaÃÃo em pomares de acerola por meio da introduÃÃo de ninhos povoados; e que a introduÃÃo destes ninhos de C. analis para polinizaÃÃo em Ãreas de cultivo {{comercial}} da acerola pode proporcionar ganhos reais de produÃÃo. The present work {{aimed to}} know the diversity and frequency of bees visiting flowers of two plots of organic orchards of acerola (Malpighia emarginata D. C.) and to study the effect of introduc ing <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> inhabited by the oil collecting bee Centris (Heterocentris) analis Fabricius on the productivity of this crop. T he research was carried out from July to October 2010, in Ubajara, CearÃ, Brazil. The methodology consisted in monitoring, collecti ng and identif ying the floral visitors in two plots cultivated wth four acerola varieties, with and and without the introduct ion of 242 <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> inhabited by C. analis, estimate of diversity, frequency, evenness and analysis of fruit production between plots. Bees were counted and collected using sweep nets in transects walked among {{the lines of the}} orchards. To estimate bee s pecies diversity visiting acerola, I used the Shannon - Weaver diversity index (H'), the frequency was determined by the amount of each bee s pecies present throughout the day and evenness by the Pielou's evenness index (J'). Eight bee species were collected visiting the flowers of the acerola, four common to both plots (Apis mellifera, C. (Centris) aenea, C. (Centris) flavifrons and Trigona spinipes) and four exclusive to the plot where the inhabited <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> were introduced (C. analis, C. (Trachina) fusca ta, C. (Ptilotops) sponsa and Xylocopa cearensis). Bees of the genus Centris were the most frequent floral visitors and accounted for 64 % in the plot I (with introduction of inhabited nests) and 11 % in plot II (no nest introduction), being present in the o rchards from 6 : 00 to 15 : 00, but in large numbers only until 9 : 00. The other bee species were present in small numbers and o nly visited flowers between 6 : 00 to 9 : 00. D iversity and evenness indices differed between plots (p < 0. 05) : plot I showed significantl y higher diversity and evenness values (1. 85 and 0. 89, respectively) comparing to plot II (0. 92 and 0. 66, respectively). Over the three - month experimental period, the number of <b>trap</b> <b>nests</b> inhabited by C. analis increased 38 %, reaching 381 nests in Octobe r. Regarding yield, there w ere significant incre ments (p < 0. 05) in fruit production per area, variety and plant in the plot with the nests of C. analis in relation to that without the introduction of bees. It was concluded that C. analis is an efficient po llinator of acerola; it is possible to use acerola orchards to multiply populations of C. analis for pollination purposes; it is possible {{to increase the number of}} bees C. analis and to reduce polli nation deficits in acerola orchards by the introduction of inhabited <b>trap</b> <b>nests,</b> and that the introduction of these nests of C. analis for pollination in areas of commercial cultivation of acerola can provide real gains in producti vity...|$|R

40|$|Of all {{prosodic}} variables used {{to classify}} languages, rhythm has proved most problematic. Recent attempts to classify languages {{based on the}} relative proportion of vowels or obstruents have had some success, but these seem only indirectly related to perceived rhythm. Coupling between <b>nested</b> prosodic <b>units</b> is identified as an additional source of rhythmic patterning in speech, and this coupling is claimed to be gradient and highly variable, dependent on speaker characteristics and text properties. Experimental results which illustrate several degrees of coupling between different prosodic levels are presented, both from previous work within the Speech Cycling paradigm, and from new data. A satisfactory account of speech rhythm {{will have to take}} both language-specific phonological properties and utterance-specific coupling among <b>nested</b> production <b>units</b> int...|$|R
