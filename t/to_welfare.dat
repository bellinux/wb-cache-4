25|$|Following Isaiah Berlin, Halsema {{distinguishes between}} {{positive}} and negative freedom. Negative freedom is, according to Halsema, the freedom of citizens from government influence; she applies this concept especially to the multicultural society and the rechtsstaat, where the government should {{protect the rights of}} citizens and not limit them. Positive freedom is the emancipation of citizens from poverty and discrimination. Halsema wants to apply this concept <b>to</b> <b>welfare</b> state and the environment where government should take more action. According to Halsema, GreenLeft is an undogmatic party that has anarchist tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Despite the pragmatism of {{classical}} economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as Jane Marcet and Harriet Martineau.

The 2009 conference, dealing specifically with global warming, proposed research into marine cloud whitening (ships spraying seawater into clouds {{to make them}} reflect more sunlight and thereby reduce temperature) as the top climate change priority, though climate change itself is ranked well below other world problems.

25|$|Citizens of the United States are {{entitled}} to a host of social benefits. Government programs such as Food Stamps and Medicaid can provide support for low-income families. However, children who are U.S. citizens may not always be able to fully enjoy these benefits. Immigrant parents with limited English language ability may be unaware they are eligible for such benefits, or may not know how to take advantage of social welfare programs. Even legal non-citizens may find that their access to social supports is restricted due <b>to</b> <b>welfare</b> reforms. In addition, parents who are undocumented may be afraid to deal with government agencies, even if their citizen children are eligible for such assistance programs. When there is risk of deportation, it affects the likelihood of a mixed-status mother's use social services. The anti-immigrant sentiment increases this and then would deter mixed-status mothers to not to participate in government programs in which their U.S. born children are eligible to receive.|$|E
25|$|Commitment to laissez-faire, however, was not uniform. Some economists {{advocated}} {{state support}} {{of public works}} and education. Classical liberals were also divided on free trade.

25|$|During the 1998 {{election}} campaign, {{the leader}} of the Australian Democrats, Meg Lees, stated that her party was opposed to a GST unless food, books and tourism packages sold offshore were exempt, and other compensating tax measures were implemented. The government initially stated that exemptions to the GST were not possible, and looked most likely to pass the GST legislation with the support of independent Senator Brian Harradine. However a compromise was eventually reached with Lees, involving most basic food items being exempt from the GST, the GST on library purchases of books being refunded, a temporary 8% refund on school textbooks, increases <b>to</b> <b>welfare</b> payments, and greater powers to the ACCC to oversee the implementation of the new tax regime. A proposal to exempt tampons from the GST was dismissed by Howard. The legislation was passed on 28 June 1999 as A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999. It gained assent on 8 July 1999 and came into operation on 1 July 2000.|$|E

25|$|In {{terms of}} social policy, the Curtin Government enacted {{a wide range of}} {{progressive}} social reforms during its time in office. Pensions were introduced for deserted wives and widows, while the establishment of the Women's Employment Board led to increased wages for some women during the war. Aboriginal Australians were provided with significantly increased entitlement <b>to</b> <b>welfare</b> benefits, while maternity allowances were extended. In addition, pensions for the elderly and infirm were increased, while reciprocal arrangements with New Zealand were introduced regarding old age and invalid pensions. In 1942, temporary public employees became eligible to apply to join the Commonwealth superannuation scheme if they had been employed for no less than five years and were certified as having indefinite future employment, while the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act of 1943 provided long service leave for all temporary Commonwealth employees. In 1943, the Universities Commission was established to exempt students from war service to undertake or continue university studies and to assist those students by exempting them from fees and, subject to a means test, by providing them with living allowances.|$|E
25|$|Born in London to wealthy upper middle-class parents, Cameron {{was educated}} at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 {{he worked at}} the Conservative Research Department, {{assisting}} the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, succeeding Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. The 2010 general election led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats – the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration introduced large-scale changes <b>to</b> <b>welfare,</b> immigration policy, education, and healthcare. It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage.|$|E
25|$|The PSI entered {{government}} in 1963. During {{the first year}} of the new Centre-Left Government, a wide range of measures were carried out which went some way towards the Socialist Party's requirements for governing in coalition with the Christian Democrats. These included taxation of real estate profits and of share dividends (designed to curb speculation), increases in pensions for various categories of workers, a law on school organisation (to provide for a unified secondary school with compulsory attendance up to the age of 14), the nationalisation of the electric-power industry, and significant wage rises for workers (including those in the newly nationalised electric-power industry), which led to a rise in consumer demand. Urged on by the PSI, the government also made brave attempts to tackle issues relating <b>to</b> <b>welfare</b> services, hospitals, the agrarian structure, urban development, education, and overall planning. For instance, during the Centre-Left Government's time in office, social security was extended to previously uncovered categories of the population. In addition, entrance to university by examination was abolished in 1965. Despite these important reforms, however, the reformist drive was soon lost, and the most important problems (including the mafia, social inequalities, inefficient state/social services, North/South imbalance) remained largely untackled.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} take {{appropriate}} and effective actions against anticompetitive behaviors in the agricultural sector, {{it is essential to}} understand the interaction between buyer power in agricultural procurement and seller power in food retailing and the optimal allocation of anti-trust efforts between markets <b>to</b> maximize <b>welfare.</b> This paper finds that, even if the policy objective is <b>to</b> maximize farmer <b>welfare,</b> anti-trust efforts may need to put to both farm and retail markets. More importantly, the optimal allocations of anti-trust efforts are the same for three different policy objectives: <b>to</b> maximize farmer <b>welfare,</b> <b>to</b> maximize consumer <b>welfare,</b> and <b>to</b> maximize social <b>welfare.</b> The steepness of farm supply and consumer demand curve, along with processors’ buyer power and retailers’ seller power, can affect the optimal allocation of anti-trust efforts. Some guidelines and formula are suggested for designing optimal allocation of anti-trust efforts between farm and retail markets.|$|R

500|$|The name Kerala has an {{uncertain}} etymology. One popular theory derives Kerala from Kera ("coconut tree" [...] in Malayalam) and alam ("land"); thus [...] "land of coconuts", {{which is a}} nickname for the state, used by locals, due to abundance of coconut trees.

500|$|On March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Ryan {{released}} a report titled , asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended {{and that there is}} little evidence that these efforts have been successful. In the report, Ryan advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that [...] "penalize families for getting ahead" [...] and that [...] "the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates," [...] both of which [...] "reduce the incentive to work". At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts <b>to</b> <b>welfare,</b> child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs. In an appendix titled [...] "Measures of Poverty", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements [...] " [...] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones." [...] According to an article in the Fiscal Times, several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.|$|E
