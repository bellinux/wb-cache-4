5|$|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were {{determined}} that their eldest son {{should have an}} education that would prepare {{him to be a}} model constitutional monarch. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister Victoria, Edward did not excel in his studies. He tried <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—Benjamin Disraeli described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner. After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, Robert Bruce.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{government}} {{refused to}} carry out death sentences, as the death penalty had been abolished in Italy in 1944 and {{was regarded as a}} relic of Mussolini's Fascist regime. The Italian decision was very disappointing to the British government because the trials had partly been intended <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of the Italian public. The War Office notified Lieutenant General Sir John Harding, who had succeeded Alexander as commander of British forces in the Mediterranean in 1946, {{that there should be no}} more death sentences and those already imposed should be commuted. Accordingly, Harding commuted the death sentences imposed on von Mackensen, Mälzer and Kesselring to life imprisonment on 4 July 1947. Mälzer died while still in prison in February 1952, while von Mackensen, after having his sentence reduced to 21 years, was set free in October 1952. Kesselring was moved from Mestre prison near Venice to Wolfsberg, Carinthia, in May 1947. In October 1947 he was transferred for the last time, to Werl Prison, in Westphalia.|$|E

25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of its existence, the partisan intelligence had been aimed chiefly at serving the Red Army operational purposes. It had frequently been asked to provide detailed information on enemy’s whereabouts, strengths, armaments, movements and intentions. Yet, the partisans’ ability <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of military consumers was limited. In 1941-1942, they relied chiefly on field intelligence – foot patrols, observation and questioning of local population – and only from late 1942 onwards succeeded in developing human intelligence capabilities. Unfortunately, the majority of their agents and collaborators were illiterate farmers and laborers unprepared for intelligence work. Technological means of collection such as communications interceptors and night vision devices were used by the partisans only on rare occasions. Besides, the wide scale deployment and high efficiency of the German security services limited the partisans’ gathering capabilities in the military field to the rural areas, almost completely preventing their access to the Wehrmacht’s bases and decision making centers.|$|E
500|$|In AD 4, Germanicus wrote a Latin {{version of}} Aratus's Phainomena, which survives, wherein he rewrites the {{contents}} of the original. For example, he replaces the opening hymn to Zeus with a passage in honor of the Roman emperor. He avoided writing in the poetic style of Cicero, who had translated his own version of the Phainomena, and he wrote in a new style <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of a Roman audience whose tastes were shaped by [...] "modern" [...] authors like Ovid and Virgil. For his work, Germanicus is ranked among Roman writers on astronomy, and his work was popular enough for scholia to be written on it well into the Medieval era.|$|E
500|$|Director Noriaki Akitaya {{had faced}} a similar dilemma for his {{animated}} film version. He explained {{that one of}} his biggest challenges was, [...] "..getting the protagonist, who is the player in the game, and making him into a character named Makoto Yuki for the film, then figuring out how to integrate him [...] into the story." [...] This led Akitaya to be extremely careful about how he went about constructing the character in terms of his speech, gestures and behavior all the while staying true to what was already established in the game. Akitaya admitted that he {{would not have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of the individual fans of the game since they were able to choose their own unique name and personality for the protagonist. Instead Akitaya took the route of incorporating the most general traits of fan reactions to the protagonist to form Yuki's character.|$|E

500|$|The group's {{members were}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the release of}} [...] "Soul Sound" [...] as a single, because they wanted to venture into an R sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction. Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals. Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, [...] "New Year", [...] "Run for Cover" [...] and [...] "Soul Sound", failed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: [...] "Everything happens for a reason and it looks like it has all worked out". [...] "Soul Sound" [...] was featured in the 2001 film Summer Catch, which stars such actors as Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jessica Biel.|$|E
500|$|In a Famitsu interview, Akitaya {{explained}} {{that one of}} his biggest challenges was, [...] "getting the protagonist, who is the [...] 'player' in the game, and making him into a character named Makoto Yuki for the film, then figuring out how to integrate him [...] into the story." [...] Akitaya went about constructing Makoto's character with extreme care in terms of speech, gestures and behavior all the while staying true to what was already established in the game. Akitaya admitted that he {{would not have been able}} <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of the individual fans of the game since they were able to choose their own unique name and personality for the Protagonist. He instead incorporated the most general traits of the Protagonist from fan reaction to form Yuki's character. Akitaya had joked that during initial pre-production the Protagonist's name was still not determined and had proposed the placeholder, [...] until the first draft was developed. However even as Kumagai began working on the script, the placeholder went unchanged for the next four to five months and Akitaya found himself growing steadily attached despite eventually changing it. Akitaya stated that his favorite scene in the film occurred when Makoto summoned his Persona for the first time. He elaborated that Makoto's maniacal laugh helped give depth to the scene and establish Watabe's character designs as being one of the film's main attractions.|$|E

2500|$|However, not all {{reception}} {{has been}} positive; {{the book has}} {{had its share of}} critics.

Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique. [...] That is to say, he has done nothing." [...] Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it [...] "captures existential teenage angst" [...] and has a [...] "complex central character" [...] and [...] "accessible conversational style"; {{while at the same time}} some readers may dislike the [...] "use of 1940s New York vernacular" [...] and other things.|$|E

Though the album sold four million copies worldwide, it failed <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>expectations</b> of Columbia Records; as a result, the label hoped to see Jessica mature her image for {{the release of}} her sophomore album. Her image changed drastically for the record, with Simpson singing more promiscuous music and wearing provocative clothing. The change in her image garnered a negative reaction from critics, some of which felt that Simpson had [...] "sold out" [...] in an attempt to emulate the success of Spears.|$|E
