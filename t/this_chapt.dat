40|$|Ever since Broca's century-old {{discovery}} of cerebral asymmetries in language functions, {{there has been}} speculation about the developmental emergence of human perceptual-cognitive asymme-tries. The basic question has been: Do the asymmetries first appear only at some point after birth, starting from an initial state of bilateral equivalence or symmetry at birth, or are the hemispheres instead functionally asymmetrical from the start? A related question is whet. her functional asym-met. ries {{can be traced to}} some lat. eral bias in the structural development of the hemispheres, such t. hat. one hemisphere matures in advance of t. he other.

40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} disorder which affects the lumbar segment of the spine. It can be either acute, subacute or chronic in its clinical presentation. Typically, the symptoms of low back pain do show significant improvement within {{two to three months}} from its onset. In a significant number of individuals, low back pain tends to be recurrent in nature with a waxing and waning quality to it. In a small proportion of sufferers this condition can become chronic. Population studies show that back pain affects most adults at some stage in their life and accounts for more sick leave and disability than any other single medical condition. This book presents new leading-edge research on <b>this</b> topic. The <b>Chapt</b> VI “Tools for the Evaluation of Low Back Pain Impairment: A Critical Review” put on light different LBP questionnaires and the different aspects of LBP they can report. In particular here is examined the role of Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) compared with the Owestry Questionnaire and the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Many works and researchers in scientific literature considered these test and their different data are here analysed to better point our attention in the tools to be considered to evaluate LBP...|$|R
40|$|This book is {{the second}} {{in a series of}} books {{organized}} as an experimental exercise: they contain both theoretical background and the output of the system, GETARUNS that enacts and applies the theory. The architecture of the system is strictly related to the structure of the books. Thus, we can think of the books as being organized around two scientifically distinct but in fact strictly interrelated fields of research: •	sentence level linguistic phenomena •	text or discourse level linguistic phenomena the former is to be described by means of grammatical theories, the latter requires the intervention of extralinguistic knowledge, i. e. knowledge of the world. Book 1 – or the current book – addresses sentence grammar or what is usually referred to as such by theoretical linguists. It does it by dividing up – somewhat ideally and sometimes arbitrarily – what must or needs to be computed at sentence level from what needs not or cannot be computed at the same level, and consequently belongs to discourse grammar. In that sense, the subdivision is not totally an arbitrary one, even though overlappings are normal cases and will be discussed where needed. The book also indirectly does another (un) intended subdivision: the one existing between syntax and semantics. Again, it would be impossible not to deal with semantically related issues when talking about syntax or the lexicon. However, semantics with uppercase S, is only treated in Book 2 – already published – where discourse and text level grammar is tackled. So eventually, this book deals with lexicon, morphology, tagging, treebanks, parsing, quantifiers and anaphoric or pronominal binding. In other words, all that concerns the level of sentence grammar in a computational environment, i. e. sentence level parsing. Sentence level Grammar – as has been purported in linguistic theories – takes care of all grammatical and linguistic relations that belong to that level. Knowledge of the world and semantic disambiguation do not interfere with the rules of sentence grammar, and {{can be thought of as}} a separate level of computation, provided that the lexicon be structured in such a way to allow such a subdivision of tasks. For that reason, the first chapter is devoted to the Lexicon and to a linguistically-based way to derive principled rules that create lexical entries for Out of Vocabulary words when needed on the basis of a fixed number of syntactic, semantic and conceptual lexical types. The second chapter presents our work on a treebank of Italian and the way to produce a conversion algorithm to Dependency Structures (almost) effortlessly. In the following three chapters – the central part of <b>this</b> book – <b>Chapts.</b> 3 - 5 – we are concerned with parsing. In these chapters we present at first a deep parser – very domain and text limited – and then a less constrained, more versatile, derived scaled version. The deep parser only works topdown and has the goal to identify ungrammatical sentences. The other parser works in both directions: and produces a semantically complete and consistent DAG (direct acyclic graph) like representation. Both parsers use the same lexical resources and rule modules. They also both take advantage of a “shallow” parser where tagging and chunking takes place. The output of the shallow parser is used to help lookahead mechanisms work appropriately at given critical constituency boundaries: to detect where possible structural ambiguity may come up. Its output can also be used as a final backoff strategy to recover from complete failure. In these three chapters we also develop a comparison with Dependency parsers and discuss their advantages and deficiencies. Then in chapter 4, we discuss at length why we regard statistically based parsing ill-founded and speak in favour of linguistically-based symbolic parsing – where however statistics can play a minor role. Eventually, in chapter 5, we present our deep parser and the rule modules. The following chapters deal respectively with: quantification – chapt. 6 -, semantic shallow interpretation – chapt. 7 -, pronominally based discourse anaphora – chapt. 8. Chapter 9 show the system used fruitfully in a shallow version for summarization. We decided to include the system in its various implementations in a CD-Rom attached to the book. GETARUN comes in three versions: -	Version 1. Complete Getarun – performs a complete analysis of a text from tokenization to discourse structure. This version also supports the fully topdown parser for grammaticality checking. It also implements question answering with a generator; -	Version 2. Partial Getarun – also performs a complete analysis but does it in a fully bottomup version, only checking for broad semantic constraints. No temporal reasoning, no logical form, no semantic discourse model. It builds a fully indexed augmented dependency structure which is then used to produce a level of informational structure. This is used to produce discourse relations and discourse structures. It is also used to evaluate entailment relations; -	Version 3. Shallow Getarun – can be used to do sentence extraction on the basis only of tagging and local discourse perusal based on discourse markers. It can also be used to do the same thing on a shallow version of the Partial Getarun, which we called Deep Summarization. It also implements a version of Question Answering based on sentence extraction as best candidate answers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter I have {{introduced}} Carnapian intensional logic again st the background of Freges and Quines puzzles. The {{main body of the}} d issertation consists of two parts. In the first part I discussed Carnapi an modal logic and arithmetic with descriptions. In the second chapter, I have described three Carnapian theories, CCL, CFL, and CNL. All three theories have three things in common. F irst, they are formulated in languages containing description terms. Sec ond, they contain a system of modal logic. Third, they do not contain th e unrestricted classical substitution principle, but they do contain the classical substitution principle restricted to non-modal formulas and t he Carnapian substitution principle, which says that two terms can be s ubstituted salva veritate if they are necessarily coreferential. There a re two major differences between the three theories. First, CCL and CFL allow universal instantiation with description ter ms, whereas CNL does not. Moreover, the quantificational theo ry of the CCL is classical, whereas the quantificational theo ry of CFL is a (negative) free logic. Another difference is t hat CCL and CFL contain different description principles. Most import antly, the description principle of CCL ensures that even imp roper descriptions have a denotation, whereas the description principle of CFL does not guarantee this. CNL does not have a description prin ciple. 	In the third chapter, I have studied collapse arguments for CCL, CFL, and CNL. A collapse argument is an argum ent for the following statement: if p is true, then it is nec essarily true. A crucial role in the proofs of these collapse results wa s played by so-called self-predication principles, which say that unde r certain conditions the (possibly complex) predicate that expresses the descriptive condition can be combined by the description term formed ou t of that predicate with the result being a true sentence. In <b>this</b> <b>chapt</b> er I have discussed a collapse argument for the extension of CCL with a self-predication principle, I have given a collapse argument for a similarly extended CFL, and most importantly, I have gi ven a collapse argument for the extension of CNL with a self- predication principle. Finally, I have argued that the relevant self-pre dication principles are unsound under a Carnapian interpretation. In the fourth chapter, I have studied the extension of Peano Arithmetic (PA) with a Carnapian modal logic C, which is a dummy l etter standing for either CCL or CFL. One can prov e that the principle of the necessity of identity is a theorem of CPA. This implies that one gets a collapse result for CPA. The standard principle of weak induction was crucial for the proof. O ne can also prove that, if one assumes a particular self-predication pri nciple, and if one assumes the principle of strong induction or, equivalently, the least-number principle, then one gets a partial collap se of de re modal truths in de dicto modal tr uths. I have argued that, if the box operator is interpreted as a metaph ysical necessity operator, then Platonists would not be inimical to the collapse result. But if CPA is extended with a physical theor y, then there is a threat that physical truths become physical necessiti es. It was shown that, under a Carnapian interpretation, the standard pr inciple of weak induction is unsound, and that it can be replaced by a C arnapian principle of weak induction that is sound. The probl em of logical and mathematical omniscience prevents ordinary Carnapian i ntensional logic from being taken seriously as a logic adequate for desc ribing the principles of demonstrability. Yet many of the proof-theoreti c results of the first part carry over to the part on Carnapian epistemi c arithmetic with descriptions, since proof-theoretic results are indepe ndent of the informal reading of the operators. In the fifth chapter, I looked at extensions of arithmetic with a modal logic in which the box operator is interpreted as a demonstrability oper ator. A first extension in that sense is Shapiros Epistemic Arithmetic (EA). Shapiro himself offered the problem of mathematic al omniscience as a reason why it is difficult to find a model theory fo r EA. Horsten attempted to provide a model theory via the deto ur of Modal-Epistemic Arithmetic (MEA). The attention of the reade r was drawn to an incoherence in the model theory of (MEA). Two al ternative solutions were presented and, after a short discussion of the problem of de re demonstrability one of those alternatives wa s chosen. The discussion of the problem of de re demonstrabil ity made it clear that {{it would be interesting to}} study the epistemic pr operties of notation systems. Horsten himself provided a framework for t his, viz. Carnapian Epistemic Arithmetic (CEA), and he started a systematic study of the epistemic properti es of notation systems within that framework. However, he did not provid e non-trivial but adequate models. To make a start with solving the prob lem of finding good models for CEA, I introduced Carnapian Mo dal-Epistemic Arithmetic (CMEA) In constructing CMEA I incorporated the lesson about the principle of weak induction learnt in the fourth chapter. In the sixth chapter, I gave a critical assessment of an argument (the  Description Argument) concerning the limits of de re demonst rability about the natural numbers. The conclusion of the Description Ar gument is that it is undemonstrable that there is a natural number that has a certain property but of which it is undemonstrable that it has tha t property. A crucial step in the Description Argument involved a self-p redication principle. Making good use of one of the results obtained in the third chapter, I proved a collapse result for the background theory against which the Description Argument was formulated. I concluded that either the either the Description Argument is sound but its conclusion i s trivial (since all arithmetical truths are demonstrable), o r the Description Argument is unsound (since there are some a rithmetical truths that are undemonstrable), or it is a cheapshot (since logic should be neutral on the issue). As an appendix I included an article co-authored by prof. dr. Leon Horst en and me. The topic of the article is indirectly related to some other topics (the logical form of descriptions, the notion of strict necessity) investigated in my dissertation. Also, it backs up one of the addition al theses I might be asked to publicly defend during my doctoral exam. T he topic of the appendix is the set of the so-called paradoxes of stric t implication. Jonathan Lowe has argued that a particular variation on C. I. Lewis notion of strict implication avoids the paradoxes of strict implication. Pace Lowe, it is argued that Lowes notion of implication d oes not achieve this aim. Moreover, a general argument is offered to the effect that no other variation on Lewis notion of constantly strict imp lication describes the logical behaviour of natural language conditional s in a satisfactory way. status: publishe...|$|E
