40|$|This study investigates how {{adolescents}} with autism use autobiography {{to negotiate and}} co-construct their identities.

Using practitioner inquiry in an ethnographic tradition, I examine how <b>the</b> <b>teens</b> created these works in the contexts {{of the group and}} <b>the</b> <b>teens</b> 2 ̆ 7 experiences. I analyze the works created as well as <b>the</b> <b>teens</b> 2 ̆ 7 interactions around this work in order to examine {{what it means to be}} a teenager with autism. This research looks at how <b>the</b> <b>teens</b> responded to expectations of and in the world around them, particularly in the context of the prevailing deficit model of autism. I also investigate how this group constructed their understandings of autism and how they represented these understandings in their works. ^ I argue that <b>the</b> <b>teens</b> in this study demonstrated an ability to create profound autobiographical works through which they located themselves and made personal connections. These findings focus on the group as a space for inquiry and the purposes that inquiry served for <b>the</b> <b>teens</b> to endure, resist, and reframe the oppressive experiences in their lives. These works created by <b>the</b> <b>teens</b> serve as a counter-practice, creating alternative narratives in which the adolescents negotiated assumptions about autism and managed their own identities. ...|$|R
