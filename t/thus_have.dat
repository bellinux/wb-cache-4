They offer Bart {{a variety of other}} prizes, all of which he refuses. Word spreads throughout town about Bill and Marty's refusal to give Bart an elephant, prompting their boss to give them a choice: either arrange for delivery of the elephant, or lose their jobs. They decide on the former option.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism.

5|$|It {{appears that}} Roman {{citizens}} were also regularly recruited to the auxilia. Most likely, {{the majority of}} citizen recruits to auxiliary regiments were the sons of auxiliary veterans who were enfranchised on their fathers' discharge. Many such may have preferred to join their fathers' old regiments, which were a kind of extended family to them, rather than join a much larger, unfamiliar legion. There are also instances of legionaries transferring to the auxilia (to a higher rank). The incidence of citizens in the auxilia would <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> grown steadily over time until, after the grant of citizenship to all peregrini in 212, auxiliary regiments became predominantly, if not exclusively, citizen units.|$|E
5|$|Outcome {{is related}} to the extent and {{duration}} of lead exposure. Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not. While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible. Children with lead poisoning may <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Parts of the {{libretto}} {{are considered}} analogous with the libretto for Giovanni Pacini's Adelaide e Comingio, {{and the final}} scene {{is based on the}} François-Thomas-Marie de Baculard d'Arnaud play Les Amants malheureux, ou le comte de Comminges. Donizetti worked on the opera in late 1839—its final page is dated 27 December 1839. Because the subject matter involved the mistress of a Neapolitan king, and may <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> caused difficulties with the Italian censors, Donizetti decided that the opera should be presented in France. The theater company Donizetti contracted went bankrupt; L'ange was never performed and was reworked as La favorite in September 1840.|$|E

5|$|The Laysan duck is an insular {{relative}} of the mallard, with a very small and fluctuating population. Mallards sometimes arrive on its island home during migration, and {{can be expected to}} occasionally have remained and hybridised with Laysan ducks as long as these species have existed. However, these hybrids are less well adapted to the peculiar ecological conditions of Laysan Island than the local ducks, and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> lower fitness. These ducks were found throughout the Hawaiian archipelago before 400AD, after which they suffered a rapid decline during the Polynesian colonisation. Now, their range includes only Laysan Island. It is one of the successfully translocated birds, after having become nearly extinct in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> low fitness.|$|E

5|$|Usually, {{the mother}} does not {{integrate}} {{herself and her}} cubs back into the pride until the cubs are {{six to eight weeks}} old. Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier, however, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time. For instance, lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles and there is communal raising and suckling of the young (once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother), who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size, and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> an equal chance of survival, and older cubs do not dominate the sucklings.|$|E
5|$|Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are {{constituent}} {{countries of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> King Willem-Alexander as their sovereign, {{as well as the}} remaining islands forming the Caribbean Netherlands. Aruba was first settled under the authority of the Spanish Crown circa 1499, but was acquired by the Dutch in 1634, under whose control the island has remained, save for an interval between 1805 and 1816, when Aruba was captured by the Royal Navy of King George III. The former Netherlands Antilles were originally discovered by explorers sent in the 1490s by the King of Spain, but were eventually conquered by the Dutch West India Company in the 17th century, whereafter the islands remained {{under the control of the}} Dutch Crown as colonial territories. The Netherlands Antilles achieved the status of an autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1954, from which Aruba was split in 1986 as a separate constituent country of the larger kingdom. The former Netherlands Antilles again split as three areas in 2010. The monarch is represented in each region by the Governor of Aruba, Alfonso Boekhoudt, the Governor of Curaçao, Frits Goedgedrag, and the Governor of Sint Maarten, Eugene Holiday.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003–04, Heskey {{signed for}} Birmingham City on 18 May 2004 on a five-year {{contract}} for an initial £3.5million fee, which could have risen to £6.25million, and would <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> become Birmingham's most expensive player. He suffered an ankle injury during a pre-season friendly against CA Osasuna, which put his Premier League debut against Portsmouth in doubt. He was eventually able to play against Portsmouth on 14 August, and the match ended as a 1–1 draw. His first goal came with a header in the eighth minute against Manchester City, which was enough to earn a 1–0 victory on 24 August. Despite Birmingham's mediocre 2004–05 season, Heskey was named as the club's Player's Player of the Season, Fan's Player of the Season, finished as top goalscorer with 11 goals and won most man of the match awards.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary written sources about Mindaugas {{are very}} scarce. Much {{what is known}} about his reign is {{obtained}} from the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle and the Hypatian Codex. Both of these chronicles were produced by enemies of Lithuania and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> anti-Lithuanian bias, particularly the Hypatian Codex. They are also incomplete: both of them lack dates and locations even for the most important events. For example, the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle devoted 125 poetry lines to Mindaugas's coronation, but failed to mention either the date or the location. Other important sources are the papal bulls regarding baptism and coronation of Mindaugas. The Lithuanians did not produce any surviving records themselves, except for a series of acts granting lands to the Livonian Order, but their authenticity is disputed. Due to lack of sources, some important questions regarding Mindaugas and his reign cannot be answered.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's {{administrative}} reforms had {{the twin}} aims of ensuring political stability and providing the bureaucratic infrastructure needed {{to raise the}} recruits and supplies needed by the army. At the top, Diocletian instituted the Tetrarchy. This divided the empire into two halves, East and West, each to be ruled by an Augustus (emperor). Each Augustus would in turn appoint a deputy called a Caesar, who would act both as his ruling partner (each Caesar was assigned {{a quarter of the}} empire) and designated successor. This four-man team would <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> the flexibility to deal with multiple and simultaneous challenges as well as providing for a legitimate succession. The latter failed in its central aim, to prevent the disastrous civil wars caused by the multiple usurpations of the 3rd century. Indeed, the situation may have been made worse, by providing each pretender with a substantial comitatus to enforce his claim. Diocletian himself lived (in retirement) to see his successors fight each other for power. But the division of the empire into Eastern and Western halves, recognising both geographical and cultural realities, proved enduring: it was mostly retained during the 4th century and became permanent after 395.|$|E
5|$|Electrostatic forces between {{particles}} are strongest when {{the charges are}} high, and {{the distance between the}} nuclei of the ions is small. In such cases, the compounds generally have very high melting and boiling points and a low vapour pressure. Trends in melting points can be even better explained when the structure and ionic size ratio is taken into account. Above their melting point ionic solids melt and become molten salts (although some ionic compounds such as aluminium chloride and iron(III) chloride show molecule-like structures in the liquid phase). Inorganic compounds with simple ions typically have small ions, and <b>thus</b> <b>have</b> high melting points, so are solids at room temperature. Some substances with larger ions, however, have a melting point below or near room temperature (often defined as up to 100°C), and are termed ionic liquids. Ions in ionic liquids often have uneven charge distributions, or bulky substituents like hydrocarbon chains, which also play a role in determining the strength of the interactions and propensity to melt.|$|E
