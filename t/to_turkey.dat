40|$|This article {{examines}} EU citizen attitudes <b>to</b> <b>Turkey's</b> bid <b>to</b> join the EU. The key theoretical constructs investigated to explain opposition <b>to</b> <b>Turkey's</b> EU membership {{are related to}} rational economic self-interest and group-level interests and concerns. The findings indicate that the former are irrelevant for distinguishing between opponents and supporters of Turkey's candidacy, while the latter do provide fairly powerful explanations for opposition to Turkish EU membership. However, because these factors do not completely explain overall levels of hostility <b>to</b> <b>Turkey's</b> candidacy, context is also introduced, particularly the threatening context provided by Turkish migration. The findings indicate that migration from <b>Turkey</b> <b>to</b> some of the EU member states has combined with feelings of group protectiveness to produce widespread animosity <b>to</b> <b>Turkey's</b> entry into the EU...|$|R
