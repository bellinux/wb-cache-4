5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months before}} the war's end, on 7 March 1945, when the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and entered German territory, Friedrich Kellner tried to explain why <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> {{themselves}} had not rebelled against Nazi rule, why {{it was necessary for}} outside forces to rid the Germans of the tyrannical government they themselves had voted into power.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{constituent}} groups were the Allgemeine SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The Allgemeine SS {{was responsible for}} enforcing the racial policy of Nazi Germany and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units of troops within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), ran the concentration camps and extermination camps. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the Gestapo and the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> for their commitment to Nazi ideology, and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Although today our {{opponents are}} at the Rhine and at the Oder, I do not believe yet {{that there will be}} a coup brought about by <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people.</b> Without {{assistance}} from outside, such a coup is not even to be considered. Only the armed forces would be able to make a conclusive coup. But the prominent officers know, as well as the party officials, that a lost war will sweep them out of power. Therefore, the war continues until the possibility of it continuing any further is brought to an end. The Allies must continue to advance and fight until the German troops have no more ammunition and war material with which to offer resistance.|$|E
5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in {{their opposition to the}} article in an attempt to generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{war in the}} East {{was based}} on Hitler's long-standing view that Jews were the great enemy of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany's expansion. Hitler focused his {{attention}} on Eastern Europe, aiming to defeat Poland, the Soviet Union and remove or kill the resident Jews and Slavs in the process. After the occupation of Poland, all Jews living in the General Government were confined to ghettos {{and those who were}} physically fit were required to perform compulsory labour. In 1941, Hitler decided to destroy the Polish nation completely and planned that within 10 to 20 years the section of Poland under German occupation would be cleared of ethnic Poles and resettled by German colonists. About 3.8 to 4 million Poles would remain as slaves, part of a slave labour force of 14 million the Nazis intended to create using citizens of conquered nations in the East.|$|E

5|$|In June 1941, Mengele {{was posted}} to Ukraine, {{where he was}} awarded the Iron Cross Second Class. In January 1942, he joined the 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking as a {{battalion}} medical officer. He rescued two German soldiers from a burning tank and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class, as well as the Wound Badge in Black and the Medal for the Care of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>People.</b> He was seriously wounded in action near Rostov-on-Don in mid-1942, and was declared unfit for further active service. After recovery, he was transferred to the Race and Resettlement Office in Berlin. He also resumed his association with von Verschuer, who was at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics. Mengele was promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmführer (captain) in April 1943.|$|E
5|$|The SS was {{regarded}} as the NSDAP's elite unit. In keeping with the racial policy of Nazi Germany, {{in the early days}} all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of Aryan ancestry back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800. Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the Nuremberg Laws. Other requirements were complete obedience to the Führer and a commitment to <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> and nation. Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria. Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS, since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The first inkling to {{the outside}} world that Hitler was dead came from the Germans themselves. On 1 May the radio station Reichssender Hamburg {{interrupted}} their normal program to announce that an important broadcast would soon be made. After dramatic funeral music by Wagner and Bruckner, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz (appointed as Hitler's successor in his will) announced that Hitler was dead. Dönitz called upon <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> to mourn their Führer, who died a hero defending the capital of the Reich. Hoping to save the army and the nation by negotiating a partial surrender to the British and Americans, Dönitz authorized a fighting withdrawal to the west. His tactic was somewhat successful: it enabled about 1.8 million German soldiers to avoid capture by the Soviets, but it came at a high cost in bloodshed, as troops continued to fight until 8 May.|$|E

5|$|While {{imprisoned in}} 1924 after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler {{dictated}} Mein Kampf to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology {{in which he}} laid out his plans for transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief in Jewish Bolshevism, a conspiracy theory that posited {{the existence of an}} international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people.</b> Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his world view as expounded in Mein Kampf. The NSDAP advocated the concept of a Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a foreign race (Fremdvölkische).|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

5|$|Hitler sought Lebensraum ("living space") for <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> in Eastern Europe and his {{aggressive}} {{foreign policy}} {{is considered to be}} the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In {{the final days of the}} war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his long-time lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.|$|E

5|$|In November 1938, the German diplomat Ernst vom Rath {{was killed}} in Paris by a young Jewish man. In response, Goebbels {{arranged}} for inflammatory antisemitic material to be released by the press, {{and the result was}} the start of a pogrom. Jews were attacked and synagogues destroyed all over Germany. The situation was further inflamed by a speech Goebbels gave at a party meeting on the night of 8 November, where he obliquely called for party members to incite further violence against Jews while making it appear to be a spontaneous series of acts by <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people.</b> At least a hundred Jews were killed, several hundred synagogues were damaged or destroyed, and thousands of Jewish shops were vandalized in an event called Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass). Around 30,000 Jewish men were sent to concentration camps. The destruction stopped after a conference held on 12 November, where Göring pointed out that the destruction of Jewish property was in effect the destruction of German property, since the intention was that it would all eventually be confiscated.|$|E
5|$|The Propaganda Ministry {{took over}} the {{broadcasting}} facilities of conquered countries immediately after surrender, and began broadcasting prepared material using the existing announcers {{as a way to}} gain the trust of the citizens. Most aspects of the media, both domestically and in the conquered countries, were controlled by Goebbels and his department. The German Home Service, the Armed Forces Programme, and the German European Service were all rigorously controlled in everything from the information they were permitted to disseminate to the music they were allowed to play. Party rallies, speeches, and demonstrations continued; speeches were broadcast on the radio and short propaganda films were exhibited using 1,500 mobile film vans. Hitler made fewer public appearances and broadcasts as the war progressed, so Goebbels increasingly became the voice of the Nazi regime for <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people.</b> From May 1940 he wrote frequent editorials that were published in Das Reich which were later read aloud over the radio. He found films to be his most effective propaganda medium, after radio. At his insistence, initially half the films made in wartime Germany were propaganda films (particularly on antisemitism) and war propaganda films (recounting both historical wars and current exploits of the Wehrmacht).|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters was not significantly large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of <b>the</b> <b>German</b> <b>people</b> would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E
