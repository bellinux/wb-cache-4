5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo <b>testing,</b> <b>is</b> the use of non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|Candidates must {{be between}} 17 and 23 years old, unmarried, {{and with no}} legal {{obligation}} to support a child. Above average high school and/or previous college grades, and strong performance on standardized <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> expected. The interquartile range on the old SAT was 1100–1360 and 68% {{ranked in the top}} fifth of their high school class.|$|E
30|$|The Mann–Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to compare}} {{continuous}} variables between two groups, and Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to compare}} dichotomous variables between two groups. The Mantel–Haenszel χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used for comparisons between two groups involving ordered categorical variables, and the χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to compare groups involving non-ordered categorical variables. Correlations were analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation. All <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> two-tailed and conducted at the 5 % significance level. Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used when comparing two related samples.|$|R
30|$|In general terms, a {{positive}} likelihood ratio {{of more than}} 10 indicates that a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at confirming disease if the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive and a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.1 indicates that the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at excluding disease when the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative.|$|R
5000|$|Confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> the <b>tests</b> {{required}} {{to confirm the}} analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more than simpler presumptive tests so presumptive <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> often done to see if confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> necessary.|$|R
5|$|In {{nuclear energy}} studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a high {{molecular}} weight and inert chemistry is desirable. A by-product of nuclear weapon <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> the release of radioactive xenon-133 and xenon-135. These isotopes are monitored to ensure compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, and to confirm nuclear tests by states such as North Korea.|$|E
5|$|Misdiagnosis is {{frequent}} (occurring {{in about}} 5 to 30% of cases). Different {{studies showed that}} in many cases seizure-like attacks in apparent treatment-resistant epilepsy have a cardiovascular cause. Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and of those who have PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> often difficult.|$|E
5|$|Modern HIV <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{extremely}} accurate. A single {{screening test}} is correct more than 99% of the time. The {{chance of a}} false-positive result in standard two-step testing protocol {{is estimated to be}} about 1 in 250,000 in a low risk population. Testing post exposure is recommended initially and at six weeks, three months, and six months.|$|E
50|$|The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> finally produced. Trial {{questions}} are included and various {{versions of the}} <b>test</b> <b>are</b> prepared to avoid cheating. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.|$|R
30|$|Qualitative {{phytochemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} for the identification of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, tannin, gums, and terpenoids in the samples [12]. Alkaloids were detected using the Dragendroff’s, Mayer’s, Hager’s and Wagner’s tests. Lead acetate, alkaline reagent, ferric chloride and ammonia <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used for detection of flavonoids. Legal’s test, Molisch, Keller-Kiliani and Borntrager’s <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> performed to identify glycosides. For identification of tannin potassium dichromate test, ferric chloride, potassium hydroxide and lead acetate <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> followed. Salkowski <b>test</b> and froth <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used to detect the presence of terpenoids and for saponins respectively. Molisch <b>test</b> <b>was</b> performed for detecting the existence of gum in the samples.|$|R
50|$|A <b>test</b> tube <b>is</b> {{filled with}} {{distilled}} water and acetic acid is added. To this mixture one drop of the effusion to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>is</b> added. If the drop dissipates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative, indicating a transudate. If the drop precipitates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive, indicating an exudate.|$|R
5|$|<b>Testing</b> <b>is</b> the preview branch {{that will}} {{eventually}} become the next major release. The packages included in this branch have had some testing in unstable {{but they may not}} be fit for release yet. It contains newer packages than stable but older than unstable. This branch is updated continually until it is frozen. Testings CDs and DVDs {{can be found on the}} Debian website.|$|E
5|$|The Infectious Disease Society of America {{recommends}} against {{empirical treatment}} and considers antibiotics only appropriate when given after a positive test. <b>Testing</b> <b>is</b> not needed in children under three as both group A strep and rheumatic fever are rare, unless {{a child has}} a sibling with the disease.|$|E
5|$|Visuospatial or {{constructional}} abnormalities {{here may}} be associated with parietal lobe pathology, and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate frontal lobe pathology. This kind of brief cognitive <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> regarded as a screening process only, and any abnormalities are more carefully assessed using formal neuropsychological testing.|$|E
30|$|The Pearson Chi Square {{test and}} Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for {{comparisons}} of the categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed rank <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison of the two groups. Kruskal–Wallis, One way Anova, and Welch <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison {{of more than two}} groups. Spearman’s Rho <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to analyze correlations among the variables.|$|R
50|$|The frontal <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed}} at 64 km/h into an offset deformable barrier. This {{is designed to}} represent an impact with a vehicle of similar mass and structure as the car itself.The side impact <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed at}} 50 km/h, but the side impact pole <b>test</b> <b>is</b> performed at 32 km/h. The pedestrian safety <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> performed at 40 km/h.|$|R
30|$|Pearson’s χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to perform}} {{categorical}} analysis, and Spearman’s correlation <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to determine}} correlations. For further evaluations, univariate analysis of variance, the paired t-test, the Kruskall–Wallis test and the Mann–Whitney-U <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|R
5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part of the assessment, with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{was formerly}} the second-most common {{mode of transmission}} for Chagas disease, but {{the development and implementation}} of blood bank screening tests has dramatically reduced this risk in the 21st century. Blood donations in all endemic Latin American countries undergo Chagas screening, and <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> expanding in countries, such as France, Spain and the United States, that have significant or growing populations of immigrants from endemic areas. In Spain, donors are evaluated with a questionnaire to identify individuals at risk of Chagas exposure for screening tests.|$|E
50|$|The Mann-Whitney U test / Wilcoxon rank-sum <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not {{the same}} as the Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test,</b> {{although}} both <b>are</b> nonparametric and involve summation of ranks. The Mann-Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to independent samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to matched or dependent samples.|$|R
30|$|The island {{partition}} {{result is}} not feasible if the DER dispatch test or the power flow <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not passed. Model modification and adjustment strategies {{corresponding to the}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> given in this section. Firstly, the cases that fail the DER dispatch <b>test</b> <b>are</b> analyzed and modification of the constraint set is proposed. Secondly, adjustment strategies based on the power flow <b>test</b> <b>are</b> given.|$|R
40|$|The multisample {{version of}} the Cucconi rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem is proposed. Even though little known, the Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> of {{interest}} for several reasons. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> compared with some Lepage-type <b>tests.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> slightly {{more powerful than the}} multisample Lepage test. Moreover, its <b>test</b> statistic can <b>be</b> computed analytically whereas several others cannot. A practical application example in experimental nutrition is presented. An R function to perform the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS is {{diagnosed}} via laboratory testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
40|$|Task 3 {{experimental}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> concluded this quarter. Second-stage {{testing of}} first-stage distilled filtrates {{and of a}} Wilsonville resid from Run 263 were completed. The first-stage filtrates {{were found to have}} higher reactivity than the Wilsonville material. Task 4 experimental <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> initiated. First-stage microautoclave <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> made at reduced catalyst loading and reduced solvent to coal ratio without negatively affecting coal conversion. Lower severity second-stage catalytic upgrading <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> begun. The single-pass resid conversion obtained in the first completed second-stage <b>test</b> <b>was</b> high (67 - 69 %) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{time series}} analysis, two {{well-known}} {{versions of a}} portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>are</b> available for <b>testing</b> for autocorrelation in the residuals of a model: it tests whether any {{of a group of}} autocorrelations of the residual time series are different from zero. This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> the Ljung-Box <b>test,</b> which <b>is</b> an improved version of the Box-Pierce <b>test,</b> having <b>been</b> devised at essentially the same time; a seemingly trivial simplification (omitted in the improved <b>test)</b> <b>was</b> found to have a deleterious effect. This portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>is</b> useful in working with ARIMA models.|$|R
40|$|The finite sample {{properties}} of recent <b>tests</b> of contagion <b>are</b> investigated using {{a range of}} Monte Carlo experiments. Some variations of these <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> also investigated to correct for size distortions and weak instrument problems. The finite sample {{results show that the}} Forbes-Rigobon and Pesaran-Pick <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> conservative <b>tests,</b> while the Favero-Giavazzi and Bae-Karolyi-Stulz <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> oversized. Two proposed variants of the Forbes and Rigobon <b>test</b> <b>are</b> shown to improve upon the sampling {{properties of}} this test. The change in the correlation <b>test</b> <b>is</b> shown to be a non-monotonic function of the strength of contagion resulting in non-monotonic power functions...|$|R
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E
5|$|Lung {{function}} <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{carried out}} by evaluating a person's capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E
5|$|Screening for {{hypothyroidism}} {{is performed}} in the newborn period in many countries, generally using TSH. This {{has led to the}} early identification of many cases and thus the prevention of developmental delay. It is the most widely used newborn screening test worldwide. While TSH-based screening will identify the most common causes, the addition of T4 <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> required to pick up the rarer central causes of neonatal hypothyroidism. If T4 determination is included in the screening done at birth, this will identify cases of congenital hypothyroidism of central origin in 1:16,000 to 1:160,000 children. Considering that these children usually have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, early identification of these cases may prevent complications.|$|E
50|$|Bartlett's <b>test</b> <b>is</b> {{sensitive}} to departures from normality. That is, if the samples come from non-normal distributions, then Bartlett's <b>test</b> may simply <b>be</b> <b>testing</b> for non-normality. Levene's {{test and the}} Brown-Forsythe <b>test</b> <b>are</b> alternatives to the Bartlett <b>test</b> that <b>are</b> less {{sensitive to}} departures from normality.|$|R
