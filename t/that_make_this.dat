25|$|The Windows API (Win32) {{is focused}} {{mainly on the}} {{programming}} language C in that its exposed functions and data structures are described in that language in recent versions of its documentation.

Similarly, the internal implementation of the API's function has been developed in several languages, historically. Despite the fact that C is not an object-oriented programming language, the Windows API and Windows have both historically been described as object-oriented. There have also been many wrapper classes and extensions (from Microsoft and others) for object-oriented languages <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> object-oriented structure more explicit (Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC), Visual Component Library (VCL), GDI+, etc.).

25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this storage method. When the {{electric}} power flows into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces. The ranges of power and energy storage technology <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> method economic, however, tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The {{respiratory}} system (also respiratory apparatus, ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. The {{anatomy and physiology}} <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> happen varies greatly, {{depending on the size}} of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.|$|E

500|$|Despite the praise, Cavin {{said that}} most of the battle system {{mechanics}} [...] "aren't very original" [...] and also criticized the [...] "lack of a unified storyline". In contrast, a reviewer for Next Generation found the battle system refreshingly broke away from tradition, and was pleased that [...] "the elements that stand out from the traditional formula are those <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> a recognizable Mario game." [...] He further remarked that the gameplay was complex enough to challenge even veteran RPG gamers, yet simple enough to not alienate newcomers to the genre. Scary Larry similarly said the game [...] "should please diehard RPG fans as well as novice players", as it is genuinely tough and offers considerable replay value in the form of sidequests and bonus features such as Toadofasky's music levels. He also found Squaresoft's trademark humor and puzzle-solving to be as exceptional as usual. Miller commented that after engaging in many battles, [...] "the battle music becomes monotonous" [...] and that after the game is beaten, [...] "There aren't any surprises to be discovered the second time around". While 1UP.com stated that [...] "The characters seem too childish for older gamers", Next Generation said the game is [...] "held together by the strength of its characters and well-developed world." ...|$|E

LL Cool J's aggressive rapping and Rick Rubin's stripped-down production were praised by critics who also agreed that LL's lyrics set a new standard for MC's at the time. The songs' lyrics were favored by critics who described LL's songwriting as clever and fun. Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times {{said that he is}} an integral artist of hip hop's [...] "second generation" [...] because of his [...] "razor-sharp wit". Rolling Stone magazine's Debby Bull was impressed by his songwriting and how its originality lies in the ballads, even though [...] "it's the sassier, dance-worthy songs <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> record such an irresistible party." [...] The critical success of the album would later result in its comparison to other LL Cool J albums, which were not as critically successful as Radio.

Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> story special, and they are the reasons why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. That was what I {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained.

500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E
500|$|Debbie Chang of BuddyTV.com {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the shows' development throughout the season, by stating it was [...] "all about couples, jumping {{in and out}} of relationships, trying their darnedest to have hot sex on the cramped, twin-sized bunk-beds in the on-call room". Chang also noted the little screen time of characters Mark Sloan and Richard Webber, and the lack of romantic development in their storylines. Many critics negatively reviewed Izzie Stevens's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George. Katherine Heigl herself deemed their relationship [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn’t seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I’m maybe a little too black and white about it. I don’t really know Izzie very well right now. She’s changed a lot." [...] Laura Burrows of IGN stated the series became [...] "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic" [...] in its fourth season. She also said that [...] "this season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." [...] However, the episode [...] "Physical Attraction, Chemical Reaction" [...] received a positive review, with Burrows stating that it [...] "fully encompassed all the things <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> show great: intense emotional drama and macabre OR activities". The Derek/Rose relationship received negative reviews, with Burrows stating that it was [...] "emotional, but not remarkable". Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters, stating that their behaviour is the show's biggest problem: [...] "the self-absorbed, pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey’s exasperate more than reward." [...] As for the storylines, Foley stated that they didn't [...] "ring true" [...] and that [...] "the plot devices became increasingly clunky", noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie's marriage and the Izzie's affair [...] "as a means of ripping it apart". Florrey also commented on Meredith Grey's arc, by stating that she turned into [...] "one of the most selfish, self-centered characters on television", whereas Mark Sloan's storyline was named [...] "sex-obsessed, borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said [...] "One of the season's best performances came from Emmy-nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser." [...] Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser's performance by stating that it [...] "has been one of the only good things that show's had going for it anymore." [...] Entertainment Weekly called Reaser's performance as Ava the sixth most memorable patient performance on the show. About.com stated that Alex Karev developed into [...] "a bold and overly confident surgeon".|$|E
