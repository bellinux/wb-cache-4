5|$|In 1912, Chinese {{businesses}} began relocating {{from the}} Loop to Chicago's South Side. Starting this trend, the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association appealed to deed-holder and former Illinois State's Attorney Jacob J. Kern to hire architect H. J. Swanson {{to design a}} building large enough to house 15stores, 30apartments and office space on the 200 block of West 22nd Street (now Cermak Road). Built in 1912 for $200,000, the building's design {{was typical of the}} period; however, it featured white <b>tile</b> <b>trim</b> adorned with Chinese dragons and a third floor balcony. The Association relocated to the building's third floor by 1914.|$|E
25|$|The colored <b>tile</b> <b>trim</b> of the IRT {{portions}} of the station closely resembles the Confederate flag. Scholars believe that Vickers and his colleagues unmistakably reference {{the symbol of the}} South to pay homage to New York Times owner Adolph S. Ochs. The Confederacy was a significant part of Ochs' heritage, and the eccentric Vickers relished literary and historical imagery. After a 2010s movement in which Confederate monuments nationwide were removed, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced in August 2017 that these tiles would be replaced.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{released}} on 11 August 2001. It begins with Minogue driving a De Tomaso Mangusta sports car on a futuristic bridge, while singing the [...] "la la la" [...] hook of the song. The next scene consists {{of a number of}} dance couples performing a dance routine dressed in black and white costumes; they are soon joined by Minogue, who is seen wearing a white tracksuit. The setting changes to a room where Minogue is seen striking various poses sporting bright crimson lipstick and a hooded white jumpsuit with a neckline plunging down to her navel. The outfit was designed by London-based fashion designer Fee Doran, under the label of Mrs Jones. Minogue then performs a synchronised dance routine with several backup dancers, who are wearing red and black suits. As the video ends, she performs a similar routine {{on the top of a}} building during the night, this time wearing a lavender halter neck dress with ribbon <b>tile</b> <b>trim.</b> Various scenes in the video show Minogue's face [...] "unusually" [...] close to the lens of the camera, thus it [...] "subtly distorts, yet remains glamorous."

5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main wall tiles and another for <b>trim</b> <b>tiles</b> near the ceiling of the stations. The station names on the main wall tiles use the colour of the <b>trim</b> <b>tiles</b> and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the <b>trim</b> <b>tiles</b> are white instead of the main wall tile colour for readability.|$|R
5|$|This {{pattern is}} based on a design similar to the {{stations}} along the University line which follow a regular pattern with some small variances which are the results of multiple events. One of these tiling variances is located at Christie station, where some of the original tiles were replaced following the 1976 arson attack. The replacement <b>trim</b> <b>tiles</b> were differently coloured {{due to the lack of}} extra green <b>trim</b> <b>tiles.</b>|$|R

60|$|Dominey {{left the}} room like {{a man in a}} dream, descended the stairs to his own part of the house, caught up a hat and stick and strode out into the sea mist which was fast {{enveloping}} the gardens. There was all the chill of the North Pole in that ice-cold cloud of vapour, but nevertheless his forehead remained hot, his pulses burning. He passed out of the postern gate which led from the walled garden on to a broad marsh, with dikes running here and there, and lapping tongues of sea water creeping in with the tide. He made his way seaward with uncertain steps until he reached a rough and stony road; here he hesitated for a moment, looked about him, and then turned back at right angles. Soon he came to a little village, a village of ancient cottages, with seasoned, red-brick <b>tiles,</b> <b>trim</b> little patches of garden, a church embowered with tall elm trees, a triangular green at the cross-roads. On one side a low, thatched building,--the Dominey Arms; on another, an ancient, square stone house, on which was a brass plate. He went over and read the name, rang the bell, and asked the trim maidservant who answered it, for the doctor. Presently, a man of youthful middle-age presented himself in the surgery and bowed. Dominey was for a moment at a loss.|$|R

This is all beneath a red <b>tile</b> roof <b>trimmed</b> with bronze cresting, with crocketed ribs on the roofs of the tower and museum.|$|R
5000|$|Update in 2017: The {{reconstruction}} of the station building included complete removal of all rotten and unusable wood. Window sashes which were salvageable were set aside. The timbers which supported the canopy were removed and reconditioned. About 75% were replaced during reconstruction. The remaining 25% were fabricated like the originals. Douglas fir was used throughout the structure. Ceramic <b>tile</b> <b>trim</b> over windows was used where the original tiles had been destroyed. The extending [...] "porch" [...] was preserved and cantilevered {{so that it can}} be used for occupancy. When completed, the exterior was in the same condition as the original building. The interior has two open floors with plywood flooring. The remnants of a chimney are in the middle of the structure. SEPTA uses the space for some storage and to house the communication system. Salvaged windows and doors are in the basement. The second floor has exhaust fans to prevent mold and overheating in the summer.|$|E
50|$|Looking {{to escape}} the anti-Chinese {{violence}} that had broken out on the west coast, the first Chinese arrived in Chicago after 1869 when the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed. By the late 1800s, 25% of Chicago's approximately 600 Chinese residents settled along Clark Street between Van Buren and Harrison Streets in Chicago's Loop. In 1889, 16 Chinese-owned businesses were located along the two-block stretch, including eight grocery stores, two butcher shops and a restaurant. In 1912, the Chinese living in this area began moving south to Armour Square. Some historians say {{this was due to}} increasing rent prices. Others see more complex causes: discrimination, overcrowding, a high non-Chinese crime rate, and disagreements between the two associations ("tongs") within the community, the Hip Sing Tong and the On Leong Tong. The move to the new South Side Chinatown was led by the On Leong Merchants Association who, in 1912, had a building constructed along Cermak Avenue (then 22nd Street) that could house 15 stores, 30 apartments and the Association's headquarters. While the building's design was typical of the period, it also featured Chinese accents such as <b>tile</b> <b>trim</b> adorned with dragons.|$|E

[...] Following the design style set by the stations of the Bloor-Danforth line, Chester station uses a two colour theme with the station's name in the Toronto Subway Font. In keeping with the style, Chester's colours match the 'opposing' stations on the western half of the subway line: the <b>trim</b> <b>tiles</b> are blue and complement Lansdowne station, while the light green main tiles complement the original tile colour for Dufferin station.|$|R
50|$|The Buhler House is a {{historic}} house at 1820 Fair Park Boulevard in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, its exterior clad in brick, set on a field stone foundation.

The house's most distinctive feature is its internal frame, which is constructed entirely out of steel beams. Its exterior and interior door frames are also steel, as is the front door, which has been processed to resemble walnut. It was built in 1930-31 by Henry Buhler, owner of a local real estate development firm. No other residential structure in the state has been documented to have this type of construction.|$|R
50|$|Webb’s offices occupy 50,000 {{square feet}} on the top six floors of the tower.

This permits all offices to have outside windows. There are no interior columns to restrict space layouts. The exterior originally used precast stone and mosaic <b>tile</b> panels and <b>trim</b> of gold anodized aluminum. Ground was broken on the tower on June 20, 1961 and it was completed by June 1962.|$|R
