40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that during the design of <b>teleinformatic</b> system the tradeoff between the systems performance and the system protection should be made. The traditional approach assumes {{that the best way}} is to apply the strongest possible security measures. Unfortunately, the overestimation of security measures can lead to the unreasonable increase of system load. This is especially important in multimedia systems where the performance has critical character. In many cases determination of the required level of protection and adjustment of some security measures to these requirements increase system efficiency. Such an approach is achieved by means of the quality of protection models where the security measures are evaluated according to their influence on the system security. In the paper, we propose a model for QoP evaluation of security mechanisms. Owing to this model, one can quantify the influence of particular security mechanisms on ensuring security attributes. The methodology of our model preparation is described and based on it the case study analysis is presented. We support our method by the tool where the models can be defined and QoP evaluation can be performed. Finally, we have modelled TLS cryptographic protocol and presented the QoP security mechanisms evaluation for the selected versions of this protocol...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} teaching of concept of base of a vector space according to the premises mediated by Fedathi Sequence during the discipline âIntroduction to Algebraâ {{in the course of}} Engineering of <b>Teleinformatic</b> at Federal University of CearÃ. The objective was to determine whether the use of Fedathi Sequence specifically in classes about the concept of base provides resources capable of becoming Meta Lever, allowing students an education based on the reflection on the worked contents. In this sense, the investigation was conducted in the form of case study, having as subject the teacher of discipline, which allowed the observation during his classes and planning, as well as having granted an interview. The results indicated that the Fedathi Sequence favored the use of resources that could become Meta Lever for students, being decisive in mediating the teacher, once the teacher behavior to use it in the classroom motivates students to reflection. We consider theories ML and FS, in this research, are complementary, and therefore we indicate that the teacher know such tools and their potential for use in teaching of concept of base, awakening the teacher an awareness of the role of mediation suggested by Fedathi Sequence.

40|$|The DTM host/network adapter uses a {{dual-ported}} shared {{buffer memory}} {{on the interface}} board as in the Van Jacobson "Witless" interface [9]. The host operating system, SunOS, performs all protocol processing in the shared buffer memory and can therefore minimize {{the number of times}} data have to be transferred over the host system bus. We give an overview of the DTM host/network adapter hardware design emphasizing on the software visible parts. These parts include the dual-ported shared memory, the interrupt mechanism, control and status registers, and the FIFO queues used for managing buffers in the shared memory. The software controlling the hardware adapter constitutes a network interface driver in the SunOS operating system kernel. This driver implements the DTM service specification [7]. We describe how the adapter is managed by the driver and the operating system. In particular, we describe the modifications to the buffer system (mbufs) and socket layer that is necessary to use the on-board buffer memory in an efficient way. One modification for out-bound data is that the socket layer must know which particular network interface the data is destined for, at the time when the data is copied from the user application buffers into the mbuf buffers, so that the mbufs can be allocated in the on-board memory. We also describe the protocol layering on top of DTM and the design of the socket application interface to the DTM packet service. We introduce a DTM "link layer" protocol for addressing and encapsulating IP and other higher level protocols.

It was mainly {{the level of the}} technique and electronics that helped to improve the first systems of connection between each other. This process caused the first communication networks. All the changes were done on the field of the radio operation. The networks were analog and were contained mainly by metallic – cooper wire. On the field of radio communication were mainly electromagnetic waves which maintained the connection of the places where was not able to stretch trunk cables. Communication has made huge qualitative improvement. This process has used different types of wire that were able to transmit higher and higher frequencies and to raise a number of made connections. All those changes were involved in radio network. In 1950 s the entertainment was made mainly through television broadcast. This improvement needed the new studios and broadcast systems and also the radio improved. In that time there was huge automatic PBX equipped with stepper drivers matrix switches. The networks started to be divided into access drivers which resulted from the subscriber terminal to the first connection point, for example, the first public telephone exchange. Among these exchanges was formed their interlinking transport or transportation network, to finally, after reaching the target (last panel) would be merged back into the network access for remote users. The aim is to describe some properties of transport networks, the contemporary, which has been fully digital technology. We will focus on data networks, i. e. those that are available to contemporary man, and describe some of the technologies and components that can be used.

40|$|Electronics {{is under}} {{development}} {{in this country}} in an organized and institutional way since the beginning of 30 -ties of the previous century. It grew up from electrical engineering of weak currents and its first name used popularly was communications. It was time when television was born and the radio was maturing. Electronics is a branch of research and technology which deals with generation and processing of electrical and electromagnetic signals. A subject of telecommunications is signal transmission for a distance. Electronics and telecommunications (ET) includes or is combined with other branches like: microelectronics, radioelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, acoustoelectronics, magnetronics, bioelectronics, energoelectronics, material engineering, semiconductor physics, automation and robotics, mechatronics and microsystems, informatics, <b>teleinformatics,</b> software engineering and other. Devices and functional systems of ET such as computers, data warehouses, cell phones, TV sets, Internet, GPS are build of electronic components and circuits. ET is a branch which belongs to hi-tech area, where the products gather a large load of knowledge of value overcoming frequently the price of work and material. ET has recently turned to an active participant of the processes of generation, storing, processing, transportation, distribution and usage of knowledge in the society. ET started to create artificial intelligence, co-creates intellectual property, searches for knowledge in big data sets, aids medicine, extends virtual/augmented reality, builds Internet of persons and things, strengthens security, protects natural environment, facilitates our life, aids our decisions, activates individuals, equalizes chances, provides convenient personal communications and access to data, starts building a penetrating ubiquitous infrastructure, ceases to be only a branch of technology, grows into the social space, touches culture, sociology, psychology and art. Such an important role of ET is combined with the existence in the society of an adequate infrastructure which recreates the full development cycle of high technology embracing: people, institutions, finances and logistics, in this also science, higher education, education, continuous training, dissemination and outreach, professional social environment, legal basis, political support and lobbying, innovation structures, applications, industry and economy. The digest of chosen development tendencies in ET was made here from the academic perspective, in a wider scale and on this background the national one, trying to situate this branch in the society, determine its changing role to build a new technical infrastructure of a society based on knowledge, a role of builder of many practical gadgets facilitating life, a role of a big future integrator of today’s single bricks into certain more useful unity. This digest does not have a character of a systematic analysis of ET. It is a kind of an arbitrary utterance of the authors inside their field of competence.
