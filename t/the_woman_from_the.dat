5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss {{to clean out}} an old and dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> apartment.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book in a coffee shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

Her lips were parted with a languid smile; and she drew back the long hair, which lay over her cheeks, her neck, her bosom, while I was gazing on her.|$|E

40|$|The {{study at}} hand is a {{retrospective}} analysis comparing the three tension-free vaginal tapes TVT, Sparc and Monarc for the surgical treatment of urinary stress incontinence in women. It was researched whether women after a transobturator Monarc operation were dissatisfied with the outcome compared to women after a retropubic TVT- and Sparc-operation. For this, the patients were interviewed using questionnaires sent by mail. Similarly, the complication rates of the three methods were studied by evaluating the medical records. Materials and methods The medical records of 241 patients (102 patients after a TVT, 78 patients after a Sparc and 61 patients after a Monarc operation) were analyzed. The patients had been operated between October 1998 and December 2004 either in the hospital Krankenhaus Märkisch Oderland in Strausberg, in the hospital Am Urban in Berlin or in the University Hospital of the Charite, Campus Benjamin Franklin in Berlin. The participation in the survey was 66 %. The questionnaires of 50 patients <b>from</b> <b>the</b> TVT, 59 patients <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sparc and 49 patients <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Monarc group were evaluated. The average follow-up period (the interval between surgery and survey by means of questionnaire) in the three groups was 29 months. The median rate in the TVT group was 48 months, in the Sparc group 17 months and in the Monarc group 19 months. Results 86 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> TVT group, 91 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sparc group and only 71 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Monarc group were satisfied (very satisfied, satisfied and fairly satisfied) with the overall result of the operation. A cure or improvement of the urinary incontinence was shown in 92 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> TVT, 93 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sparc and 80 % of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Monarc group. There were four bleeding complications (4 %) and one bladder injury (1 %) {{in the implementation of}} 102 TVT procedures. The application of 78 Sparc procedures resulted in a bleeding in two cases (3 %) and in a bladder injury in three cases (4 %) whereas in 61 Monarc operations there was only one bladder injury (2 %) and bleeding did not occur. Interpretation These findings show that the transobturator tape insert {{in the form of a}} hammock seems less reliable than the retropubic tape insert. A further factor to be considered is the learning curve. A minimal vaginal dissection seems to influence the satisfaction of patients positively. All three methods can be described as low-risk surgical procedures, but the Monarc process has the least potential for injury. Comparing the three methods, the Sparc method is the most reliable system regarding the success of <b>the</b> operation. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> author´s perspective the Monarc method is an important alternative. Further investigation should follow...|$|R
