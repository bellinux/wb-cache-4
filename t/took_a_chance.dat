After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts.

However, some baseball commentators like RotoWorld and Tim Dierkes still considered the signing worthwhile, since many of the other free agent pitchers that year, like Matt Morris and Paul Byrd had less impressive career stats, even though they had fewer health risks.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{receiving}} a red {{card in the}} previous game, Ljungberg was ineligible to play the next Seattle Sounders game. As a result, All-Star coach Dominic Kinnear played Ljungberg for a full 90 minutes. At {{the end of the}} game, Ljungberg started to have impaired vision. When the game went to penalty kicks, he chose to sit it out due to his loss of vision after an on-set migraine. Unfortunately for Ljungberg, the initial five kicks ended in a draw. Kinnear, not fully understanding Ljungberg's condition, sent him out as the sixth kicker. Ljungberg, unable to see, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> and just tapped the ball in the center of net. However, Tim Howard caught it, resulting in Everton's win. Immediately following the game, Ljungberg was removed from the field on a stretcher. Later, Ljungberg told reporters that he ingested trace amount of red wine while in Utah, resulting in his second migraine within months.|$|E
25|$|A short week two-game {{road trip}} {{concluded}} on a Friday in Chicago, where D.C. once again rescued {{a point in}} the final minutes. The game started brightly for the visitors, when they were awarded an indirect free kick just outside the Fire's 6-yard box. Rob Vincent scored his first MLS goal, with a blast through the defense, assisted by Acosta. However, the Fire responded quickly as Luke Mishu, playing for the injured Franklin, lost his mark on a corner kick and surrendered a header for goal. The Fire made it 2-0 not long thereafter, as David Accam dribbled around Birnbaum and took a long shot that found the corner of the goal. Down a goal, United turned in a tired display, and seemed destined for a defeat. As the game went into stoppage time, Mullins <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> with a spectacular overhead volley that rang off the crossbar. The rebound went to Nyarko, who forced a save by the diving Sean Johnson, but Boswell headed that rebound in for the tying goal. The draw again put United ahead of Orlando City Soccer Club {{in the race for the}} final playoff position, - but only on the goal differential tiebreaker with a big home match against Orlando City looming the following weekend. Both teams actually trailed New England Revolution in that race, by two points, but the Revolution had played an additional game.|$|E

500|$|Aden is characterised as a [...] "bad boy" [...] {{who goes}} on a journey {{to become one of}} the [...] "good guys". Aden's backstory played a {{substantial}} role in his early material. His childhood was plagued with sexual abuse at the hands of his grandfather, while Aden's father, Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson) became an alcoholic. Lasance and scriptwriters have both pointed out that these events impacted on Aden's life and contribute to his destructive personality. As Aden begins to trust others again, he gains a close circle of friends including Nicole Franklin (Tessa James), Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) and Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). He also has a nemesis throughout his tenure in the form of Geoff Campbell (Lincoln Lewis). However, his main relationship is with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey); when the actors first heard that their on-screen counterparts would enter a relationship, they both complained to producers. Both felt like it would not work out and be ill-received by viewers. However, the two realised they had chemistry as a duo and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> The couple became popular with viewers and fans coined the term [...] "Adelle" [...] to refer to the pair.|$|E

The actor's only speaking role during this period came when he was 12; he was seen as Govinda, the title character's adopted son, in Prakash's Bhagwaan Dada (1986). Roshan decided {{that he wanted to be}} a full-time actor, but his father insisted that he focus on his studies. In his early 20s, he was diagnosed with scoliosis that would not allow him to dance or perform stunts. Initially devastated, he eventually decided to become an actor anyway. Around a year after the diagnosis, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> by jogging on a beach when he was caught in a downpour.

500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a {{successful}} catalogue of songs, which included [...] "What's That For, Eh?", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being [...] "blue" [...] and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her [...] "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head." [...] Similar-styled songs followed; [...] "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. [...] This was followed by [...] "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; [...] "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye" [...] and [...] "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. [...] Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself {{as a member of the}} French government. He confirmed to her that [...] "Twiggy Vous" [...] was [...] "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news. [...] At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime Cinderella in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.|$|E
500|$|Although Warner Brothers studio {{had assumed}} that the many costumed films that studios like MGM had earlier {{produced}} would never succeed {{during the years of}} the Great Depression, they nonetheless <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> by producing Captain Blood in 1935. The film is a swashbuckler action drama based on the popular novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz. It would star a then unknown extra, Errol Flynn, alongside the little-known de Havilland. According to film historian Tony Thomas, both actors had [...] "classic good looks, cultured speaking voices, and a sense of distant aristocracy about them". Filmed between August 5 and October 29, 1935, Captain Blood gave deHavilland the opportunity to appear in her first costumed historical romance and adventure epic, a genre to which she was well suited, given her beauty and elegance. In the film, she played Arabella Bishop, the niece of a Jamaica plantation owner, who purchases at auction an Irish physician wrongly condemned to servitude. The on-screen chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn was evident from their first scenes together, where clashes between her character's spirited hauteur and his character's playful braggadocio did not mask their mutual attraction to each other. Arabella is a feisty young woman who knows what she wants and is willing to fight for it. The bantering tone of their exchanges in the filmthe healthy give-and-take and mutual respectbecame the basis for their on-screen relationship in subsequent films. Captain Blood was released on December 28, 1935, and received good reviews and wide public appeal. DeHavilland's performance was singled out in The New York Times and Variety. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The popular success of the film, as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple, led to seven additional collaborations.|$|E
500|$|The {{beginning}} of season five saw, for the first time, Clark and Lana in a happy relationship together, one that was void of dishonesty and secrets. The return of Clark's powers in [...] "Hidden", {{as well as the}} secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life has been motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that she could see her parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Although she did not truly love Lex, Kreuk argues that Lex was not a rebound guy and that Lana did have feelings for him." ...|$|E

This scheme was ultimately successful because male and female literacy rates were increasing at the time. Among the first American novels are Thomas Attwood Digges' [...] "Adventures of Alonso", published in London in 1775 and [...] William Hill Brown's The Power of Sympathy published in 1791. Brown's novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fell in love without knowing they were related.

Despite their poor regular season showing in 1968–69, they made the playoffs. They again lost to St. Louis, however, this time being dispatched in a four-game sweep. Not wanting his team to be physically outmatched again, majority owner Ed Snider instructed General Manager Bud Poile to acquire bigger, tougher players. While Head Coach Keith Allen soon after replaced Poile as GM, this mandate eventually led {{to one of the most}} feared teams to ever take the ice in the NHL. The keystone of those teams was acquired when the Flyers <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> on a 19-year-old diabetic from Flin Flon, Manitoba, Bobby Clarke, with their second draft pick, 17th overall, in the 1969 NHL Amateur Draft.
