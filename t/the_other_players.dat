5|$|At E3 2012, Nintendo {{introduced}} the Wii U launch title Nintendo Land, which hosts Luigi's Ghost Mansion, a multiplayer minigame based on Luigi's Mansion. In this minigame, four players controlling Miis {{dressed up as}} Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have to drain the energy of a ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, must make all <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>players</b> faint before time runs out.|$|E

If the new king dies, the King's Guard will return to being neutral and the other princes regain their men.|$|E
5|$|Plante's {{first foray}} into {{organized}} hockey came at age 12. He was watching his school's team practice, when the coach ordered the goaltender off the ice after a heated argument over his play, and Plante asked to replace him. The coach permitted him to play {{since there was no}} other available goaltender; it was quickly apparent that Plante could hold his own, despite <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>players</b> being many years older than he was. He impressed the coach and stayed on as the team's number one goaltender.|$|E
5|$|Terlecki {{tried to}} stop the many pressmen at the airport from photographing Młynarczyk by running around, yelling, and {{snatching}} cameras and microphones from their hands. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>players</b> attempted to talk Kulesza around, telling him that Młynarczyk had serious personal problems. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed the goalkeeper to travel with the team.|$|E

50|$|In Go, {{one player}} {{can choose the}} amount of komi and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player</b> decides whether to accept that or switch colors with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player.</b> In <b>the</b> long run, this leads players to choose fair komi amounts because if they choose a Komi that is too {{advantage}}ous, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player</b> can just choose to play White {{and take advantage of}} that high komi.|$|R
5|$|The Grand Slam Chess Final {{was held}} as a double round robin with six players, in São Paulo (25 September–1 October) and Bilbao (5–11 October). Although Carlsen had a slow start, {{including}} a loss against bottom-ranked Francisco Vallejo Pons, he finished +3−1=6, equal with Ivanchuk (whose +4−3=3 finish was equal due to three points for a win). Carlsen then won the blitz tiebreak against Ivanchuk. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>players</b> were Anand, Aronian, Nakamura, and Vallejo Pons.|$|E
5|$|At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond {{excelled at}} sports {{including}} cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), football and fives. At Cirencester, he played football {{for the school}} first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>players</b> and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred to be out playing cricket.|$|E
5|$|Bond rapidly rebuilds his {{position}} {{before the next}} break. Le Chiffre's girlfriend, Valenka, spikes Bond's martini with poison. Bond vomits and retreats to his Aston Martin to inject himself with an antidote. MI6 instructs him to use the defibrillator, but a wire is disconnected; Vesper saves Bond by reconnecting the wire. Bond returns to the game just as Leiter loses his last hand to Le Chiffre. The tournament culminates in a $115-million hand in which the remaining players, including Bond and Le Chiffre, go all in. Le Chiffre trumps <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>players,</b> but Bond wins with a straight flush.|$|E

On 22 March, Carlsen played a game for his club Stavanger in the final team match for promotion to the Norwegian Premier League.

5|$|In Super Mario Kart, {{the player}} takes control {{of one of}} eight Mario series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against {{computer-controlled}} characters in multi-race cups over three difficulty levels. During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups {{can be used to}} gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode. In multi-player mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode.

The player who has collected the most parts will control the combined ship's main shot, while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player</b> (<b>the</b> one with the fewer parts collected) controls the secondary weapon. When the timer runs out or the combined ship takes enough damage, the player's ship will revert to its regular state (along with that of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player's).</b>|$|R
50|$|Initially, all {{the players}} stand {{on the ground and}} a stick is thrown from a {{predefined}} line. Chor has to pick up that stick and place it at the line; during this time, <b>other</b> <b>players</b> have to climb a tree.

5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>players</b> to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
5|$|The White Sox {{brought on}} new manager Jack Onslow {{to begin the}} 1949 Chicago White Sox season.

50|$|Online {{challenges}} {{consist of}} two 10×10 puzzles in a row. If a mistake is made, the game grid is frozen for five seconds while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player</b> {{is allowed to}} continue. <b>Players</b> cannot see <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player's</b> screen, but are shown a progress bar that estimates how close <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>player</b> is to completing the puzzles.
