5|$|Drug-induced {{psoriasis}} {{may occur}} with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <b>terbinafine,</b> calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering drugs, and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab. Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis {{due to the}} rebound effect.|$|E
25|$|Some {{methods of}} {{prevention}} include avoiding walking barefoot in public showers, keeping the toenails short, wearing big enough shoes, and changing socks daily. When infected, the feet {{should be kept}} dry and clean and wearing sandals may help. Treatment can be either with antifungal medication applied to the skin such as clotrimazole or for persistent infections antifungal medication that are taken by mouth such as <b>terbinafine.</b> The use of the cream is typically recommended for four weeks.|$|E
25|$|Where {{available}} and tolerated by the patient, antifungal drugs are indicated {{as the primary}} treatment of sporotrichosis. For cutaneous infection itraconazole or <b>terbinafine</b> are the primary treatment with fluconazole being recommended if primary antifungals are not well-tolerated. When infection is disseminated throughout the body, Amphotericin B is the drug of choice. To completely clear the fungus, the course of treatment generally lasts from 3 to 6 months. In vitro susceptibility to antifungal drugs {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the growth phase (hyphal or yeast) of the fungus.|$|E
2500|$|... 500mg and 1000mg daily dosages of <b>terbinafine</b> {{for twelve}} to 24 weeks {{has been used}} to treat {{cutaneous}} sporotrichosis.|$|E
2500|$|Alkynes {{occur in}} some pharmaceuticals, {{including}} the contraceptive noretynodrel. A carbon–carbon triple bond is {{also present in}} marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral Efavirenz and the antifungal <b>Terbinafine.</b> Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene ("ene") between two alkyne groups ("diyne"). These compounds, e.g. calicheamicin, {{are some of the}} most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a [...] "warhead". Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the Bergman cyclization, generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.|$|E
2500|$|A {{diagnosis}} of E. dermatitidis {{infection of the}} CNS can only be reliably achieved following biopsy. For systemic infections there are few treatment options, and E. dermatitidis is described as [...] "notoriously resistant" [...] to antifungal drugs. During the North Carolina outbreak, treatment with voriconazole was effective in four out of the five patients, and all of voriconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin B {{were found to be}} effective in vitro. <b>Terbinafine</b> has also been found to be effective in vitro, and combinations of antifungal drugs can have a synergistic effect against E. dermatitidis. A 2012 article found that of reported cases, 44% of patients responded to amphotericin B treatment, 50% responded to voriconazole treatment, and 71.4% responded to itraconazole therapy.|$|E
50|$|Tinea unguum (nails) usually {{will require}} oral {{treatment}} with <b>terbinafine,</b> itraconizole, or griseofulvin. Griseofulvin {{is usually not}} as effective as <b>terbinafine</b> or itraconizole. A lacquer (Penlac) can be used daily, but is ineffective unless combined with aggressive debridement of the affected nail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terbinafine</b> {{first became}} {{available}} in Europe in 1991 {{and in the}} United States in 1996. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first generic versions of prescription Lamisil (<b>terbinafine</b> hydrochloride) tablets. The remaining patent or exclusivity for Lamisil expired on June 30, 2007.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{side effects}} and adverse drug {{reactions}} have been reported with oral <b>terbinafine</b> hydrochloride possibly due to its extensive biodistribution and the often extended durations involved in antifungal treatment (longer than two months). A comprehensive list of adverse events associated with <b>terbinafine</b> use includes: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Terbinafine</b> {{has been}} used in the treatment.|$|E
50|$|Like other allylamines, <b>terbinafine</b> {{inhibits}} ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting squalene epoxidase, {{an enzyme}} {{that is part}} of the fungal cell membrane synthesis pathway. Because <b>terbinafine</b> prevents conversion of squalene to lanosterol, ergosterol cannot be synthesized. This is thought to change cell membrane permeability, causing fungal cell lysis.|$|E
5000|$|Topical {{medications}} like clotrimazole, butenafine, miconazole, and <b>terbinafine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Systemic {{medications}} (oral) like fluconazole, griseofulvin, <b>terbinafine,</b> and itraconizole.|$|E

50|$|Drugs {{to treat}} skin infections are the azoles: ketoconazole, itraconazole, <b>terbinafine</b> among others.|$|E
50|$|Treatment may {{be based}} on the signs. Treatment may be with the {{medication}} <b>terbinafine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{treatment}} options are the antifungal drug <b>terbinafine,</b> an experimental drug posaconazole, and heat therapy.|$|E
50|$|Allylamines such as <b>terbinafine</b> are {{considered}} more efficacious than azoles {{for the treatment}} of athlete's foot.|$|E
5000|$|Tolnaftate - a thiocarbamate antifungal, which {{inhibits}} fungal squalene epoxidase (similar {{mechanism to}} allylamines like <b>terbinafine)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Oral {{medications}} include <b>terbinafine</b> (76% effective), itraconazole (60% effective) and fluconazole (48% effective). They share {{characteristics that}} enhance their effectiveness: prompt {{penetration of the}} nail and nail bed, persistence in the nail for months after discontinuation of therapy. Ketoconazole by mouth is not recommended due to side effects. Oral <b>terbinafine</b> is better tolerated than itraconazole. For superficial white onychomycosis, systemic rather than topical antifungal therapy is advised.|$|E
50|$|Allylamines inhibit {{squalene}} epoxidase, another enzyme {{required for}} ergosterol synthesis. Examples include Amorolfin, Butenafine, Naftifine, and <b>Terbinafine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Interactions are {{possible}} with anticoagulants, phenytoin, <b>terbinafine,,</b> some newer atypical antipsychotics, cyclosporin, and some statins {{used to treat}} hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{available}} prescription drugs, {{the evidence is}} best for <b>terbinafine</b> and naftifine, but other agents may also work.|$|E
5000|$|... 500mg and 1000mg daily dosages of <b>terbinafine</b> {{for twelve}} to 24 weeks {{has been used}} to treat {{cutaneous}} sporotrichosis.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the locus and {{severity}} of infection. For tinea pedis, many antifungal creams such as miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), <b>terbinafine</b> hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid are effective. For more severe or complicated infections, oral ketoconazole was historically shown {{to be an effective}} treatment for T. rubrum infections but is no longer used for this indication due to the risk of liver damage as a side effect. Oral <b>terbinafine,</b> itraconazole or fluconazole have all been shown to be safer, effective treatments. <b>Terbinafine</b> and naftifine (topical creams) have been successfully treated tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by T. rubrum. Trichophyton rubrum infections {{have been found to be}} susceptible to photodynamic treatment, laser irradiation, and photoactivation of rose bengal dye by green laser light.|$|E
50|$|It also {{displays}} superior activity against Candida albicans than <b>terbinafine</b> and naftifine. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against Cryptococcus and Aspergillus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terbinafine</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{may induce}} or exacerbate subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Persons with lupus erythematosus should first discuss possible risks with their doctor before initiation of therapy.|$|E
5000|$|For example, Ajoene {{has been}} shown to have {{activity}} against the human dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum, {{the most common cause of}} tinea pedis, commonly known as Athlete’s Foot. The specific mechanism of action is unclear, but is thought to be related to the inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in human dermatophytes. In a randomized study by Ledezma et al. (2000), 70 soldiers from the Venezuelan Armed Forces with KOH or culture proven tinea pedis interdigitalis were randomly distributed into 3 treatment groups: 0.6% ajoene, 1% ajoene, and 1% <b>terbinafine</b> (commercially available as Lamisil AT®) applied twice daily for 1 week. At the 60 day follow up, 72%, 100%, and 94% of the patients treated with 0.6% and 1% ajoene, and 1% <b>terbinafine,</b> respectively, had maintained culture-proven mycologic cure suggesting that short-term topical treatment with ajoene is at least as effective as topical <b>terbinafine</b> for treating tinea pedis.|$|E
50|$|Case reports {{indicate}} {{the use of}} the following chemotherapy treatments with varying success: potassium iodide, amphotericin B, <b>terbinafine,</b> itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, natamycin, posaconazole, voriconazole, prednisone, flucytosine, and liposomal nystatin.|$|E
50|$|Novartis {{manufactures}} {{the drugs}} clozapine (Clozaril), diclofenac (Voltaren), carbamazepine (Tegretol), valsartan (Diovan) and imatinib mesylate (Gleevec/Glivec). Additional agents include ciclosporin (Neoral/Sandimmun), letrozole (Femara), methylphenidate (Ritalin), <b>terbinafine</b> (Lamisil), and others.|$|E
50|$|Tinea cruris is best {{treated with}} topical {{antifungal}} medications of the allylamine or azole type. The evidence {{is best for}} <b>terbinafine</b> and naftifine but other agents may also work.|$|E

50|$|Butenafine {{hydrochloride}} is {{a synthetic}} benzylamine antifungal, marketed under the trade names Mentax, Butop (India) {{and is the}} active ingredient in Lotrimin Ultra. It is structurally related to synthetic allylamine antifungals such as <b>terbinafine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} of M. gallinae involves both topical and oral antifungals. Topical antifungals, such as: <b>Terbinafine,</b> Tolnaftate, and orally administered Griseofulvin {{have been used}} successfully to treat M. gallinae infections in humans and animals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terbinafine</b> {{hydrochloride}} {{is a white}} fine {{crystalline powder}} that is freely soluble in methanol and dichloromethane, soluble in ethanol, and slightly soluble in water. It is highly hydrophobic and tends to accumulate in hair, skin, nails, and fatty tissue.|$|E
