5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> Patience, Carte {{built the}} large, modern Savoy Theatre, {{which became the}} partnership's {{permanent}} home. It was the first theatre (indeed the world's first public building) to be lit entirely by electric lighting. Patience moved into the Savoy after six months at the Opera Comique and ran {{for a total of}} 578 performances, surpassing <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> H.M.S. Pinafore and becoming the second longest-running work of musical theatre up to that time in history.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Coward {{suffered}} from arteriosclerosis and, during <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> Suite in Three Keys, he struggled with bouts of memory loss. This also affected his work in The Italian Job, and he retired from acting immediately afterwards. Coward was knighted in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He received a Tony Award for lifetime achievement. In 1972, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by the University of Sussex.|$|E

One of his best races came in Austria where despite starting from the pitlane and suffering a drive-through penalty he set the race's third fastest lap, behind only the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello, finishing in 7th place.|$|E

5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre.|$|E

50|$|Depending on how <b>the</b> {{individual}} <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases {{are arranged}} in a bimolecular or intramolecular quadruplex, a quadruplex can adopt {{one of a number}} of topologies with varying loop configurations. If all strands of DNA proceed in the same direction, the quadruplex is termed parallel. For intramolecular quadruplexes, this means that any loop regions present must be of the propeller type, positioned to the sides of the quadruplex. If one or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases has a 5’-3’ direction opposite to <b>the</b> other <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases, <b>the</b> quadruplex is said to have adopted an antiparallel topology. <b>The</b> loops joining <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases in intramolecular antiparallel quadruplexes are either diagonal, joining two diagonally opposite <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine bases, or lateral (edgewise) type loops, joining two adjacent <b>runs</b> <b>of</b> guanine base pairs.|$|R

5|$|Supporting {{cast members}} were added {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> the show. The only addition with no professional acting experience was the Holmfirth resident Gordon Wharmby, who performed so well during his audition as mechanic Wesley Pegden that Alan J. W. Bell cast him in one episode. Pegden became a regular character after a positive audience reception.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> {{consecutive}} defeats {{extended to}} five {{during the first}} two weeks of October. After a 3–0 defeat to Accrington Stanley, McCall added two more loan signings to the squad, Nicky Law, son of former City manager Nicky Law, and goalkeeper Rhys Evans. Both played as City lost 2–1 to both Milton Keynes Dons, when Barry Conlon scored his first goal for the club, then Morecambe. <b>The</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> defeats came to an end when City drew 0–0 with Darlington, but the month ended without a single victory after another draw, this time 1–1 with Grimsby Town, when Rhys Evans was substituted after 24minutes for City, and Ndumbu-Nsungu scored a late equaliser following Grimsby's own goalkeeper Phil Barnes' red card. Evans' loan deal was cut short following the injury and he returned to Blackpool after just four games. Young midfielder Joe Colbeck, who had been one of several players McCall wanted to send out on loan to gain first team experience, was loaned out to Darlington for a month.|$|E
5|$|The season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation. The season had {{a slight}} impact on popular culture.

5|$|Two {{years after}} his {{tutoring}} had begun, {{he was sent to}} the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus' interest in botany and gave him <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> his garden.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey, De Soto spent March and April fruitlessly {{cruising}} for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico. As {{one of the}} few fast steamers in Bailey's command, De Soto {{possessed a}} speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey. This was demonstrated on 24 April, when De Soto sailors boarded and seized two sloops, Jane Adelie and Bright, sixteen hours out of Mobile, Alabama, and each laden with cotton. Two schooners, General Prim and Rapid, were then taken the very next day, and they too carried cotton. All four prizes were sent to Key West for adjudication. On 27 April, De Soto continued <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> good luck, seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana, Cuba to Matamoras.|$|E
5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>of</b> a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present Laughter and his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E

30|$|NESCA, a newly {{discovered}} signaling adapter protein in the NGF-pathway, contains a RUN domain at its N-terminus. Here we report the crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NESCA <b>RUN</b> domain determined at 2.0 -Å resolution. The overall fold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NESCA <b>RUN</b> domain comprises nine helices, resembling <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> domain <b>of</b> RPIPx and <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> 1 domain <b>of</b> Rab 6 IP 1. However, compared to <b>the</b> other <b>RUN</b> domains, <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> domain <b>of</b> NESCA has significantly different surface electrostatic distributions at the putative GTPase-interacting interface. We demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>RUN</b> domain <b>of</b> NESCA can bind H-Ras, a downstream signaling molecule of TrkA, with high affinity. Moreover, NESCA RUN can directly interact with TrkA. These results provide {{new insights into}} how NESCA participates in the NGF-TrkA signaling pathway.|$|R
