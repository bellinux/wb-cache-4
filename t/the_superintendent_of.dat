5|$|In 115 BC {{the central}} government's mint was {{transferred}} from the Minister Steward's ministry to the park managed by <b>the</b> <b>Superintendent</b> <b>of</b> Waterways and Parks. In 113 BC the central government closed all commandery-level mints; private minting had previously been outlawed in 144 BC. The Superintendent's imperial mint in the park outside Chang'an had the sole right to issue coinage throughout the empire. However, Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25–57 AD) abolished <b>the</b> <b>Superintendent</b> <b>of</b> Waterways and Parks and revived his post annually during autumn to conduct a ritual sacrifice. The imperial mint became {{the responsibility of the}} Minister of Finance and the imperial park located outside Eastern-Han Luoyang was administered by a prefect.|$|E

However, Pius V relentlessly avoided delegating any real autonomous power to Bonelli.|$|E
