5|$|Great mullein most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> to grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats has been linked to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E
5|$|Other moons in the Solar System {{are also}} tidally heated, and they too may {{generate}} additional heat through the friction of subsurface magma or water oceans. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> to generate {{heat in a}} subsurface ocean increases the chance of life on bodies like Europa and Enceladus.|$|E

5|$|The philosopher Kenneth Craik {{had noted}} {{the ability of}} thought to predict events. He {{stressed}} the survival value of natural selection for <b>this</b> <b>ability.</b> This internal working model allows a person to try out alternatives mentally, using knowledge of the past while responding to the present and future. Bowlby applied Craik's ideas to attachment, when other psychologists were applying these concepts to adult perception and cognition.|$|E
5|$|While other bats {{have almost}} {{lost the ability}} to {{maneuver}} on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> {{to digest}} food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey {{much larger than}} their mouths. Their diets include clams and oysters, arthropods, small fish and {{gastropod}} molluscs. Some starfish are not pure carnivores, supplementing their diets with algae or organic detritus. Some of these species are grazers, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky mucus strands that are swept towards the mouth along ciliated grooves.|$|E

5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited to one or two. Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> for single RNA strands.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} roomy compared to the Gemini capsule. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
5|$|Each novel {{centers on}} the family of Atrus, a {{scientist}} and explorer who {{has the ability to}} write special books which serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages. <b>This</b> <b>ability,</b> known as the Art, was practiced extensively by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, who were only mentioned briefly in the original Myst game. The plot of each book reveals more of the Myst back-story and the workings of the D'ni.|$|E

40|$|Autistic Spectrum Disorders are {{characterized}} by significant impairments in social cognition, which consists {{in the ability to}} infer others’ mental states from complex combinations of behavioural cues. Social cognition includes a series of human information processes, specialized in the perception and in the analysis of social stimuli. After {{a brief description of the}} leading research areas that investigate social cognition, this article describes the psychological processes involved in <b>this</b> <b>abilities</b> and its underlie neural networks. Finally, the principal evidence-based intervention to promote social cognition in Autistic Spectrum Disordered are illustrated and discussed...|$|R
5|$|Exile begins 10 {{years after}} the events of Riven, when the Stranger arrives {{at the home of}} Atrus and his wife Catherine. Atrus is a {{scientist}} and explorer who has mastered an ancient practice known as the Art: he can create links to different worlds, called Ages, by writing special books. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> is by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbles after the D'ni city is devastated by a plague. Atrus calls the Stranger to his home to display his newest Age, Releeshahn, which Atrus has designed as a new home for the D'ni survivors.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 Phil Senter {{published}} {{a study on}} dromaeosaurid toes and showed that their range of motion was compatible with the excavation of tough insect nests. Senter suggested that small dromaeosaurids such as Rahonavis and Buitreraptor were small enough to be partial insectivores, while larger genera such as Deinonychus and Neuquenraptor could have used <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> to catch vertebrate prey residing in insect nests. However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. <b>This</b> <b>ability</b> for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|Some {{birds have}} also {{demonstrated}} {{the capacity to}} fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time. The birds tend to exercise <b>this</b> <b>ability</b> depending upon its position relative {{to the outside of}} the flock. This may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock. This adaptation is also known from marine mammals. Communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators. Roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety.|$|E
