40|$|A {{fast-acting}} valve {{includes an}} annular valve seat that defines an annular valve orifice between {{the edges of}} <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> valve seat, an annular valve plug sized to cover the valve orifice when the valve is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> valve plug on and off <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> valve seat. <b>The</b> use of an <b>annular</b> orifice reduces <b>the</b> characteristic distance between {{the edges of the}} valve seat. Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus). The reduced characteristic distance greatly reduces the gap required between <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> valve plug and <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> valve seat for the valve to be fully open, thereby greatly reducing the required stroke and corresponding speed and acceleration of <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> valve plug. <b>The</b> use of a valve-plug holder that is under independent control to move <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> valve plug between its open and closed positions is important for achieving controllable fast operation of the valve...|$|R

40|$|If {{the binding}} {{energy of the}} pulsar’s surface is not so high (the case of a neutron star), both the {{negative}} and positive charges will flow out freely {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> star. <b>The</b> <b>annular</b> free flow model for γ-ray emission of pulsars is suggested in this paper. It is emphasized that: (1). Two kinds of acceleration regions (annular and core) need to be taken into account. <b>The</b> <b>annular</b> acceleration region is defined by the magnetic field lines that cross the null charge surface within the light cylinder. (2). If the potential drop in <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> region of a pulsar is high enough (normally the cases of young pulsars), charges in both <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> and <b>the</b> core regions could be accelerated and produce primary gammarays.

The potential drop in <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> region grows more rapidly than that in the core region. <b>The</b> <b>annular</b> acceleration process is a key point to produce wide emission beams as observed.

40|$|Abstract Geometrical {{properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> gap model, efforts of observational tests {{on it and}} applications of the model to explain the bi-drifting phenomenon are introduced in this paper.

Recently, Wang et al. proposed an independent geometrical method to determine the location for the multi-band radiation regions of PSR B 1055 – 52.

40|$|Non-linear {{analysis}} of smart annular plates using cylindrically orthotropic piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composite Satyajit Panda This article deals with geometrically non-linear finite element {{analysis of}} substrate annular plates integrated with <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> patches of <b>the</b> piezoelectric fiber reinforced composite (PFRC) material. The PFRC material is a cylindrically orthotropic smart composite material in which the piezoelectric fibers are circumferentially reinforced in the epoxy matrix material. <b>The</b> <b>annular</b> PFRC patches are activated by the externally applied voltage across their thickness and act as the distributed actuators for controlling the non-linear deformations of <b>the</b> substrate <b>annular</b> plates. Based on the first-order shear deformation theory and the von Karman non-linear strain–displacement relations, the non-linear governing finite element equations of equilibrium of this electro-elastic coupled problem are derived employing the principle of minimum potential energy. The governing non-linear finite element equations are then solved using direct iteration method. The numerical illustrations reveal the significant control authority of <b>the</b> cylindrically orthotropic <b>annular</b> PFRC patches in counteracting the non-linear deformations of <b>the</b> substrate <b>annular</b> plates. <b>The</b> numerical illustrations also reveal that for the constant circumferential stretch of <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> PFRC patches, if their radial span is {{less than that of}} <b>the</b> substrate <b>annular</b> plate, then <b>the</b> radial location of <b>the</b> <b>annular</b> patches attached to the top surface of the substrate plate plays an important role for their effective control authority.
