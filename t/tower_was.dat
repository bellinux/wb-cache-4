5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the <b>tower</b> <b>was</b> {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The <b>tower</b> <b>was</b> then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, and would have been an effective lookout tower in any future conflict. There appears to have been an attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging the stair turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the <b>tower</b> <b>was</b> carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E

50|$|The used <b>towers</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} for carrying a single circuit {{in a single}} level. As conductors bundle conductors of 4 ropes are used.

As strainers triple <b>towers</b> <b>are</b> used whereby a fourth <b>tower</b> <b>is</b> required for strainers without or with less direction change for keeping the required distance of the outmost conductor to the tower. Also transposing <b>towers</b> <b>are</b> implemented as monopolar towers whereby two additional <b>towers</b> <b>are</b> required.|$|R
