5|$|The {{events of}} the Second Test also {{affected}} the career paths of other players. England's inability to cut down the Australians resulted in the dropping of three of their bowlersWright, Laker and Coxonafter the Lord's Test. Coxon's debut was his only Test match, something believed to be caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit {{proved to be the}} end of his international career.|$|E

5|$|England {{made three}} further changes. Spinner Jack Young and paceman Dick Pollard {{replaced}} the spin pair of Doug Wright and Jim Laker in the bowling department, meaning England would only play one slow bowler. Wright and Laker had struggled {{to penetrate the}} Australian batting lineup in the Second Test, taking match figures of 2/123 and 2/128 respectively. In contrast, Pollard had taken match figures of 4/85 for Lancashire in a match against Australia earlier in the season, and had taken 27 wickets in four county matches in the past fortnight. The selection was seen as being influenced by the fact the Test was being staged at Lancashire's home ground, where Pollard {{was familiar with the}} conditions, and the Australians had a high regard for him. In the month since being dropped for the Second Test in favour of Wright, after taking 1/107 in the First Test, Young had returned to play for Middlesex, taking 27 wickets in five matches. Alec Coxon, the Yorkshire allrounder who made his Test debut in the previous match at Lord's and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by Jack Crapp, a debutant batsman. Crapp had scored 100 not out and 32 for Gloucestershire in the preceding match against the tourists. It was only the third century scored against Australia during the tour, and was part of a season in which Crapp had made four centuries and six half-centuries in 16 matches thus far. Coxon's omission was believed to have been caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Denis Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. O'Reilly interpreted the omission of the Yorkshiremen Hutton and Coxon {{at the expense of the}} Gloucestershire pair of Crapp and Emmett as symptoms of a regional bias in the English selection panel.

500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E

In {{the early stages of}} their career they would often wear a uniform of mechanic's jumpsuits along with masks such as Madonna, Richard Nixon, Darth Vader, an executioner's hood or plastic clown or gimp masks. Bassist Trevor Dunn claimed that initially the reason for the dressing up was to assure anonymity. Regarding their heavy usage of clown and carnival themes, Trey Spruance explained [...] "The thing is, every now and then while driving around aimlessly as teenagers blasting Sodom’s Obsessed by Cruelty album at 3AM, Patton and I would run across these redneck carnivals popping-up overnight on the periphery of town, in the middle of nowhere. We called them “Satanic Carnivals” due to their unexplained phantasmic arrival, and their pointless neon lights no one was around to appreciate as they sparkled up against the dreary fog.

2500|$|Monty, {{who left}} the series in 1986, {{returned}} in 1991 with the hope she would again raise the ratings of the show. She brought Geary back to General Hospital that same year as Luke's look-alike cousin, Bill Eckert. The actor had refused {{to return to the}} show as Luke without Laura. The unpopularity of the Bill Eckert character led to ABC's firing Monty, killing off Bill, and bringing Luke and Laura back, played by Geary and Francis. Upon their return, the actors took more control of the writing for their characters. Geary, along with a writer friend, Irene Suver, developed the story for Luke and Laura's return. Geary's contract allowed him to rewrite his dialogue at his discretion. Francis and Geary were also known for fighting over story direction with executive producer Wendy Riche and the show's writers. The departure of head writer Richard Culliton days after a tense meeting with Geary caused rumors to circulate that the actor threatened to quit if Culliton were not fired. [...] "The meeting did not go well, but I made no ultimatums and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> no violence," [...] Geary said. [...] "I really don't know if I {{had anything to do with}} his departure, but I wouldn't shed any tears if I did." [...] Francis supported Geary in what they considered to be standing up for the [...] "integrity" [...] of their characters and protecting the [...] "Spencer franchise." [...] "Sometimes people think we're difficult because of that, but we're only difficult because we want to live up to the high standards we've set," [...] Francis said.
