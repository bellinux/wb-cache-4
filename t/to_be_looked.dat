5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual of instructions and recipes, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded that the use of BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> at and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial {{should be on the}} road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E

25|$|Beauty {{contests}} {{have been}} criticised for reinforcing {{the idea that}} girls and women should be valued primarily for their physical appearance. This is an especially sensitive issue for naturists as being contrary to the naturist philosophy of body-acceptance of all body types, and that women are not there <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> at. Beauty contests are no longer as common {{as they were in}} the 1950s and 1960s in mainstream naturist venues.|$|E
25|$|Its mystic mode of {{explaining}} some commandments was applied by its commentators to all religious observances, {{and produced a}} strong tendency to substitute mystic Judaism {{in the place of}} traditional rabbinic Judaism. For example, Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> upon as the embodiment of God in temporal life, and every ceremony performed on that day was considered to have an influence upon the superior world.|$|E
25|$|The American {{psychologist}} James H. Leuba (1868–1946), in A Psychological Study of Religion, {{accounts for}} mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he {{considered to be}} necessary if religious psychology were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> at scientifically. Shamans {{all over the world}} and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of drugs leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.|$|E

25|$|The Greeks reimagined the Phoenician god Melqart as Melikertês (Melicertes) {{and made}} him the son of Athamas and Ino. He drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity Palaemon, while his mother became Leucothea. (cf Ino.) At Corinth, he was so closely {{connected}} with the cult of Poseidon that the Isthmian Games, originally instituted in Poseidon's honor, came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> upon as the funeral games of Melicertes. Phalanthus was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in Italy) {{on the back of}} a dolphin, according to Pausanias.|$|E
25|$|By {{a similar}} token, Cocoa {{provides}} a pervasive data manipulation method called key-value coding (KVC). This allows {{a piece of}} data or property of an object <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> up or changed at runtime by name. The property name acts {{as a key to}} the value. In traditional languages, this late binding is impossible. KVC leads to great design flexibility. An object's type need not be known, yet any property of that object can be discovered using KVC. Also, by extending this system using something Cocoa terms key-value observing (KVO), automatic support for undo-redo is provided.|$|E
25|$|Héloïse d'Argenteuil lived {{within the}} precincts of Notre-Dame, {{under the care}} of her uncle, the secular canon Fulbert. She was {{remarkable}} for her knowledge of classical letters, which extended beyond Latin to Greek and Hebrew. Abelard sought a place in Fulbert's house and, in 1115 or 1116, began an affair with Héloïse. The affair interfered with his career, and Abelard himself boasted of his conquest. Once Fulbert found out, he separated them, but they continued to meet in secret. Héloïse became pregnant and was sent by Abelard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> after by his family in Brittany, where she gave birth to a son whom she named Astrolabe after the scientific instrument.|$|E

25|$|Flower {{was also}} a leading {{authority}} on the arrangement of museums. He insisted {{on the importance of}} distinguishing between collections intended for the use of specialists and those designed for the instruction of the general public, pointing out that it was as futile to present to the former a number of merely typical forms as to provide the latter with a long series of specimens differing only in the most minute details. His ideas, which were largely and successfully applied to the museums of which he had charge, gained wide approval, and their influence entitles him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> upon as a reformer who did much to improve the methods of museum arrangement and management.|$|E
25|$|LGE did not {{challenge}} {{the claim that}} the intended and reasonable use of the microprocessor products was to incorporate them into computers, but it claimed that some noninfringing uses existed: they could be sold overseas, as repair parts, or by disabling the features that made them patented. The Court dismissed these arguments. As for disablement, the Court asserted that the disabled device aspects (“features”) rather than the device that remained must have a noninfringing use, so that disabling them would cause them to have “no real use.” As for foreign or replacement use, the legal test <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> to was whether the product would perform the patented method or embody the patented product, not whether the use gave rise to infringement liability.|$|E
25|$|Expanding his horizons he {{went into}} {{producing}} his own shows and often {{had more than one}} tour going on at the same time. He wanted to move on from his circus clowning and reinvented himself as a gentleman. He started to take up politics and would often have Democratic undertones in his shows. He was then regarded as not only a multi-talented performer, but a smart and noble man who was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> up to. He won the affection of many newspapers and publicists including that of a then unknown Mark Twain and Walt Whitman. Mark Twain paid him homage in his description of a circus in Huckleberry Finn, and it is likely a boyhood Twain actually saw Rice perform when his circus came to Hannibal for a show.|$|E

25|$|Several Acts of Parliament {{allowed the}} {{building}} of the Asylum, and statutes have driven the subsequent changes in mental health care. The background {{to the creation of the}} asylum included the 1808 County Asylums Act which was passed after an expensive war against France. This recognised lunatics as being ill, as being held in the wrong institutions and perhaps having a chance to recover if given the right type of treatment. Non-recovery would mean that the insane pauper would always need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> after, which would cost more in the long run. Some parishes were growing in population due to industrialisation, and the existing charitable institutions and workhouses could not cope with the increasing demand. The recognition of insanity as an illness can almost be seen as a cost-saving measure rather than a humane one.|$|E
25|$|An athlete {{may choose}} to leave their sport due to many reasons, either due to an injury or due to them {{reaching}} an old age. If an athlete becomes injured, this must be looked deeper into, as an injury can vary between very subtle and very dangerous. If the athlete loves their sport, they will sometimes hide {{the severity of the}} injury and just wait till it heals slightly {{in order for them to}} get playing as soon as possible, which could cause catastrophic injuries later on in their career. This is why injuries need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> into, because if the injury is too extreme where the athlete can't physically go back to playing their sport, they may get forced to retire in order for them not to damage themselves at a more extreme level, resulting in the athlete experiencing many different feelings, such as alienation, distress or uselessness.|$|E
25|$|The {{inherent}} tendency test theoretically {{has a lower}} threshold {{than the}} real risk test, thereby causing persons who are charged with scandalizing contempt to be convicted for the offence with greater ease. In Shadrake, Justice Loh identified two problems with the inherent tendency test {{as it had been}} set out in Wain. First, the High Court had said that the justification for scandalizing contempt was the prevention of interference with the administration of justice as opposed to protecting public confidence in the administration of justice. The former is the concern of sub judice contempt– that is, contempt relating to a case that is currently under consideration by a court– while it is the latter that is concerned with scandalizing contempt. Secondly, such a test indicates that the words in the impugned publication or speech are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> at alone. This has the effect of ignoring the circumstances surrounding the utterance or publication of the words, and is excessively harsh.|$|E
