5|$|Bergen {{remained}} a quiet base during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the occupation, experiencing only one large Allied air attack. In 1943, the U-boat base added two new bunkers, U-Stützpunkt Prien and U-Stützpunkt Weddingen {{along with a}} shipyard named Danziger Werft.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to fertilize the soil. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Both Regina Margherita and Benedetto Brin {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> their careers, and participated in the peacetime routine of fleet training. Regina Margherita frequently served as the fleet flagship before {{the completion of the}} new s. On 29 September 1911, Italy declared war on the Ottoman Empire, starting the Italo-Turkish War. The two ships saw action during the war in the 3rd Division in the 2nd Squadron. Benedetto Brin took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911, and both were involved in the campaign to seize Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Dogalis {{career was}} uneventful; she {{served with the}} main Italian fleet for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> her career and visited the United States in 1893 {{for the start of}} the World's Columbian Exposition. In January 1908, the ship was sold to Uruguay and renamed 25 de Agosto and later Montevideo. In 1914, the cruiser was {{withdrawn}} from service, but she was not disposed of until 1932 when she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Eddy was widowed {{when she}} was 22 years old and pregnant, after which she {{returned}} to live in her father's home. Her son was raised there for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his life, looked after by domestic staff because of Eddy's poor health. The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy alleges that she allowed him to be adopted when he was four. According to Eddy, {{she was unable to}} prevent the adoption, but McClure's implied otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Henry assumed {{formal control}} of his {{government}} in January 1227, although some contemporaries argued that he was legally still a minor until his 21st birthday the following year. The King richly rewarded Hubert de Burgh for his service during his minority years, making him the Earl of Kent and giving him extensive lands across England and Wales. Despite coming of age, Henry remained heavily influenced by his advisers for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> his rule and retained Hubert as his justiciar to run the government, granting him the position for life.|$|E

5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E
5|$|The fictional Sun Hill suburb {{is located}} in the fictional London borough of Canley in the East End, north of the River Thames. The Borough of Canley is {{approximately}} contiguous to the real-life London Borough of Tower Hamlets, and in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> The Bill, Sun Hill police station was actually stated as being located in Wapping in Tower Hamlets. Sun Hill has a London E1 postcode (the 'address' of Sun Hill police station is given as '2 Sun Hill Road, Sun Hill, Canley E1 4KM'.), which corresponds to the real-life areas of Whitechapel and Stepney.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a booming economy. The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the {{rapid expansion of}} the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> their {{marriage}} were reasonably happy, {{leading to the}} birth of their daughter Vibeke in 1895, but as a result of P.S. Krøyer's periods of mental illness, by the early 1900s they spent ever more time apart. In 1902, Marie began an affair with the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén, with whom she became pregnant in 1905. Thereafter she spent most of her time with Alfvén in Sweden, marrying him in 1912, three years after Krøyer had died in Skagen.|$|E
5|$|The {{interest}} cost is another major item of this company's financing. In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> operation, interest rates were well above market rates. Interest expense stood at around NT$1.3billion per month in April 2008, when THSRC first achieved break-even cash flow, with revenue and cash expenses (which exclude depreciation) both around NT$2.1billion. Interest rates {{fell in the}} first half of 2009, reducing interest expenses and contributing to a reduced net loss.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 14th century Thomas witnessed three charters of Coupar Angus Abbey {{in the company of}} Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, a known opponent of the English crown.|$|E
5|$|Time has {{undergone}} several restorations because of deterioration and decline caused by natural and urban elements. During the late 1990s and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 21st century it underwent repairs that corrected {{many of the}} problems caused by these earlier restorations. Although extensive renovation of the sculpture was completed as recently as 2005, the supporters of Time continue to seek resources for additional lighting, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation has nominated it for further funding.|$|E
5|$|A {{minority}} of Vietnamese are also {{followers of the}} Cao Đài faith which was introduced in 1927. The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> its founding, but a royal decree which outlawed the religion and efforts by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards. A Cao Đài temple was built in Mao Tse Tung Boulevard in 1937, and in the 1960s there were about 70,000 adherents in Cambodia. Cao Đài was outlawed during the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge regimes, but regained official recognition in 1985 and has about 2,000 adherents in 2000.|$|E

5|$|After {{teaching}} at the University of Washington from 1910 to 1912, Morgan completed a Ph.D. in chemistry at the University of Chicago in 1914. Stieglitz supervised her dissertation. She {{may have been the}} only married woman to have received a Ph.D. in chemistry in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband was ill at the time.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} gained success in European club tournaments in the 1980s and 1990s, and {{thousands}} of IFK fans travelled to Hamburg, Barcelona, Dundee, Milan, Manchester and Munich, the supporters gained influence on the club, for example by lending money to the almost bankrupt IFK Göteborg so the team could go to Valencia to play the quarter-final in the UEFA Cup in 1982, or by being the main force behind the move back to Gamla Ullevi in 1992. The early 1990s saw a downward trend in attendance numbers, even though the club was successful on the pitch, but the trend turned in the later years of the decade and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the new millennium brought the club's highest average attendance since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.|$|E

This allowed Rollerblade, Inc. to capitalize and grab a huge percentage of the world market share and almost total dominance of the North American market with their aggressive advertising campaigns and sponsored in-line-only sporting events.|$|R
