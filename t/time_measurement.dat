5|$|The Olympics were of {{fundamental}} religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias {{stood in his}} temple at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops was famous for his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis. The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues. The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks {{as one of their}} units of <b>time</b> <b>measurement.</b> The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing, that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. Each stage is {{discussed in terms of}} its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time-measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E
5|$|The {{family was}} clearly in some {{financial}} difficulty for, in 1604, Mercator's library of some 1000 books was {{sold at a}} public auction in Leyden (Netherlands). The only known copy of the sale catalogue perished in the war but fortunately a manuscript copy {{had been made by}} Van Raemdonck in 1891 and this was rediscovered in 1987. Of the titles identified there are 193 on theology (both Catholic and Lutheran), 217 on history and geography, 202 on mathematics (in its widest sense), 32 on medicine and over 100 simply classified (by Basson) as rare books. The contents of the library provide an insight into Mercator's intellectual studies but the mathematics books are the only ones to have been subjected to scholarly analysis: they cover arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, surveying, architecture, fortification, astronomy, astrology, <b>time</b> <b>measurement,</b> calendar calculation, scientific instruments, cartography and applications. Only one of his own copies has been found—a first edition of Copernicus's De revolutionibus orbium coelestium annotated in Mercator's hand: this is held by Glasgow University.|$|E

5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of the gnomon itself cannot be attributed to Anaximander because its use, {{as well as the}} division of days into twelve parts, came from the Babylonians. It is they, according to Herodotus' Histories (II, 109), who gave the Greeks the art of <b>time</b> <b>measurement.</b> It is likely that he was not the first to determine the solstices, because no calculation is necessary. On the other hand, equinoxes do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during solstices, as the Babylonians thought. As the Suda seems to suggest, it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry, he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equinoxes.|$|E
25|$|As Bob {{does not}} know the basis the photons were encoded in, all {{he can do is}} to select a basis at random to measure in, either {{rectilinear}} or diagonal. He does this for each photon he receives, recording the <b>time,</b> <b>measurement</b> basis used and measurement result. After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis each was measured in. They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different basis, which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{comprehensive}} study concerning the reproducibility {{and stability of}} organic n-type field effect transistors is presented. C 60 based OFETs were chosen to investigate the fabrication reproducibility and the long term stability because C 60 is a high mobility n-type material. We fabricated 48 transistors and each transistor was measured for 24 h inside the glove box. To test for life time stability – long term measurements up to three months have been undertaken. We report about the fluctuations in the device parameters of all investigated transistors by comparing the transfer characteristics, and on/off ratio for short time and long <b>time</b> <b>measurements.</b> C 60 based OFETs showed good reproducibility and stability for short <b>time</b> <b>measurements</b> and a decay for long <b>time</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|R

Some believe that Indiana businesses have lost hours of productive time with out-of-state colleagues because the time quirks are too confusing {{to keep track of}} on a daily basis. The confusion caused to outsiders featured prominently in the plot of an episode of The West Wing in which presidential aides unfamiliar with Indiana's non-observance of DST miss their return flight to Washington, D.C., on Air Force One and express consternation with the variances in the state's <b>time</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The decans were {{a system}} of <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> {{according}} to the constellations. They were led by the constellation Sothis or Sirius. The risings of the decans in the night were used to divide the night into ‘hours’. The rising of a constellation just before sunrise (its heliacal rising) was considered the last hour of the night. Over {{the course of the}} year, each constellation rose just before sunrise for ten days. When they became part of the astrology of the Hellenistic Age, each decan was associated with ten degrees of the zodiac. Texts from the 2nd century BC list predictions relating to the positions of planets in zodiac signs {{at the time of the}} rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis. The earliest Zodiac found in Egypt dates to the 1st century BC, the Dendera Zodiac.|$|E
25|$|The {{travel time}} of the neutrinos had to be {{measured}} by tracking {{the time they were}} created, and the time they were detected, and using a common clock to ensure the times were in sync. As Fig.1 shows, the time measuring system included the neutrino source at CERN, the detector at LNGS (Gran Sasso), and a satellite element common to both. The common clock was the time signal from multiple GPS satellites visible from both CERN and LNGS. CERN's beams-department engineers worked with the OPERA team to provide a travel <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> between the source at CERN and a point just before the OPERA detector's electronics, using accurate GPS receivers. This included timing the proton beams' interactions at CERN, and timing the creation of intermediate particles eventually decaying into neutrinos (see Fig.3).|$|E

25|$|Primary {{clarifier}} effluent {{was discharged}} directly to eutrophic natural wetlands for decades before environmental regulations discouraged the practice. Where adequate land is available, stabilization ponds with constructed wetland ecosystems {{can be built}} to perform secondary treatment separated from the natural wetlands receiving secondary treated sewage. Constructed wetlands resemble fixed-film systems more than suspended growth systems, because natural mixing is minimal. Constructed wetland design uses plug flow assumptions to compute the residence time required for treatment. Patterns of vegetation growth and solids deposition in wetland ecosystems, however, can create preferential flow pathways which may reduce average residence <b>time.</b> <b>Measurement</b> of wetland treatment efficiency is complicated because most traditional water quality measurements cannot differentiate between sewage pollutants and biological productivity of the wetland. Demonstration of treatment efficiency may require more expensive analyses.|$|E
