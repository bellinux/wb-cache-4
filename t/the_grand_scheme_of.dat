25|$|Hoveyda's plan {{to crack}} down on {{corruption}} became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and {{turned a blind eye to}} the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda's inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a cynic. After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an obtrusive system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion that the regime in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue in <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> modernization. In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran's conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier's office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the famed participant in the 1953 coup against Mossadegh, General Fazlollah Zahedi.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Sustainability {{education}} typically {{focuses on}} sustaining life, ecosystems, and humans here on Earth. However, important insights come from considering life beyond Earth. This article presents {{several ways to}} teach astrobiology – the study {{of life in the}} universe – in an undergraduate sustainability course. The concept of habitable zones offers perspective on the temporal and spatial scales of sustainability on Earth and beyond. The prospects for long-term sustainability in the universe suggest expanded conceptualizations of sustainability, leading to a present-day focus on the risk of certain global catastrophes. Finally, the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the fact that none has yet been observed gives us new ways of thinking about our own lives on Earth. In sum, astrobiology offers an understanding of how our current sustainability challenges fit within <b>the</b> <b>grander</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe.

While it's important in <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>of</b> things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive thing he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous when they should be skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a thesis about {{existence}} questions. My contention {{is that the}} metaphysical game, especially the game of existence questions, is rigged.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{paper is to}} show that the {{substantial}} support for ultra-nationalist and regionalist political parties in Western Europe has hindered attempts by the European Union to fully institute ideas of pan-Europeanism within its area. The strength of these parties show that, despite the forewarnings of classical liberalism on the dangers of European nationalisms to European peace and prosperity, separatism and xenophobia are still attractive sentiments to many who seek new solutions to social and economic problems. The traditions of pan-Europeanism and ultra-nationalism/regionalism have thus clashed in today's European political theater, with no sign of settlement. But it is also the position of this paper that there exist several other, largely untapped solutions to this problem of promoting European solidarity and peace that could be called upon. These solutions disregard <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>schemes</b> <b>of</b> liberalism and <b>the</b> "inevitabilities" of realism and try to look at inter-ethnic conflict from fresh perspectives...|$|R
