5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson claims that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> and natural {{explanation for the}} ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from a time past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5|$|The concerto is {{innovative}} in many respects. In {{the first}} movement alone, Mendelssohn departs from the typical {{form of a}} Classical concerto in many ways, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> being the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which also occurs in his First Piano Concerto. Although the first movement is mostly in the conventional sonata form, Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin {{and then by the}} orchestra. Classical concertos typically opened with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of essentially the same material that incorporates the soloist.|$|E

5|$|In February 1793, {{following}} years of rising tension, the French Republic that {{had emerged from}} the French Revolution declared war on the Kingdom of Great Britain. For the Royal Navy one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> concerns was to contain the French Atlantic Fleet based in the massively fortified harbour at Brest in Brittany. This port was ideally positioned to disrupt the merchant shipping convoys that passed through the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay en route to Britain {{from all over the}} world, and it was therefore imperative that the French fleet was not permitted to put to sea without being challenged. For the French, Brest was a vital port for the receipt of grain supplies from the Americas and so French fleets regularly sailed on missions to escort these convoys into the harbour and to disrupt British convoys entering the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|The Anahim hotspot {{is set in}} {{a remote}} {{location}} accessed by a network of logging roads from Quesnel on Highway 97. Because of this, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only. Although not heavily populated, the area is home to forestry operations and the small community of Nazko. The presence of burned wood within Nazko tephra suggests that this area is prone to forest fires caused by volcanic eruptions. Also, if an eruption column were to be produced, it would disrupt local air traffic. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Renewed volcanism is likely to result in the creation of mafic cinder cones. The latest such event occurred with the eruption of Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. However, eruptions of less mafic magma, typical of earlier activity of the Anahim hotspot, cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities {{did their best to}} respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices {{for the remainder of the}} medieval period.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> {{probable}} <b>immediate</b> {{influence on}} the strip was Welsh Rarebit Tales (1902) by Harle Oren Cummins.

5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} {{communities around the}} bay transformed during the 20th century. Following the devastating 1900 hurricane, donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive area communities. This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena an important fruit producer for many years afterward. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. In fact, because the port had opened just before the 1900 hurricane, {{it was able to}} handle Galveston's diverted shipping traffic until the island's damaged port was repaired. Following another hurricane in 1915, the Texas City Dike was built to protect the Texas City ship channel from sediment movement in future storms, thus helping to build confidence in the safety of the port. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> effects of the dike, however, was to increase the salt levels in West Bay, between Galveston and the southwest coastline.|$|E
5|$|The work of Pasteur and Koch did not {{accurately}} reflect the true {{diversity of the}} microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It {{was not until the}} work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>immediate</b> impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation {{of a wide range of}} microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.|$|E
