6000|$|Various other {{anomalies}} in man, {{more or less}} {{analogous to}} the foregoing, have been advanced by different authors, as cases of reversion; but these seem not a little doubtful, for we have to descend extremely low in the mammalian series, before we find such structures normally present. (41. A whole series of cases is given by Isidore Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, 'Hist. des Anomalies,' tom, iii, p. 437. A reviewer ('Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,' 1871, p. 366) blames me much for not having discussed the numerous cases, which have been recorded, of various parts arrested in their development. He says that, according to my theory, [...] "every <b>transient</b> <b>condition</b> of an organ, during its development, {{is not only a}} means to an end, but once was an end in itself." [...] This does not seem to me necessarily to hold good. Why should not variations occur during an early period of development, having no relation to reversion; yet such variations might be preserved and accumulated, if in any way serviceable, for instance, in shortening and simplifying the course of development? And again, why should not injurious abnormalities, such as atrophied or hypertrophied parts, which have no relation to a former state of existence, occur at an early period, as well as during maturity?) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the film thickness values {{is very important in}} lubricated contacts to verify the lubrication conditions. Optical interferometry {{is one of the most}} used methodologies for film thickness and shape determination of Elastohydrodynamic-lubricated contacts. An image processing programme has been developed for the analysis of white light interferograms. The programme, based on the analysis of the hue channel, has been developed in order to process big amounts of images, as often generated under <b>transient</b> <b>conditions.</b> The measurement range is currently limited to a maximum film thickness of 0. 7 [*]m. The programme has been used for analysing several images recorded in tests carried out with a ball on disc contact under steady-state as well as <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> for different velocities and slide-to-roll ratios. Under <b>transient</b> <b>conditions,</b> the entraining velocity is varied with a sinusoidal law for two different frequencies. The results obtained evidenced an asymmetric reduction of the film thickness when increasing the percentage of sliding, both for stationary and <b>transient</b> <b>conditions.</b> Under <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> with increasing test frequency, film thickness loops of increasing amplitude have been found that reduce their amplitude more when the ball is running faster than the disc.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effect of}} {{different}} slide-to-roll ratios has been experimentally investigated {{under steady state}} and <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> using a steel ball {{in contact with the}} plane surface of a glass disc. Under <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> the entraining velocity has been varied with a sinusoidal law at two different frequencies. Measurements of the friction force and film thickness using optical interferometry have been made. For the same working conditions, different friction coefficient trends found for positive and negative slide-to-roll ratios can be related to different film thickness values and shapes. The combination of different thermal effects could be a possible explanation for the obtained results...|$|R

50|$|Systems can {{be defined}} as dynamic or non-dynamic in an {{equilibrium}} state. Besides the usual <b>transient</b> <b>condition,</b> where at least one quantity changes with time, stable dynamic systems may be in a steady state condition or equilibrium state where the system is at rest. This special condition is possible after sometime, when all input and output quantities are and remain constant. The relation between input and output quantities for a system in a steady state condition is called “Static Transfer Response of the Dynamic System”. Dynamic systems {{can be defined}} as static and transient, while this is seemingly contradictory, this indicates that the system is always a dynamic system, even if it remains momentarily in a steady state condition. The opposite of dynamic is not static but non-dynamic.|$|E
50|$|After {{exclusion}} of coeliac disease and wheat allergy, the subsequent step for {{diagnosis and treatment}} of NCGS is to start a strict gluten-free diet to assess if symptoms improve or resolve completely. This may occur within days to weeks of starting a GFD, but improvement may also be due to a non-specific, placebo response. Recommendations may resemble those for coeliac disease, for the diet to be strict and maintained, with no transgression. The degree of gluten cross contamination tolerated by people with NCGS is not clear but {{there is some evidence that}} they can present with symptoms even after consumption of small amounts. It is not yet known whether NCGS is a permanent or a <b>transient</b> <b>condition.</b> A trial of gluten reintroduction to observe any reaction after 1-2 years of strict gluten-free diet might be performed.|$|E
