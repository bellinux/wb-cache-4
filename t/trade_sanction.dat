40|$|The {{ability of}} {{creditors}} to impose <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> {{has been one}} of the workhorse arguments to explain why governments repay foreign creditors. Although sovereign defaults are associated with declines in the defaulting country trade, the absence of explicit <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> following defaults in recent decades is troublesome. One way in which the <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> argument is reconciled with this evidence is to argue that creditor countries are punishing defaulting countries through sub rosa actions that disrupt their trade. Is this the case? Are <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> (understood in a broad sense) causing the declines in trade? Using a gravity model framework we devise an empirical strategy to evaluate this issue. It is based on the idea that if <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> are causing the declines, bilateral trade with creditor countries should fall more than trade with other countries. We find that sovereign defaults are associated with a decline in overall trade for the defaulting country. However, in the aftermath of defaults, there seems to be no evidence of a larger decline in bilateral trade with creditor countries affected by the default. This would imply that the declines are not due to punishments imposed by these creditor countries. The analysis does not yield evidence of broader punishment strategies including a league of major creditors (not just those affected by the default) either. These results would contradict the predictions of the <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> theory of sovereign borrowing...|$|R

The authority of the USTR to target trading partners of the United States for their unsatisfactory protection of United States intellectual property rights comes from the Special 301 provision of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The Special 301 provision is designed to use the threat of unilateral retaliation by the United States to pressure its trade partners to reform their currently deficient intellectual property practices. The idea is the carrot and the stick, where the carrot is the right to export to the United States as a most favored nation, and the stick is the <b>trade</b> <b>sanction.</b> This paper will trace and analyze the interaction between the United States and Taiwan in the process of resolving disputes on intellectual property protection, and will discuss the implications of Taiwan 2 ̆ 7 s experience, which can be useful for understanding conflicts over intellectual property protection in other countries...|$|E

Even if a given sanction does not constitute a legal impediment justifying the defaulting party’s exemption from liability, the risk of penalty that this party would incur if it were to perform the contract in breach of the sanction may justify an adaptation of the contract. The heavier the penalties and the longer a sanction’s term, the more efficient the sanction, if not in achieving its ultimate political goal, certainly in preventing the performance of contracts under the initially agreed terms...|$|E

Using conventional general equilibrium analysis, it is possible to derive comparative static conclusions about the relative effects of financial and <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions.</b> In broad terms, under the small country assumption, the burden of financial sanctions resides in a decrease in national income through an income effect, whereas <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> reduce national income through a mechanism involving both income and substitution effects.

40|$|Some {{developed}} countries have used unilateral <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> against governments that have allegedly {{been engaged in}} gross {{violations of human rights}} as a tool to force such governments to comply with basic human rights standards. Even though unilateral <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> might be targeted against governments that grossly violate human rights, such measures have unintended consequences on the general population who live in the target country. In many cases, the general population suffers as a result of such sanctions rather than the public officials who are the targets. Hence, the effectiveness of such measures in meeting the desired result is questionable. Such measures have been utilized by countries that are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) thereby raising the issue of the legality of such measures under the WTO rules. The two main issues that surround unilateral <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> are thus the legality of such measures under the WTO rules and the effectiveness of the measures to meet the desired result. I argue that unilateral <b>trade</b> <b>sanctions</b> on grounds of human rights violations are neither permissible under the WTO rules nor effective weapons to achieve the goals (i. e. forcing governments to comply with basic human rights standards) ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{interaction}} between credit markets, trade sanctions and the incidence of child labour in a two good, two period model with unequally wealthy households. Compared to financial autarky, a domestic credit market leads to unambiguously less child labour among borrowers (who {{are likely to be}} households with low parental income). However, child labour among lenders may increase.

40|$|Chapter 1 {{studies the}} {{interaction}} between inequality and house prices using an incomplete market heterogeneous agent model. The model links cross-sectional household portfolio saving decisions to housing market outcomes, contributing to the housing literature by illustrating a new price formation mechanism in which the investment motive among the wealthy plays a key role. A quantitative application of the theory rationalizes puzzling phenomena in China – notably, its recent substantial housing boom accompanied by rising savings rates. The theory in this paper shows that market frictions can have differential impacts cross-sectionally, increasing the risk of an explosion of inequality. This adds {{to the understanding of}} a broader topic: how inequality and macroeconomic forces can interact. Chapter 2 explores the welfare and distributional effects of fiscal uncertainty in a neoclassical stochastic growth model with incomplete markets, where households face uninsurable idiosyncratic risks in their labor income and discount factor processes. Aggregate uncertainty arises from both productivity and government purchases shocks. Starting from an initial situation calibrated to key features of the U. S. economy, we eliminate government purchases shocks but keep the aggregate productivity process. We then evaluate the distributional consequences of the elimination of fiscal uncertainty and find, in the baseline case, welfare gains that decline with private wealth holdings. Chapter 3 offers new theoretical and empirical insights into the effect of sovereign defaults on trade. We contend that sovereign debt renegotiation is associated not with <b>trade</b> <b>sanction</b> but with trade benefit between debtor countries and creditor countries. We find empirical support for the argument from the changes in trade share after debt renegotiations as well as the Aid-for-trade statistics. We build a two-country DSGE model with incomplete market to explain why <b>trade</b> <b>sanction</b> is not observed. We reason that creditors lower trade costs with debtors in hope to collect the remaining debt during debt renegotiations. The adjustment, in turn, affects debtors' default decisions. The model departs from the existing literature on sovereign defaults by introducing the strategic interaction between debtors and creditors. We solve the model numerically to determine the optimal trade costs given different combinations of debt and income levels...|$|E
40|$|The Cuban-American lobby {{successfully}} influenced Congress {{and various}} presidential administrations {{from the early}} 1980 s until nearly {{the end of the}} century on U.

Although two major events, the passage of the <b>Trade</b> <b>Sanction</b> Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, and the Elián González affair of the same year, dramatically reduced the power of this conservative ethnic interest group, its influence continued during the George W.

Despite the lobby’s active role, since 2008 the opposition of several political actors towards the sanctions regime, such as the agribusiness lobby, the administration of Barack Obama, and a significant number of Congressmen from both major parties, created an environment of major competition between two camps with distinct policy agendas.
