40|$|Muscle {{tissue is}} sampled during Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) {{operations}} to identify victims by DNA analysis. The tissue is preserved to prevent DNA degradation {{and improve the}} chances of obtaining good short tandem repeat (STR) profiles. Biological samples are normally preserved at low temperatures. However, refrigeration {{may not always be}} readily available in the field. Therefore, alternative preservation methods that do no require refrigeration would be useful. Because DVI operations often occur in remote locations under adverse conditions, these alternative methods should ideally make use of substances that are inexpensive, non-toxic and readily available in the field (or easily transportable). Human muscle tissue was stored in a number of preservatives at 35 °C to simulate the conditions that may be encountered during DVI operations in warm conditions. The tissue was stored for up to one month, to represent {{the amount of time that}} may be required to transport the samples back to the laboratory. DNA was quantified using Quantifiler™ Human DNA Quantitation Kit (Applied Biosystems) and profiled using AmpFℓSTR® Identifiler® PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems) to determine the success of each method. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>preservatives</b> were successful under the conditions of the study when sampling DNA directly from the tissue and full STR profiles were obtained after one month’s storage: 1) DMSO-EDTA-NaCl, 2) 70 % ethanol, 3) DNA Genotek Tissue Stabilising Kit, 4) Biomatrica® DNAgard™, and 5) oven drying. DNA could also be extracted directly from aliquots of the DNA Genotek Tissue Stabilising Kit and Biomatrica® DNAgard™ preservatives, giving them an advantage over other methods because the tissue did not require handling. Sodium chloride was shown to be less successful than these methods but still produced full DNA profiles after storage for one month...|$|E
40|$|The {{perishability}} of mild cured herring products demands special precautions as to temperature during curing to acertain {{the right}} degree of taste and texture. With appropriate consideration of transport and «shelflife» before consumption {{it would be}} of certain advantage to have a quick and simple method in hand {{to be able to}} control the curing process and chose with accuracy the time when the right degree of curing is reached. An earlier work by the same author published in the Series of Technological Research concerning the Norwegian Fisheries, vol. 2 no. 10, undertook to establish figures {{to find out if the}} development of trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) which is considered as the difference between total volatile nitrogen and TMA-N, compared with an organoleptical estimation of the product could give figures exact enough to form a basis for judgement of the different stages of the curing. The investigations appeared to give a positive answer to the question as far as the analytical figures were found to coincide fairly well with the organoleptical test. As the analytical figures will naturally vary with the special forms of curing (mild salt curing with or without vinegar, salt and sugar curing etc.) it will be necessary later to establish the figures for these curing methods also. The individual variation in TMA values for herring will be of no importance when the brine is analysed, but will give a reliable average value. The Conway Diffusion method is a simple and satisfactory method as to speed and accuracy when applied to the analysis of a large number of samples simultaneously. The present publication is a continuation of the previous one and tries on hand of the same analytical method to establish figures which could enable one to judge the action and effect of different preservatives on mild cured herring products stored at elevated temperatures. The values for TMA-N, which is formed by the action of TMO splitting enzymes formed by certain bacterias active on saltwater fish and form a representative part of the bacterial flora also of salt cured herring, is thought to give an index of the bacterial activity. The difference between total volatile nitrogen and TMA-N which is 95 % ammonia is presumed to give an index of the overall enzymatic activity. Compared with an organoleptical judgement the graphical curves showing the development of NH 3 -N and TMA-N during storage at + 37 ° C of herring in brine with different added preservatives seem to give a reliable picture of the difference in effectiveness of the preservatives. The herring with 8 % salt, 6 % sugar and 0, 8 % acetic acid content was placed in a jar and covered with 10 % salt brine. The pH of the brine being as an average 5, 0. The preservative was then added and the jar was allowed to stand for two days at + 10 ° C to allow for even distribution and penetration of preservative into the fish before being stored at + 37 ° C. Samples were taken at regular intervals. <b>The</b> <b>following</b> <b>preservatives</b> were tried: (The figures are percentage of total content of the jar). A. Benzoic acid sodium 0, 2 %. B. Benzoic acid sodium 0, 2 % + ocylgallat 0, 015 %. C. Nipacombin 0, 1 %. D. Hexamethylenetetramine 0, 1 %. F. Herring previously spiced with 1, 4 % of a commercial mixture of spices with added sodiumnitrite (0, 25 % of weight of the herring.) The action of the preservatives on account of the analysis of NH 3 -N and TMA-N was estimated as follows: A. Showing good proteolytic inhibiting action but poor bacteriostatic action. B. A pronouncedly stronger effect than A on the enzymatic as well as on the bacterial activity. C. The bacteriostatic effect is equal to B but as an enzym inhibitor it is noticeably inferior to A and B. D. The evaluation of the action of hexamethylenetramine is influenced by the splitting off of ammonia in an acid medium. As demonstrated by a blind test a solution of 0, 1 % hexamethylenetetramine in 0, 7 % acetic acid splits off 26 mg of NH 3 -N/ 100 ml. Allowing for an adequate reduction of the registered values for NH 3 -N in D the effect as an enzyme inhibitor appears very good. The bacteriostatic effect is not less than B and C and appears similarly good in comparison. The effect of the preservative is thought to be due at least in part to the liberated equivalent of formaldehyde. F. An apparent prolonging effect of the spice-mixture on storage life of the herring. The effect of the preservatives on the rancidity of the herring fat was analysed through the Kreis red values. C and F showed the lowest values and no rancid odour. B showed a much lower value than A and no rancid odour. A and D were pronouncedly rancid and the Kreis values were from two to three times that of the others. A later publication will demonstrate along similar lines the effect of preservatives and combinations of preservatives on herring cured without acid...|$|E
40|$|Blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) are primary colonisers of cadavers; {{the ages}} of the eldest {{immature}} stages can be used to estimate minimum post-mortem interval (PMI). These estimates are obtained using calliphorid larvae, for which there are established and reliable preservation protocols and age estimation methods. The opposite is true for pupae; non-standardised crime-scene collection and preservation methods are employed, resulting in poorly preserved specimens for age estimation, which is often conducted using limited and inadequate research data. This has hindered the use of this sedentary, long-lasting stage of the blowfly lifecycle in PMI estimation. A multidisciplinary approach to age estimation of Calliphora vicina pupae was explored, including development of standard preservation protocols, with the aim of improving PMI estimation. Initial work involved the development of standardised egg collection protocols for the purpose of minimising variation in lifecycle length and precocious egg occurrence. This enabled quantification of pupal age error, which was subsequently applied to developmental timelines. Multiple preservation protocols were then trialled on pupae with the aim of retaining native morphological form and nucleic acid integrity for species identification and proposed age estimation methods. Optimal preservation methods for each analysis were suggested and <b>the</b> <b>following</b> universal <b>preservative</b> protocol proposed: pupae are pierced, hot-water-killed, and stored in 80 % ethanol at - 20 °C. Three methods of pupal age estimation were developed using changes in external morphology, histology and temporal gene expression. The external morphological development of 23 features was recorded from 1494 pupae. These data was used to create a Pupal Age Estimator tool, comprising a manual age-range correlation method and a regression equation for age estimation. Blind sample analysis indicated that age could be estimated to within 23 hours at 22 °C, approaching the observed natural variation range. Internal morphological development of 42 pupae sampled at 24 -hourly intervals was examined using histology and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Six additional features were identified as suitable age markers, however full analysis was limited by the inherent tissue loss due to sectioning and the low resolution of OCT. Finally, temporal gene expression levels of 42 pupae (selected at 24 -hourly intervals) were quantified using qRT-PCR. Expression ratios were calculated between three developmentally expressed genes (Ecr, LSP- 2 and Trp) and two housekeeping genes (EF 1 α and RP 49). Regression analysis of these data indicated age estimation was possible to approximately 23 hours at 22 °C. It can therefore be considered that the reliability and precision of PMI estimation using the C. vicina pupal stage is much improved from that possible at present. Pupal age estimation is critically dependent on appropriate preservation, now facilitated by the proposed standard protocols and by combining all age estimation methods presented here, a multidisciplinary approach can estimate C. vicina pupal age to within 23 hours at 22 °C.
