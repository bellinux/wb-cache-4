40|$|In {{order to}} design {{equipment}} for improved processing of wild pistachio (Pistacia vera L.), {{some of the}} engineering properties were determined {{as a function of}} moisture content. The average length, width and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> wild pistachio <b>nuts</b> at 5. 83 % moisture content (w. b.) were 13. 98, 8. 76 and 7. 25 mm, while the corresponding values of kernels at 6. 03 % moisture content (w. b.) were 11. 07, 5. 92 and 4. 83 mm, respectively. The bulk and true densities <b>of</b> wild pistachio <b>nut</b> and kernel increased with increase in moisture content, while porosity decreased. At all moisture contents, the static coefficient of friction was the highest for wild pistachio nut and kernel on rubber and the least for glass. The results of this research indicated that the filling and emptying angle <b>of</b> repose <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> and kernels increased as the moisture content increased in the range studied...|$|R
40|$|Poka-yoke is {{a method}} in a lean {{manufacturing}} process that use sensor or other devices to avoid and eliminate product defects by preventing, correcting or drawing attention of human errors. The aim of this project is to design, develop and analyze Poka-yoke system for nut identification to defect prevention. The development Poka-yoke systems start with construct programming using Arduino IDE software and microcontroller ATmega 328 is used as interface between the system and hardware. Next process is to build and implement the hardware using two proximity sensor named sensor 1 and 2 and trigger system. To validate this system, size and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nut</b> and different specimen’s material are analyzed. Findings shows sensor 1 and 2 and trigger signal are working efficiency by detecting missing nut. It can conclude that Poka-yoke system is very flexible, simple and robust to detect and correct localization mistakes and it helps {{to reduce the number}} of error occurring during the production processes...|$|R
30|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{strength of}} a bolt-nut connector made from wood-based material was evaluated. The thread strength of the wooden bolt-nut connector was tested to select various parameters of the connector {{and the type of}} wood material; the wood materials tested were hard maple, white oak, ebony, glue-laminated bamboo, and densified Japanese cedar. A plane model of wooden threads with various thread angles was also evaluated. The results showed that the maximum failure load of the thread increased with increasing bolt density and connection area, which was calculated from the diameter of the bolt and the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nut.</b> The withdrawal resistance after reaching the maximum load underwent a graded decrease because the bolt threads were broken one by one. In addition, the thread strength depended on the thread angle. In the model with a thread angle of 90 °, compressive deformation in the transverse direction occurred prior to shear deformation along the root of the threads; the model with this thread angle thus had higher strength than those with other angles.|$|R
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{a number}} of physical, mechanical and aerodynamic attributes <b>of</b> acorn <b>nuts</b> grown in Iran at a moisture content of 5. 84 % dry basis (d. b). The mean of major diameter, intermediate diameter, minor diameter and geometric mean diameter were 31. 27, 18. 20, 16. 64 and 21. 89 mm, respectively. Mean values for sphericity and surface area were 68. 29 % and 1462. 73 mm 2, respectively. The true density, bulk density and porosity were 1028. 33 kgm- 3, 512. 62 kgm- 3 and 49. 84 %, respectively. Cracking forces with loading on the lateral axis, vertical axis and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nuts</b> were determined to be 367. 84, 480. 53 and 401. 19 N, respectively. Static friction coefficient on plywood, galvanized steel sheet and fiberglass were 0. 38, 0. 33 and 0. 27, respectively, while the dynamic angle of repose on plywood, galvanized steel sheet and fiberglass were 25. 53 ˚, 21. 74 ˚ and 16. 31 ˚, respectively. The terminal velocity for the nut, kernel and hull were 19. 52, 16. 80 and 4. 07 ms- 1, respectively. These findings provide useful data for the suitable design and development of crop-processing machines such as sorting, grading, grinding, drying and extraction equipments...|$|R
40|$|Walnuts grow {{on large}} trees, {{known for their}} beauty, timber and tasty edible nuts. There are many {{varieties}} of walnuts that vary in hardiness, <b>nut</b> size and <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nut</b> shell. When {{it comes to their}} health benefits, Walnuts definitely are not hard nuts to crack. They contain free radical scavenging compounds like ellagic acid, juglone and certain phytosterols that support the immune system and appear to have anti-cancer properties. Walnuts have higher contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids including α-Linolenic acid, than do other nuts which may give walnuts additional anti-atherogenic and cosmetic value. It was found in clinical trials that walnut consumption in the amount of two to three servings per day consistently decreased total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Linolenic acid and Linoleic acids present abundantly in walnuts are crucial for maintaining skin functions such as regulation of transepidermal water loss and anti- inflammatory action. The beneficial action of walnut oil on skin is known for centuries and is widely used in cosmetic industry. The walnut oil is a component of dry skin creams, anti-wrinkle and anti-ageing products as it possesses moisturizing property as well as free radical scavenging capacity. Besides, they also exhibit anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-stress, anti-ageing and Hepatoprotective activities. “Walnuts are better than cookies, french fries or potato chips, when you need a snack” as they provide rich nutrients. In the light of above, we thought it worthwhile to compile an up-to-date review article on Walnuts covering its synonyms, phytoconstituents, phytopharmacology and medicinal uses...|$|R

40|$|Nuts, {{inflammation}} and insulin resistanceThe beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>nut</b> consumption on cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{have been widely}} documented. These protective effects are mainly attributed to the role <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> in the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins. As chronic inflammation is a key early stage in the atherosclerotic process that predicts future CVD events and {{is closely related to}} the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, many recent studies have focused on the potential effect <b>of</b> <b>nut</b> consumption on {{inflammation and}} insulin resistance. Through different mechanisms, some components <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> such as magnesium, fiber, alpha-linolenic acid, L-arginine, antioxidants and MUFA may protect against inflammation and insulin resistance.

Dirt’s and other extraneous materials were removed from the sampled nuts and oven dried at 80 °C for 16 h. The nuts were physically characterised and pulverised to powder. The proximate, chemical and mineral composition <b>of</b> the <b>nuts</b> was determined in addition to the microbal load and aflatoxin content. The shape of the two species <b>of</b> kola <b>nut</b> varied from flat to oval to spherical. In addition C. nitida had two big cotyledons while C. acuminata had on the average, 3 to 6 cotyledons.

In a previous study, extensive and persistent snap trapping significantly reduced rat populations and depredations on developing macadamia nuts, but {{had little effect}} on subsequent yields <b>of</b> mature <b>nuts.</b> This suggested that macadamia trees may compensate for rat damage, and that commonly used indices based on rodent activity and proportion <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> damaged may overestimate the impact of rodent depredations and exaggerate the effectiveness of control measures.

Both number <b>of</b> <b>nuts</b> per raceme (P = 0. 0001) and total weight of mature kernels per raceme (P = 0. 0001), but not mean weight per mature kernel (P = 0. 90), varied among treatments.
