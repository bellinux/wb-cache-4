5|$|Among the adapiforms, frugivory {{seems to}} have been the most common diet, {{particularly}} for medium-sized to large species, such as Cantius, Pelycodus and Cercamonius. Folivory was also common among the medium and large-sized adapiforms, including Smilodectes, Notharctus, Adapis and Leptadapis. Sharp cusps on <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> some of the smaller adapiforms, such as Anchomomys and Donrussellia, indicate that they were either partly or primarily insectivorous.|$|E
5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This is because <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E

5|$|During growth, through {{thickening}} {{the tooth}} morphology {{changed so much}} that, had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon, <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species.|$|E
5|$|In a 2003 article, Milner {{noted that}} <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> Baryonyx {{were very similar}} to those of the genus Suchosaurus and {{suggested}} that their remains represented the same animal. The type species of the genus, S. cultridens, was named in 1841 based on teeth from Tilgate Forest in Sussex; a second species, S. girardi, was named in 1897 based on jaw fragments and a tooth from Boca do Chapim. In 2007 Buffetaut considered <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> S. girardi {{very similar to those}} of Baryonyx (and S. cultridens) except for the stronger development of the crown ribs, suggesting that the remains belonged to the same genus. Buffetaut agreed with Milner that <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> S. cultridens were almost identical to those of B. walkeri, but with a ribbier surface. The former taxon might be a senior synonym of the latter (since it was published first), depending on whether the differences were within a taxon or between different ones. According to Buffetaut, since the holotype specimen of S. cultridens is one worn tooth and that of B. walkeri is a skeleton it would be more practical to retain the newer name. In 2011 Portuguese palaeontologist Octávio Mateus and colleagues agreed that Suchosaurus was closely related to Baryonyx, but considered both species in the former genus nomina dubia (dubious names) since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic (lacking distinguishing features) and could not be definitely equated with other taxa.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. Teardrop-shaped teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of tooth {{marks in the}} fibula of a Hypacrosaurus specimen inflicted by a bite from <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> a tyrannosaurid indicated that this, and other hadrosaurids were either preyed upon or scavenged by large theropod dinosaurs during the Late Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> Herrerasaurus {{indicate}} {{that it was a}} carnivore; its size indicates it would have preyed upon small and medium-sized plant eaters. These might have included other dinosaurs, such as Pisanosaurus, as well as the more plentiful rhynchosaurs and synapsids. Herrerasaurus itself may have been preyed upon by giant rauisuchids like Saurosuchus; puncture wounds were found in one skull.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E

5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay.

5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between <b>the</b> <b>teeth)</b> <b>of</b> ankylosaur specimens found that the ability for backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries that sauropods like Apatosaurus were too massive {{to support their}} own weight on dry land. It was theorized that they lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. More recent findings do not support this; sauropods are now {{thought to have been}} fully terrestrial animals. A study of diplodocid snouts showed that the square snout, large proportion of pits, and fine, subparallel scratches of <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus suggests it was a ground-height, nonselective browser. It may have eaten ferns, cycadeoids, seed ferns, horsetails, and algae. Stevens and Parish (2005) speculate that these sauropods fed from riverbanks on submerged water plants.|$|E
5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the {{two teeth}} is 11.2mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E

5|$|The {{milk shark}} has a slender build with a long, pointed snout, large, round eyes with nictitating {{membranes}} (protective third eyelids), and no spiracles. On {{each side of}} the head behind the corner of the jaw, there are usually seven to 15 enlarged pores. The nostrils are small, as are the adjacent triangular skin flaps. There are long furrows at the corners of the mouth on both the upper and lower jaws. The tooth rows number 2425 in both jaws. The upper teeth are finely serrated and strongly oblique; the lower teeth have a similar shape, though the serrations are smaller and the tips curve gently upward. <b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> juveniles are smooth-edged.|$|E
5|$|The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in {{comparison}} {{to those of other}} ankylosaurs, and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed cushions of collagen fibers. These were structurally similar to Sharpey's fibers, and were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This would have provided the ankylosaurids with an armor covering which was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by <b>the</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> predators. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>of</b> Patagosaurus are {{reminiscent}} of more derived sauropods. They are similar in morphology to Euhelopus, being concave on one side as well as having crowns with fairly great expansions. They are also similar to Camarasaurus, although the latter genus has less of a concavity and expansion. The teeth also possess marginal denticles on the crown. Based on histological studies, an individual of Patagosaurus would have replaced all its teeth within 58 days, similar to 62 days for Camarasaurus, and 34 days for Diplodocus.|$|E
