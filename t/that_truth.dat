5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes <b>that</b> <b>truth</b> and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|Ivan ends {{his story}} {{deep in thought}} as Vasilisa begins to cry and Lukerya looks on in pain. He parts with the widows and {{continues}} homeward, thinking that his story troubled Lukerya and made Vasilisa weep not because he told it well but because the tale was relevant to them nineteen centuries later. As he rides the ferry to his village, Ivan comes to believe <b>that</b> <b>truth</b> and beauty serve as the connectors of all human history and he is filled with joy and awe at life itself.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues <b>that</b> <b>truth,</b> justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E
50|$|Fitch's {{paradox of}} knowability {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} puzzles of epistemic logic. It provides a challenge to the knowability thesis, which states <b>that</b> every <b>truth</b> is, in principle, knowable. The paradox is that this assumption implies the omniscience principle, which asserts <b>that</b> every <b>truth</b> is known. Essentially, Fitch's paradox asserts that the existence of an unknown truth is unknowable. So if all truths were knowable, it would follow <b>that</b> all <b>truths</b> are in fact known.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the logical}} symbols of a {{language}} (other than quantifiers) are truth-functional connectives <b>that</b> represent <b>truth</b> functions — functions <b>that</b> take <b>truth</b> values as arguments and return truth values as outputs (in other words, these are operations on truth values of sentences).|$|R
40|$|The Church–Fitch argument, or 'paradox' of knowability, {{apparently}} shows <b>that,</b> if all <b>truths</b> are knowable, {{then all}} truths are known. As some truths are unknown, anti-realists who hold <b>that</b> <b>truths</b> must be knowable {{have been at}} pains to block the argument. Here, I consider two such approaches: denying that knowledge distributes over conjunction, and moving to a typed logic. I argue that neither approach works. I first show that a Church–Fitch argument can be run with an assumption weaker than distribution of knowledge over conjunction. I then argue that a modified Church–Fitch argument can be constructed in a typed logic. So neither approach will help those who hold <b>that</b> all <b>truths</b> are knowable. 12 page(s...|$|R
5|$|The term anekāntavāda is {{not found}} in early texts {{considered}} canonical by Shwetambara tradition of Jainism (denied by Digambara tradition as canonical). However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Shwetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira <b>that</b> <b>truth</b> can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine {{is found in the}} Tattvarthasutra of Umasvati, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{has been}} shown by Gödel that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about {{seemingly}} unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in Gödel's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea—manifested by the diagonal lemma—is the basis for Tarski's theorem <b>that</b> <b>truth</b> cannot be consistently defined.|$|E

They claim that by asserting <b>that</b> <b>truth</b> is relative, Protagoras then could say that whatever further theory he proposed must be true.|$|E

Though Yanni said <b>that</b> <b>Truth</b> of Touch was started by experimenting with new sound designs, Allmusic's James Christopher Monger said that the album shows Yanni returning to his instrumental roots, and should appeal to fans of his music from the mid-1990s. Three of fifteen tracks on the predominantly instrumental album included vocals from respective Yanni Voices vocalists.|$|E

James was also a pluralist in that he believed that there may actually be multiple correct accounts of truth. He rejected the correspondence theory of truth and instead held <b>that</b> <b>truth</b> involves a belief, facts about the world, other background beliefs, and future consequences of those beliefs. Later in his life James would also come to adopt neutral monism, {{the view that the}} ultimate reality is of one kind, and is neither mental nor physical.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Amongst {{those who}} feel {{the pull of the}} truthmaker {{principle}} (<b>that</b> <b>truths</b> require for their truth a truthmaker to exist), there is disagreement as to whether it applies to all truths or merely to some distinguished subset. Those in the latter camp, the non-maximalists, argue that ⟨there are no ducks in my bath ⟩ is true not because of something’s existence, but {{because of the lack of}} ducks in my bath. Maximalists, by contrast, insist <b>that</b> <b>truths</b> are made true by something’s existence, and so appear to be committed to strange ‘negative’ entities in their ontology. As a consequence, non-maximalists appear to have a more common-sense ontology than maximalists. But things are not so straightforward. I will argue that if maximalism is committed to strange entities then so is non-maximalism; and if non-maximalism can do without strange entities, then so can maximalism. Either way, the non-maximalist has no ontological advantage over the maximalist. ...|$|R
