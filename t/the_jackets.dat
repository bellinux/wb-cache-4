5|$|Bobby Ross {{came from}} Maryland after winning three ACC titles over four years. Ross' first season at Tech {{experienced}} a severe talent vacuum after Curry's departure, {{and the players}} Ross inherited resisted the changes he demanded. The team only won two games, and Ross contemplated ending his coaching career after a humbling loss to Wake Forest in 1987. Ross decided to remain at Tech and continued to rebuild Tech's program. The turning point came in 1989 with the recruitment of Shawn Jones and several other key freshman. After two seasons and only five total wins, Jones helped <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> rebound {{at the end of}} the 1989 season.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 Yellow Jackets, {{despite being}} {{predicted}} to finish 5th in Coastal Division by ESPN, garnered a 10-2 regular season record (6-2 ACC), including wins over then No. 19 Clemson and No. 9 Georgia {{to finish the}} regular season ranked No. 11 by the College Football Playoff Committee. The highlight of the season came when Georgia Tech defeated the Bulldogs in Athens in an overtime game that featured numerous swings in momentum. After a couple of controversial calls that gave UGA the advantage, the Rambling Wreck fought back, staying with the Bulldogs. With 18 seconds left, the Yellow Jackets delivered 30-yard drive that ended up with Harrison Butker's 53-yard field goal sending the game into overtime. After a 1-yard rushing touchdown by Georgia Tech RB Zack Laskey, the win was clinched by <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> when cornerback D.J. White intercepted UGA quarterback, Hutson Mason. Georgia Tech won the Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division and met No. 4 Florida State in the 2014 ACC Championship Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, losing 37-35. The 2014 appearance marked Georgia Tech's third ACC Championship Game in seven seasons under Paul Johnson. With {{the advent of the}} College Football Playoff, Florida State was chosen in the top four (ranked No. 3), under which circumstance the Orange Bowl selected Georgia Tech, now ranked No. 12, as its replacement to face the No. 7 Mississippi State Bulldogs on December 31, 2014. In the orange bowl game, Justin Thomas led <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> to a dominating 49-34 win over No. 7 Mississippi State. The Yellow Jackets finished the season 11–3, No. 8 in AP poll and No. 7 in the American Coaches Poll.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{successful}} collegiate and professional football players once played for Tech. The school has 48first-team All-Americans and over 150alumni who {{have played in}} the NFL. Among the most lauded and most notable players the school has produced are Calvin Johnson, Demaryius Thomas, Keith Brooking, Joe Hamilton, Joe Guyon, and Billy Shaw. In addition to its players, Tech's football program has been noted for its coaches and its, in many cases bizarre traditions and game finishes. Among the team's former coaches are John Heisman, for whom the Heisman Trophy is named, and Bobby Dodd, for whom the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award and the school's stadium are named. Heisman led the team to the highest-scoring game in American football history, and both Heisman and Dodd led Tech's football team to national championships. Dodd also led <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> on their longest winning streak (8 games) against the University of Georgia, Tech's most time-endured rival.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on <b>the</b> <b>jackets</b> range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton's prowess as {{a runner}} and passer thrilled the Georgia Tech fans. Offensive {{coordinator}} Ralph Friedgen utilized a complex offense with Hamilton that featured option football {{mixed in with}} complex timing routes. Hamilton racked up yardage, touchdowns, and wins for Tech. In 1998, Hamilton and Tech's high powered offense won 10 games and a season ending victory over Notre Dame in the Gator Bowl. Hamilton's senior year {{put him on the}} national stage. He was a leading candidate for the Heisman Trophy against rushing phenomenon Ron Dayne. Hamilton passed for over 3000 yards and rushed for over 700 yards. But while Hamilton dazzled, the Georgia Tech defense was a liability (they allowed around 28 points per game), and may have ultimately cost Hamilton the 1999 Heisman Trophy. In a late-season, nationally televised game against Wake Forest, Tech gave up 26 points and Hamilton threw two interceptions and no touchdowns. As an indirect result, Dayne {{went on to win the}} Heisman (Joe was runner-up). Hamilton's Georgia Tech career ended on a sour note in the 2000 Gator Bowl against the Miami, where <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> lost 28–13. The following season, redshirt junior George Godsey, a more traditional pocket passer, succeeded Hamilton at the helm of Tech's powerful offense. The drop-off was minimal—Godsey continued where Hamilton left off, winning 9 games in 2000 and 8 games in 2001. In 2000, Godsey also led Tech to their third straight victory over the archival Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{weeks after}} Johnson's defeat of rival Georgia, Georgia Tech rewarded Johnson {{with a new}} {{contract}} worth $17.7 million, a 53% raise that made him the second highest paid coach in the ACC before he had even completed {{his first year in}} the conference. In 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to their first win over Florida State in Tallahassee in school history, a 49-44 shootout that featured over 1000 total yards between the two teams. One week later, Johnson defeated No. 4 Virginia Tech 28-23 at Bobby Dodd Stadium. The win broke an 0–17 losing streak to top five opponents at Grant Field in the past 47 years. On October 24, 2009, Johnson led the Yellow Jackets to their first win against the Virginia Cavaliers in Charlottesville, Virginia since 1990. At Duke University Johnson and his team clinched the ACC Coastal Division {{for the first time since}} 2006. Still, Johnson and company could not win their second game in a row over hated Georgia as the Bulldogs upset Tech 30–24 in the final home game of the season in 2009. On December 5 <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> defeated the Clemson Tigers to make them ACC champions, a title that would be vacated on July 14, 2011 due to NCAA infractions. The Yellow Jackets went on to lose to Iowa in the Orange Bowl, 24-14.|$|E

5|$|Crosby put {{together}} a healthy and productive year in 13–14, playing 80 games {{for the first time}} since the 2009–10 season. Crosby finished the season with 36 goals and a league-leading 68 assists. It marked the first time in his career that he led the league in assists. He also finished with a league-high 104 points, winning the Art Ross Trophy for the second time in his career. Crosby and the Penguins finished second in the east to the Bruins, and were matched up with new division rival the Columbus Blue Jackets in the first round. Despite a very back-and-forth series and not a single goal by Crosby, the Penguins defeated <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> in 6 games to advance to a second-round matchup with longtime rival the New York Rangers. Going into their second-round series with the Rangers, Crosby looked to end a long playoff goal drought, which dated back to the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Bruins. After dropping Game 1 at home, Crosby finally broke his goal drought in Game 2, as the Pens tied the series at 1–1 heading back to Madison Square Garden. The Penguins would capitalize on their Game 2 win, taking next two games and destroying the Rangers home ice advantage. However, the Rangers would quickly rebound, winning Game 5 and 6, forcing a Game 7 in Pittsburgh. The Penguins would complete an epic playoff collapse, as they dropped Game 7 to the Rangers, and headed home without a prize for the fifth straight season. The team's collapse prompted Penguins ownership to fire general manager Ray Shero, replacing him with Jim Rutherford, the former general manager of the Carolina Hurricanes. Rutherford's first action as GM was to relieve Dan Bylsma of his duties, and on June 25, he announced that Mike Johnston was hired as new head coach. On May 1, Crosby, along with fellow captains Ryan Getzlaf and Claude Giroux, was named a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. It marked the fourth time in his career Crosby was named a top three finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy, and his first win since 2006–07. Crosby also collected his third Ted Lindsay Award, as the players choice for the best player in the league.|$|E
25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} most notable {{for the amount}} of {{injuries}} <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> incurred. <b>The</b> <b>Jackets</b> lead the league in man games lost with 502. At one point, the injured reserve list consisted of 15 players, including stars Sergei Bobrovsky, Brandon Dubinsky, Jack Johnson, and Ryan Murray. When the team's injured players began to return in late February, they were able to accumulate wins the way they had the previous two seasons and in the process, set a franchise record earning nine consecutive wins. However, the Blue Jackets still finished fifth in the Metropolitan Division and missed the playoffs by nine points despite a 42-35-5 record. On May 20, 2015, Nick Foligno was named the sixth captain in team history. The position had been vacant since Rick Nash was traded to the New York Rangers in July 2012. On June 30, 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> traded centers Marko Dano and Artem Anisimov, along with wingers Jeremy Morin and Corey Tropp, to the Chicago Blackhawks for Brandon Saad. This move was the subject of much controversy in Chicago since Blackhawks General Manager Stan Bowman had publicly said that Saad {{was going to be a}} part of the organization for many years to come. <b>The</b> <b>Jackets</b> also acquired Michael Paliotta and Alex Broadhurst in the trade. <b>The</b> <b>Jackets</b> signed center Gregory Campbell from the Boston Bruins a few days later.|$|E

5000|$|In early 1992, Winchester {{introduced}} the [...] "Black Talon", a newly designed hollow-point handgun bullet which used a specially designed, reverse tapered <b>jacket.</b> <b>The</b> <b>jacket</b> was cut at the hollow to intentionally weaken it, and these cuts allowed <b>the</b> <b>jacket</b> to open into six petals upon impact. <b>The</b> thick <b>jacket</b> material kept <b>the</b> tips of <b>the</b> <b>jacket</b> from bending {{as easily as}} a normal thickness <b>jacket.</b> <b>The</b> slits that weakened <b>the</b> <b>jacket</b> left triangular shapes in the tip of <b>the</b> <b>jacket,</b> and these triangular sections of jacket would end up pointing out after expansion, leading to the [...] "Talon" [...] name. The bullets were coated with a black colored, paint-like lubricant called [...] "Lubalox," [...] and loaded into nickel-plated brass cases, which made them visually stand out from other ammunition. While actual performance of the Black Talon rounds was not significantly {{better than any other}} comparable high performance hollow-point ammunition, <b>the</b> reverse taper <b>jacket</b> did provide reliable expansion under a wide range of conditions, and many police departments adopted the round.|$|R

25|$|The {{seeds for}} this rivalry were planted when the Blue Jackets traded star forward Rick Nash to the New York Rangers for Brandon Dubinsky, {{the latter of}} whom has a {{personal}} feud with Penguins' star centerman Sidney Crosby. Furthermore, this was amplified {{by the arrival of}} longtime Philadelphia Flyers forward Scott Hartnell in Columbus. The 2013–14 NHL realignment saw <b>the</b> <b>Jackets</b> and the Detroit Red Wings move to the Eastern Conference, placing Columbus in the Metropolitan Division with the Penguins. Pittsburgh swept the regular season series against <b>the</b> <b>Jackets,</b> but Columbus, {{on the heels of a}} 93-point season, earned a wild-card playoff berth (only their second in team history), facing the Penguins in the first round of the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs, which the Penguins won in 6 games.

25|$|Despite these playoff {{losses to}} the Penguins, the Blue Jackets have {{in recent years}} gotten the better of Pittsburgh in regular season matchups, leaving the Penguins with a losing record versus Columbus {{over the past two}} years of play.
