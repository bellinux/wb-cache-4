For alcohol calculation the standard deviations and coefficients of variation for literature and our relations were different (literature relations: SD = 7. 37 – 8. 53, CV = 8. 33 – 9. 52 %, our relations: SD = 7. 18 – 13. 94, CV = 7. 96 – 16. 55 %) and they were higher for the <b>total</b> <b>dry</b> <b>extract</b> (literature relations: SD = 16. 39 16. 76, CV = 45. 14 – 49. 49 %; our relations: SD = 13. 70 – 16. 73, CV = 42. 68 – 49. 16 %).

We evaluated two different enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) for the noninvasive evaluation of adrenocortical activity in ground-feeding aardwolves (Proteles cristata) and tested the influence of soil content in aardwolf feces on the interpretation of fecal glucocorticoid metabolite data. Using adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenges for validation, we successfully identified a cortisol EIA suitable for assessing adrenocortical activity in aardwolves. An alternatively tested 11 -oxoetiocholanolone EIA failed to detect a biologically relevant signal after ACTH administration. Although the proportion of inorganic content in aardwolf feces did not alter qualitative conclusions from the endocrine data, the data related to mass of organic content had a larger amount of variance attributed to relevant biological contrasts and a lower amount of variance attributed to individual variation, compared with data related to <b>total</b> <b>dry</b> mass of <b>extracted</b> material.

There were no differences in nutrients (DM, OM, NDF, ADF, CP, starch) ingestion among diets.

The ingathering of the physicochemical characteristics provides information {{that allow the}} standardization of the product and provide safety to the consumer, whereas the rheological characterization in important for the processing. Samples of five commercial brands of strawberry flavored dairy beverages, with ten to fourteen days of manufacture, from three different batches were analyzed in triplicate in order to study the percentage of protein, fat, pH, titratable acidity, <b>total</b> <b>dry</b> <b>extract,</b> fixed mineral residue and lactose. It was performed a colorimetric determination and verification {{of the presence of}} starch. The rheological tests were carried out in a rotational rheometer and the data was adjusted by Herschel-Bulkley’s model. The statistical analysis was executed by an analysis of variance and the Tukey’s test with 5 % significance. The analysis showed that the percentages of lipids of three brands were below the required by legislation. Furthermore, the presence of starch in the composition was detected for all analyzed beverages. Both for the physicochemical and rheological parameters the brands of dairy beverage examined differed between themselves in several parameters. These results indicated the need to establish well-defined identity and quality standards aiming at product quality control and consumer safety improvement...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the study of the {{influence}} of different strains of yeasts on the concentration of organic acids, metallic content, and other physical-chemical parameters from experimental sparkling white wines produced by traditional method (bottle fermented). This study was required due to climatic conditions varying from year to year, generating grape harvests with very high alcoholic potential, and very low values for total acidity. In this case, a Muscat Ottonel grape must was used and passed by a reverse osmosis process. The obtained permeate was mixed with a calculated amount of the concentrate to generate a must with a potential of 10. 5 % (v/v) alcohol, in order o to obtain the base wine for the second fermentation. After fermentation, the wine was treated to get tartaric, protein and microbiological stabilization. For the second fermentation four different strains of yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae were used. Bottle fermentation and storage was performed at a constant temperature of approximately 12 [*]°C. After six months of storage, sparkling wine samples were analyzed. The metal content was determined using AAS method, and organic acid concentration was determined by a HPLC method. The main physical-chemical characteristics were determined (alcohol concentration, total acidity, volatile acidity, <b>total</b> <b>dry</b> <b>extract,</b> free SO 2, total SO 2, density, pH, conductivity) based on OIV methods. The results obtained indicated significant differences of the analyzed parameters...|$|E
40|$|The yeast Brettanomyces/Dekkera {{can cause}} {{important}} spoilage in wines, {{with the production}} of ethylphenols and other off-flavor compounds. This study aimed at determining {{the presence of this}} yeast and the ethylphenols produced by them in Brazilian red wines, establishing their relationship with other chemical characteristics. Isolates of Brettanomyces/Dekkera were quantified by plating 126 samples of dry red wine in selective culture medium, while ethylphenols were analyzed by solid phase extraction and GC/FID. Free and total SO 2, alcohol, <b>total</b> <b>dry</b> <b>extract,</b> residual sugar, total and volatile acidity, and pH were also determined. Brettanomyces/Dekkera was present in 27 % of samples. Ethylphenols were detected in most samples, with amounts higher than the threshold limit of 426 g/L found in 46. 03 % of samples. The majority of wine samples showed inadequate levels of SO 2 and residual sugars, facts that might facilitate microbial spoilage. The passage in barrels and the grape varieties (Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), did not show any influence on the levels of contamination or ethylphenols contents. The prevalence of Brettanomyces/Dekkera and the concentrations of ethylphenols were high considering the sensory impact they can cause. The growth of Brettanomyces/Dekkera was dependent on the levels of SO 2 and alcohol of wines. Knowledge of the contamination, the presence of ethylphenols, and their relationship with the chemical characteristics of wines can entice effective measures to prevent Brettanomyces/Dekkera and contribute to improve the general quality of Brazilian red wines...|$|E
