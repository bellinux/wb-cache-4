5|$|Steve Neal, McNary's biographer, {{describes}} McNary as {{a progressive}} who {{stuck with the}} Republican Party in 1910 even when many progressives left the party in favor of West, a Democrat. McNary backed the Progressive Era reforms (the initiative, recall, referendum, primary elections, and the direct election of US senators) of Oregonian William Simon U'Ren, {{and he was an}} early supporter of public, rather than private, power companies. After West won the election, he chose McNary <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>special</b> legal counsel to Oregon's railroad commission, who urged lower passenger and freight rates. Meanwhile, McNary maintained friendly relations with both progressive and conservative factions of the Oregon Republicans and with West.|$|E

25|$|Goethe's book {{provides}} {{a catalogue of}} how colour is perceived {{in a wide variety}} of circumstances, and considers Isaac Newton's observations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>special</b> cases. Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum, as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe's theory in Remarks on Colour.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{categories}} of monster cards, which are color-coded and vary in the methods {{by which they}} are summoned. Generally, the monsters with more difficult summoning methods will have higher ATK points and better card effects. Normal and Effect monsters can be Normal Summoned, Tribute Summoned, or Special Summoned by card effects. All other types of cards need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Special</b> Summoned by fulfilling the summoning requirements detailed below. Fusion, Synchro, Xyz and Link Monsters are stored in an Extra Deck separate from the Main Deck (where destroyed Pendulum Monsters are also placed). These cards may be resummoned from the graveyard provided they were successfully summoned beforehand, though if they are returned to the Extra Deck, the player will need to fulfill the summoning requirements once more to summon them again.|$|E

25|$|Noah tracks Sylar and Elle {{down at the}} Canfield {{household}} and watches them have sex through the scope of a sniper rifle. Afterwards, he opens fire, misses, and then breaks {{into the house and}} shoots at them with a Company handgun, hitting Elle in the left thigh and forcing them into a retreat. While looking for them, Noah receives a call from Sandra in which she informs him that Claire is hospitalized. Instead of immediately rushing to the hospital, Noah follows a trail of Elle's blood to a local grocery store. After luring him into a back room, Sylar jumps him from behind, but he is once again outmatched without his powers against Noah's fighting skills. Ultimately, after tossing the ultimate insult ("Poor Gabriel. You always wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>special.</b> Now look at you; you're nobody."), he slits Sylar's throat with a box cutter. When he returns home, Claire is understandably angered with him for focusing on Sylar rather than rushing to the hospital. When Claire reveals that she had died in the hospital, Noah realizes something awful: if Claire's powers are back, then so are Sylar's. Indeed, Sylar and Elle, newly empowered, have made it to the Bennet {{household and}} are holding Sandra and Lyle hostage. Sylar telekinetically disarms Noah, pins him to the wall, and begins to strangle him with his powers. Claire desperately swears to go with Sylar in exchange for leaving her family alone, but Sylar is unsatisfied with that and begins to cut into Noah's neck, clearly intent on decapitating him. Fortunately, Hiro Nakamura arrives, teleports Sylar and Elle away, and then time-travels with Claire back to the day when his father first assigned Noah to protect her.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} {{university in}} 1996, Edwards made a short monster movie set in suburbia.

Considering that the film would have to be low-budget, Edwards decided to embrace the found footage style of The Blair Witch Project, and mix that element with his original concept. After learning about Cloverfield similar premise, he abandoned this idea and moved on to a concept where a [...] "war [...] going on somewhere {{on the other side of}} the world, and no one cares".|$|E

500|$|Despite initial reports stating guest actress Theresa Russell {{would be}} playing a {{recurring}} character, the episode marked her only appearance as an adult version of the character. Russell plays Rebecca Kibner, a former test subject and love interest of Walter's; a younger version played by actress Tegan Moss {{is seen in the}} season premiere [...] "A New Day in the Old Town". In the DVD audio commentary, the writers explained that when they were looking for an actress to play the character, the casting director April Webster, acting on Jeff Pinkner's instructions, called Kibner both [...] "a blessing and a curse," [...] because the writers wanted to explore the burden of what it meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>special.</b> One writer explained Kibner and Walter's past relationship had not been a long term affair, but instead more of a [...] "little fling". The episode also marked the first appearance of Canadian actor Ryan McDonald as recurring character Brandon Fayette, a Massive Dynamic scientist. According to the episode's writers, the character is based on a man who works at the production company Bad Robot.|$|E
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>special</b> on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E

2500|$|Significant {{analytical}} work of Hausdorff {{occurred in}} his second time at Bonn. In Summation methods and moment sequences I in 1921, he developed a whole class of summation methods for divergent series, which today are called Hausdorff methods. In Hardy's classic Divergent Series, an entire chapter {{is devoted to the}} Hausdorff method. The classical methods of Hölder and Cesàro proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>special</b> Hausdorff method.

In Moment problems for a finite interval of 1923 he treated more special moment problems, such as those with certain restrictions for generating density , for instance [...] Criteria for solvability and determination of moment problems occupied Hausdorff for many years as hundreds of pages of studies in his Nachlass attest.|$|E

60|$|When we {{say that}} the force which retains the planets in their orbits is {{resolved}} into gravity, or that the force which makes substances combine chemically is resolved into electricity, we assert in the one case what is, {{and in the other}} case what might, and probably will ultimately, be a legitimate result of induction. In both these cases motion is resolved into motion. The assertion is, that a case of motion, which was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>special,</b> and to follow a distinct law of its own, conforms to and is included in the general law which regulates another class of motions. But, from these and similar generalizations, countenance and currency have been given to attempts to resolve, not motion into motion, but heat into motion, light into motion, sensation itself into motion; states of consciousness into states of the nervous system, as in the ruder forms of the materialist philosophy; vital phenomena into mechanical or chemical processes, as in some schools of physiology.|$|E
