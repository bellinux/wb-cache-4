40|$|Following {{six decades}} of fastest {{economic}} and technological development in history, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crises</b> have been triggered by collapse of unsustainable financial systems. The extent of these contemporary interconnected crises of economic, societal, environmental, financial and other systems {{has also shown}} a need to reevaluate the measurement of sustainable development. Although the existing sustainability indicators are very complex, interdisciplinary and multidimensional, they could neither predict {{the onset of the}} crises nor their extent. Therefore relations between indicators of sustainability, technological development and happiness are presented and discussed also in terms of some of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crises.</b> Some possible solutions are also presented, which could be used for better measurement of life quality and could potentially replace the Gross Domestic Product as the prevailing measure of development...|$|R

25|$|On 21 November 2011 Schäuble {{said the}} euro would emerge {{stronger}} from <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crisis,</b> and ultimately all non-members would be convinced to sign up. He said Great Britain would eventually join the euro (but that he respected Britain's decision {{to keep the}} pound). On a British exit from the EU, Schäuble argued in 2014 that Britain's EU membership was particularly important for Germany as both countries share a market-oriented reform approach in many economic and regulatory questions.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>crisis</b> has {{its origins}} in the Fiji coup of 2000. The 2000 coup was aimed at the {{multi-ethnic}} Government led by Mahendra Chaudhry. The proponents of the coup were an armed faction not {{closely associated with the}} military, who opposed their actions. After Bainimarama declared martial law and resolved the crisis by force, an interim government was sworn in, headed by current prime minister Laisenia Qarase. The Prime Minister was democratically elected in elections in 2001 and 2006, and has since begun to take actions that have provoked the displeasure of the military.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012 in an International Herald Tribune op-ed, Harvard University {{professor}} and director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation Hal S. Scott called for a global response to the Euro-zone crisis. He wrote that two failures to address European problems around German power had led to world wars in the 20th century and that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crisis</b> was also beyond the capacity of Europe, with Germany again at the center, to solve on their own. Accepting that leadership transitions were underway in both China and America, Scott called on all concerned—with Japan included with China and America—to begin organizing a global restructuring through the International Monetary Fund with possibly a Bretton Woods II conference as part of the process.|$|E

25|$|On June 26, 1939, the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office {{reported}} to the British Cabinet {{that the only way}} of ending the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crisis</b> with Nazi Germany threatening Poland made it militarily unadvisable. If the bulk of the Royal Navy was sent to Singapore, Britain {{would not be able to}} impose a blockade on Germany should the Reich invade Poland, and as such one of Britain's main deterrents against Adolf Hitler invading Poland would be removed, something that would encourage Hitler to choose war. In addition, Chamberlain faced strong pressure from the French not to weaken British naval strength in the Mediterranean given the danger that Benito Mussolini might honor the Pact of Steel should war break out in Europe. The Pact of Steel signed in Rome in May 1939 was an offensive-defensive German-Italian alliance, which meant there was a real possibility that if war with Germany began, Italy would join in.|$|E
25|$|Through the Christian {{community}} in Japan, Pessoa was {{informed of the}} intrigues against him and promptly prepared for defence and departure. He prepared a large quantity of hand grenades and ammunition aboard the ship, but due to the large size of the cargo, the ship {{was not ready to}} sail until after New Years Day in 1610, whereas previous Macanese vessels usually returned before Christmas. While the ship was being loaded, Arima tried to entice Pessoa to come ashore with offers of hospitality, saying that he had been sent to Nagasaki only to negotiate silk prices, and that the high officials in Sunpu only wanted Pessoa to give his account of the Macau events in person—he would be pardoned as a foreigner even if he was found guilty. Many Portuguese believed Arima, but not Pessoa, who knew Arima had assembled a force of 1200 samurai against him. Pessoa now would not go ashore even for Mass, and ordered his crew to come aboard the carrack to set sail. However, this was delayed as some crew believed that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crisis</b> was merely Pessoa's personal feud and dragged their feet, while most who had wanted to embark were obstructed by Japanese guards. By the time Arima attacked the carrack on January 3, only about 50 Europeans were on board with some black slaves and lascars.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the financial instability hypothesis of Hyman P.

The second part of the bachelor thesis applies the hypothesis to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> financial <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> whole thesis refers to the general discussion about relations of the Minsky's hypothesis to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> financial <b>crisis</b> and to the fall of the insurance company AIG Corporation. The second part concludes that many relevant parts of Minsky's hypothesis {{can be applied to the}} recent financial crisis but important differences of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> financial system to the system in Minsky's times should be awared of. There are two most important differences: changes in risk management and new financial instruments. At the end, the thesis discusses the implications of these differences for applicability of the hypothesis on <b>the</b> <b>current</b> financial <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> thesis regards the fact that the recent financial crisis is caused by rational behaviour of economic agents and not by exogenous forces as the most important lesson to learn from the financial instability hypothesis of Hyman P.

40|$|In {{the paper}} we {{test for the}} {{different}} reactions of stock markets to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> financial <b>crisis.</b> We focus on Central European stock markets, namely the Czech, Polish and Hungarian ones, and compare them to the German and U.

The energy of a scale is proportional to its wavelet variance. The decompositions of the tested stock markets show changes in the energies on the scales during <b>the</b> <b>current</b> financial <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate {{that each of the}} tested stock markets reacted differently to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> financial <b>crisis.</b> More important, Central European stock markets seem to have strongly different behaviour during the crisis. ewavelet analysis, multiresolution analysis, Central European stock markets, financial crisis...|$|R
