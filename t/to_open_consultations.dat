40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{order to}} be able to {{influence}} and monitor future developments for urologists, strategies should be promoted in advance to guarantee the future of the speciality and to accommodate the inevitable changes. Faced with this challenge, the EAU, through its Strategy Planning Office (SPO), has prepared a document which is offered, here, in abbreviated form, to the European and international urological communities for general consideration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of subjects, related to the domains and internal consistency of urology as a speciality, were selected and discussed among the members of the SPO and later submitted <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> among distinguished members of the urological community. The topics selected for discussion included: what is urology; urology in the university; sub-specialization in urology; training in urology; does kidney transplantation belong to urology, and others. RESULTS: It is shown that urology is going through an exciting and hazardous transition period. Urology has conflicting problems in its traditional domains due to changes in health care policy, and internal identification problems due to its permanent expansion and sub-specialization options. Weaker points are its relation with primary care medicine (shared care options), the presence and role of urology in institutions such as the university, department of surgery, children's hospitals, administration, etc.; the desegregating effect of the sub-specialities; the increasing encroachment of other specialities, and the increasing outpatient effect of technological progress. CONCLUSION: An action plan is proposed to confront these changes without loosing manpower, internal consistency or social image and improving patient care quality, excellence of training and scientific progress...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to examine}} the ethnic minorities’ state of affairs {{in light of the}} {{constitutional}} reforms in Armenia since President Serzh Sargsyan decided <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the <b>consultations</b> with the parliamentary factions on November 2005. Policy-makers and representatives on behalf of ethnic minority groups have been taking relevantly place at the recent wave of democratic protests throughout the process of constitutional reforms in order to entrench a more stable multiparty system, independent judiciary, new balances between State and civic society. Hence, what is the reason to endorse those tiny ethnic groups such wealth of minority rights and political recognition? Why have ethnic Armenian minority groups not had objections or particular regrets in the constitutional reform processes? In turn, may this high level of internal recognition to ethnic minority groups foster assistance to Armenian minorities and protect Armenian heritage into the de facto entities of the South Caucasus...|$|R

30|$|Policy {{changes and}} {{initiatives}} are often {{triggered by the}} stakeholders {{that are going to}} be affected by those future policies, e.g. a specific sector of the industry. In democratic countries policy makers typically consult a limited number of experts and the largest stakeholders directly involved before issuing a new policy proposal. However, this process leaves citizens and smaller stakeholders underrepresented in the process of policy-shaping. Therefore in many countries, governments are working on improving the communication with citizens and stakeholders to increase their involvement in the law-making process. As an example, the European Commission (EC) has been making a significant effort to engage an increasing number of citizens in the EU law-making process by means of <b>open</b> public <b>consultations</b> (European Political Strategy Centre 2018). This was formerly known as the “Your Voice in Europe” initiative where citizens and stakeholders were encouraged to provide feedback to policy proposals by means of responses <b>to</b> the <b>open</b> public <b>consultations.</b> Typically, the responses are limited to a few hundred, mostly coming from the lobbying organizations that are active in the specific policy areas.|$|R

Clinicians {{need to be aware of}} the importance of attitude and medical consultation as factors influencing patients' outcome from investigation and treatment. While consulting styles reflect the individual personality of the doctor, we need to be aware of our own underlying attitudes and how these might enter into the dynamics of the consultation.

40|$|What {{explains}} interest groups’ position alignments in the European Commission’s <b>open</b> <b>consultations?</b> The article {{argues that}} formal membership ties facilitate organisational coordination {{and the creation}} of lobbying coalitions among interest groups, which in turn affects their position alignments.

Sharing a formal membership tie within an over-arching organisational structure has a stronger effect on position alignment than the fact of representing the same type of interest or having the same organisational form. Coordinated, coalition-based lobbying accounts to a significant extent for stakeholders’ position alignments in the EU <b>open</b> <b>consultations.</b> The ‘social’ embeddedness of lobbying has a direct effect on the advocacy strategies interest groups decide to employ during the early stages of EU policymakin...|$|R

Methods. An ecologic case-referent study design was used with data from the Netherlands Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Defence, the 1992 High-School Student Study, all of the youth health care departments in The Netherlands and relevant censuses. Results. Attention to mental and physical health and health compromising behaviour, either during screening, <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours or during well-care visits seems to be ineffective and in some instances even detrimental to youth health. Of the 18 different outcome measurements, 5 were significantly negative and none were significantly positive. Conclusions. This four part study does not support the hypothesis that on a population level, the preventive activities of youth health care departments such as screening for scoliosis, (more) frequent well-care visits or offering <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours at secondary schools, have a beneficial effect on prevention of (para) suicide, poor mental health, health compromising behaviour or obesity...|$|R

40|$|Background In {{this study}} {{the effect is}} {{assessed}} of (repeated) well-care visits and freely accessible consultation hours at secondary schools on the prevalence of adolescent health-compromising behaviour and later obesity. Methods An ecological case-referent study design was used with data from the Netherlands Bureau of Statistics, the Ministry of Defence, the 1992 High-School Student Study, all youth health care departments in The Netherlands and relevant census. Data from the High-School Student Study included 4569 students aged 12 - 18 years, of whom 4167 had answered all questions on health-compromising behaviour and eating habits. The data from the Ministry of Defence included 1004 cases with a body mass index greater than 27 {{of a total of}} 12 251 male conscripts. The census of 18 - and 19 -year-old males in the regions of the relevant youth health care departments served as referents. Results Except for the use of alcohol, the effect of more well-care visits was in all cases negative, and for the use of tobacco even significantly so [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 15, 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) = 1. 01 - 1. 33]. The availability of <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours had an adverse effect on use of alcohol (OR = 1. 29, 95 per cent CI = 1. 11 - 1. 50). The OR for obesity in male conscripts showed an adverse effect of a greater number of well-care visits (OR = 2. 46, 95 per cent CI = 1. 74 - 3. 46) and the availability of <b>open</b> <b>consultation</b> hours (OR = 1. 97, 95 per cent CI = 1. 72 - 2. 25).
