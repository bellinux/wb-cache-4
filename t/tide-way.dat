60|$|THE SEA had not changed. Its waters {{were low}} on the mud-banks, and the Marazion Bell-buoy clanked and swung in the <b>tide-way.</b> On the white beach-sand dried stumps of sea-poppy shivered and chattered.|$|E
6000|$|So St. Brandan {{went out}} to the point of Old Dunmore, and looked over the <b>tide-way</b> roaring round the Blasquets, at the end of all the world, and away into the ocean, and sighed--"Ah that I had wings as a dove!" [...] And far away, before the setting sun, he saw a blue fairy sea, and golden fairy islands, and he said, [...] "Those are the islands of the blest." [...] Then he and his friends got into a hooker, and sailed away and away to the westward, and were never heard of more. But the people who would not hear him were changed into gorillas, and gorillas they are until this day.|$|E
60|$|They told a {{rambling}} story, how Edwin always would needs go to Winchester, {{to see the}} queen, for she would stand his friend, and do him right. And how they could not get to Winchester, for fear of the French, and wandered in woods and wolds; {{and how they were}} set upon, and hunted; and how Edwin still was mad to go to Winchester: but when he could not, he would go to Blethwallon and his Welsh; and how Earl Randal of Chester set upon them; and how they got between a stream and the <b>tide-way</b> of the Dee, and were cut off. And how Edwin would not yield. And how then they slew him in self-defence, and Randal let them bring the head to the king.|$|E
6000|$|... § VI. We push our way {{on between}} large barges laden with fresh water from Fusina, in round white tubs seven feet across, and {{complicated}} boats full of {{all manner of}} nets that {{look as if they}} could never be disentangled, hanging from their masts and over their sides; and presently pass under a bridge with the lion of St. Mark on its archivolt, and another on a pillar {{at the end of the}} parapet, a small red lion with much of the puppy in his face, looking vacantly up into the air (in passing we may note that, instead of feathers, his wings are covered with hair, and in several other points the manner of his sculpture is not uninteresting). Presently the canal turns a little to the left, and thereupon becomes more quiet, the main bustle of the water-street being usually confined to the first straight reach of it, some quarter of a mile long, the Cheapside of Murano. We pass a considerable church on the left, St. Pietro, and a little square opposite to it with a few acacia trees, and then find our boat suddenly seized by a strong green eddy, and whirled into the <b>tide-way</b> of one of the main channels of the lagoon, which divides the town of Murano into two parts by a deep stream some fifty yards over, crossed only by one wooden bridge. We let ourselves drift some way down the current, looking at the low line of cottages on the other side of it, hardly knowing if there be more cheerfulness or melancholy in the way the sunshine glows on their ruinous but whitewashed walls, and sparkles on the rushing of the green water by the grass-grown quay. It needs a strong stroke of the oar to bring us into the mouth of another quiet canal on the farther side of the <b>tide-way,</b> and we are still somewhat giddy when we run the head of the gondola into the sand on the left-hand side of this more sluggish stream, and land under the east end of the Church of San Donato, the [...] "Matrice" [...] or [...] "Mother" [...] Church of Murano.|$|E
6000|$|... [Edinburgh,] July 6.--Returned {{last night}} with my frozen Muscovites to the Capital, and {{suffered}} as usual from the incursions of the black horse during the night. It was absolute fever. A bunch of letters, but little interesting. Mr. Barry Cornwall[293] writes to condole with me. I think our acquaintance scarce warranted this; but it is well meant and modestly done. I cannot conceive the idea of forcing myself on strangers in distress, and I have half a mind {{to turn sharp round}} on some of my consolers. Came home from Court. R.P. Gillies called; he is writing a satire. He has a singular talent of aping the measure and tone of Byron, and this poem goes to the tune of Don Juan, but it is the Champagne after it has stood two days with the cork drawn. Thereafter came Charles K. Sharpe and Will Clerk, as Robinson sayeth, to my exceeding refreshment.[294] And last, not least, Mr. Jollie, one of the triumvirs who manage my poor matters. He consents to going on with the small edition of novels, which he did not before comprehend. All this has consumed the day, but we will make up <b>tide-way</b> presently. I must dress to go to Lord Medwyn[295] to dinner, and it is near time.|$|E
6000|$|... 228. For {{the three}} {{preceding}} centuries, Milan, the oldest archbishopric of Lombardy, {{had been the}} central {{point at which the}} collision between the secular and ecclesiastical power took place in Europe. The Guelph and Ghibelline naturally met and warred throughout the plain of Lombardy; but the intense civic stubbornness and courage of the Milanese population formed a kind of rock in their <b>tide-way,</b> where the quarrel of burgher with noble confused itself with, embittered, and brought again and again to trial by battle, that of pope with emperor. In 1035 their warrior archbishop, heading their revolt against Conrad of Franconia, organized the first disciplined resistance of foot-soldiers to cavalry by his invention and decoration of the Carroccio; and the contest was only closed, after the rebuilding of the walls of ruined Milan, by the wandering of Barbarossa, his army scattered, through the maize fields, which the traveler now listlessly crosses at speed in the train between Milan and Arona, little noting the name of the small station, [...] "Legnano," [...] where the fortune of the Lombard republic finally prevailed. But it was only by the death of Frederick II. that the supremacy of the Church was secured; and when Innocent IV., who had written, on hearing of that death, to his Sicilian clergy, in words of blasphemous exultation, entered Milan, on his journey from Lyons to Perugia, the road, for ten miles before he reached the gates, was lined by the entire population of the city, drawn forth in enthusiastic welcome; as they had invented a sacred car for the advance of their standard in battle, they invented some similar honor for the head of their Church as the harbinger of peace: under a canopy of silk, borne by the first gentlemen of Milan, the Pope received the hosannas of a people who had driven into shameful flight their Caesar-king; and it is not uninteresting for the English traveler to remember, as he walks through the vast arcades of shops, {{in the form of a}} cross, by which the Milanese of to-day express their triumph in liberation from Teutonic rule, that the [...] "Baldacchino" [...] of all mediæval religious ceremony owed its origin to the taste of the milliners of Milan, as the safety of the best knights in European battle rested on the faithful craftsmanship of her armorers.|$|E
60|$|To these {{successive}} immigrations {{of strong}} Puritan blood, more {{than even the}} influence of the Cromwells and other Puritan gentlemen, we may attribute that strong Calvinist element which has endured for now nigh three centuries in the fen; and attribute, too, that sturdy independence and self-help which drove them of old out of Boston town, to seek their fortunes first in Holland, then in Massachusetts over sea. And that sturdy independence and self-help is not gone. There still lives in them some of the spirit of their mythic giant Hickafrid (the Hickathrift of nursery rhymes), who, when the Marshland men (possibly the Romanized inhabitants of the wall villages) quarrelled with him in the field, took up the cart-axle for a club, smote them hip and thigh, and pastured his cattle in their despite in the green cheese-fens of the Smeeth. No one has ever seen a fen-bank break, without honouring the stern quiet temper which there is in these men, when the north-easter is howling above, the spring-tide roaring outside, the brimming <b>tide-way</b> lapping up to the dyke-top, or flying over in sheets of spray; when round the one fatal thread which is trickling over the dyke--or worse, through some forgotten rat's hole in its side--hundreds of men are clustered, without tumult, without complaint, marshalled under their employers, fighting the brute powers of nature, not for their employer's sake alone, but for the sake of their own year's labour and their own year's bread. The sheep have been driven off the land below; the cattle stand ranged shivering on high dykes inland; they will be saved in punts, if the worst befall. But a hundred spades, wielded by practised hands, cannot stop that tiny rat-hole. The trickle becomes a rush--the rush a roaring waterfall. The dyke-top trembles- -gives. The men make efforts, desperate, dangerous, as of sailors in a wreck, with faggots, hurdles, sedge, turf: but the bank will break; and slowly they draw off; sullen, but uncomplaining; beaten, but not conquered. A new cry rises among them. Up, to save yonder sluice; that will save yonder lode; that again yonder farm; that again some other lode, some other farm, far back inland, but guessed at instantly by men who have studied from their youth, as the necessity of their existence, the labyrinthine drainage of lands which are all below the water level, and where the inner lands, in many cases, are lower still than those outside.|$|E
50|$|Fairway {{stood as}} a {{stallion}} at the Woodlands Stud at Newmarket from 1931 {{until his death}} in November 1946. He was Champion sire four times and sired the Classic winners Blue Peter, Watling Street, Pay Up, Kingsway, Garden Path and <b>Tide-Way.</b> His most influential son however, was the Champion sire Fair Trial.|$|E
5000|$|Manitoba was sired by Manna, {{winner of}} the 1925 2,000 Guineas Stakes and Epsom Derby and sire of Miracle (£14,607) and Colombo (£26,228). Manna was by the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland, Phalaris. His dam, Berystede, was a {{daughter}} of another two-time Leading sire, Son-in-Law, whom the National Horseracing Museum said was [...] "probably {{the best and most}} distinguished stayer this country has ever known." [...] http://www.horseracinghistory.co.uk/hrho/action/viewDocument?id=968 Manitoba was from Bruce Lowe family, 8 which included Melton ({{winner of the}} Epsom Derby and St. Leger), Sunstream and <b>Tide-way.</b>|$|E
50|$|Back In Front was a brown gelding with a {{small white}} star bred in County Limerick Ireland by Noreen Hayes. He was sired by Bob Back, a racehorse whose best {{performance}} came when he recorded an upset win over Pebbles and Commanche Run in the 1985 Prince of Wales's Stakes. As a breeding stallion, he sired the St Leger Stakes winner Bob's Return, but had more success as a National Hunt sire, with his progeny including Bobs Worth, Bacchanal (Stayers' Hurdle), Thisthatandtother (Festival Trophy) and Burton Port (Reynoldstown Novices' Chase). Back In Front's dam Storm Front showed some ability as a National Hunt racehorse, winning six minor races and being placed at Grade III level. She was a descendant of the broodmare Drift who produced the classic winners <b>Tide-Way</b> and Sun Stream.|$|E
