5|$|An {{expansion}} pack, <b>The</b> <b>Deeper</b> Dungeons, {{was released}} on 30 November 1997. It features fifteen new levels each for single player and multiplayer, and an improved artificial intelligence for the enemies. The Avatar also reappears in the final level. A Direct3D version, which brought improved graphics and 3D acceleration support, and a level editor were released for the game. These add-ons, along with <b>the</b> <b>Deeper</b> Dungeons and a Dungeon Keeper-based desktop theme, were bundled with the game, re-released as Dungeon Keeper Gold Edition on 31 December 1998. Dungeon Keeper received a fan-made mod, called KeeperFX. This mod increases compatibility with later versions of Windows, fixes bugs, and adds features such as TCP/IP multiplayer support. A sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2 was released in 1999, and the series was rebooted by Mythic Entertainment {{with the release of}} a remake (also titled Dungeon Keeper) for iOS and Android on 30 January 2014.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass {{is not in}} the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> layers.|$|E

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1992 Lin JianpingAn oxygen-deficient (12. 8 microM dissolved oxygen and oxygen saturation 5. 0 - 7. 4 % in the water of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole) isolated water system in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole of <b>the</b> Yarra River estuary was investigated to discover the relationship between iodate and iodide. The iodate concentration in the water of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole was very low (0. 039 to 0. 062 microM at bottom water, salinity from 26. 8 - 30. 0 Practical Salinity Scale, 1978), because iodate reduced to iodide in the water by reducing agents (S 2 -, Fe 2 + and Mn 2 +) diffused from the sediment of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole. <b>The</b> concentrations of iodine species in the sediment pore water and suspended material in the water of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole were determined to investigate iodine cycling in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole. <b>The</b> iodine flux from sediment into overlying water in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole was 15. 6 micromol/m^ 2. day. The concentration of total inorganic iodine (iodate+iodide) in the dry suspended material from the water of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole was 0. 117 micro mol/g. The water residence time in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole was studied. In winter especially, the seawater of high density may intrude into <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole with <b>the</b> highest tides. The seawater remains trapped in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole below <b>the</b> halocline, which allows the development of oxygen-deficient conditions. It was found that in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole <b>the</b> iodide concentration increase resulted from sediment diffusion (36 %), iodate reduction (27 %) and release from suspended material (37 %) during the water residence time in the water of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole. <b>The</b> iodine cycling in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole was: iodate in the water reduced to iodide by reducing agents diffused from sediment; suspended material containing soluble or particular iodine may release iodide and also trap iodate and iodide from water during precipitation; iodate in the sediment reduced to iodide and iodide diffused from sediment into overlying water. Iodine is accumulated in the isolated water in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> hole and might be moved out at the next water exchange. Open Acces...|$|R

During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape {{with a small group of}} men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement of the affected arm and in <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>deep</b> {{ocean is}} both cold and dark with {{generally}} weak velocities (although limited areas of <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> ocean {{are known to}} have significant recirculations). <b>The</b> <b>deep</b> ocean is supplied with water from the upper ocean in only a few limited geographical regions: the subpolar North Atlantic and several sinking regions around the Antarctic. Because of the weak supply of water to <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> ocean <b>the</b> average residence time of water in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> ocean is measured in hundreds of years. In this layer as well the hydrostatic and geostrophic relationships are generally valid and mixing is generally quite weak.|$|R

If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules. Involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade leads to activation of matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{from the}} Apollo 17 mission {{shows that the}} massifs {{surrounding}} the valley are composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia and that basalt underlies the valley floor, {{a result of the}} lava flows during the valley's history. Seismic studies suggest that the basalt below the valley floor is about 1400 metres (4593.2feet) thick. Above the layer of subfloor basalt lies a deposit of unconsolidated material of various compositions ranging from volcanic material to impact-formed regolith. The valley floor's unusually low albedo, or reflectivity, {{is a direct result of}} the volcanic material and glass beads located there. <b>The</b> <b>deeper</b> craters on the valley floor act as 'natural drill holes' and allowed the astronauts to sample the subfloor basalt. These basalt samples are composed primarily of plagioclase, but also contain amounts of clinopyroxene and other minerals.|$|E

The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that males were most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> two groups.|$|E

5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under water stress conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> layers of the soil.

Sheridan reached Charlottesville on March 3, but faced delays caused by muddy roads. During that time, Custer's division (including the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry) destroyed the railroad line between Lynchburg and Amherst Courthouse, and Devin's division destroyed the James River Canal. Rainy weather had caused the James River to swell. <b>The</b> <b>deeper</b> and wider river became dangerous to cross, and fords became unusable. The swollen river, and bridges that had been destroyed by the Confederates, persuaded Sheridan to move east toward Richmond instead of moving south across the river to link with Sherman's army in North Carolina.

5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. <b>The</b> <b>deeper</b> the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge.
