5|$|Gross and Kotok {{built the}} digital audio program Expensive <b>Tape</b> <b>Recorder.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Voyager 1 {{is unable}} to {{communicate}} directly with the Earth, its digital <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> (DTR) can record about 64 kilobytes of data for transmission at another time. Signals from Voyager 1 take over 19 hours to reach Earth.|$|E
5|$|Spacecraft {{communications}} {{included a}} command subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping, attitude, and sensor performance data. Video {{data from the}} three-camera RBV system was transmitted in both real-time and <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> modes at 2265.5MHz, while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20MHz radio-frequency bandwidth at 2229.5MHz.|$|E
5000|$|British <b>Tape</b> <b>Recorders</b> or BTR {{machines}} were reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> initially made by EMI in England after World War II. They {{were the first}} magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> to be manufactured in Britain, and their design imitated that of the <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> used by the Germans during the war. Because these multi-track recorders were painted EMI green, they then {{became known as the}} [...] "Green Machines".|$|R
50|$|Helical scan is {{a method}} of {{recording}} high-frequency signals on magnetic tape. It is used in open-reel video <b>tape</b> <b>recorders,</b> video cassette <b>recorders,</b> digital audio <b>tape</b> <b>recorders,</b> and some computer tape drives.|$|R
50|$|In 1949 Studer {{branched}} {{out into the}} audio business by modifying imported <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> from the United States. By 1950 they had developed their own line of <b>tape</b> <b>recorders,</b> named the Dynavox series.|$|R
5|$|Though {{numerous}} episodes {{are still}} missing, full-length audio soundtracks for all missing episodes {{are held by}} the BBC. These come from off-air recordings made by fans, often made by use of a microphone attached to a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> placed close to the television set. While the quality of these off-air recordings varies greatly, multiple fan recordings exist for every episode.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, several {{customers}} {{asked if}} Phillips could make demo discs, so {{he bought a}} 1/4inch <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> (replaced in 1963 with a Vortexion portable), an MSS (Marguerite Sound Studios - after the owner's wife) disc cutting machine, an amplifier, a 4-track mixer, three microphones (a Reslo, an HMV ribbon microphone, and an AKG), and three pairs of headphones for £400, while {{on a trip to}} London to visit his son Frank, who was there for a sound recording course at EMI Electronics.|$|E
5|$|Inside the case, {{there were}} many more {{similarities}} with the ZX81. Like its successor, it used the Z80A microprocessor and had only 1KB of on-board RAM. It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display. It relied on an ordinary cassette <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> for data storage. The main {{difference between the two}} machines lay in the internal software; when the ZX81 was released, ZX80 owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board.|$|E
50|$|In practice, AAD was {{uncommon}} and DAD {{was very}} rare, as many companies (especially the well-known classical music labels) used digital <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> (which was not prohibitively {{more expensive than}} analog <b>tape</b> <b>recorders)</b> during the editing or mixing stage.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Not all video <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> use a {{cassette}} {{to contain the}} magnetic recording videotape. Early models of consumer video <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> VTRs, and most professional broadcast analog videotape machines (e.g. 1-inch Type C) use reel to reel tape spools.|$|R

5|$|Johnny is a {{successful}} banker {{who lives in a}} San Francisco townhouse with Lisa, his fiancée. Lisa, however, having become dissatisfied with her life and Johnny, seduces his best friend, Mark and the two begin a secret affair. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's influence at his bank slips, Lisa alternates between glorifying and vilifying Johnny to her family and friends, both making false accusations of domestic abuse and defending Johnny against criticisms. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confess her infidelity to her mother, attaches a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover.|$|E
5|$|Pentangle's {{first major}} concert {{was at the}} Royal Festival Hall in 1967, and their first album was {{released}} in the following year. Pentangle embarked on a demanding schedule of touring the world and recording and, during this period, Jansch largely gave up solo performances. He did, however, continue to record, releasing Rosemary Lane in 1971. The tracks for this album were recorded on a portable <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> by Bill Leader at Jansch's cottage in Ticehurst, Sussex—a process which took several months, with Jansch only working {{when he was in}} the right mood.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{initiative}} {{came from}} Norman Pierre Gentieu (1914–2009), an American writer who discovered Sorabji by reading his book Around Music {{just after the}} Second World War. Because of the post-war shortages in England, Gentieu sent Sorabji some provisions, {{and the depth of}} their friendship appears to have been such that he continued to do so for the next four decades. In the early 1950s Gentieu made an offer to Sorabji to pay for the microfilming of his major piano works and to give some copies to selected libraries. All of his unpublished musical manuscripts were eventually microfilmed. Gentieu also sent Sorabji a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> to record some of his music, but Sorabji did not do so.|$|E

5|$|Following their Star Search audition, Johnny and the Moondogs {{changed their}} name to Japage 3 (combining letters {{from each of}} the member's names: John, Paul, and George). Lennon had a friend from art school, named Derek Hodkin, who owned a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder,</b> and Lennon {{convinced}} him to record the group (along with McCartney's brother Mike on drums). The group then asked Hodkin to act as their manager, and he agreed. Despite Hodkin's management, bookings for the group dried up. Harrison began a stint as rhythm guitarist in the Les Stewart Quartet, who had a weekly club engagement. By May, Japage 3 was defunct, although the three continued to see each other socially, and Lennon and McCartney continued to write songs together.|$|E
5|$|Nick's older sister, Gabrielle, {{became a}} {{successful}} {{film and television}} actress. Both parents were musically inclined and each wrote pieces of music. Recordings of Molly Drake's songs, which have come to light since her death, are remarkably similar in tone and outlook to the later work of her son. Mother and son shared a similar fragile vocal delivery; both Gabrielle and biographer Trevor Dann have noted a parallel sense of foreboding and fatalism in their music. Encouraged by his mother, Drake learned to play piano {{at an early age}} and began to compose songs which he recorded on a reel-to-reel <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> she kept in the family drawing room.|$|E
5|$|Sarah advises that Hank and Jacob team up to {{plot against}} Lou. Much to Jacob's dismay, the two {{brothers}} visit Lou at his home where Jacob has him drunkenly confess to the old man's murder. Hank records the false confession with a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> Lou grows enraged when he realizes that the two have conspired against him and pulls a gun on them. Jacob grabs a rifle from his truck and kills Lou to save his brother. Hank then kills Lou's wife with Lou's shotgun when she appears with another gun. The two brothers avoid arrest after Hank concocts a rehearsed speech for himself and Jacob to tell the police.|$|E

5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science <b>Tape</b> <b>Recorder</b> {{with a new}} Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, {{the data from the}} camera was stored initially in an on-board <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority over the use of the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
5|$|Having seen Xavier chasing his son, Eric brutally assaults John {{and forces}} him {{to lead him}} to the house. John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies. Amanda {{appears in the doorway}} and seals the door, leaving Eric to die.|$|E

5|$|Wendy Oxenhorn, {{director}} of the Foundation, arranged for housekeeping and free medical care for Norman, as well as helping him plan for his future, providing back rent and negotiating with Norman's landlord. In {{the course of that}} housekeeping, in July 2002, Norman's rare tape of his jam session with Marley was located in his apartment and placed on auction, retrieving considerably above its estimated value when auctioned at $26,290. During the same housekeeping session, Norman rediscovered old notebooks containing his compositions. Producer Kerryn Tolhurst recorded Norman performing the songs on a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> in his apartment, taking the tapes into the studio later to add parts by other musicians. Judy Collins, whose drummer Tony Beard contributed to the project, released the resultant album under her own Wildflower label in 2004. The project, titled Little Pieces, is the first album Norman has ever released with wide distribution. In 2006, Little Pieces won in The 5th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Blues Album.|$|E
5|$|After {{several days}} of {{trekking}} through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is initially greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the Ya̧nomamö and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank, where they save a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from death. The Ya̧nomamö invite Monroe and his team back to their village in gratitude, yet they treat the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of Ya̧nomamö women emerge from the riverbank {{to take him to}} a shrine, where he discovers the rotting remains of the filmmakers. Angered, he confronts the Ya̧nomamö in the village, during which time he plays a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder.</b> The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the filmmakers's surviving reels of film during a cannibalistic ceremony, in which Monroe must take part.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor enters Bennett's room, {{and finds}} {{things are not}} as they seem. The {{supposedly}} crippled Bennett is missing, and a <b>tape</b> <b>recorder</b> hides his absence. He finds a trap door in {{the floor of the}} cabin and follows it to a temple carved from rock where he unmasks Koquillion as Bennett. Bennett reveals he killed a crewmember on board the ship and was arrested, but the ship crashed before the crime could be radioed to Earth. It was he who killed the crash survivors and the natives of Dido to cover his crime. He has been using the Koquillion alias so that Vicki would back up his story, and had hoped the planet would be destroyed when his version of events was given. Just as Bennett is about to kill the Doctor, two surviving native Didonians arrive and force Bennett to his death over a ledge. They then stop the signal to prevent the Rescue Ship reaching their planet. With no living family and nothing left for her on Dido, Vicki is welcomed aboard the TARDIS.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after, {{came the}} {{creation}} and production of Erdro Erdrosed, Contemporary Improv & recording system for piano, acoustic guitar, percussions, 3 <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> and 3 technicians. A more complex and better structured version, Erdro Erdrosed II (for 6 <b>tape</b> <b>recorders</b> working live in a multiple re-injection system), will be created in 1983 at the Musee dart contemporain de Montreal.|$|R
