5000|$|In England the {{technique}} {{was used for}} [...] "furniture prints" [...] with a similar purpose, and became very popular, though regarded with disdain by producers of the portrait mezzotints that dominated the English portrait print market. Stipple competed with mezzotint as a <b>tonal</b> <b>method</b> of printmaking, and while it lacked the rich depth of tone of mezzotint, it had the great advantage that far more impressions could be taken from a plate.|$|E
5000|$|Mezzotint is a printmaking {{process of}} the {{intaglio}} family, technically a drypoint method. It was the first <b>tonal</b> <b>method</b> to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like hatching, cross-hatching or stipple. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening the plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a [...] "rocker." [...] In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when {{the face of the}} plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.|$|E
2500|$|Milton Babbitt, in his 1949 {{critique}} of Bartók's string quartets, criticized Bartók for using tonality and non <b>tonal</b> <b>methods</b> unique to each piece. Babbitt noted that [...] "Bartók's solution was a specific one, it cannot be duplicated" [...] Bartók's use of [...] "two organizational principles"—tonality for large scale relationships and the piece-specific method for {{moment to moment}} thematic elements—was a problem for Babbitt, who worried that the [...] "highly attenuated tonality" [...] requires extreme non-harmonic methods to create a feeling of closure [...]|$|R
50|$|The ear {{training}} system created by Karaseva allows students dealing with intonationally and rhythmically complicated music patterns of contemporary music {{to be able}} to clearly select by ear (not only by theoretical analysis) interrelationships between new modes, non-third chords, and new functional <b>tonal</b> system. This <b>method</b> improves sight-singing and listening of 20th century music.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method to {{automatically}} determine key signature changes. In automatic music transcription, unconsidered sections in distantly related keys {{may lead to}} music scores {{that are hard to}} read due to a high number of notated accidentals. The problem of key change is commonly addressed by finding the correct local key out of the 24 major and minor keys. However, to provide the best matching key signature, choosing the right mode (major or minor) is not necessary and thus, we only estimate the local underlying diatonic scale. After extracting chroma features and a beat grid from the audio data, we calculate local probabilities for the different diatonic scales. For this purpose, we present a multiplicative procedure that shows promising results for visualizing complex tonal structures. From the obtained diatonic scale estimates, we identify candidates for key signature changes. By clustering similar segments and applying minimum segment length constraints, we ge t the <b>tonal</b> segmentation. Our <b>method</b> was tested on a dataset containing 30 hand-annotated pop songs. To evaluate our results, we calculate scores {{based on the number of}} frames correctly annotated, as well as segment border F-measures and perform a cross-validation study. Our rulebased method yields up to 90 % class accuracy, and up to 70 % F-measure score for segment borders. These results are promising and qualify the approach to be applied for automatic music transcription...|$|R
40|$|More {{information}} is now {{readily available to}} computer users {{than at any time}} in human history; however, much of this {{information is}} often inaccessible to people with blindness or low-vision, for whom information must be presented non-visually. Currently, screen readers are able to verbalize on-screen text using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis; however, much of this vocalization is inadequate for browsing the Internet. An auditory interface that incorporates auditory-spatial orientation was created and tested. For information that can be structured as a two-dimensional table, links can be semantically grouped as cells in a row within an auditory table, which provides a consistent structure for auditory navigation. An auditory display prototype was tested. ^ Sixteen legally blind subjects participated in this research study. Results demonstrated that stereo panning was an effective technique for audio-spatially orienting non-visual navigation in a five-row, six-column HTML table as compared to a centered, stationary synthesized voice. These results were based on measuring the time- to-target (TTT), or the amount of time elapsed from the first prompting to the selection of each tabular link. Preliminary analysis of the TTT values recorded during the experiment showed that the populations did not conform to the ANOVA requirements of normality and equality of variances. Therefore, the data were transformed using the natural logarithm. The repeated-measures two-factor ANOVA results show that the logarithmically-transformed TTTs were significantly affected by the <b>tonal</b> variation <b>method,</b> F(1, 15) = 6. 194, p= 0. 025. Similarly, the results show that the logarithmically transformed TTTs were marginally affected by the stereo spatialization method, F(1, 15) = 4. 240, p= 0. 057. The results show that the logarithmically transformed TTTs were not significantly affected by the interaction of both methods, F(1, 15) = 1. 381, p= 0. 258. These results suggest that some confusion may be caused in the subject when employing both of these methods simultaneously. The significant effect of tonal variation indicates that the effect is actually increasing the average TTT. In other words, the presence of preceding tones increases task completion time on average. The marginally-significant effect of stereo spatialization decreases the average log(TTT) from 2. 405 to 2. 264. ...|$|R
