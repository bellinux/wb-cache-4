25|$|The {{last week}} in Jerusalem is the {{conclusion}} of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through Perea and Judea. Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to <b>that</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|E

It is also related to the {{suspension bridge}} in having arcuate main cables with suspender cables, although the self-anchored type lacks the heavy cable anchorages of the ordinary suspension bridge. Unlike either a cable-stayed bridge or a suspension bridge, the self-anchored suspension bridge must be supported by falsework during construction {{and so it is}} more expensive to construct.|$|E

500|$|After the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe {{announced}} that he was splitting with Frost to train with one of his assistants, Tracey Menzies, who had no prior international experience. Admitting <b>that</b> <b>tension</b> existed between him and Frost, Thorpe asserted that the split was amicable. He cited waning motivation for the split, stating [...] "I decided I either had to make the change or it was {{to walk away from the}} sport". The retired Talbot expressed concerns that Thorpe was making a decision whilst he was physically and emotionally drained, while other coaches felt that the new relationship would end up with Thorpe, rather than Menzies, making the decisions. Despite a turbulent year, he was again named by Swimming World as its World Swimmer of the Year.|$|E

Owen praised the writing and subversion of expectations, and, though he found some of the twists predictable and felt that the ending needed more groundwork, felt that the final sequence [...] "was worth it for another brown-trouser moment". Bennion felt that the [...] "genius" [...] of the episode was the way <b>that</b> <b>tension</b> was [...] "undercut" [...] with humour, but felt that the humour actually served to raise the tension. He highlighted the joke involving blue paint as particularly funny. Patrick Mulkern, of Radio Times, also praised the mix of humour and horror.|$|E

Although she felt skeptical, Twain visited vocal coach Eric Vetro {{to prepare for}} her session with Foster. Twain and Vetro executed vocal exercises to loosen up the tension and tightness in her vocal chords. [...] "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has {{to take all of}} <b>that</b> <b>tension</b> and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it. And to start singing from her heart again, the way she did {{when she was a little}} girl, when she started," [...] Vetro stated. He also opined that Twain was ready to return to her music career.

500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, repetition was {{a natural}} part of Tchaikovsky's music, just as it {{is an integral part of}} Russian music. His use of sequences within melodies (repeating a tune at a higher or lower pitch in the same voice) could go on for extreme length. The problem with repetition is that, over a period of time, the melody being repeated remains static, even when there is a surface level of rhythmic activity added to it. Tchaikovsky kept the musical conversation flowing by treating melody, tonality, rhythm and sound color as one integrated unit, rather than as separate elements. By making subtle but noticeable changes in the rhythm or phrasing of a tune, modulating to another key, changing the melody itself or varying the instruments playing it, Tchaikovsky could keep a listener's interest from flagging. By extending the number of repetitions, he could increase the musical and dramatic tension of a passage, building [...] "into an emotional experience of almost unbearable intensity," [...] as Brown phrases it, controlling when the peak and release of <b>that</b> <b>tension</b> would take place. Musicologist Martin Cooper calls this practice a subtle form of unifying a piece of music and adds that Tchaikovsky brought it to a high point of refinement. (For more on this practice, see the next section.) ...|$|E
500|$|During casting {{discussions between}} Bayona and del Toro, Bayona {{expressed}} a desire to see Belén Rueda in the lead. Bayona admired her after seeing her performance as Julia in Alejandro Amenabar's The Sea Inside. Del Toro appreciated this choice, as he admired her as an actress and liked that Bayona was casting her against type. Bayona asked Rueda to watch The Innocents and Close Encounters of the Third Kind to prepare for the role. Another actress Bayona desired for the film was Geraldine Chaplin in the role of Aurora, the medium. Bayona stated that he wanted the film to have [...] "the mood of 70s Spanish cinema and Geraldine starred in one of the best movies of that decade, Carlos Saura's The Secret of Anna, as the ghost of the mother. It made sense to have her play the medium." [...] Bayona was nervous about filming with Chaplin. To break <b>that</b> <b>tension,</b> {{on the first day of}} shooting with her Bayona hid under a bed during a scene which required Chaplin to portray Aurora kneeling down near it in the dark, and he grabbed Chaplin's leg when she did so. Aurora's scream in the film is Chaplin's actual frightened scream as Bayona grabbed her. Roger Príncep's test-screening was one of the first for the role of Simón. Bayona test-screened over four-hundred children during two months before making his choice to cast Princep. Edgar Vivar was cast in role of Balabán; Bayona knew him through his work on the Mexican television series El Chavo and sent him an invitation for the role through e-mail.|$|E
500|$|In April2011, it was {{reported}} that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An EastEnders insider told the News of the World, [...] "Masood has never got over <b>that.</b> <b>Tension</b> has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [...] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab." [...] Ganatra said that Yusef will turn [...] "very manipulative and very nasty" [...] and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, [...] "He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own." [...] Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, [...] "I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play." [...] The scenes were broadcast on 2June2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.|$|E

2500|$|Most emphatically in The Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard's author {{argues that}} the human self is a {{composition}} of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the [...] "relationship of the two to itself," [...] and a consciousness of [...] "the power that posited" [...] the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist {{in a state of}} tension. <b>That</b> <b>tension</b> between two aspects of the [...] "self" [...] that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person {{is in a state of}} despair. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.|$|E
2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt {{that the only way to}} tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think <b>that</b> <b>tension</b> helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E
2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been aimed at Carmel's portrayal {{as a health}} visitor. In the late 1980s, a specialist nursing magazine called Nursing Times [...] had a feature on the character, remarking that she [...] "has come in for {{quite a bit of}} stick from HVA [...] members who haven't felt that the character gives a good impression of their role". HVA members expressed disappointment that the character [...] "has not developed in a way which promotes the role of health visitors more positively." [...] Roma Iskander, who had discussed the role with EastEnders scriptwriters on behalf of the HVA, said that [...] "Carmel isn't a positive image of a black woman or a health visitor." [...] The magazine article suggested that Carmel's personal problems with family and clients served her right [...] "for moving to Albert Square in the first place. Health visitors be warned — don't live on your work patch". However, in Dominic Strinati's book, Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain, Christine Geraghty has argued that [...] "the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depended on her being part {{of the life of the}} Square, regularly and unproblematically available as a source of advice and support in her professional capacity as well as the focus of interest in terms of her personal life." [...] Geraghty has said <b>that</b> <b>tension</b> arose from conflict in the 1980s soaps [...] "between a desire to be positive about a particular issue and a commitment to credibility in terms of character and setting. The HVA, it would appear, want Carmel to be a model health visitor, demonstrating a wide range of skills in a professional manner. But the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depends on her being a character who is part of the life of the Square, a professional who makes mistakes and whose personal life is almost a source of interest. Quite clearly, the demands for a positive image for health visitors as a profession are less pressing than the necessity to be able to deploy Carmel as a soap opera character. Those making the programme are quite certain that this is the way it must be." ...|$|E

40|$|Summary Today's {{economic}} systems are characterised by flexible specialisation {{driven by a}} growth of service-based firms, a servicification of manufacturing firms and projectification. There is therefore {{a growing number of}} matrix organisations being co-dependent on line organisations and projects. The study aims to advance theorising on such organisations by empirically studying the assumption <b>that</b> <b>tensions</b> act as drivers for managerial action in project organisations and that they constitute a foundation upon which theories may be built. The study shows <b>that</b> <b>tensions</b> are concerns in project organisations and <b>that</b> sources of <b>tensions</b> are primarily created by the co-existence of fundamentally different organising principles, the way employees identify themselves with either the line function or with projects and by competition for limited organisational resources. The study differentiates project-oriented organisations and project-based organisations from one another. The main contribution is to empirically study and validate Lundin and Söderholm's (1995) [Lundin, R. A., & Söderholm, A. (1995). A theory of the temporary organisation.
