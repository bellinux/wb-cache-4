5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to <b>the</b> <b>mill.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> is <b>The</b> <b>Mill</b> Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, a {{group of}} enthusiasts {{purchased}} Thelnetham windmill for restoration. Numerous volunteers helped to restore <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> to full working order over an eight-year period. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> {{is open to the}} public, and flour ground at <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> can be bought at the site.|$|E
5|$|Tatchell leased <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> to his {{son-in-law}} John Sherrin, who inherited <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> in 1824 following Tatchell's death. When Sherrin died, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> passed to his three sons, although only one, Robert, worked <b>the</b> <b>mill.</b> Simon Spearing became the miller in 1869. He was later assisted {{by his son}} William, who lost an arm when he was thirteen due to an accident at a watermill in Low Ham. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was acquired by Adam Sherrin in 1881 and owned by his family until 1902. By the late 1880s, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was being rented by George Parker. He added a portable steam engine as auxiliary power. It drove one pair of stones. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was damaged by storms in 1897 or 1898 and after that was only powered by the steam engine, which had been installed in 1894, rather than the wind. The bakehouse ceased to be used around this time.|$|E
5000|$|In 1588, one of <b>the</b> <b>mills</b> was {{described}} as a [...] "gunpowder mill". During the 16th century <b>the</b> three <b>mills</b> were reduced to two (which today are <b>the</b> House <b>Mill</b> and <b>the</b> Clock <b>Mill).</b> In <b>the</b> 17th century, <b>the</b> <b>mills</b> were used to grind grain, which was then used to distill alcohol; <b>the</b> <b>mills</b> became a major supplier to the alcohol trade and gin palaces of London.|$|R

30|$|The {{amount of}} heat that is {{dissipated}} {{is strongly dependent on}} <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> parameters that influence the energy input in <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> beaker. These parameters are the frequency ν osc, <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> ball diameter d MB, <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> ball filling degree Φ MB (Eq.  1), <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> beaker size, <b>the</b> grinding stock filling degree Φ GS (Eq.  2) and material properties of the grinding stock {{as well as of the}} grinding tools, such as Young´s modulus, density, hardness and heat capacity [12, 26].|$|R
5|$|The {{consortium}} took {{possession of}} <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> in November 1979. The first priority {{was to make}} <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> to prevent further water penetration of the structure. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed {{in preparation for the}} removal of the cap frame.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mill</b> {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} TW Monds & Sons until their 1918 merger with T Affleck & Son—which owned the Newry mill at Longford—creating the company Monds & Affleck. Monds & Affleck only operated <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> until 1924, and never reopened it. By 1931 it was reported as having ceased operations years ago. Monds & Affleck sold <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> in 1947, though it is not known when the mill's machinery was removed. By this time <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was descending into Ruin and had long been vacant. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was renovated in 1984 and opened as a restaurant, though four years later it had closed and was being sold. After this it was reopened as a wedding and meeting venue. It had closed again by 2008, but was being renovated with the intention of reopening.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was {{restored}} {{over a period}} of six years. Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair <b>the</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{influence}} of the operating frequency, <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> ball and grinding stock filling degree, the material of <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> balls and beakers, <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> ball diameter {{and the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> beakers on <b>the</b> temperature increase inside <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> beakers in a mixer ball mill was investigated. These parameters influence the temperature progression and the equilibrium temperature of the system. The grinding stock filling degree with regard to the void volume in <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> ball package showed huge influence on the heating rate and the equilibrium temperature. In this context, the behavior of the temperature progression changes if the complete void volume is filled with the grinding stock.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was {{worked by}} Stephen Peverett, Richard's son. He {{inherited}} <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> {{on the death}} of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879. In 1884, <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was sold by auction, and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold. Bryant rebuilt the floors of <b>the</b> <b>mill.</b> From 1892, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor. This was replaced in 1914 by a Hornsby oil engine. Bryant ran <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent, a retired millwright from Garboldisham, Norfolk. The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was tailwinded c1920, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. Vincent carried out some repairs to <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> and ran it until he retired in 1924. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was again tailwinded.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 {{the sails}} were {{replaced}} and <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> re-thatched and restored by local craftsmen {{at a cost}} of a £100,000; <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was re-opened later that year. The work was funded by the Grantscape Community Heritage Fund. Although the sails do not rotate with the wind, they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance. Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that the bats would still have access after the restoration.|$|E
5|$|In the 1898, A Murray {{became part}} of the Fine Cotton Spinners' and Doublers' Association Limited (FCSDA). <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> complex began to decline in the early 20th century as the canal basin was filled in and Little Mill burnt down. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> was {{replaced}} with the earliest mill in Greater Manchester that was built to use mains electricity. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> complex continued producing cotton until the 1950s. The mills were later leased out to other companies and in some cases allowed to fall into disrepair. Between 2000 and 2003, Urban Splash redeveloped Fireproof and Doubling Mill into offices, winning a RIBA Award. The rest of the complex underwent a £17M regeneration between 2004 and 2006 and are proposed to be used as flats and a hotel.|$|E
5|$|Initially, both <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> {{owners and}} local unions were against the army's {{takeover}} of lumber production. <b>The</b> <b>mill</b> owners disliked having the army overseeing their businesses, and the unions saw soldiers' labor {{as a form}} of strikebreaking. Disque, however, called on everyone to support war production. He was also careful not to favor either owners or unions as he increased production, helping both sides achieve their goals. For <b>the</b> <b>mill</b> owners, military manpower kept mills open and running at full capacity; in addition, it prevented radicals from sabotaging facilities or equipment. The unions benefited because military rules stabilized wages and improved working conditions for loggers and sawmill workers throughout the Pacific Northwest. Among the improved conditions was a standard eight-hour day.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> Hope <b>Mills</b> {{burned in}} 1790, <b>the</b> grist <b>mills</b> were rebuilt as <b>the</b> New Hope <b>Mills</b> by Benjamin Parry. The town was renamed for <b>the</b> <b>mills.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>mills</b> {{were close}} {{together}} {{one of the}} towers would 'rob the wind' (or obstruct the airflow to the sails) of the other. Consequentially before 1890 <b>the</b> Sarah <b>mill</b> had its sails removed and <b>the</b> <b>milling</b> machinery powered by a vertical-boilered stationary steam engine. It is possible that Sarah never had the sails fitted. <b>The</b> <b>mills</b> were used for grinding grain from the Oakes' estates, both for flour and for animal feed. In 1918 the sails of <b>the</b> James <b>mill</b> were removed and the steam plant replaced by a [...] oil engine which powered both <b>mills.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mills</b> stopped work c. 1927.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mills</b> {{were built}} {{beginning}} in 1863 by Robert Knight and Benjamin Knight (B.B. & R.

50|$|Liberty’s next change came in 1901, when Mr. Jeptha P.

Eighteen houses and two overseer houses were {{built as a}} mill village to house the plant’s workers and their families. <b>The</b> second cotton <b>mill</b> was built by Mr. Lang Clayton of Norris in 1905. Built {{in a part of}} town often referred to as Rabbit Town, the plant was originally named <b>the</b> Calumet <b>Mill,</b> and later renamed <b>the</b> Maplecroft <b>Mill.</b> By 1920, both mills had come under the control of Woodside <b>Mills.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>mill</b> became known as Woodside Liberty Plant #1 (commonly called <b>the</b> Big <b>Mill),</b> and <b>the</b> second as Woodside Liberty Plant #2 (commonly called <b>the</b> Little <b>Mill).</b> Woodside <b>Mills</b> operated <b>the</b> plants until 1956, when the company was purchased by Dan River Mills of Virginia. At their height in <b>the</b> 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>mills</b> employed over one thousand workers and housed over one thousand looms. In the 1970s, <b>the</b> Woodside Liberty <b>Mills</b> were <b>the</b> world’s largest producers of oxford fabric, a popular fabric of <b>the</b> era. <b>The</b> <b>mills</b> were again purchased in the early 1980s by Greenwood Mills, which maintained control of <b>the</b> <b>mills</b> until local textile industry declined in the 1990s due largely to foreign competition.
