5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, ash clouds, falling volcanic ash, pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As volcanic ash can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of volcanic ash, {{also known as}} tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|E
5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area {{would be the first to}} be hit by floods in the event of a tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E

Craig, who has not yet professed his love for Sophie, becomes upset; he accosts the Doctor and demands that he leave, which forces the Doctor to reveal his history and his reason for being in the flat.|$|E

All this, to any person with natural affection for the young, is horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|Using {{the power}} of a {{powerful}} substance known as aer, mankind is in an age of discovery and prosperity. The crystallized form of aer, which is known as Apatheia, {{is considered to be a}} very powerful energy source as it is essential <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>life.</b> To protect towns from attacks by monsters, large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns. One day, in a forest near the town of Shizontania, Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo, two knights who have just joined the Niren Corps, together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members, Hisca and Chastel, are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area.|$|E
5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>life,</b> {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but stopped short after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E

5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>life.</b> On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E
5|$|Some researchers, {{as well as}} some timber {{companies}} and private citizens, understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems. Fire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter, allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients. Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk. As early as 1924, environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems, and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species. Over the next 40 years, increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems. In 1963, a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks. The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems. By 1968, the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes. The service determined that fires that started naturally (by lightning) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk <b>to</b> <b>human</b> <b>life</b> and property. The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions, controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems. Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn.|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{problems}} now facing the human race on Earth are, in fact, life support issues. Decline of air Quality {{as a result of}} industrial and automotive emissions, pollution of ground water by organic pesticides or solvents, and the disposal of solid wastes are all examples of environmental problems that we must solve <b>to</b> sustain <b>human</b> <b>life.</b> The technologies currently under development to solve {{the problems}} of supporting <b>human</b> <b>life</b> for advanced space missions are extraordinarily synergistic with these environmental problems. The development of these technologies (including both physicochemical and bioregenerative types) is increasingly focused on closing the life support loop by removing and recycling contaminants and wastes to produce the materials necessary <b>to</b> sustain <b>human</b> <b>life.</b> By so doing, this technology development effort also focuses automatically on reducing resupply logistics requirements and increasing crew safety through increased self-sufficiency.
