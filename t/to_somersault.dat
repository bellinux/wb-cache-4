5|$|Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the protagonist Samus Aran from a first-person perspective, and it takes place in an open-ended world with interconnected regions. Gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, and shooting enemies. Progress through the game requires both dimensions to be explored, using power-ups that Samus acquires over time. Equipment players collect include the Screw Attack, which allows Samus <b>to</b> <b>somersault</b> in midair and off certain surfaces, and new beam weapons that have limited ammunition.|$|E

Continuing the moose's flight in his mind he saw that it must pass the trunk. He resolved on one more shot, and in the empty air above the trunk he aimed and steadied his wavering rifle. The animal sprang into his field of vision, with lifted fore-legs as it took the leap. He pulled the trigger. With the explosion the moose seemed <b>to</b> <b>somersault</b> in the air. It crashed down to earth in the snow beyond and flurried the snow into dust.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Biomechanics [© Elsevier]. The definitive version is available at: www. jbiomech. com/Performing complex somersaulting skills during the flight phase of tumbling requires the generation of linear and angular momenta during the approach and takeoff phases. This paper investigates how approach characteristics and takeoff technique affect performance with a view <b>to</b> maximising <b>somersault</b> rotation in tumbling. A five-segment planar simulation model, customised to an elite gymnast, was used to produce a simulation which closely matched a recorded performance of a double layout somersault by the elite gymnast. Three optimisations were carried out <b>to</b> maximise <b>somersault</b> rotation with different sets of initial conditions. Using the same initial linear and angular momentum as the double layout somersault and varying the joint torque activation timings allowed a double straight <b>somersault</b> <b>to</b> be performed with 19...|$|R

50|$|On May 10, 1912, Martin flew a {{self-built}} seaplane from Newport Bay, California to Avalon on Catalina Island, {{then back}} across the channel. This broke the earlier English Channel record for over-water flight. Martin's total distance was 68 mi, with the Newport-Avalon leg taking 37 minutes. He picked up a bag of mail on the island on the way, and was presented with $100 ($ in 2011) prize for his achievement. In 1913, Martin was not as fortunate while competing in the Great Lakes Reliability Cruise, a 900 mi race of seaplanes around the Great Lakes. Martin's pontoon hit a wave at high speed and low altitude, causing the plane <b>to</b> <b>somersault,</b> and sink to the bottom with Martin, who escaped and attempted to salvage the plane to finish the race.|$|E
5000|$|The city name {{originates}} from Saults de Sainte-Marie, archaic French for [...] "Saint Mary's Falls", {{a reference}} to the rapids of Saint Marys River. Etymologically, the word sault comes from an archaic spelling of saut (from sauter), which translates most accurately in this usage to the English word cataract. This in turn derives from the French word for [...] "leap" [...] or [...] "jump" [...] (similar <b>to</b> <b>somersault).</b> Citations dating back to 1600 use the sault spelling to mean a cataract, waterfall or rapids. In modern French, however, the words chutes or rapides are more usual. Sault survives almost exclusively in geographic names dating from the 17th century. (See also Long Sault, Ontario, Sault St. Louis, Quebec, and Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, New Brunswick, three other place names where [...] "sault" [...] also carries this meaning.) ...|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Cróquer also competed {{regularly}} in sports car racing.

He then won the national championship in 1954 and joined the Maserati team in the First International Grand Prix of Caracas in November 1955, where he faced Jean Behra, Eugenio Castellotti, Juan Manuel Fangio, Stirling Moss, Luigi Musso and Alfonso de Portago, among other driving celebrities. A short time after that, Cróquer was competing in the Carrera de la Cordialidad, held in December 1955 between the cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena in Colombia. He was fatally injured when his Maserati 200S apparently suffered a mechanical failure on a fast curve, which caused the car <b>to</b> <b>somersault</b> a number of times.

The semi-final in front of a crowd of over 100,000 at Hampden saw Celtic beat Rangers 5-0. Celtic met Dundee in the final on 11 April 1925.

40|$|Who is {{responsible}} for the Sahel disaster? How could such a severe famine occur in the Twentieth Century during this age of modern medicine, the Green Revolution and space technology? The answer, I believe, lies in unchanging human nature. Procrastination, failure to take responsibility, lack of a holistic point of view, greed and indecisiveness {{are just a few of}} the human failings that caused a drought <b>to</b> <b>somersault</b> into a famine. While only 'a few people or organizations actually possess the power to aid countries in trouble, must the rest of us be forced to idly stand by while thousands starve? Is there not a way to make those in power see the need for swift action, or are human failings never to be overcome? Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary describes drought as a prolonged period of dryness or a chronic shortage or lack of something. In the case of the Sahel drought from approximately 1967 to 1976 in sub-Saharan Africa, not only was there a lack of rain, but also a chronic shortage of relief planning and aid. There are a myriad of reasons for this oversight many of which will be looked at shortly. First, however, it is important to know exactly what drought is and to realize that there is more than one cause of decreased precipitation. Only by attempting to understand how man's actions have affected weather and how his actions may cause future disturbances such as drought can people make a concerted effort to avoid actions that may cause disasters. It may be too late to avert some phenomenae, in which case, some sort of realistic plan should be implemented to deal with them. In coping with any disaster, it is important to know if it is just a freak occurrence or if it is cyclic in nature. In any planning, the future must be taken into account and planning for drought-stricken areas is no exception...|$|E
