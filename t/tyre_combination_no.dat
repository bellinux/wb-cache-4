5000|$|In 1958, a Royal Enfield Super Meteor {{was used}} by the Transport Research Laboratory to test the Maxaret {{anti-lock}} brake on motorcycles. [...] The Maxaret works by detecting rapid decelerations of the wheel that may cause it to lock and releases and re-applies hydraulic pressure to the brake several times a second, keeping the average braking effort at the maximum that can be used by the road surface and <b>tyre</b> <b>combination.</b> The experiments demonstrated that anti-lock brakes could be of great value on motorcycles, where skidding is involved in a high proportion of accidents. Stopping distances were reduced in almost all the tests, compared with locked wheel braking, but particularly on slippery surfaces, where the improvement could be as much as 30 per cent. Royal Enfield's Technical Director at the time, Tony Wilson-Jones, saw little future in the system and it was not put into production by the company.|$|R

40|$|When {{constructing}} a tyre, {{it is of}} importance that improvements and planned changes are not only physically measurable, but that they also can be perceived by a listener. Tyre/road noise becomes a more important focus area, especially with the growing market of electric vehicles. In the design of tyre/road sound, there are three main aims: to reduce the overall sound level, to increase pleasantness {{and to do so}} still maintaining the carried information about e. g. driving conditions. To be able to do this, an understanding of how physical changes in a tyre are reflected in the perception of the same tyre is essential. In the present study, the aim is thus to determine if the rolling noise of a tyre can be both differentiated and characterized by its perceptual qualities. The focus is on the perception of the sound outside the car, perceived by, for example, a pedestrian. Listeners have judged different road <b>tyre</b> <b>combinations</b> and their perception in terms of their emotional responses (pleasantness, activation and stress) and their psychoacoustic responses (loudnes s, sharpness, roughness, and pitch). The results confirmed that rolling noise can be perceptually differentiated. Further, it is possible to differentiate between the effects of the street and the effects of the tyre on all emotional and most psychoacoustic parameters. The results suggest that changes to both road surfaces and tyres can affect both emotional and psychoacoustic perceptual qualities...|$|R

40|$|With the {{technological}} computer advancements, vehicle development is relying {{more and more}} on simulations as an alternative to testing. A similar trend follows in aerodynamic development of vehicles where Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) simulations are increasing in complexity and accuracy. Even though these simulations have previously been used to evaluate trends of different design and analyse the flow field around the car, they are aimed at being used to predict exact figures in the future. Wheel flow aerodynamics {{has been the focus of}} CFD research for several years now especially with the expected introduction of the WLTP regulations, which will require car manufactures to evaluate the drag of the vehicle for all different rim and <b>tyre</b> <b>combinations</b> the car could have in order to determine its official fuel consumption. Thus correct and accurate modelling of tyre and rims in CFD is a high priority for vehicle manufacturers in order optimize vehicle design without large increases in testing costs. This thesis investigates the effects of different wheel geometries as well as different wheel rotation modelling techniques and their effect on overall vehicle forces. 	An important parameter to consider when validating simulations is the cooling flow as the amount of air going through the vehicles engine bay changes the airflow around the car thus affecting the flow directed towards the wheels. In this thesis a novel, simple, and quick method for measuring cooling flow is introduced. This allows the monitoring of cooling flow during aerodynamic development at low costs especially with the introduction of grill shutters as a further step to reduce aerodynamic drag when cooling flow is not needed...|$|R
