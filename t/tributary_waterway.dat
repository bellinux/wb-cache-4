50|$|In the 16th century most of {{the grain}} {{exported}} was leaving Poland through Gdańsk, which because of its location at the terminal point of the Vistula and its <b>tributaries</b> <b>waterway</b> and of its Baltic seaport trade role became the wealthiest, most highly developed (by far the largest center of crafts and manufacturing) and most autonomous of the Polish cities. Other towns were negatively affected by Gdańsk's near-monopoly in foreign trade. During the reign of Stephen Báthory Poland ruled two main Baltic Sea ports: Gdańsk controlling the Vistula river trade and Riga controlling the Western Dvina trade. Both cities were among {{the largest in the}} country. Around 70% the exports from Gdańsk were of grain.|$|R

50|$|By the 1790s, New England was {{exporting}} 36 million feet of pine {{boards and}} 300 ship masts annually, with over 75 percent coming from Massachusetts (which included Maine) and another 20 percent coming from New Hampshire. By 1830, Bangor, Maine {{had become the}} world's largest lumber shipping port and would move over 8.7 trillion board feet of timber over the following sixty years. Throughout the 19th century, Americans headed west in search of new land and natural resources. The timber supply in the Midwest was dwindling, forcing loggers to seek new sources of “green gold.” In {{the early decades of}} the 19th century, the Great Lakes and their <b>tributary</b> <b>waterways</b> flowed through areas densely covered with virgin timber. The timber became a primary resource for both regional and national building materials, industry, and fuel.|$|R
40|$|The Waterway Enhancement Programme was {{established}} by the Christchurch City Council {{as part of an}} ongoing commitment towards the sustainable management of <b>tributary</b> <b>waterways</b> throughout the city. Enhancement activities involve landscaping to emphasise the natural contours of the waterways, and planting native species to promote the establishment and maintenance of aquatic and bird life. Waterway enhancement activities provide increased opportunities for recreation and education, as well as drainage and water quality improvement services for the city. To the extent that they improve the habitat for native flora and fauna they also contribute to a valuable natural ecosystem that contributes to {{the quality of life for}} all Christchurch residents. The public good aspects of these benefits raise interesting policy questions regarding willingness to pay for waterway enhancement services, and the role of the public sector in their provision. In this study a simple statistical model is specified and used to explore the relationship between property values and proximity to a particular waterway enhancement site. Results indicate a statistically significant positive relationship between property values and waterway proximity, and suggest a positive willingness to pay for enhancement activities...|$|R
2500|$|The land {{surface in}} and around the city of Houston is {{composed}} of alternating layers of red, gray, sandy brown, and black organic clay; these strata generally dip to the southeast at a slope of 0.06% ( [...] of vertical change for every [...] of distance traveled). These soils were deposited by <b>tributaries</b> of local <b>waterways,</b> particularly the Brazos and Trinity rivers. There is a considerable contrast in soil composition to the north around Cypress Creek; most of the surface there consists of tan-colored sand with small amounts of gray clay. The north and northwestern regions of Houston and Harris County feature a slightly steeper slope than other parts of the city, with occasional escarpments caused by faulting or erosion.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{maintain}} records of hydrographic and climatological data {{as an aid}} in evaluating changes in bay fauna. To summarize these records in a form which makes their interpretation as components of the biotic environment more convenient. Procedure: Hydrographic and climatological data were recorded at the Seabrook Field Laboratory by various staff members. Hydrographic data, including water temperatures, salinities, and sometimes turbidity and tidal data were recorded from stations established in Galveston, Trinity, East and West Bays and their <b>tributaries,</b> the Intracoastal <b>Waterway,</b> and the Gulf beach. These data have been compiled in various ways and interpreted as follows: Findings; I. Data from the Field Laboratory Bulkhead Previous to January 1959 regular water samples were sometimes taken at the Field Laboratory bulkhead by various workers and checked for temperature, salinity, etc. But beginning January, 1959, a regular weather observation and water analysis schedule was set up at the Field Laboratory with daily observations at 8 : 00 AM and 4 : 00 PM on work days. Water levels, air temperature, amount of precipitation, visibility, cloud coverage, wind direction and velocity, and barometric pressure are recorded and determinations of the temperature, salinity, turbidity, pH, and dis solved oxygen content of the water are made.

40|$|In early August, 1975, the Center for Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio, {{carried out}} an {{appraisal}} of archaeological and historical resources {{in certain areas}} along the Gulf Intracoastal <b>Waterway</b> <b>Tributary</b> Channel to Aransas Pass, Texas. The work was done {{under the terms of}} a contract (DACW 64 - 76 -M- 0040) between The University of Texas at San Antonio and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District. The Corps of Engineers proposes to modify the present tributary channel to Aransas Pass through a program of dredging which will both widen and deepen the channel in Nueces and San Patricio Counties. As a result of the proposed dredging operations, several areas adjacent to the tributary channel will be affected by the disposal of dredged material. Therefore, the investigations by the Center were designed to determine if archaeological and/or historical resources existed within those areas which were to be affected. 1 n accordance with Corps of Engineers specifications, the Center had the further responsibilities of evaluating the significance and importance of such resources, of ascertaining the potential effects of dredging and disposal activities on the resources, and of recommending means of mitigating damage or destruction of such resources...|$|R
40|$|Over {{more than}} 50 years, the {{activity}} {{of one of the}} world’s largest metal alloy producers, located in the margins of São Francisco River (SF), Brazil, have produced tailings that have been accumulated in the surrounding area. The lack of an environmental concern lead to a heavy metal contamination, much above the critical levels, which accumulate in the soils of the drainage area and in the sediments and water column of the nearby waterways. To reverse the negative impact of this contamination and to prevent its extension to the largest Brazilian river, under the request and payment of the company, it has been conducted an extensive study to characterize the area affected by the industrial activity, with particular emphasis on the geochemistry of the soils, sediments and water column. This work aims to discuss the heavy metal contamination level of the water of a small <b>waterway,</b> <b>tributary</b> of SF, which receive all the drainage coming from the affected area. Beside the knowledge of its extent, this study also sought to discuss its linkage with the levels and chemical forms in which metals occur in the sediments accumulated in the bottom and alluvial plains. The analysis of the waterway was performed in the rainy and dried season. Two different studies had been done: (1) water sampling; (2) placing DGT (Chelex and Fe-oxide Gel) at various depths in water for 5 days. At the time of the sampling and of the placement/collection of DGT, it was recorded the time and measured physical-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential). Water samples (acidified) and DGT, were chilled since the time of collection until the analysis in laboratory. The resin of the DGT was placed in acid solutions to give the passage of ions into the aqueous phase (1) 1 M HNO 3 solution, 24 H for Chelex DGT and (2) 0, 25 M H 2 SO 4 solution, followed by shaking for 2 H, for Fe-Oxide DGT. The solutions and the filtered water samples were analyzed for metallic elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) by ICP-OES in axial view mode, coupled with an ultrasonic nebulizer. The analysis of physic-chemical parameters showed higher values of Eh and conductivity and a pH reduction in the dried period. Among the analyzed elements, Cd, Cu, Mn and Zn are in failure in respect of the limit allowed for fresh waters, in particular Zn which has contents about a hundred times higher. These values are in agreement with the high concentrations found in sediments and the chemical forms in which metals preferably occur, soluble phase in pore water and as exchangeable cations, demonstrating the high mobility of these elements and their environmental hazard. For the effectiveness of the environmental remediation of this area and for the improvement of the water quality, it’s urgent to prevent the migration of toxic elements to São Francisco River. To do this, it’s necessary to cease all contamination sources and to establish a soil and alluvium recovery strategy, which lead to the chemical immobilization of these metals...|$|R
