5|$|Confederate Army {{officers}} {{indicated their}} military affiliation with different colored facing on their coats or jackets. The colors were red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, light blue for infantry, and black for medical. A very distinctive {{feature of the}} Confederate officers uniforms was the gold braid Austrian knots on <b>their</b> <b>sleeves.</b> More elaborate braiding indicated higher rank and some knots almost reached the shoulder. However, a general order, issued in 1862, called for the Austrian knots not to be worn in the field, as this made officers conspicuous to enemy combatants.|$|E
5|$|For the 1924–25 season, the Canadiens {{celebrated their}} world {{champion}} status {{with a special}} jersey design. The team moved their CH logo to <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> and played with a large world globe logo crest on their jersey fronts. Montreal {{finished third in the}} league standings and defeated Toronto in the semi-final. The players on the first place Hamilton Tigers refused to participate in a playoff series unless they were paid an additional $200 each. When they failed to relent on their demands, NHL president Frank Calder suspended the entire team, and declared the Canadiens to be the league champions. The Habs thus traveled to the Pacific Coast to play the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the 1925 Stanley Cup Final. The Cougars won the best-of-five series 3–1; {{it was the last time}} a non-NHL team won the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} polyester mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a natural fibre. Most professional clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E

25|$|The bombs used by {{the pair}} varied and were crudely made from carbon dioxide canisters, {{galvanized}} pipe, and metal propane bottles. The bombs were primed with matches placed at one end. Both had striker tips on <b>their</b> <b>sleeves.</b> When they rubbed against the bomb, the match head would light the fuse. The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs.

25|$|The twins {{made their}} first {{representative}} cricket team {{when they were}} selected the Bankstown District under-10s {{at the age of}} eight. They were both sent off the field because <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> were of the wrong colourBev had knitted on the colours of the team, but everyone else was wearing plain white. In 1976, the twins were the youngest ever to be selected in the New South Wales Primary Schools' soccer team. Playing for Panania Primary School, the twins swept their school to win the Umbro International Shield, a statewide knockout soccer competition, scoring all of their team's three goals in the final. They were a key part of their school's consecutive state cricket championships, and were part of the school tennis team that came second in the state in their final year. In their final year, Mark was the captain of the state primary school cricket and tennis teams, both of which won the national championships. Steve was the vice-captain of the cricket team and captained the state soccer team. The twins were instrumental in New South Wales winning the cricket carnival without a defeat, in one match combining in a partnership of 150.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2007–08 season, Leinster's kits {{have been}} {{supplied}} by Canterbury of New Zealand. Bank of Ireland, the country's oldest banking institution are Leinster's primary sponsors {{appearing in the}} front of their shirt, <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> the top back of their shirt and the front right of their shorts. The Bank of Ireland symbol appeared on Leinster's front right and front left collars. However, on occasion the team will wear a shirt adorned with the logo of another sponsor due to a promotion run annually by the bank offering up the sponsorship space to an Irish business by way of a competition to win the right to become sponsor for a day. During the 2013–14 season the contest was won by Dublin-based meat wholesaler Gahan Meats and for 2014–15 the shirt sponsorship winners were accounting software provider Big Red Cloud. The sponsorship prize package is valued at €50,000 and attracts hundreds of companies keen to be shortlisted each year. The left of Leinster's back shorts had Bank of Ireland between 2009 and 2013 where it was replaced by Bank of Ireland's Twitter address right up until 2015 where it was replaced by Laya Healthcare. The teams 'official airline' is Irelands' CityJet.|$|E
500|$|In Royal Navy slang, a {{midshipman}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "snotty". Two popular stories give origins for the term: the first claims that it arose from a shortage of handkerchiefs among midshipmen, who would consequently use <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> to wipe their noses. Prince William, later William IV, is sometimes cited as a notorious example of this practice among midshipmen. [...] The other story claims that the three buttons formerly sewn onto midshipmen's jacket cuffs were placed there to prevent them from wiping their noses on <b>their</b> <b>sleeves.</b>|$|E

500|$|After the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor, the U.S. {{government}} called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management {{and labor unions}} throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as General Motors (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the United Auto Workers union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, [...] "Together We Can Do It!" [...] and [...] "Keep 'Em Firing!" [...] In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with {{the ultimate goal of}} preventing the government from exerting greater control over production.|$|E
50|$|The Kriegsmarine {{rating system}} was {{designed}} to indicate the particular career specialty of enlisted sailors, petty officers, and chief petty officers.

500|$|The Junta faced [...] strong {{opposition}} from the beginning: it was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia, still loyal to the absolutist factions; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter-revolution at Córdoba. Mariano Moreno, an unimportant politician up to that point, became {{the leader of the}} most radical supporters of the Junta. He was supported by the popular leaders Domingo French and Antonio Beruti, Dupuy, Donado, Orma, and Cardozo; and priests like Grela and Aparicio. Historian Carlos Ibarguren described that Morenist youths roamed the streets preaching new ideas to each pedestrian they found, turned the [...] "Marcos" [...] coffee shop into a political hall, and proposed that all social classes should be illustrated. Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli supported Moreno within the Junta, and French was promoted to Colonel of the regiment [...] "América".

500|$|Dougan {{dropped down}} to the Third Division to join Peterborough United for a £21,000 fee {{in the summer of}} 1963. He later {{admitted}} that [...] "I had made a mistake in going to the Third Division when I was a First Division player". The move did though have its benefits, as the club's physiotherapist managed to diagnose and eventually correct an ankle injury that had troubled Dougan for the previous five years. He scored 20 goals in 38 league games in the 1963–64 season, {{and at the end of}} the campaign manager Jack Fairbrother was replaced by Gordon Clark, who Dougan said [...] "renewed my sense of vocation". He then scored seven goals in the club's 1964–65 run to the sixth round of the FA Cup, including one in their 2–1 win over top-flight Arsenal at London Road. Peterborough's league promotion campaign failed despite their cup exploits, causing Dougan to remark that [...] "after playing at Stamford Bridge it was not easy to go to places like Gillingham on a cold Tuesday evening, where they are waiting for you with <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> rolled up".|$|E
500|$|According to PETA, Lisa {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{vegetarian}} characters on primetime television.

[...] Japanese broadcasters reversed viewer dislike of the series by focusing marketing of the show on Lisa. Lisa's well-intended but ill-fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and community struck a chord with Japanese audiences. Mario D'Amato, a specialist in Buddhist studies at Rollins College in Florida, described Lisa as [...] "open-minded, reflective, ethical, and interested in improving herself in various ways, while still preserving a childlike sense of innocence. These are all excellent qualities, ones which are espoused by many Buddhist traditions." ...|$|E
