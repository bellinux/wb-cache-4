5|$|Macedonia (as {{a current}} {{geographical}} term) {{refers to a}} region of the Balkan peninsula in south-eastern Europe, covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Aliákmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strymónas rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{observations}} by the Chandra X-ray Observatory revealed six {{sources in}} the HDF, which were found <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> three elliptical galaxies: one spiral galaxy, one active galactic nucleus and one extremely red object, {{thought to be a}} distant galaxy containing a large amount of dust absorbing its blue light emissions.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{reformed}} {{the provincial}} administration, establishing a three-tiered provincial hierarchy, {{in place of}} the previous single-tier structure. The original 42 provinces of the Principate were almost tripled in number to c. 120. These were grouped into 12 divisions called dioceses, each under a vicarius, in turn grouped into 4 praetorian prefectures, <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> the areas of command assigned to the four Tetrarchs, who were each assisted by a chief-of-staff called a praefectus praetorio (not be confused with the commanders of the Praetorian Guard, who held the same title). The aim of this fragmentation of provincial administration was probably to reduce the possibility of military rebellion by governors (by reducing the forces they each controlled).|$|E

5|$|Spots {{were found}} <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed in the {{vicinity}} of moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{building and}} rebuilding of royal palaces in the Renaissance style probably began under James III and accelerated under James IV. These works {{have been seen}} as directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun, and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace of a palatium ad modem castri (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed, and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Flower {{was created by}} Vincent Diamante, a video game music {{composer}} and professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin {{when they were both}} at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and adjusting the music dynamically <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> changes in the game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.|$|E

5|$|As {{a change}} from earlier games by the developer, Sabreman is invulnerable to enemies and is instead knocked back in a bounce by their touch. However, Sabreman will fall to his death if knocked off a precipice. The player begins with six lives and few extras can be found {{throughout}} the game. Blue gemstone power-ups turn Sabreman invincible to enemy touch for {{a limited amount of}} time. Enemies include harpies and gargoyles, who can be killed with Sabreman's weapon. Later in the game, eagles can pick up and drop Sabreman. Underwurlde has three possible endings, and each was designed <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> the plots of the three planned sequels in the Sabreman series. The player receives a score calculated by the number of objects acquired, enemies defeated, and percentage of rooms visited. The game also supports keyboard and joystick control, and as with other games from the developer, the instructions packaged with Underwurlde were cryptic, and left the player to figure out the controls and sequence on their own. The Commodore 64 version of the game is similar to the original in appearance and gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level were chosen <b>to</b> <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> the game {{world and the}} level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in correlation with the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in correlation {{with the amount of}} petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended to be able to stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E

50|$|For example, if one polygon has {{sequential}} sides a, b, c, d, and e and {{the other}} has sequential sides v, w, x, y, and z, and if b and w are corresponding sides, then side a (adjacent <b>to</b> b) must <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> either v or x (both adjacent to w). If a and v <b>correspond</b> <b>to</b> each other, then c <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> x, d <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> y, and e <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> z; hence the ith element of the sequence abcde <b>corresponds</b> <b>to</b> the ith element of the sequence vwxyz for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
