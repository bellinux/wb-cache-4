These effector functions, however, are not only a feature ofmature macrophages. We recently described a nonadherent and nonphagocytic macrophage precursor cell that is able to spontaneously and extracellularly kill a broad pattern of <b>target</b> <b>cells,</b> <b>ranging</b> from YAC- 1 lymphoma cells to Candida albicans yeast phase microorganisms to protozoa of the genus Leishmania (5). These macrophage precursors can be isolated and purified from spleen and liver ofnormal mice, and of mice in which inflammatory conditions had been induced (6, 7). Macrophage precursors endowed with fungicidal, leishmanicidal, and NK activity could also be reproducibly generated in 3 -d-old bone marrow liquid cultures supplemented with L cell-conditioned media as a source ofCSF 1 (8 - 10). In keeping with results from other laboratories (11), the NK activity of these cells was somewhat lower than that exerted by their organ-derived counterparts.

40|$|The natural {{evolution}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 infection often includes a switch in coreceptor preference late in infection from CCR 5 to CXCR 4, a change associated with expanded <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> and worsened clinical prognosis. Why coreceptor switching takes so long is puzzling, since it requires as few as one to two mutations. Here we report three obstacles that impede the CCR 5 -to-CXCR 4 switch. Coreceptor switch variants were selected by <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> replacement in vitro. Most switch variants showed diminished replication compared to their parental R 5 isolate. Transitional intermediates were more sensitive to both CCR 5 and CXCR 4 inhibitors than either the parental R 5 virus or the final R 5 X 4 (or rare X 4) variant. The small number of mutations in viruses selected for CXCR 4 use were distinctly nonrandom, with a dominance of charged amino acid substitutions encoded by G-to-A transitions, changes in N-linked glycosylation sites, and isolate-specific mutation patterns. Diminished replication fitness, less-efficient coreceptor use, and unique mutational path-ways may explain the long delay from primary infection until the emergence of CXCR 4 -using viruses. The entry of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) into <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> requires binding of the viral envelope glyco-protein gp 120 to CD 4 and one of two chemokine receptors, CCR 5 or CXCR 4 (1, 9, 15, 17, 19).

We also analyzed the effect of hemolysin on invasion of human epithelial cells and found that H. ducreyi strains expressing cloned hemolysin genes showed a 10 -fold increase in invasion compared to the control strain.

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacteria that express contact-dependent growth {{inhibition}} (CDI) systems outcompete siblings that lack immunity, suggesting that CDImediates intercellular competition. To further explore {{the role of}} CDI in competition, we determined the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> of the CDIEC 93 system from Escherichia coli EC 93. The CdiAEC 93 effector protein recognizes the widely con-served BamA protein as a receptor, yet E. coli EC 93 does not inhibit other enterobacterial species. The predicted membrane to-pology of BamA indicates that three of its extracellular loops vary considerably between species, suggesting that loop heteroge-neity may control CDI specificity. Consistent with this hypothesis, other enterobacteria are sensitized to CDIEC 93 upon the expression of E. coli bamA and E. coli cells become CDIEC 93 resistant when bamA is replaced with alleles from other species. Our data indicate that BamA loops 6 and 7 form the CdiAEC 93 -binding epitope and their variation between species restricts CDIEC 93 <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> selection. Although BamA loops 6 and 7 vary dramatically between species, these regions are identical in hundreds of E. coli strains, suggesting that BamAEcoli and CdiAEC 93 {{play a role in}} self-nonself discrimination. IMPORTANCE Contact-dependent {{growth inhibition}} (CDI) systems are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria, enabling them to bind to neighboring bacterial cells and deliver protein toxins that inhibit cell growth. In this study, we tested the role of CDI in interspecies competition using intestinal isolate Escherichia coli EC 93 as an inhibitor cell model. Although E. coli EC 93 inhibits different E. coli strains, other bacterial species from the intestine are completely resistant to CDI. We show that resis-tance is due to small variations in the CDI receptor that prevent other species from being recognized as <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> CDI recepto...|$|R

Mice infected with wild-type VSV died from an acute encephalitis characterized by neuronal necrosis and efficient virus replication in both brain and spinal cord. In contrast, with VSV ts pi 364, the most prominent histopathological feature was destruction of the ependyma of the lateral ventricles. Virus antigen was also limited to the leptomeninges and the lateral ventricles. Infected mice survived and developed hydrocephalus. Replication of ts pi 364 in the brain was 10 - to 100 - fold {{less than that of}} wild-type VSV, and appearance of virus in the spinal cord was delayed. VSV ts pi 364 was isolated from mouse cells persistently infected with VSV. Another VSV ts pi mutant, isolated from the same persistent infection, behaved in vivo like wild-type VSV, even though both mutants were very similar in plaque size, reversion frequency, cut-off temperature, and synthesis of virus-specific proteins at semipermissive temperature. These results strongly suggest that VSV ts pi 364 has a second, non-ts mutation which results in a restricted <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> in vivo; wild-type VSV can infect both neurons and ependymal cells, whereas ts pi 364 does not replicate in neurons...|$|R

Using the EBV P 3 HR- 1 strain, we have reproduced in long-term culture of SVK epithelial cells an unusual pattern of infection previously observed in a subset of tumor biopsy samples: the persistence of het DNA {{in the absence of the}} parental helper virus. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of infected cell subclones indicated the retention of het DNA in an integrated form. Incorporation of an intact het DNA molecule was confirmed by PCR, using primers that framed junctions of the four rearranged EBV DNA segments comprising P 3 HR- 1 -derived het DNA. Structural analysis of EBV terminal repeats revealed a banding pattern consistent with the integration of het DNA as a concatemer. Linkage of concatemeric monomers was defined at a nucleotide level, and that junctional sequence was detected in cell-free P 3 HR- 1 virion DNA, confirming that subgenomic het DNA was packaged into infectious particles in a concatemeric configuration. Stable integration into cells having lost the standard viral genome allowed the unambiguous designation of het DNA as the source for viral gene products potentially encoded by both. Continuous expression of the latency-to-lytic switch protein Zta and detection of the BALF 4 gene product gB, known to expand the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> of standard virus when incorporated at augmented levels into infectious progeny, add to a presumption of het DNA-enhanced pathogenesis in diseases of EBV reactivation...|$|R

Adherent cells obtained from cord blood or from the peripheral blood of old donors had natural cytotoxicity similar to monocytes obtained from young adult volunteers. Peripheral blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages showed enhanced cytolytic activity after exposure to partially purified human fibroblast interferon.

These mice were then challenged with either murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) and sacrificed 3 days later. No interleukin 2 infusions were given. Mice receiving as few as 5 x 10 (5) LAK cells had several 100 -fold decreases in spleen MCMV titers as compared with untreated mice. This treatment had no effect on spleen LCMV titers. The LAK cell cultures contained 10 to 17 % NK 1. 1 +, 50 to 55 % Lyt- 2 +, and 33 to 50 % immunoglobulin D+ cells. Double fluorescence labeling and in vitro cytotoxicity assays with fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed at least two mutually exclusive killer cell populations. NK 1. 1 + LAK cells resembled freshly isolated activated NK cells with regard to <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> (YAC- 1 <b>cell</b> killing greater than L- 929, P 815, and EL- 4 cell killing), large granular lymphocyte (LGL) morphology, and decreased ability to lyse interferon (IFN) -treated <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Lyt- 2 + LAK <b>cells</b> lysed the <b>targets</b> mentioned above but at lower levels and without the differences in susceptibility mentioned above. These Lyt- 2 + LAK cells also had a decreased ability to lyse IFN-treated targets, in contrast to classic cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which lyse IFN-treated targets far more efficiently than untreated targets. Purified populations of LAK cells obtained by fluorescence-activated cell sorting were used in the antiviral protection model. The results showed that protection against MCMV could be mediated by NK 1. 1 +, NK 1. 1 -, Lyt- 2 +, Lyt- 2 -, and IgD- populations but not by IgD+ cells. The five protective populations all had in common the LGL phenotype and cytotoxic activity in vitro. The IgD+ population did not contain LGLs, lyse <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro, or mediate an antiviral effect in vivo.

The frequencies of cells capable of extensive proliferation under these culture conditions were 0. 52 - 0. 73, 0. 98 - 1. 11, and less than 0. 02 in peripheral blood mononuclear, E-rosette-positive, and E-rosette-negative cell populations, respectively. The clonogenic potential of virtually all T cells was confirmed in experiments using single cells isolated by micromanipulation. Clone size ranged between 5 and 30 X 10 (4) cells on day 14 of culture. The same microculture system was used to determine the precursor frequency of all cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL-P).

40|$|Radiation-induced {{pancytopenia}} {{proved to}} be a suitable model system in mice and rhesus monkeys for studying thrombopoietin (TPO) <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> <b>range</b> and efficacy. TPO was highly effective in rhesus monkeys exposed to the mid-lethal dose of 5 Gy (300 kV x-rays) TBI, a model in which it alleviated thrombocytopenia, promoted red cell reconstitution, accelerated reconstitution of immature CD 34 + bone marrow cells, and potentiated the response to growth factors such as GM-CSF and G-CSF. In contrast to the results in the 5 Gy TBI model, TPO was ineffective following transplantation of limited numbers of autologous bone marrow or highly purified stem cells in monkeys conditioned with 8 Gy TBI. In the 5 Gy model, a single dose of TPO augmented by GM-CSF 24 h after TBI was effective in preventing thrombocytopenia. The strong erythropoietic stimulation may result in iron depletion, and TPO treatment should be accompanied by monitoring of iron status. This preclinical evaluation thus identified TPO as a potential major therapeutic agent for counteracting radiation-induced pancytopenia and demonstrated pronounced stimulatory effects on the reconstitution of immature CD 34 + hemopoietic cells with multilineage potential. The latter observation explains the potentiation of the hematopoietic responses to G-CSF and GM-CSF when administered concomitantly. It also predicts the effective use of TPO to accelerate reconstitution of immature hematopoietic cells as well as possible synergistic effects in vivo with various other growth factors acting on immature stem cells and their direct lineage-committed progeny. The finding that a single dose of TPO might be sufficient for a clinically significant response emphasizes its potency and is of practical relevance. The heterogeneity of the TPO response encountered in the various models used for evaluation points to multiple mechanisms operating on the TPO response and heterogeneity of its <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Mechanistic mouse studies made apparent that the response of multilineage cells shortly after TBI to a single administration of TPO is quantitatively more important for optimal efficacy than the lineage-restricted response obtained at later intervals after TBI and emphasized the importance of a relatively high dose of TPO to overcome initial c-mpl-mediated clearance. Further elucidation of mechanisms determining efficacy might very well result in a further improvement, e. g., following transplantation of limited numbers of stem cells. Adverse effects of TPO administration to myelosuppressed or stem cell transplanted experimental animals were not observed...|$|R

Between days 1 and 5 postinfection (p. i.), both viruses induced a three- to fourfold increase in NK cell lytic activity in the livers of C 3 H/St mice and a three- to fourfold {{increase in the number}} of LGL in the organ. These LGL were characterized as NK cells on the basis of cell surface antigens, kinetics of appearance, <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> <b>range,</b> and morphology. By day 7 p. i., virus-specific, H- 2 -restricted, Thy- 1 +, Lyt- 2 +, CTL activity was present in the liver, and its appearance correlated with a second wave of LGL accumulation. CTL activity, total leukocyte number, and CTL/LGL number were at least fivefold higher in the livers of mice infected with LCMV-WE than with LCMV-ARM. The dramatic LCMV-WE-induced day 7 increases in total leukocytes and LGL were absent in athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, suggesting that the increases were T cell-dependent. LCMV- ARM infection of C 57 BL/ 6 mice induced significant spleen CTL activity but little liver CTL activity, whereas LCMV-WE infection resulted in significant liver CTL activity but minimal spleen CTL activity. Mice infected with the cytopathic hepatotropic viruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), experienced much greater increases in liver NK/LGL by day 3 p. i. than did mice infected with LCMV or injected with the interferon-inducer poly(I-C). MHV-infected mice homozygous for the beige (bg/bg) mutation also exhibited significant increases in liver NK/LGL cell number and activity, although the activity was less than heterozygote controls, and the morphology of the LGL granules was aberrant. These data show that the LGL accumulate in virus-infected organs, in this case, the liver. An early NK/LGL influx is most pronounced during infection with cytopathic hepatotropic viruses. This initial influx of NK/LGL is followed later by an influx of CTL also possessing LGL morphology.

The early and late accumulations of LGL in the virus-infected liver were associated with the appearance of two waves of LGL with blast cell morphology expressing the phenotypes of NK cells and CTL, respectively.

Our findings suggest that phage treatment can be used as an effective tool to decontaminate human MRSA from both hard surfaces and fabrics...|$|R
40|$|A novel motion {{compensation}} technique is presented {{for the purpose}} of forming focused ISAR images which exhibits the robustness of parametric methods but overcomes their convergence difficulties. Like the most commonly used parametric autofocus techniques in ISAR imaging (the image contrast maximization and entropy minimization methods) this is achieved by estimating a target's radial motion in order to correct for <b>target</b> scatterer <b>range</b> <b>cell</b> migration and phase error. Parametric methods generally suffer a major drawback, namely that their optimization algorithms often fail to converge to the optimal solution. This difficulty is overcome in the proposed method by employing a sequential approach to the optimization, estimating the radial motion of the target by means of a range profile cross-correlation, followed by a subspace-based technique involving singular value decomposition (SVD). This two-stage approach greatly simplifies the optimization process by allowing numerical searches to be implemented in solution spaces of reduced dimension. </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{cellular}} uptake of CLENs by the <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> {{was greater}} overall {{when compared to}} DoxilLP. Moreover, 4  T 1 doxorubicin loaded-CLENs demonstrated more significant growth inhibitory effects. Data also support greater activity against intended <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> compared to non-specific <b>target</b> (control) <b>cell</b> populations. A greater degree of selectivity was observed when both the lipid extracts used to prepare CLENs and the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> population were derived from the same organ tissue environment (i.e. breast). This result was highly consistent and reproducible. However, the most desirable results were achieved when CLENs were prepared directly from the <b>target</b> <b>cell,</b> when compared to <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> that shared the organ tissue environment only (Figs. 2 and 3).|$|R
40|$|The {{embodiment}} of the invention provides a cell switching method. The cell switching method comprises the following steps: receiving a physical cell identity (PCI) of a <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> from user equipment (UE); acquiring position information, wherein the position information is used for representing the position of the UE or controlling the position of a target base station of the target cell; determining the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> switched from the UE according to the PCI of the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> and the position information; sending a switching request to the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> switched from the UE, and performing UE switching. The {{embodiment of}} the invention further provides a base station and the UE, which are used for determining the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> switched from the UE according to the PCI of the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> and the position information. The phenomenon that the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> cannot be determined due to cell PCI collision can be avoided, and cell switching delay under the condition of the PCI collision is reduced...|$|R

40|$|We {{have shown}} that the {{hydroxyl}} radical scavengers sodium benzoate, phenol, dimethyl sulfoxide, sodium formate, and mannitol protect chicken erythrocyte (Ec) <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> from lysis by K-cells in plaque assays. The protection afforded by benzoate, phenol, mannitol, and dimethyl sulfoxide was abrogated if the <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> were pretreated with sodium chromate. Neither superoxide dismutase nor catalase protected Ec <b>target</b> <b>cells,</b> indicating that superoxide and H 2 O 2 are not involved in lysis. The lysis obtained on chromium-treated Ec <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of benzoate, phenol, and mannitol is likely due to singlet oxygen, because 1, 4 -diazabicyclo[2. 2. 2]octane and bilirubin, singlet oxygen scavengers, protected chromium-treated Ec <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> in the presence of phenol. Ec <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> not treated with chromium were not protected by either of the singlet oxygen scavengers...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} requirements for antigen presentation to {{a panel of}} MHC class I-and class II-restricted, influenza virus-specific CTL clones by controlling the form of virus presented on the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> surface. Both H- 2 K/D- and I region-restricted CTL recognize <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to infectious virus, but only the I region-restricted clones efficiently lysed histocompatible <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> pulsed with inactivated virus preparations. The isolated influenza hemagglutinin (HA) polypeptide also could sensitize <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> for recognition by class II-restricted, HA-specific CTL, but not by class I-restricted, HA- specific CTL. Inhibition of nascent viral protein synthesis abrogated the ability of <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> to present viral antigen relevant for class I-restricted CTL recognition. Significantly, presentation for class II- restricted recognition was unaffected in <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to preparations of either inactivated or infectious virus. This differential sensitivity suggested that these H- 2 I region-restricted CTL recognized viral polypeptides derived from the exogenously introduced virions, rather than viral polypeptides newly synthesized in the infected cell. In support of this contention, treatment of the <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine abolished recognition of infected <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> by class II-restricted CTL without diminishing class I-restricted recognition of infected <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Furthermore, when the influenza HA gene was introduced into <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> without exogenous HA polypeptide, the <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> that expressed the newly synthesized protein product of the HA gene were recognized only by H- 2 K/D-restricted CTL. These observations suggest that important differences may exist in requirements for antigen presentation between H- 2 K/D and H- 2 I region-restricted CTL. These differences may reflect {{the nature of the}} antigenic epitopes recognized by these two CTL subsets...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} using HBsAg-coated Chang <b>cells</b> as <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> {{was developed in}} order to measure cell-mediated immune reactions to HBsAg. The specificity of cytotoxic reactions was tested in experiments using Chang cells conjugated with human serum albumin. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) specific for the HBsAg-coated <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> was demonstrated up to dilutions of anti-HBsAg serum of 10, 000 : 1, when lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of normal individuals were added to the <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> Spontaneous cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) to HBsAg-coated <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> was demonstrated for lymphocytes from patients with hepatitis B and from patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH), but not for lymphocytes from healthy controls. The CMC of hepatitis B lymphocytes to HBsAg-coated <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> was inhibited in the presence of antiserum to HBsAg. In experiments using purified lymphocyte populations evidence is presented that the CMC is T-cell dependent. HLA-restriction of the CMC was not observed. The described cytotoxicity test system has the advantage that <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> conjugated with defined antigens are used and that relevant control <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> are available...|$|R

40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTL) {{kill their}} <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> via a contact- dependent mechanism {{that results in}} the perturbation of the <b>target</b> <b>cell's</b> plasma membrane and the fragmentation of the <b>target</b> <b>cell's</b> DNA into nucleosomal particles. The membrane disruption is presumed {{to be due to}} the action of perforin, while the DNA fragmentation is thought to be by the activation of an endogenous nuclease(s). DNA topoisomerases I and II are nuclear enzymes with inherent endonuclease activities. We have investigated their role in the CTL-induced DNA fragmentation process.

40|$|We {{found that}} rotavirus-specific protein {{synthesis}} {{was not necessary}} for recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In addition, CTLs lysed rotavirus-infected <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> prior to production of infectious virus. <b>Target</b> <b>cell</b> processing of rotavirus antigens for presentation to CTLs was enhanced by treatment of rotavirus with trypsin prior to infection; trypsin-induced cleavage of the viral hemagglutinin (vp 4) has previously been found to facilitate rotavirus entry into <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> by direct penetration of virions through the plasma membrane. We conclude that sufficient quantities of exogenous viral proteins may be introduced into the cytoplasm for processing by <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> The mechanism by which rotavirus proteins are processed for presentation to the <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> surface remains to be determined...|$|R
