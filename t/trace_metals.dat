5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of <b>trace</b> <b>metals</b> and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the {{bay bolete}} was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, {{and it is}} still listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from a common ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can bioaccumulate some <b>trace</b> <b>metals</b> from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E

40|$|Barnacles {{have very}} high {{accumulated}} <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> body concentrations that vary with local <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> bioavailabilities and represent integrated {{measures of the}} supply of bioavailable metals. Pioneering work in Chinese waters in Hong Kong highlighted the potential value of barnacles (particularly Balanus amphitrite) as <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> biomonitors; in coastal waters, identifying differences in local <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> bioavailabilities over space and time. Work in Hong Kong has also shown that although barnacles have very high rates of <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> uptake from solution, they also have very high <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> assimilation efficiencies from the diet. High assimilation efficiencies coupled with high ingestion rates ensure that trophic uptake {{is by far the}} dominant <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> uptake route in barnacles, as verified for cadmium and zinc. Kinetic modelling has shown that low efflux rate constants and high uptake rates from the diet combine to bring about accumulated <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in barnacles that are amongst the highest known in marine invertebrates...|$|R

As seagrasses {{are known to}} be highly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing, we evaluated the use of <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in seagrasses as bioindicators for <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> pollution of coastal regions at both global and local scale. We carried out a meta-analysis based on literature data to provide a global benchmark list for <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> accumulation in seagrasses, which was lacking in literature. We subsequently carried out a case study at the Caribbean islands of Cura硯 and Bonaire to test for local-scale differences in <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in seagrasses, and internal metal allocation. The benchmark and local study show that <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in seagrass leaves, regardless of the species, can vary over a 100 e 1000 -fold range, and are related to the level of anthropogenic pressure, making seagrasses highly valuable indicators.

40|$|Progress {{in marine}} {{chemistry}} {{has been driven}} by improved sampling and sample handling techniques, and developments in analytical chemistry. Consequently, during the last 20 years our understanding of marine <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> biogeochemistry has improved a great deal. Stripping voltammetric techniques (anodic stripping voltammetry and adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry) have made an important contribution to this understanding. The selectivity and extremely low detection limits have made stripping voltammetry a widely used technique for <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> speciation and <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> distribution measurements in seawater. Stripping voltammetry is very suitable for ship-board and in-situ applications because of the portability, low cost and capability for automation of the voltammetric instrumentation. Future developments in stripping voltammetry can be expected in the field of stand-alone submersible voltammetric analysers, capable of continuous <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> measurements. Future applications of stripping voltammetry {{can be found in the}} interactions between <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> speciation and growth and the functioning of organisms in pristine and metal polluted marine waters.

25|$|Several <b>trace</b> <b>metals</b> can occurs {{naturally}} in some rocks or enter {{in the environmental}} from natural processes such as weathering.

25|$|Inundation and {{sediment}} deposition on the marsh surface is also assisted by tidal creeks {{which are a}} common feature of salt marshes. Their typically dendritic and meandering forms provide avenues for the tide to rise and flood the marsh surface, {{as well as to}} drain water, and they may facilitate higher amounts of sediment deposition than salt marsh bordering open ocean. Sediment deposition is correlated with sediment size: coarser sediments will deposit at higher elevations (closer to the creek) than finer sediments (further from the creek). Sediment size is also often correlated with particular <b>trace</b> <b>metals,</b> and can thus tidal creeks can affect metal distributions and concentrations in salt marshes, in turn affecting the biota. Salt marshes do not however require tidal creeks to facilitate sediment flux over their surface although salt marshes with this morphology seem to be rarely studied.|$|E
25|$|The {{utilization}} of wastewater and ocean water instead of freshwater is strongly advocated {{due to the}} continuing depletion of freshwater resources. However, heavy metals, <b>trace</b> <b>metals,</b> and other contaminants in wastewater can decrease the ability of cells to produce lipids biosynthetically and also impact various other workings in the machinery of cells. The {{same is true for}} ocean water, but the contaminants are found in different concentrations. Thus, agricultural-grade fertilizer is the preferred source of nutrients, but heavy metals are again a problem, especially for strains of algae that are susceptible to these metals. In open pond systems the use of strains of algae that can deal with high concentrations of heavy metals could prevent other organisms from infesting these systems. In some instances it has even been shown that strains of algae can remove over 90% of nickel and zinc from industrial wastewater in relatively short periods of time.|$|E

The calculation of realistic solubility limits for a specific <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> requires that the chosen solubility-limiting mineral may form under the relevant geochemical conditions (pressure, tempera-ture, water composition, redox state), that the solubility of the mineral is reliably known, that all relevant aqueous complexes involving the <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> are accounted for, and that the corresponding complexation constants are reliably known...|$|R

This article reviews the sources of <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> accumulation/deficiency in these subjects and describes the metabolism and concentrations {{of a number of}} relevant elements in patients with impaired renal function. The intradialytic transfer of trace elements in either hemodialysis (HD), continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and others is considered. Toxic effects and clinical implications of <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> disturbances in renal failure are discussed and methods for their assessment, diagnosis and treatment are proposed...|$|R

A rather large mushroom, it may reach {{dimensions}} of up to [...] broad by [...] tall. It {{is commonly known as}} the mosaic puffball, a reference to the polygonal-shaped segments the outer surface of the fruiting body develops as it matures. Widespread in northern temperate zones, it is found frequently on pastures and sandy heaths, and is edible when young. H.utriformis has antibiotic activity against a number of bacteria, and can bioaccumulate the <b>trace</b> <b>metals</b> copper and zinc to relatively high concentrations.|$|E
500|$|Russula virescens has {{a limited}} {{capacity}} to bioaccumulate the micronutrients iron, copper, and zinc from the soil. [...] The concentration of these <b>trace</b> <b>metals</b> is slightly {{higher in the}} caps than the stipes. A [...] meal of fresh mushroom caps would supply 16% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of copper for an adult male or female (ages 19–50); 16% or 7.3% of the RDA of iron for an adult male or female, respectively; and 16–22% of the adult RDA of zinc. The mushroom is a poor bioaccumulator of the toxic heavy metals arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and nickel.|$|E
500|$|The sea holds {{enormous}} {{quantities of}} valuable dissolved minerals. The most important, Salt for table and industrial use has been harvested by solar evaporation from shallow ponds since prehistoric times. Bromine, accumulated after being leached from the land, is economically {{recovered from the}} Dead Sea, where it occurs at 55,000 parts per million (ppm). Other minerals on or within the seabed can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialized shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up, and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead, zinc, and <b>trace</b> <b>metals</b> which were only discovered in the 1960s. They form when geothermally superheated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as [...] "black smokers": {{in contact with the}} cold waters of the deep ocean, the minerals precipitate and settle around the vent. The ores are of high quality but currently very costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.|$|E

In Schiff base, amine based monomers and aldehyde containing monomers undergo a reaction to create the repeat unit for CMPs.

Another benefit of Schiff base is nitrogen is produced in creating CMPs, which could be beneficial for many applications.|$|E
2500|$|The 1974 {{aluminum}} cent was a one-cent coin {{proposed by}} the United States Mint in 1973.

[...] A 1974-D specimen was found in January 2014 by Randall Lawrence, who said it was a retirement gift to his father, who worked at the Mint in Denver. Randall planned on selling it in a public auction, but the Mint demanded its return, saying that the coin was never authorized for release and therefore remains U.S. Government property.

2500|$|Most {{but not all}} uptake systems {{also have}} an extracytoplasmic receptor, a solute binding protein. [...] Some {{homologous}} ATPases function in non-transport-related processes such as translation of RNA and DNA repair. ABC transporters {{are considered to be}} with the ABC superfamily based on the sequence and organization of their ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domains, even though the integral membrane proteins may have evolved independently several times, and thus comprise different protein families. The integral membrane proteins of ABC exporters appear to have evolved independently at least three times. ABC1 exporters evolved by intragenic triplication of a 2 TMS precursor (TMS= transmembrane segment. [...] a [...] "2 TMS" [...] protein has 2 transmembrane segments) to give 6 TMS proteins. [...] ABC2 exporters evolved by intragenic duplication of a 3 TMS precursor, and ABC3 exporters evolved from a 4 TMS precursor which duplicated either extragenicly to give two 4 TMS proteins, both required for transport function, or intragenicly to give 8 or 10 TMS proteins. The 10 TMS proteins appear to have two extra TMSs between the two 4 TMS repeat units. Like the ABC exporters, {{it is possible that the}} integral membrane proteins of ABC uptake systems also evolved at least 3 times independently, based on their high resolution 3-dimensional structures. ABC uptake porters take up a large variety of nutrients, biosynthetic precursors, <b>trace</b> <b>metals</b> and vitamins, while exporters transport lipids, sterols, drugs, and a large variety of primary and secondary metabolites. [...] Some of these exporters in humans are involved in tumor resistance, cystic fibrosis and a range of other inherited human diseases. High level expression of the genes encoding some of these exporters in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (including human) result in the development of resistance to multiple drugs such as antibiotics and anti-cancer agents.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mineralogy}} and geological setting on <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> concentration and distribution within six weathered profiles developed sandstone mudstone was assessed. Primary minerals {{occurring in the}} weathered profiles are quartz, plagioclase, and K-feldspar. Kaolinite is the most dominant secondary mineral followed by mixed layers of smectite-illite, illite, hematite, siderite, and occasional calcite. Metal concentrations within fresh and weathered samples were investigated by two methods of digestions: HF-based digestion and aqua regia. Results revealed that V and Cr are largely present in the primary aluminosilicate matrix and are not easily available to the environment; however, Cu, Zn, and Pb are present in extractable forms and readily leached. Iron occurs in both primary minerals and insoluble secondary minerals such as hematite. The mineralogical study also showed that drill hole material with more clay minerals tends to contain higher metal concentrations, demonstrating that mineral composition is the major control over <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> content. Spearman's rank correlation matrix also confirmed the role of mineralogy on <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> concentration (e. g., V and Cr correlated with kaolinite and Pb correlated well with mixed layers of illite-smectite). Effect of geological setting on <b>trace</b> <b>metal</b> concentration was assessed by examining the geomorphological location of drill holes with respect to paleochannels, surface topography, and water table position.
