5000|$|The {{congregation}} gained {{national attention}} in 2001 when it ordained Anita C.

5000|$|Despite his {{powerful}} {{position in the}} Senate, Specter had numerous problems entering the election. A moderate who generally received only tepid support from his party's conservative wing, he was criticized by the right for opposing Ronald Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Specter subsequently faced a primary challenge from an ultra-conservative State Representative named Stephen Freind; although the incumbent won handily, the battle was expensive and featured many damaging attack ads. The senator was also highly targeted by women's groups for his involvement in <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> proceedings; in his questioning of Anita Hill, Specter appeared to show no sympathy for her allegations of sexual harassment. Furthermore, President Bush's popularity was rapidly declining in the state over high unemployment rates and was subsequently dragging down Republican candidates.|$|E
5000|$|This trend {{began to}} change in the wake of <b>the</b> <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> Supreme Court {{nomination}} hearings, and the subsequent election of the 103rd Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the [...] "Year of the Woman." [...] In addition to Mikulski, who was reelected that year, four women were elected to the Senate, all Democrats. They were Patty Murray of Washington, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, and Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, both of California. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive [...] "boys' club." [...] Since 1992, there has been at least one woman elected to the Senate every two years with one exception, the 2004 elections. Since 2004, at least two woman have been elected to the Senate every two years except 2010, when only one woman was elected.|$|E

25|$|Bush {{appointed}} the two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1990, Bush {{appointed the}} largely unknown appellate judge David Souter to replace liberal icon William Brennan.

In 1991, Bush nominated <b>the</b> conservative <b>Clarence</b> <b>Thomas</b> to succeed Thurgood Marshall, another long-time liberal stalwart. Thomas won confirmation after contentious hearings {{in a narrow}} 52-48 vote, and Thomas {{became one of the}} most conservative justices of his era.|$|R
