40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the wear {{behavior}} of X 45 MoCrV 5 - 3 - 1 tool steel, used as die material in aluminum extrusion, after single treatment (CrN coating) and duplex treatment (nitriding and CrN coating). Gas nitriding and physical vapor deposition were used as processing techniques and wear tests were carried out at both room and elevated temperatures. A ball-on-disc type tribometer was used for room temperature tests, utilizing Al 2 O 3 ball as counterpart. In order to simulate the wear conditions during extrusion, hot wear tests were carried out at 450 C using block-on-cylinder type tribometer against AA 6080 material. Worn surfaces were studied by microscopy to reveal the wear characteristics of treated steels. It was found that (i) duplex <b>treated</b> <b>steel,</b> having higher friction coefficient at room and elevated temperature, had higher wear resistance, (ii) at room temperature single <b>treated</b> <b>steel</b> exhibited higher volume loss than the duplex treated one, (iii) at elevated temperature duplex <b>treated</b> <b>steel</b> revealed a stable coating layer, whereas micro cracks were observed on the surface of the single <b>treated</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Carbonitriding of {{four types}} of steels, namely, low carbon steel (LCS), medium carbon steel (MCS), low alloy steel (LAS) and high alloy steel (HAS) was {{achieved}} using cyanide salt bath heat treatment process. The steels, after preheating, were heated in a diesel fired salt bath heat treatment furnace and then quickly quenched in different media including air, oil and brine. The heat treatment processes were performed at different temperatures ranging from 790 oC to 920 oC. The heat treatment time was varied from 30 minutes to 120 minutes at an interval of 30 minutes so as to investigate {{its effect on the}} surface hardness of LCS. The surface hardness of all the heat <b>treated</b> <b>steels</b> samples were measured using an Indentec Rockwell hardness tester. The result revealed that the surface hardness of the heat <b>treated</b> <b>steels</b> is related to the heat treatment temperature and the quenching medium used.

40|$|This {{experimental}} program {{investigated the}} effects of cryogenic treatment on the mechanical properties and microstructures of AISI 4340 steel and aluminum alloy 7075. Mechanical tests including fatigue resistance, impact energy and hardness were carried out on both alloys, after they had undergone various heat treating conditions {{and the results were}} compared. Experimental results showed that the hardness and fatigue resistance of the cryogenically treated 4340 steel, in general, were a little higher than those of the conventionally <b>treated</b> <b>steel.</b> However, the toughness of the cryogenically <b>treated</b> <b>steel</b> was lower when compared to that of the conventionally <b>treated</b> <b>steel.</b> The quantitative assessment of retained austenite using neutron diffraction technique was also explored. It is concluded that the transformation of retained austenite to martensite is the determining factor which improved hardness and fatigue resistance of the cryogenically treated 4340 steel. In aluminum alloy 7075, the results indicated that after cryogenic processing the fatigue resistance was lower than for conventionally solution and precipitation heat-treated samples. However, the hardness and toughness of the cryogenically treated samples were slightly higher in comparison to the conventional T 6 treated specimens.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} grain {{refinement}} of medium carbon steel, having different initial microstructure, modified by either thermal and/or thermomechanical treatment (TM) prior severe plastic deformation. In case of TM <b>treated</b> <b>steel,</b> structure refinement {{was conducted in}} two steps. Preliminary structure refinement has been achieved due to multistep open die forging process which provided total strain of 3. Uniform and fine recrystallized ferrite structure with grain size {{of the order of}} 2 - 5 &# 956;m and with nest-like pearlite colonies was obtained. The further grain refinement of steel samples having different initial structure was accomplished during warm Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at 400 °C. The microstructure development was analyzed in dependence of effective strain introduced (&# 949;ef ~ 2. 5 - 4). Employment of this processing route resulted in extensive deformation of ferrite grains where mixture of subgrains and ultrafine grain was found regardless the preliminary treatment of steel. The straining and moderate ECAP temperature caused the partial cementite lamellae fragmentation and spheroidization as straining increased. The cementite lamellae spheroidization was more extensive in TM <b>treated</b> <b>steel</b> samples. The tensile behavior was characterized by strength increase for both structural steel states; however the work hardening behavior was modified in steel where preliminary TM treatment was introduced to modified coarse ferrite-pearlite structure...|$|E

40|$|The area of micro-abrasion is an {{interesting}} and relatively recent area in tribo-testing methodologies, where small particles of less than 10 mm are employed between interacting surfaces. It is topical {{for a number of}} reasons; its direct relation to the mechanisms of the wear process in bio-tribological applications, ease in conducting tests and the good repeatability of the test results. It has widespread applications in conditions used in the space and offshore industries to bio-engineering for artificial joints and implants. There have been many recent studies on the micro-abrasion performance of materials, ranging from work basic metals to nanostructured coatings. However, no significant work is reported on the micro-abrasion resistance of thermochemically <b>treated</b> <b>steels.</b> Hence, this paper looks at the performance of two thermochemically <b>treated</b> <b>steels,</b> Tenifer bath nitride stainless steel (T-SS) and vanadized carbon steel (V-CS) in such conditions with reference to the stainless steel (SS) by varying the applied load and sliding distance. The results indicated that T-SS demonstrates exceptionally poor resistance to micro-abrasion. It was observed that the heat treatment process and properties of the hardened layer (hardness and thickness) are extremely important in determining the micro-abrasion resistance of such steels. Finally, the results were used to develop micro-abrasion mechanism and wastage maps, which can be used to optimize the surface treated materials for micro-abrasion resistance.
