5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to a mass audience.

Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubids {{had three}} {{principal}} means of recruiting <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> elites whom {{they needed to}} administer their cities and towns. Some of these local leaders, known as shaykhs, entered the service of an Ayyubid ruling household and thus their bids for power were supported from Ayyubid household revenues and influence. Others were paid directly out of revenues made from the diwan, a high governmental body of the state. The third method was assignment to the shaykhs of the revenues of charitable endowments, known as waqfs. The Ayyubids, like their various predecessors in the region, had relatively few state agencies by which they could penetrate their cities and towns. To link themselves with <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> elite of their cities, they relied on the political usage of patronage practices. The assignment of waqf revenue to this elite {{was similar to the}} assignment of fiefs (iqta'at) to the commanders and generals of the army. In both cases, it enabled the Ayyubids to recruit a dependent, but not administratively subordinate elite.|$|E

30|$|According to this research, {{graduating in}} {{downturns}} inflicts {{a scar on}} earnings for both the low and <b>the</b> high <b>educated</b> Flemish youth, but <b>the</b> low <b>educated</b> are penalised in terms of annual hours worked and not wages, while the reverse occurs for <b>the</b> high <b>educated.</b> Thus, due to unfavourable labour market conditions at graduation, <b>the</b> high <b>educated</b> downgrade to lower-paying jobs, whereas <b>the</b> low <b>educated</b> remain unemployed more often. 6 This means that, in Flanders, the aforementioned scar on earnings occurs through different channels depending on the educational level, i.e. (i) the loss of early work experience for <b>the</b> low <b>educated</b> and (ii) <b>the</b> acceptance of lower-paying jobs for high educated (ii). Evidence (i) runs in favour of the identifying assumption required to study the long-term penalties of early non-employment by means of our IV approach.

5|$|The use of Latin as the {{language}} of administration persisted until formally abolished by Heraclius in the 7th century.

5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E

5|$|In 1300 or shortly after, Villani {{began working}} on the Cronica, which was divided into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally biblical times {{with the story of}} the Tower of Babel up to the year 1264. The second phase, in six books, covered the history from 1264 until his own time, {{all the way up to}} 1346. He outlined the events in his Cronica in year-to-year accounts; for this he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. He wrote his Cronica in the vernacular language rather than Latin, the language of <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> elite. His chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, sometimes with little interpretation. This often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, especially in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs).|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Roman Empire was in {{language}} and civilization a Greek society.

Since {{as early as the}} Hellenistic era, Greek had been the lingua franca of <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> elites of the Eastern Mediterranean, spoken natively in the southern Balkans, the Greek islands, Asia Minor, and the ancient and Hellenistic Greek colonies of Southern Italy, the Black Sea, Western Asia and North Africa. At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium, the koine (Greek: κοινή) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings, while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators.|$|E
5|$|The {{innovation}} of {{movable type}} printing {{was made by}} the artisan Bi Sheng (990–1051), first described by the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088. The collection of Bi Sheng's original clay-fired typeface was passed on to one of Shen Kuo's nephews, and was carefully preserved. Movable type enhanced the already widespread use of woodblock methods of printing thousands of documents and volumes of written literature, consumed eagerly by an increasingly literate public. The advancement of printing deeply affected education and the scholar-official class, since more books could be made faster while mass-produced, printed books were cheaper in comparison to laborious handwritten copies. The enhancement of widespread printing and print culture in the Song period was thus a direct catalyst in the rise of social mobility and expansion of <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> class of scholar elites, the latter which expanded dramatically in size from the 11th to 13th centuries.|$|E

5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century there was growing scepticism about the reality of {{witchcraft}} among <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> elite. Scotland was defeated in the Civil Wars {{by the forces of}} the English parliament led by Oliver Cromwell and occupied. In 1652 Scotland was declared part of a Commonwealth with England and Ireland and the Privy Council and courts ceased to exist. The English judges who replaced them were hostile to the use of torture and often sceptical of the evidence it produced, resulting in a decline in prosecutions. In an attempt to gain support among the landholding orders, Sheriff's courts were re-established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656. The result was a wave of witchcraft cases, with 102 in the period 1657–59. The limitations on prosecutions were fully reversed with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and there was a flood of over 600 cases that alarmed the restored Privy Council, leading it to insist on the necessity of its commission for an arrest or prosecution, and banning judicial torture.|$|E
5|$|Tarnovo was {{captured}} by the Ottomans after a three-month siege in 1393. After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 brought about {{the fall of the}} Vidin Tsardom, the Ottomans conquered all Bulgarian lands south of the Danube. The nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, with much of <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> clergy fleeing to other countries. Under the Ottoman system, Christians were considered an inferior class of people. Thus, Bulgarians, like other Christians, were subjected to heavy taxes and {{a small portion of the}} Bulgarian populace experienced partial or complete Islamisation, and their culture was suppressed. Ottoman authorities established the Rum Millet, a religious administrative community which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying as Christians. However, the clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept it alive, and that helped it to survive as in some rural, remote areas, as well as in the militant Catholic community in the northwestern part of the country.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of a monetary policy shock on the skill premium and the un-employment persistence. A VAR demonstrates that a contractionary policy induces a lagged decline in the skill premium and a larger and more persistent increase in the unemployment ratio of the unskilled relative {{to that of the}} skilled. A new Keynesian framework characterized by labor search frictions is developed. The labor force is divided into high and low educated. Firms post two types of vacancies: the complex that can be matched with <b>the</b> high <b>educated,</b> and <b>the</b> simple that can be matched with both the high and <b>the</b> low <b>educated.</b> A positive shock to the nominal interest rate induces <b>the</b> high <b>educated</b> unemployed to compete with <b>the</b> low <b>educated,</b> as they increase their search intensity for simple vacancies. As <b>the</b> high <b>educated</b> occupy simple vacancies, they crowd out <b>the</b> low <b>educated</b> into unemployment. This downgrading of jobs, and the subsequent crowding out of <b>the</b> low <b>educated</b> into unemployment, provide a possible explanation to unemployment persistence and the response of the skill premium...|$|R

5|$|The late 17th {{century in}} England {{was a time}} of great {{progress}} in design. Following the austere years of Commonwealth rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660. Royalist exiles and wealthy young men who made the Grand Tour, returned home with new ideas—often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the Baroque era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, John Webb, and Sir Christopher Wren were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is Coleshill House in Berkshire, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an imperial staircase. Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and <b>the</b> <b>educated</b> prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance. While Belton is not in the Baroque style, it displays all the traits typical of the new tendencies.|$|E
