50|$|The {{general term}} raven turn refers to any {{inversion}} {{that follows the}} design described above; however, {{there are two types}} of raven turns. Assuming the train is going round the half-loop first, an inside raven turn is where the rails are below the <b>train</b> <b>at</b> the <b>start</b> whereas an outside raven turn is one in which the rails are above the <b>train</b> <b>at</b> the <b>start</b> of the element. X² at Six Flags Magic Mountain, Eejanaika at Fuji-Q Highland, and Dinoconda at China Dinosaurs Park are examples of raven turns.|$|R

30|$|Inequality (2) is {{departure}} time constraint, which imposes {{a limit on}} the actual {{departure time}} of trains from starting station. This ensures that actual departure time <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> station is always equal or greater than the planned time of that <b>train</b> <b>at</b> <b>starting</b> station. Equation (3) states that leaving time (finish time of job) of a section must be equal to the entering time plus free running time. Constraint (4) is ensuring that scheduled stop is more than minimum dwell time which is practically required to load and unload passengers and freight trains. Constraints (5) and (6) are headway constraints to ensure safe operations. Constraint (5) is imposing minimum headway requirement for safe operation of trains running, in opposite or same direction, on the same track. While, inequality (6) imposes that minimum headway requirement on two consecutive <b>trains</b> approaching <b>at</b> same station. Constraint (7) gives the upper bound of time which a train can wait for other <b>train</b> <b>at</b> a station.|$|R

50|$|The Tokyo Metro is {{extremely}} punctual and has regular trains arriving {{less than five}} minutes apart most of the day and night. However, it does not run 24 hours a day.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the procedures and {{results of a}} simulation project of a railroad coal transportation system. Locomotives and wagons are modeled at the system level, as opposed to other work that inserts <b>trains</b> <b>at</b> <b>start</b> of the line, and removes them on the other side, just to analyze line utilization and traffic. The case {{was based on the}} Estrada de Ferro Vitória-Minas (EFVM), managed by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, one of the biggest iron coal mining companies in the world. The project helped to find the best train size, the impact of various changes on the physical line, the influence of failures and accidents, and provided a full customized interface, with the ability to do many more experiments. ...|$|R

50|$|The Soviets had a {{large number}} of {{armoured}} <b>trains</b> <b>at</b> the <b>start</b> of World War II but many were lost in 1941. Trains built later in the war tended to be fitted with T-34 or KV series tank turrets. Others were fitted as specialist anti-aircraft batteries. A few were fitted as heavy artillery batteries often using guns taken from ships.|$|R

By the end, two hundred thousand officers presided, and two- thirds of them had started their careers in training camps where the tests were applied.

50|$|Soreness can {{theoretically}} {{be avoided}} by limiting exercise to concentric and isometric contractions. But eccentric contractions in some muscles are normally unavoidable during exercise, especially when muscles are fatigued. Limiting the length of eccentric muscle extensions during exercise may afford some protection against soreness, but this may also not be practical depending on the mode of exercise. A study comparing arm muscle <b>training</b> <b>at</b> different <b>starting</b> lengths found that <b>training</b> <b>at</b> the short length reduced muscle damage indicators by about 50% compared to the long length, but this effect was not found in leg muscles.|$|R
