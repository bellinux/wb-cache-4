The Board decided in 1977 that construction of the final three units would commence in 1979 with the target of commissioning in 1985/6, as part of meeting load growth with an adjusted mix policy aiming for a balance of coal, nuclear, and oil. However later that year in July, the Government requested that Drax Completion proceed immediately, ahead of requirements, in order to secure jobs in the North East's heavy manufacturing industries.

Recent studies indicate that nearly all accounting textbooks touch on ethics in some way. In 1993, the first United States center that focused on the study of ethics in the accounting profession opened at Binghamton University. Starting in 1999, several U.S. states began requiring ethics classes prior to taking the CPA exam.|$|E

The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled {{the amount of money}} that went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into <b>this</b> <b>subject</b> was never published.|$|E

5|$|Rhegium owed {{its laws}} on epikleroi to Androdamas of Rhegium, a law-giver whose views on <b>this</b> <b>subject</b> were {{especially}} esteemed, according to Aristotle. In the city-state of Charondas' laws, an epikleros {{had to be}} given a dowry if her nearest kin did not wish to marry her. During the time of Alexander the Great, Tegean law deals with the inheritance of returning exiles, limiting them to inheriting only their paternal estate or an estate of their mother if she had become an epikleros while in exile. The city-states of Naupactus and Thermus allowed women to inherit property, but whether or not the daughters were considered epikleroi is unknown from the surviving fragments of the laws from those cities.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{scientist}} Peter Kropotkin {{first proposed}} {{the idea of}} fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets {{at the end of}} the 19th century. He theorized that the tremendous pressure exerted by the cumulative mass of thousands of vertical meters of ice could increase the temperature at the lowest portions of the ice sheet to the point where the ice would melt. Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian glaciologist I. A. Zotikov, who wrote his Ph.D. thesis on <b>this</b> <b>subject</b> in 1967.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Tintin and the Picaros, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating the next adventure of Tintin—setting an entire story in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in <b>this</b> <b>subject,</b> and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels' art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each Adventure, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.|$|E
