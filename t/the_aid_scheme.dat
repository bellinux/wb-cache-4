30|$|Regarding {{intermodal}} rail transport, the Flemish aid (N 566 / 02) for {{combined transport}} provided {{an annual budget}} of € 3 million for the acquisition of combined transport equipment, transshipment equipment and aid for information systems. The subsidy scheme, which expired end of 2003, covered investment costs of the railway operators with the objective to offer new combined transport operations, i.e. a new route, new types of traffic or a new contract, to expand existing combined transport operations or to maintain the capacity of existing combined transport operations. A new subsidy (N 249 / 04) is specifically designed to national intermodal rail transport. The Belgian government grants {{an annual budget of}} € 30 million to the intermodal operators, which offer transport services within Belgium of minimum 51  km. The subsidy is composed of a fixed part (20 Euros) and a variable part (maximum 0.40 Euros per kilometre). The objective of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>scheme,</b> which is extended till end 2008 (N 656 / 07), is to help maintain existing rail traffic levels of 300, 000 ITU and to increase rail traffic by 20 % over a period of 3  years.|$|E
40|$|State aid law {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} categories of the competition law in the European Union. The state as such has an unprecedented advantage compared to other competitors: the state disposes of a huge amount of funds which could be easily distributed in favor of the privileged undertakings. The risk of the distorting effect on competition is high; thus, strict rules are necessary. The thesis is divided into four parts: introduction, the general part, specific provisions and the conclusion. Part two of the thesis is dedicated to the general provision. Section 2. 1 deals with the term "state aid", describes the main criteria for qualification of the aid as a state aid incompatible with the internal market. I also focused on two judgments of the Tribunal which I considered important for the used argumentation. Substantial efforts were dedicated to the analysis of the private investor principle in paragraph 2. 1. 1 of the thesis.

40|$|On {{the last}} decades, European {{countries}} {{have increased their}} focus on local production systems {{as a matter of}} industrial policy measures. Based on the works related to industrial districts of Becatini (1989), Brusco (1990), Ybarra (1991 and 1996) and Dei Ottati (1994), or the later contributions of Porter (1998 a) about productive clusters, Governments have taken measures to stimulate the creation and strengthening of clusters. However, the progressive extension of cluster policies has highlighted the constraints of rationality on which it is based and the criteria used to evaluate their impact and effectiveness. Consequently, the traditional arguments based on the neoclassical concept of efficiency and the advantages of external economies have given way to a new paradigm that gives a central role to organizational learning, collective decision-making and networks as governance structure. The new approach to the analysis of production networks exceeds the territorial or sectorial boundaries to highlight the dynamic and complex nature of the relationships established between actors in the cluster. The approach of governance, {{as a starting point for}} the analysis of production networks, opens a new perspective in the assessment of the potential impact of cluster development and the effectiveness of measures aimed to their promotion. Based on the theoretical premises above mentioned, this paper aims to the analysis and valuation of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> of Innovative Business Partnerships (AEI) sponsored by the Spanish government. This study is based both on traditional analysis of the implementation and impact indicators, as in the analysis of the AEI program's ability to promote the adoption of models of governance and collective action to enhance the competitive capabilities of the cluster. ...|$|E

40|$|Nimekkeen selvennys: Final {{reports of}} the MATEUS {{research}} programme. In the beginning of 1995 the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry set up a special research programme to find out and make preparations for the economic impacts of the EU membership. The projects were directed to the economic adjustment of the Finnish agriculture and horticulture at {{the early stages of}} the membership. Originally the programme period was 1995 - 1999, but later on a decision was made to bring it to a conclusion at the end of 1997. The programme contained both short-term surveys and monitoring and more in depth examination of the long-term effects. The main emphasis was on short-term surveys and studies necessary, among other things, for the complementing <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> for agriculture and horticulture, which had remained incomplete in the Accession Treaty. The projects implemented in the MATEUS research programme concerned five main topics: The aid for serious difficulties, adjustment to the common agricultural policy of the EU, effects of environmental aid, regional adjustment and development of information systems. In connection with the aid for serious difficulties the research concentrated on the income development in agriculture and the plans of farms related to the continuation of agricultural production and investments on the basis of the bookkeeping farms as well as extensive inquiries and other data. There was a number of projects concerning the adjustment of agriculture and horticulture to the common agricultural policy of the EU and the new market situation in the different production lines for the part of the product markets of e. g. milk, meat, cereals and eggs. In the study concerning the structural change in agriculture the main emphasis was on the possibilities to increase the farm size, investment needs and profitability as well as financing of transfers of farms to descendants. The future changes in the agricultural policy of the EU were also involved in many of the MATEUS projects. An extensive project concerning the impacts of the environmental aid scheme was financed from the MATEUS programme, and the commitment of farmers to the scheme as well as the environmental effects of the liberalisation of agricultural trade were examined. The regional adjustment included a study of income changes in agriculture and their effects on the tax revenue as well as the significance of the food chain in the different regions. At the macro level the development projects related to the information systems were mainly concerned with the development of the sector model for agriculture and at the micro level with the development of the FADN bookkeeping required by the EU. This final report of the MATEUS research programme describes the changes in the Finnish agriculture and horticulture in the first years in the EU and the challenges for the development of agriculture and horticulture due to the new market environment. This final report makes it possible for agricultural and horticultural authorities as well as different interest groups and the general public to obtain information on the contents and results of the programme. Efforts have been make to include all more than 30 projects of the MATEUS programme in the report. The number of special research project reports published is over 50, and their titles and authors are given in the list of references. In the final report reference is also made to the projects concerning the adjustment of agriculture in the "Economic adjustment of agriculture" programme of the Academy of Finland implemented in 1994 - 1997. vokMTT Taloustutkimu...|$|E

40|$|The {{critique}} of <b>the</b> Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>scheme</b> is on two levels. Firstly ‘technical’ problems are discussed. It {{is in the}} nature of these problems that they can be resolved within the present structural arrangement of the scheme. The administrative procedures, use and coverage of the scheme are examined, taking into account the view point of the consumer. Privately paying and legal aid clients are compared in terms {{of the quality of the}} service they receive, solicitors’ attitudes to them, and the differing nature of the problems of poor people. The argument then concentrates on the 'structural’ defects of the scheme, avoiding the minutiae of its workings. The proprietry of a scheme created to provide legal services to poor people through solicitors in private practice is questioned. The legally orientated theory underlying <b>the</b> Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>scheme</b> is contrasted to social and consumer based theories, and to the practical model of the American Neighbourhood Law Firm. Empirical research is used to highlight the deficiency in the distribution of private practice solicitors to meet the needs of the poor; and the compensatory role of advice agencies in providing the relevant legal services to them. <b>The</b> Legal <b>Aid</b> Act 1988 is subjected to a close analysis with particular emphasis on the Lord Chancellor's powers, and the creation of <b>the</b> Legal <b>Aid</b> Board. <b>The</b> role and agenda of the Board, and future of <b>the</b> Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>scheme</b> are considered by outlining and examining the proposals contained in the preceding White Paper.

40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years.
