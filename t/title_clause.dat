25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of <b>title</b> <b>clause.</b> This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium Industrie Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of <b>title</b> <b>clause</b> ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E

2500|$|While UK {{insolvency}} law fixes a priority regime, and within each class of creditor {{distribution of assets}} is proportional or pari passu, creditors can [...] "jump up" [...] the priority ladder through contracts. A contract for a security interest, which is traditionally conceptualised as creating a proprietary right that is enforceable against third parties, will generally allow the secured creditor to take assets away, free from competing claims of other creditors if the company cannot service its debts. This is the first and foremost function of a security interest: to elevate the creditor's place in the insolvency queue. A second function of security is to allow the creditor to trace the value in an asset through different people, should the property be wrongfully disposed of. Third, security assists independent, out-of-court enforcement for debt repayment (subject to the statutory moratorium on insolvency), and so provides a lever against which the secured lender can push for control's over the company's management. However, given the adverse distributional impact between creditors, the economic effect of secured lending is a negative externality against non-adjusting creditors. With an ostensibly private contract between a secured lender and a company, assets that {{would be available to}} other creditors are diminished without their consent and without them being privy to the bargain. Nevertheless, security interests are commonly argued to facilitate the raising of capital and hence economic development, which is argued to indirectly benefits all creditors. UK law has, so far, struck a compromise approach of enforcing all [...] "fixed" [...] or [...] "specific" [...] security interests, but only partially enforcing floating charges that cover a range of assets that a company trades with. The holders of a floating charge take subject to preferential creditors and a [...] "ring fenced fund" [...] for up to a maximum of £600,000 reserved for paying unsecured creditors.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the lack of}} protection granted to purchasers of goods encumbered with retention of <b>title</b> <b>clauses.</b> In chains of transactions, disponees are only able to acquire such title that their immediate disponor had. The difficulties involved in determining {{the extent to which}} the title is encumbered is magnified as chains of transactions extend. English law fails to acknowledge the vital role of authorization in cases involving pre-existing but unknowable encumbrances. The failures of English law can be usefully contrasted with the situation in the USA. Under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, a security interest can pass with the goods upon disposition, yet if the disposition is authorized, the security interest will merely attach to the proceeds of the disposition. The final purchaser will be able to retain the goods. Although prima facie similar to English law, the American case law demonstrates that authorization plays a substantially more influential role, and reduces the risk to purchasers in comparison with English law.

5000|$|In {{other common}} law legal systems, recharacterisation usually {{refers to the}} risk that a title {{transfer}} arrangement could be treated instead as the grant of a security interest. If a transaction is recharacterised in this manner, {{there is a risk}} that the transaction may be void if it has not been registered under applicable registration laws. The title transfer arrangements that are perceived to be vulnerable to recharacterisation are transfers of margin (such as a title transfer under an English Law ISDA Credit Support Annex as collateral for a derivatives transaction), or transactions which involved an actual transfer of securities backed by cash (such a stock loan or repo transaction). Retention of <b>title</b> <b>clauses</b> may also sometimes be recharacterized in this manner. Security interests which are expressed as fixed charges are sometimes recharacterised as floating charges.
