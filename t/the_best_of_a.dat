He was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> five-rider {{breakaway}} {{at the front}} of the race, one which included teammate Taaramäe. That same day, Gallopin took sixth in a sprint finish to the Grand Prix de Plumelec-Morbihan. The team's last race of the early season was Halle–Ingooigem in June, where Sijmens rode to ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> difficult situation and represent his father as best he could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex would almost certainly have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.|$|E

Gibbon believes, as do most historians, that Charles had made <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad situation. Though allegedly outnumbered and without any heavy cavalry, Charles had tough, battle-hardened infantrymen who believed in him implicitly. Moreover, as Davis points out, these infantrymen were heavily armed, each man carrying up to perhaps 75 pounds (34kg) of armour into battle.|$|E
25|$|In {{between the}} University matches, the AIF {{made the first}} of three visits to Lord's Cricket Ground (Lord's) where they played Middlesex 26 to 28 May. The AIF had arguably <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> keenly fought draw. Herbie Collins made his first century of the tour with 127 and 64.

After Zamora was convicted and sentenced to life, he unsuccessfully appealed his sentence, blaming Rubin for the TV intoxication defense which he claimed had made a joke of his trial. The federal appeals court ruled that evidence against Zamora was overwhelming and that Rubin had made <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weak case; the defense had in fact helped Zamora by focusing attention on Zamora's deprived background. Zamora was released from prison in 2004 after having served 27 years in prison. A Costa Rican national, Zamora was repatriated to that country.|$|E
25|$|South Africa named an {{unchanged}} side, {{boosted by}} {{the confidence of}} the draw at Lords and content that their bowlers could deliver as anticipated second time around. Graeme Smith enforced this belief by opting to field, and was rewarded as Morné Morkel and Dale Steyn in particular got stuck into England's batsmen. England were dismissed for 203 on day 1. Kevin Pietersen top scored with 45, and Ian Bell scored 31, but this was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad bunch. Andrew Flintoff scored 17 and looked to have some confidence with the bat, having had very little success in his recent county appearances. But overall, it was a disappointing effort from England, but they did respond with 3 wickets before the close of play to leave South Africa on 101/3.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum tubes {{may have}} or develop defects in {{operation}} that make an individual tube unsuitable {{in a given}} device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. Microphonics refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; sound or vibration pick-up may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from {{the ends of the}} heater may also inject hum into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise. Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for many purposes. Selecting <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, Australia was {{scheduled}} to tour England {{to play for the}} Ashes. Before the squad was selected, Greg Chappell announced {{that he would not be}} leading the Australian team, citing business and family reasons. In his absence, the Australian Cricket Board turned to Hughes as captain. The Australian team arrived in England in May and was greeted by rain, leaving them short of needed match practice. Nevertheless, Hughes and his team unexpectedly won the preliminary One Day International series. The first Test was played at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. Australia won the low scoring and rain affected match by six wickets, after Hughes had taken the opportunity to put England into bat after winning the toss. Australia then had <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drawn match in the second Test at Lord's. After making a pair in this match, Ian Botham resigned his position as captain of England.|$|E
25|$|After Camberley he was {{appointed}} to command 2nd Division, a post he held for two years with little effect or interest – he was frustrated by the task of training an infantry force with no modern equipment – and then sent to command the Meerut district, in India, in 1928. He enjoyed life in India, but found the military situation to be equally uninteresting; the equipment was old-fashioned, as were the regimental officers and the overall strategic plans. He was promoted to lieutenant general in March 1931, and left for England in May, where he returned to half-pay with the sinecure of Lieutenant of the Tower of London. He was relieved from this bleakness by a posting to India as Quartermaster-General in 1933, where he travelled extensively, crossing the country to visit regiments and oversee the Indianisation process. For all this, however, it was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad job; he was still far from the War Office, and unable to make {{significant impact on the}} army's preparation for a future war.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Nintendo Power listed Mega Man V as the 14th best Game Boy or Game Boy Color video game, praising it as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quality {{series of}} {{portable}} Mega Man games. Game Informers Ben Reeves {{called it the}} 11th best Game Boy game due to its relative ambition compared to its Game Boy predecessors. Mega Man V was available for the similarly named Nintendo Power cartridge service in Japan on April 13, 2001 alongside its four Game Boy Mega Man predecessors. Outside Japan, the game {{is considered to be}} quite rare. All five games on the Game Boy were to be released as part of a Game Boy Advance compilation in 2004 titled Mega Man Anniversary Collection, but it was delayed indefinitely, renamed Mega Mania, and eventually cancelled. In 2011, IGN listed the game among titles they wished to see downloadable from the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS. On July 18, 2013, it was confirmed that Mega Man V is planned for release on the 3DS Virtual Console; it came out November 6, 2013 in Japan, on May 22, 2014 in North America. and August 28, 2014 in the PAL Region.|$|E

25|$|The {{main story}} {{leading up to}} the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was the health of the England vice-captain Denis Compton. His famously damaged knee had swollen up after making another century – 115 vs an Australian XI – and hourly bulletins were posted by the MCC manager Brigadier Michael Green expressing optimistically that he would play in order to help draw a large crowd for the Test, though doubts where express by those who had seen him. In the end he was unfit to play and was {{replaced}} by the Welsh amateur batsmen Gilbert Parkhouse who had made 58 in the Australian XI game, adding 130 with the luckless Compton. The reserve wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre was also dropped from his batting role and the teenaged Brian Close was brought in as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad bunch, having hit 105 not out against long hops and full tosses served up in a minor game. Brown thought that if nothing else as an all-rounder he could help take some of the strain off the other bowlers and so Close became the youngest Englishman to play Australia in a Test. Australia made only one change, dropping Jack Moroney for having made a pair in the First Test. His successor was chosen in the Australian XI game and opener Ken Archer (12th man at Brisbane) was given his Baggy Green ahead of the middle order batsman Jim Burke (who was made 12th man), although he had only made 81 to Burke's 128. Lindsay Hassett won the toss and batted first on a yellow, matted wicket made for batting.|$|E

The common citizen associated Brezhnev's rule more with its limitation than its actual progress: as a result, Brezhnev earned neither affection nor respect. Most Soviet citizens had no power to change the existing system, so most of them tried to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad situation. Rates of alcoholism, mental illness, divorce and suicide rose inexorably during the Brezhnev era.

500|$|The castle was now principally {{a prison}} and a court, still {{operating}} {{under the authority of}} the constable and the Forest Law originally established in 1217. The remaining buildings inside the bailey were converted into a courtroom and jury room, with {{the west side of the}} gatehouse being used as a jail for detaining prisoners. St Briavels Castle was primarily a debtors' prison– in England up until the Debtors' Act of 1869, individuals unable to pay their debts or fines could be detained in prison indefinitely to encourage payment. The conditions in the castle prison became increasingly notorious after a visit from the prison reformer John Howard in 1775 as part of his research for the first edition of his book The State of the Prisons, published two years later. Howard found the prison [...] "greatly out of repair", with the two inmates locked in a single room without exercise for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> year, with no fresh water, financial support or firewood.

Both critics said the film was made so through the filmmakers' unique inside access to the events at the palace with Ebert calling that aspect [...] "unique in film history". Although Ebert was generally very praising of the film, he criticised {{the way in which}} Chávez's opponents were portrayed, while Shenk faulted the lack of historical context; however, he said this was balanced by the film's [...] "brevity and succinctness".
