25|$|Stephen Crittenden: No {{prizes for}} Australian audiences {{guessing}} that {{the prize for}} the most Islamophobic international politician went to Ariel Sharon last year, but I was rather shocked to see <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> website, Ariel Sharon is nominated for an interview in which he described wanting to burn Palestinian children and encouraging his soldiers to rape Arabic girls, and describing Palestinian women as ‘slaves for Jews’, all of which you say yourselves on your website, comes from an interview that can’t be verified for its authenticity.|$|E
2500|$|Agnes knelt and, crying, begged President Juárez {{to forgive}} the Emperor. The President's answer has become famous in Mexican history textbooks: [...] "It causes me great pain, Madame, {{to see you}} like <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> knees; but even if every king and queen were in your place, I couldn't spare his life. It isn't me who takes it from him, it is {{the people and the}} law who claim his life". Juárez had already {{received}} telegraphs from most of the heads of the European states asking him to spare Maximilan. Upon Juárez's denial the brave woman answered, [...] "Oh, if blood must be spilled, then take my life, the life of a useless woman; and spare that of a man who can still do much good in other country." [...] Juarez did offer to spare the life of her husband, however, Maximilan would undergo a courts martial. [...] The scene was painted by the Mexican painter Manuel Ocaranza. vol.23 no.78 México mar./may. 2001.|$|E
2500|$|The hare couldn't see; {{at night}} the hare couldn't see. When the hare arrived there, the cat began to move. When he heard the movement, the hare ran back without taking any water. The pig asked: [...] "Why did you run away without {{bringing}} water?" [...] The hare {{said that there was}} some man there. Again the fox and the hare went to the water. When they came to the spring, they asked the cat: [...] "What are you?" [...] — [...] "I am a man", said the cat. [...] "What is <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> shoulder?", asks the fox. [...] "A rifle", says the cat. The fox and the hare were very frightened, but since they knew it was a cat, afterwards the three of them went together to cook meat. The pig hid behind a bunch of trees and, pushing out its ears, slept, and the cat was warming itself by the fire.|$|E

The Queen tells Hamlet, the altar awaits him, here is his betrothed. Hamlet looks away, without replying. The Queen persists. Hamlet thinks of Polonius' perfidy (Hamlet: Sur moi tombent les cieux avant que cet hymen funeste s'accomplisse! [...] "May the heavens fall upon me before such an ill-fated {{marriage}} can be solemnized!"). Ophélie asks what he means. He responds: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie. [...] "No! Go to a nunnery, go, Ophélie."). The Queen asks whether he has forgotten all Ophélie's virtues. He replies he now feels nothing in his heart. Ophélie despairs (Ophélie: Cet amor promis à genoux [...] "The love <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> knees you swore"). She returns her ring to him (Theme of Hamlet's Love), and Hamlet weeps. The Queen turns to Ophélie saying he weeps, he remembers, he loves you. Hamlet cries out again (Hamlet: Non! Allez dans un cloître, allez, Ophélie [...] "No! Go to a nunnery, go, Ophélie"). Each continues to express conflicting feelings in an extended ensemble. Ophélie leaves, hiding her tears.|$|E

You {{will find}} it always well, in looking at any cathedral, to make your {{quarters}} of the compass sure, in the beginning; and to remember that, as you enter it, you are looking and advancing eastward; and that if it has three entrance porches, <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> left in entering is the northern, <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> right the southern. I shall endeavour in all my future writing of architecture, to observe the simple law of always calling {{the door of the}} north transept the north door; and that {{on the same side of}} the west front, the northern door, and so of their opposites. This will save, in the end, much printing and much confusion, for a Gothic cathedral has, almost always, these five great entrances; which may be easily, if at first attentively, recognized under the titles of the Central door (or porch), the Northern door, the Southern door, the North door, and the South door.|$|E
