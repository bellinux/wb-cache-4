5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could have noticed specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

25|$|Feena is {{the princess}} of the Kingdom of Sphere {{on the moon and}} also the main female protagonist. In order to become more {{knowledgeable}} about Earth and be able to follow in her mother's footsteps, she comes to Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary {{to the president of the}} United Nations, Sayaka Hozumi. Since she was very young, she has always wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without knowing how to swim, and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the first}} year of Japanese rule, the colonial {{government}} embarked on a mission to study the aborigines so they could be classified, located and [...] "civilized". The Japanese [...] "civilizing project", partially fueled by public demand in Japan <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> empire, would be used to benefit the Imperial government by consolidating administrative control over the entire island, opening up vast tracts of land for exploitation. To satisfy these needs, [...] "the Japanese portrayed and catalogued Taiwan's indigenous peoples in a welter of statistical tables, magazine and newspaper articles, photograph albums for popular consumption". The Japanese-based much of their information and terminology on prior Qing era narratives concerning degrees of [...] "civilization".|$|E

500|$|Her {{literary}} career got a boost {{after she}} sent {{a copy of}} Éparpillements to Remy de Gourmont, a French poet, literary critic, and philosopher who had become a recluse after contracting the disfiguring disease lupus vulgaris in his thirties. He was impressed enough to invite her {{to one of the}} Sunday gatherings at his home, at which he usually received only a small group of old friends. [...] She was a rejuvenating influence in his life, coaxing him out for evening car rides, dinners at the Rue Jacob, a masked ball, even a short cruise on the Seine. [...] He turned some of their wide-ranging conversations into a series of letters that he published in the Mercure de France, addressing her as l'Amazone, a French word that can mean either horsewoman or Amazon; the letters were later collected in book form. [...] He died in 1915, but the nickname he gave her would stay with her all her life—even her tombstone identifies her as [...] "the Amazon of Remy de Gourmont"—and his Letters to the Amazon left readers wanting <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> woman who had inspired them.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before you then go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening {{for the first time in}} this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{stated that}} this episode gave her [...] "hope for this procedural {{that the pilot}} didn't". She called the storyline [...] "heartbreaking", [...] "sad", shocking", and [...] "chilling" [...] and added that there were [...] "plenty of twists and turns that kept me guessing throughout the hour". She was upset that Al Chapman was the murderer, saying {{that it would have}} been [...] "wonderful to see Brian, Linda's bad tempered, control freak of an ex hauled away in cuffs". She added that the look that Eric Singleton gave Detective Baker was [...] "positively evil". She praised the interaction between the Megan and the rest of the main cast, saying, [...] "We got <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cast of characters in Megan's office and Curtis was the standout. Last week Megan questioned Curtis' abilities as a doctor. This week, Curtis not only proved her wrong but turned out to be the much needed comic relief delivering some of the best lines of the night". She finished, [...] ""Letting Go" [...] definitely left me looking forward to what this new hit show has in store for us next". After the ratings for [...] "Pilot" [...] were high, Matt Roush of TV Guide hoped that Body of Proof would [...] "continue to improve" [...] adding that he preferred this episode to [...] "Pilot", despite the lower ratings.|$|E

500|$|Many {{ideas were}} {{suggested}} for {{the sequel to}} Friday the 13th, including making the title part of a serialized film series, where each succeeding film would be its own story and not related to any previous film under the Friday the 13th moniker. It was Phil Scuderi, one of the producers for the original film, which suggested bringing Jason back for the sequel. The director Steve Miner felt it was the obvious direction to take the series, as he felt the audience wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> child who attacked Alice in the lake. Miner decided to pretend as if Alice {{did not see the}} [...] "real Jason" [...] in her dream, and Jason had survived his drowning as a boy and had grown up. After killing Jason in The Final Chapter, it was the director Joseph Zito's intention to leave the door open for the studio to make more films with Tommy Jarvis as the main antagonist. Screenwriter Barney Cohen felt Jarvis would become a substitute for Jason, but the idea was never fully developed in A New Beginning. Director and co-screenwriter Danny Steinmann disliked the idea of Jason not being the killer, but decided to use Tommy's fear of Jason as the primary story. This idea was immediately abandoned in Jason Lives, when A New Beginning did not spark the [...] "creative success" [...] the studio was looking for. Executive producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. wanted to bring Jason back, and he did not care how it was achieved. In yet another alteration of the series' continuity, Tom McLoughlin chose to ignore the idea that Jason had survived his drowning, instead presenting him as always having been some sort of supernatural force. Since A New Beginning, no sequel has attempted to replace Jason as the main antagonist. Miller, who has not seen any of the sequels, took issue with all of them because they made Jason the villain. Miller believes the best part of his screenplay was that it was about a mother avenging the senseless death of her son. Miller stated, [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning; he was a victim, not a villain." ...|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "Childe" [...] is an honorific once {{given to}} young aristocratic {{men who had}} not yet {{attained}} knighthood, and its use in the play's title is a reference to Lord Byron's poem, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage. [...] The drama begins with Ada, the Countess of Lovelace, writing her will. She is a mathematician and the daughter of the infamous George Gordon, Lord Byron, a man reputed to be [...] "mad, bad, and dangerous to know." [...] She is dying of a painful cancer at age thirty-six, the same age he was when he died. [...] Separated from him while he lived, she now hates his memory. [...] As her own end is near, however, she desires <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man. [...] Her medicines stimulate her imagination, and she envisions him alive again. [...] In incisive, witty dialogue she digs into the truth behind the legends surrounding her father. [...] Six other actors play a diverse range of characters as she observes scenes from Byron's life, including his youthful incestuous relations with his sister, his homosexual adventures, his foolish marriage, and the causes of his disapprobation by British society.|$|E
2500|$|Xenopol's {{dispute with}} Eminescu was {{revisited}} in a 2002 book by critic Alexandru Dobrescu: Detractorii lui Eminescu ("Eminescu's Detractors", second edition 2006). Poet and Convorbiri Literare book critic Emilian Marcu notes: [...] " [...] {{are in fact}} intellectuals of great amplitude, who express opinions that are somewhat in contraction with those imposed officially. [...] book gives {{us a chance to}} rediscover [...] texts by authors who are at least honorable, over which, alas, the dust of oblivion has set. Their return into an intellectual circuit can only be beneficial for all those who truly wish <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> great Eminescu". Similarly, critic Bogdan Crețu notes that Dobrescu managed to overturn the [...] "poltroonish" [...] classification of Xenopol and others as [...] "detractors": [...] "the new anthology [...] an honest exercise in the reevaluation of an epoch that is much more nuanced and rich than the books of literary history or the dictionaries will have us know". Contrarily, other experts routinely list Xenopol as mainly an anti-Eminescian—his has an entry among the [...] "detractors of Eminescu" [...] in Săluc Horvat's dictionary of Eminescu exegetes (published in 2010).|$|E

[...] "Everyone had rosaries in their pockets." [...] Sumich found himself [...] "practising as a Catholic {{for the first time}} in my life, as distinct from just going to Sunday Mass. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Faith, because I'd just forgotten everything". His mother sent him a Catechism of the Catholic Church, which he [...] "sat down on a beach and read" [...] over one summer. [...] "It all made sense". He started going to frequent Confession and [...] "finding a sense of shame which probably hadn't existed before". At age 34, Sumich set aside a year, praying intensely, including the 15 prayers of St Bridget of Sweden and the Rosary. At this time, he was the coach of the Croatian rugby team. [...] "We would be playing at the Hong Kong Sevens and my rosary [...] would be in my pocket and I would finger it". [...] Sumich liked to challenge his players. [...] "I would say to them, 'strong moral life, strong character on the rugby field; weak moral life, and you are the first one to chuck the towel in when the going gets tough' [...] ". Returning to New Zealand, Sumich found local liturgies very different from what he had become used to in Croatia. But, in Auckland, he was introduced to the [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] Tridentine Mass celebrated by Denzil Meuli at Titirangi. Sumich [...] "felt God's call and sought an order using this rite". He was accepted by the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter and went to their formation house, [...] the International Seminary of St. Peter in Wigratzbad-Opfenbach, Bavaria, but he did most of his studies in Denton, Nebraska at Our Lady of Guadalupe Seminary [...] where he was ordained deacon in [...] March 2008.|$|E
