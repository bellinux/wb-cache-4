5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is conventionally {{divided into}} four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe,</b> and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them. Each lobe is associated {{with one or two}} specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them.|$|E
5|$|Sound waves {{travel through}} the outer ear, are {{modulated}} by the middle ear, and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the inner ear. This nerve transmits information to the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> of the brain, where it is registered as sound.|$|E
5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other medial <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
30|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder that is characterised pathologically by {{an accumulation of}} senile plaques and neuritic tangles. It typically begins in the transenthorinal regions and spreads to the hippocampal cortex and mesial <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> before progressing to the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes,</b> basal forebrain {{and the rest of}} the brain.|$|R
50|$|Molaison {{suffered}} from epileptic seizures {{and had his}} medial <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> surgically removed to prevent or decrease the occurrence of the seizures. After the removal of Molaison's medial <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes,</b> he {{suffered from}} anterograde amnesia as well as moderate retrograde amnesia. Molaison {{was still able to}} retain procedural memory after the surgery.|$|R
50|$|The medial <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> (near the {{sagittal}} plane) {{are thought}} to be involved in encoding declarative long term memory. The medial <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> include the hippocampi, which are essential for memory storage, therefore damage to this area can result in impairment in new memory formation leading to permanent or temporary anterograde amnesia.|$|R
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy {{of the affected}} regions, including degeneration in the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> and parietal lobe, {{and parts of the}} frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau {{which has become}} hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence of}} ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe.</b> Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy surgery may be {{an option}} for people with focal {{seizures}} that remain a problem despite other treatments. These other treatments include at least a trial {{of two or three}} medications. The goal of surgery is total control of seizures and this may be achieved in 60–70% of cases. Common procedures include cutting out the hippocampus via an anterior <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> resection, removal of tumors, and removing parts of the neocortex. Some procedures such as a corpus callosotomy are attempted in an effort to decrease the number of seizures rather than cure the condition. Following surgery, medications may be slowly withdrawn in many cases.|$|E
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a motor cortex and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary motor cortex, which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} a patient {{presenting}} Pick's disease {{similar to the one}} reported by Pick in 1892, with ubiquitin-positive and tau-negative inclusions.

Macroscopic examination showed atrophy on the frontal and <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes.</b> The left hippocampus displayed a major circumscribed atrophy. The diagnostic confirmation was made by the neuropathological findings of the autopsy that showed neuronal loss with gliosis of the adjacent white matter and apearence of status spongiosus in the middle frontal and especially in the upper <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes.</b> There were also neuronal swelling (ballooned cell) and argyrophilic inclusions (Pick's bodies) in the left and right hippocampi.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The {{mechanism}} {{underlying the}} perception of music {{has been the subject}} of study for many years. We investigated the role of the anterior portion of the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> in {{the perception of}} music in nonmusicians by use of positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS: We used the subtraction technique for PET to investigate the role of the anterior portion of the bilateral <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> in music perception. Nonmusicians performed two kinds of musical tasks: harmony listening and soprano part listening. RESULTS: During the harmony-listening task, the anterior portion of the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes,</b> cingulate gyri, and cerebellum were bilaterally activated. During the soprano part–listening task, the bilateral superior parietal lobules, and the right precuneus were significantly acti-vated. CONCLUSION: The anterior portion of the bilateral <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> is vital in the discrim-ination of melodies and chords. Differences between activated brain regions exist between musicians and nonmusicians when listening to a particular vocal part of a musical phrase.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent {{advances}} in data-processing techniques have allowed more accurate MR-based volumetric measurement than was {{possible in the}} past. The {{purpose of this study}} was to use this technique to evaluate the development of the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> in childhood. METHODS: The study group consisted of 42 subjects aged 3 weeks to 14 years (mean age, 5 years), all with normal findings on a routine MR study and none with a history of epilepsy. MR images were acquired on a 1. 0 -T system using a T 1 -weighted 3 D ultrafast gradient-echo sequence. The volumes of the hippocampal formations and <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> were measured by using a workstation, and the percentage of hippocampal formations in the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> was calculated. Myelination in the limbic system and related structures was also evaluated. RESULTS: The volume of the hippocampal formations increased sharply until the age of 2 years, and continued to increase slowly thereafter. However, the percentage of hippocampal formations in the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> showed a negative correlation with age. The hippocampal formations on the right side were larger than those on the left in 38 cases (91 %), and the anterior <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> on the right were larger than those on the left in 32 cases (76 %).

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. <b>Temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.|$|E
5|$|She {{explains}} the neurological basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind neurological pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes neurological science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe,</b> the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E

Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but was shocked to discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with <b>temporal</b> <b>lobe</b> epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a morphologically determined scale—the Tomography Dementia Rating scale (TDR) to diagnose AD stages, based on the measurement of the severity of voluminal atrophic changes of the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> of the brain detected among patients during CT and MRI at various stages of the disease. The research included 140 patients aged 28 - 79. Test Group comprised 81 patients aged 34 - 79 suffering from various AD stages. Control Group consisted of 59 patients aged 28 - 78 who had various types of brain lesions with manifestations of dementia and cognitive impairment but who did not suffer from AD. CT and MRI data obtained has made it possible to create a scale that allows determining the severity of atrophic changes in the <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> at each stage of AD development: 1) Pre-clinical AD stage—TDR- 0 : <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> atrophy with a 4 % - 8 % decrease in tissue mass (corresponds to 26 - 28 MMSE points); 2) Early AD Stage—mild dementia—TDR- 1 : <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> atrophy with a 9 % - 18 % decrease in tissue mass (corresponds to CDR- 1 and to 20 - 25 MMSE points); 3) Middle AD stage—moderate dementia—TDR- 2 : <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> atrophy with a 19 % - 32 % decrease in tissue mass (corresponds to CDR- 2 and to 12 - 19 MMSE points); 4) Late AD stage—heavy dementia—TDR- 3 : <b>temporal</b> <b>lobes</b> atrophy with a 33 % - 62 % decrease in tissue mass (corresponds to CDR- 3 and to 7 - 11 MMSE points). Thereby, the developed Tomography Dementia Rating scale (TDR) complements the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) and allows a correct and objective determination of AD stages as well as an easy differentiation of existing lesions with neurodegenerative changes characteristic for other diseases accompanied by dementia and cognitive impairment...|$|R
