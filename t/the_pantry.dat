The current keep was built on an earlier mound, known as a motte. The curtain wall of the bailey dates from the early 13thcentury.

Against the east curtain wall was a stable. In the northern half of the bailey, aligned east–west, was an unfinished 15th-century collegiate church; it was cleared away in the early 16thcentury.

500|$|Although the {{exterior}} of Bodiam Castle has largely survived, the interior is ruinous. The domestic buildings within the castle lined the curtain walls. However, remains are substantial enough to recreate a plan of the castle. The structure was divided into separate living areas for the lord and his family, high-status guests, the garrisons, and servants. The south range of the castle consisted of the great hall, the kitchens, and associated rooms. The great hall, {{to the east of}} the centrally located postern gate, was [...] and would have been as tall as the curtain wall. To the west of the great hall was <b>the</b> <b>pantry</b> and buttery, linked to the great hall by a screens passage. The three standing arches gave access to different rooms, <b>the</b> <b>pantry,</b> buttery and the kitchen which was at the far west of the south range. This layout was typical of large medieval houses. The great hall was the social centre of the castle, and where the lord would have entertained guests. The buttery and pantry occupied the bottom floor, and above was a room of unknown purpose. The buttery had a cellar and was used to store ale and wine, while <b>the</b> <b>pantry</b> held the supplies for the kitchen. To prevent heat from the cooking fires becoming unbearable, the kitchen was as tall as the curtain walls to provide a large space to absorb the heat. In the southwest tower was a well, from which water would have been drawn for the household.|$|E
500|$|The {{room on the}} {{opposite}} side of the Clifton Maybank corridor from the Great Hall was originally two rooms comprising the [...] "pannetry" [...] (sic) and [...] "buttery." [...] In a large household the buttery and [...] "pannetry" [...] were part of the offices pertaining to the kitchen, and as at Montacute they were generally close to the Great Hall. The buttery was traditionally the place from which the yeoman of the buttery served beer and candles to those lower members of the household not entitled to drink wine. Montacute's buttery is typical, as it had a staircase to the beer cellar below. The [...] "pannetry" [...] was the room from which the yeoman of <b>the</b> <b>pantry</b> served bread. By the time of Montacute's completion, upper servants often dined and entertained visiting servants in <b>the</b> <b>pantry.</b> This layout was a medieval concept and later, as custom dictated that servants withdraw from the principal areas of the house, these rooms became used by the family as reception and private dining rooms. Eventually, in the early 20th century, Lord Curzon amalgamated the two rooms to create the grand, and socially necessary, dining room, which Montacute had lacked since the Great Chamber had been abandoned more than 100 years earlier.|$|E

[...] After receiving a higher offer from a white knight, private equity firm Forstmann Little & Company, Perelman's Pantry Pride finally was able to make a successful bid for Revlon, valuing the company at $2.7 billion. [...] The buyout would prove troubling, burdened by a heavy debt load. [...] Under Perelman's control, Revlon sold four divisions: two were sold for $1 billion, its vision care division was sold for $574 million and its National Health Laboratories division was spun out to the public market in 1988.
