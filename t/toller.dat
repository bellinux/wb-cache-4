5|$|In February 1921 {{he met the}} 21-year-old {{photographer}} Charlotte ("Yolla") Niclas; {{the close}} romantic {{relationship between the two}} was to last many years, despite their age difference. The same year, following a family vacation to the Baltic coast, he began preparatory work on his science fiction novel Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants), which would be published in 1924. In 1920 Döblin joined the Association of German Writers (Schutzverband Deutscher Schriftsteller), and in 1924 he became its president. In November 1921 he began reviewing plays for the Prager Tagblatt, and in 1925 joined the Gruppe 1925, a discussion circle of progressive and communist intellectuals including Bertolt Brecht, Johannes R. Becher, Ernst Bloch, Hermann Kasack, Rudolf Leonhard, Walter Mehring, Robert Musil, Joseph Roth, Ernst <b>Toller,</b> Kurt Tucholsky, and Ernst Weiß, among others. It was likely Brecht, who counted Döblin among his significant influences, who introduced him to Erwin Piscator in 1928.|$|E

2500|$|The breed is {{categorized}} as a [...] "sporting" [...] dog under the CKC and AKA organizations, making <b>tollers</b> ideal dogs for various physical activities. Other kennel clubs {{such as the}} AKNC and UKC categorize <b>tollers</b> as a [...] "gundog" [...] which depicts their drive, mental intelligence, and intuitive hunting sense. Kennel clubs throughout the world recognize <b>Tollers</b> as an athletic, intelligent, and driven breed that have the innate ability to excel {{in any of the}} following activities: dog agility, dock jumping, disc catching, flyball, lure coursing, obedience, search and rescue, therapy dog, and hunting.|$|R
25|$|Tollers {{are often}} mistaken for small Golden Retrievers, but the <b>Toller</b> is more active, both {{physically}} and mentally. According to the breed standards, the <b>Toller</b> is athletic, muscular, compact, medium to heavy boned, balanced and powerful. The chest is deep. Conformation judges require Tollers {{to be capable of}} tolling, and physical faults that inhibit working ability are heavily penalized. They should be of moderate build—a lack of substance or a heavy build are penalized by judges, as both detract from the breed standard and athleticism. The legs are sturdy and solid, and they have webbed feet.|$|E
25|$|Aseptic {{meningitis}} (sometimes called steroid-responsive meningitis) {{has been}} diagnosed {{in increasing numbers}} in the Norwegian <b>Toller</b> population in recent years.

25|$|When {{the birds}} are close, the hunter calls the dog back to the blind, then rises, putting the birds to flight, {{allowing}} him a shot. The <b>Toller</b> then retrieves any downed birds. They are particularly suited for retrieving in cold water climates because of their water-repellent double coat.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the church}} are marble monuments and plaques commemorating {{eighteen}} people, dated between 1719 and 1848, {{and others to}} charitable bequests. Included are those to Billingborough rector Robert Kelham (died 1752), to Revd Brownlow <b>Toller</b> (died 1794), and to Thomas Buckberry (died 1828), who in 1827 provided for a charity to distribute bread to the poorest parishioners. Church plate includes a chalice, dated 1829, and a paten, probably by William Bellchambers.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for a <b>Toller</b> {{to have at least}} one of the {{following}} white markings: tip of tail, feet (not extending above the pasterns), and chest. Lack of white is not a fault, Tollers can be born with no white markings. Dogs with white on the shoulders, around ears, back of neck, across back or flanks, or with silvery, grey or black areas in coat are disqualified from conformation shows.|$|E
25|$|Der Rosenkavalier premiered in 1911 in Dresden {{under the}} baton of Ernst von Schuch, who had {{previously}} conducted the premieres of Strauss's Feuersnot, Salome and Elektra; Georg <b>Toller</b> was originally supposed to produce the production, but he backed out {{and was replaced by}} Max Reinhardt. The event was a pinnacle in the career of soprano Margarethe Siems (Strauss’s first Chrysothemis) who portrayed the Marschallin. Minnie Nast played Sophie, and Eva von der Osten was Octavian.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tollers</b> are the {{smallest}} of all the retriever breeds. They range in height from 17 - 21 in at the withers, and weigh 30 - 50 lb, with females being slightly shorter and lighter (the breed standard does not specify weight). <b>Tollers</b> are always a medium-sized breed, never large; however, {{there has been a}} trend towards larger dogs in recent years.|$|R

25|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2002 by the Canadian Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever breed club to discover which diseases and conditions {{occur in the}} <b>Toller</b> population, involving owners of 1180 dogs worldwide, showed 73% reported in excellent health {{and a total of}} 7.5% reporting poor or bad health. 141 dogs (12%) were reported as deceased with the average age at death being 6.4 years. The most common cause of death was cancer, reported in 25% of deaths, with old age being the next most common at 9%.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Toller</b> was bred to {{retrieve}} from icy waters {{and must have}} a water-repellent double coat of medium length and softness, and a soft dense undercoat. The coat may have a slight wave on the back, but is otherwise straight. Some winter coats may form a long loose curl at the throat. Featherings are soft and moderate in length, the tail is well feathered and held jauntily when the dog is excited or moving.. The hair on the muzzle is short and fine. Seasonal shedding is to be expected.|$|E
25|$|The {{event was}} held at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris four years later but only two {{countries}} competed, Great Britain and hosts France. The French team was mostly represented by English expatriates while the English team was represented by Devon & Somerset Wanderers Cricket Club, so was not nationally selected. It is considered that few of the participants would have been good enough to play first-class cricket — only the British side had experience of eight such games in its side through Somerset's Montagu <b>Toller</b> and Alfred Bowerman.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} situation in Germany and elsewhere in Europe after World War I (1914–1918) contributed {{to the rise of}} virulent antisemitism. Many Germans did not accept that their country had been defeated, which gave birth to the stab-in-the-back myth. This insinuated that it was disloyal politicians, chiefly Jews and communists, who had orchestrated Germany's surrender. Inflaming the anti-Jewish sentiment was the apparent over-representation of Jews in the leadership of communist revolutionary governments in Europe, such as Ernst <b>Toller,</b> head of a short-lived revolutionary government in Bavaria. This perception contributed to the canard of Jewish Bolshevism.|$|E
25|$|Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers {{are known}} to be very intelligent, curious, alert, outgoing, and high-energy dogs. They are affectionate, eager to please, busy, and get along well with children. They are good family dogs, however during the {{decision}} process potential owners should be weary of the physical and mental commitment that is required in order to keep a <b>Toller</b> busy. Physical stimulation should be provided for these dogs each day since they may become destructive when they are not exercised enough or left alone for too long.|$|E
25|$|Tollers {{have the}} {{capacity}} to be very social dogs, {{as long as they are}} sufficiently socialized early on in life. While Tollers are energetic and outgoing around their owners and family, their cautious nature makes them reserved around strangers. Exposure to new people, locations, smells and sights are crucial to the healthy development of the <b>Toller</b> breed. They tend to get along well with other dogs; however, they have a strong prey drive and may chase after cats or other small animals. Their prey drive can be avoided if cats, for example, are introduced early on in a Toller's life. Failure to properly socialize Tollers at a young age may result in aggressive, destructive, or timid behaviour in maturity.|$|E
25|$|Duck <b>Tollers</b> {{are working}} animals and are happiest {{when they have}} a job to do. <b>Tollers</b> are {{excellent}} hunting companions. They excel at many types of sporting competitions, such as agility, dock diving and obedience. Their keen sense of smell, intelligence, drive to work, and small size, make them perfect search and rescue dogs. The breed standard states that the dog should have a strong retrieving drive, intense birdiness, endurance and a love for water.|$|R
25|$|Those who breed <b>Tollers</b> for {{conformation}} shows {{consider the}} head (clean cut, slightly wedge-shaped) {{to be an}} important feature, and believe it should resemble that of a fox, and must never be blocky like that of a Golden Retriever. The ears are triangular and set high and well back from the skull. The pigment on a <b>toller's</b> nose, lips and eye rims should match, and should be either black (which normally fades with age) or liver, blending into the coat. Lips fit fairly tightly around the mouth. The correct bite is a scissor bite, full dentition is required. Jaws are strong enough to carry a large bird, but <b>Tollers</b> must have a soft mouth too. Eyes are set well apart, almond shaped, medium-sized. Colour, amber to dark brown. Expression is friendly, alert and intelligent.|$|R
