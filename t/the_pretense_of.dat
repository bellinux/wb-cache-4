5|$|Barret {{is first}} {{introduced}} in Final Fantasy VII as an eco-terrorist, leading the group AVALANCHE to bomb Mako reactors in the fictional city of Midgar, {{so as to}} avenge the losses dealt him by the megacorporation Shinra, the Planet's de facto world government, who operate under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> saving the Planet. As the story progresses, Barret re-examines his efforts and focuses on pursuing the villain Sephiroth {{in an effort to}} protect the Planet and the future of his adopted daughter, Marlene.

However, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), who has come to dislike Clark, invites himself and Andy along under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> helping with the audition, ruining Clark's seduction plan.

5|$|Debegri {{attempts}} to subdue Tlanth under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> unpaid taxes and for conspiring {{to break the}} Covenant. Mel and Bran and their small group of forces – mostly farmers and tradespeople – initially succeed at foiling Debegari with guerilla tactics, such as blockading a stream to flood the enemy's camp. However, the war changes for the worse when the capable Marquis of Shevraeth (25), {{the heir to the}} nearby principality of Renselaeus, takes command from Debegari. Shevraeth soon captures Mel and takes her to the capitol of Remalna-city, imprisoning her. Shevraeth tells her that the king orders her to surrender Tlanth's forces or face execution.

Suspicious that Mike is spending the night with Edie, Susan enters Edie's home uninvited with <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> borrowing sugar. While inside, she accidentally knocks over a candle, which sets fire to the entire house. Susan flees the scene, leaving behind her glass measuring cup.

When Walker testifies about Underwood's role in the Chinese money laundering, Underwood takes the stand in his own defense and stuns the committee by resigning the presidency. When Claire demands an explanation, Underwood reveals that his resignation was part of a plan to ensure that they control the country for years to come: Claire from the White House, he from the private sector. To tie up loose ends, he has Macallan and Harvey killed.|$|E
50|$|Sex {{segregation}} {{can also}} be motivated by religious or cultural ideas about men and women. Such cultural assumptions may even exist in the aforementioned policies enacted under <b>the</b> <b>pretenses</b> <b>of</b> safety or privacy concerns. Gender separation and segregation in Judaism and Islam reflect religiously motivated sex segregation. In Buddhism, Christianity, and Hinduism, monastic orders, prayer spaces, and leadership roles have also been segregated by sex.|$|R

5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI {{to wear a}} wire to avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} {{had learned}} about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts {{in a series of}} attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed {{in the early stages of}} the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus {{was given}} the title of {{quaestor}} in AD 7, five years before the legal age of 25, and in that year was sent to assist Tiberius {{in the war against}} the Pannonians and Dalmatians. According to Cassius Dio, Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum because Tiberius' lack of activity made Augustus suspect that he was delaying to remain under arms as long as possible under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> war. Germanicus brought an army of levied citizens and manumitted slaves that were bought from their masters to reinforce Tiberius in Siscia, his base of operations in Illyricum. In late autumn/early winter additional reinforcements arrived at Siscia from Moesia and the East: three legions from Moesia led by Aulus Caecina Severus and two from Anatolia led by Silvanus with Thracian cavalry and auxiliary troops. While this did show that Augustus took the threat seriously, Tiberius had some soldiers sent back, because he had more than he needed.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, Duvert expounded his {{ideology}} {{at length}} in Le Bon Sexe Illustré (Good Sex Illustrated) {{in which he}} sharply criticised sex education and the modern western family.

Furthermore, Yukizane is {{surprised to find that}} Eijiro did not meet Masuhiro while travelling. Eijiro leaves with a warning to the Senshin clan, and reports to his father that, as suspected, the bride has disappeared. He also informs Hirotomo that Masuhiro has gone missing as well, and that Eijiro has located Yorikiro's location. Upon hearing this, Hirotomo summons his four most trusted warriors, the Demons of the Sorrow, and sends them after his Yorikiro.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Sophie's {{country is}} {{caught up in}} a war with a {{neighboring}} country. The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> being his mother, to tell the king that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives to Sophie a charmed ring that connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman says that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight; Sophie protests passionately in his defense, allowing Suliman to see Sophie's true form, and to realize that she has feelings for Howl. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch.|$|E
5|$|Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was {{allegedly}} poisoned with mushrooms or alternatively poison herbs. However, {{accounts of the}} way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his taster, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, {{is considered to be}} the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> helping him to vomit, or by poisoned gruel or an enema. Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1963, {{the coup}} went ahead, with Cao's troops {{isolated}} in the far south, and Tung's forces outside Saigon, unable to rescue Diệm from the rebel encirclement. Tung was called to the Joint General Staff (JGS) headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> a routine meeting, and was seized and executed. Attempts by Diệm and Nhu {{to make contact with}} Đính were blocked by other generals, who claimed that Đính was elsewhere. This led the Ngô brothers to think that Đính had been captured, still unaware that he had rebelled. The following morning, Đính was allowed to have the final word with Diệm before the brothers were arrested, allowing him to prove his loyalty to the rebel cause. Đính subsequently shouted obscenities at the Ngô brothers.|$|E

50|$|The Constitutional Charter of the Military Committee for National Salvation (CMSN), {{which was}} promulgated on February 9, 1985, {{served as a}} de facto constitution. The charter {{unequivocally}} eliminated any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pretenses</b> <b>of</b> democracy embodied in the 1961 constitution. At the same time, it pledged adherence to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the charters of the United Nations (UN), the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and the League of Arab States (Arab League). The charter also proclaimed Islam the state religion and sharia {{the only source of}} law. Article 14, however, presaged a return to democratic institutions and a new constitution that would bear some semblance to the 1961 Constitution.|$|R
5|$|The festival {{turned out}} to be a huge success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show attracted the attention of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E
5|$|After {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} reach Derek on his phone, Sharon finds Derek {{at the hospital}} and suspects that he and Lisa had an affair, as Lisa claims. LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under <b>the</b> <b>pretense</b> <b>of</b> being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers).

When Derek and Sharon return home from the hospital, they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E
