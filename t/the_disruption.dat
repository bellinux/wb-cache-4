5|$|Shrimpers in the Carolinas blamed high {{fuel prices}} and <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> of Tropical Storm Tammy {{for some of}} the {{troubles}} facing the shrimping industry in 2005. Rising fuel prices and dwindling demand has already created tough conditions that year, but <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> of several days' fishing due to Tammy escalated the situation.|$|E
5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

5|$|Train {{operating}} {{companies were}} {{adversely affected by}} <b>the</b> <b>disruption,</b> losing an estimated 19% of revenue in the year following the crash.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} issue of {{rescheduling}} {{to allow for the}} unexpected arrival of new jobs, taking into account the effect of <b>the</b> <b>disruptions</b> on a previously planned optimal schedule. We consider the single-machine rescheduling problems with deteriorating jobs. Rescheduling means that a set of original jobs has already been scheduled to minimize some classical objective, then a new set of jobs arrives and creates a <b>disruption.</b> <b>The</b> objective is to minimize the total tardiness costs under a limit of <b>the</b> <b>disruptions</b> from <b>the</b> original scheduling. We propose polynomial time algorithms or some dynamic programming algorithms for each problem...|$|R

5|$|A {{much larger}} power-related {{incident}} than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services {{on both the}} North South and East West lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. <b>The</b> <b>disruption</b> lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into the cause of <b>the</b> <b>disruption.</b> The cause was identified as damage to a third rail insulator due to a water leak at Tanjong Pagar station. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.|$|E
5|$|As noted below, such a {{cloud of}} {{collectors}} would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based astronomers to observe.|$|E
5|$|Dactyl {{may have}} {{originated}} {{at the same}} time as Ida, from <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.|$|E

5|$|If the {{resulting}} short-circuit current is {{high enough to}} trip the circuit breaker then disruption of service will occur.

5|$|In 1825, {{following}} <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> {{the group}} were experiencing, Shapira travelled to Europe once again.

His mission, however, was unsuccessful, as was a later mission attempted in 1829 by Zoref.|$|E

5|$|The speed {{restrictions}} and track replacement works caused significant disruption on {{a majority of}} the national network for more than a year. <b>The</b> <b>disruption</b> and Railtrack's spiralling costs eventually caused the company to enter administration at the insistence of Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, and its replacement by the not-for-dividend company Network Rail under Byers's successor Alistair Darling.|$|E

5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} usually (just under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe usually (just under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.|$|E
5|$|Although American Graffiti {{is set in}} 1962 Modesto, California, Lucas {{believed}} the city had changed too much in 10 years and initially chose San Rafael as the primary shooting location. Filming began on June 26, 1972. However, Lucas soon became frustrated {{at the time it}} was taking to fix camera mounts to the cars. A key member of the production had also been arrested for growing marijuana, and, in addition to already running behind the shooting schedule, the San Rafael City Council immediately became concerned about <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> that filming caused for local businesses and therefore withdrew permission to shoot beyond a second day.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
