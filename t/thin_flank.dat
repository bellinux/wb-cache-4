40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in order to assess {{commercial}} front and rear cuts of dairy-origin cattle fed mesquite pod meal. Twenty-five non-castrated male bovines (Holstein-Zebu), distributed according to a completely randomized design, with five animals per treatment, were used. The feed contained about 121. 2 and 544. 98 g kg- 1 of crude protein and total digestible nutrients, respectively, and was composed of tifton grass hay, cornmeal, soybean meal, mesquite pod meal and mineral salt. The right half carcass of each animal was separated between the 5 th and 6 th ribs, in front and rear quarters, from which commercial cuts were obtained. There was no effect (p > 0. 05) as to the replacement of corn for mesquite pod meal on the weights and yields of front cuts (shoulder, brisket, chuck, hump and flanks) and rear cuts (tenderloin, shank, knuckle, <b>thin</b> <b>flank,</b> flat, eye round, rump tail, top side, cap of rump, rump, cut of rump, striploin, cap of cube roll).

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} beef carcasses, aimed at identifying the growth patterns of wholesale cuts and their tissues in steer during fattening phase. This study involved 69 grass-fed steers with a live-weight range of 300 to 600 kg. They had entered, or were progressing along, their fat deposition phase. An allometric model (Huxley, 1932) was used to study the growth patterns of carcass tissues within wholesale cuts. In general, The growths of muscle and fat within wholesale cuts followed similar patterns. Some differences in growth patterns between muscle and fat were identified on the dorsal region. The growth impetus for fat moved from the thoracic backwards to the lumbar region which was the reverse of the growth impetus for muscle. Differential growth patterns occurred between intermuscular (IM) fat and subcutaneous (SC) fat. With IM fat, its growth movement {{was similar to that}} of total fat where there was a concentration of growth in the lumbar area and <b>thin</b> <b>flank</b> as side weight increased. With SC fat, there were growth movements from the ventral region to the dorsal region of the carcass. Bone growth within wholesale cuts showed a less clear pattern.

40|$|The {{presence}} of flanking targets can impair depth discrimination, presumably through {{a form of}} lateral interaction or visual crowding. This study investigates how stereoscopic crowding interferes with foveal depth discrimination when tests and flanking stimuli of different spatial configuration are located {{on and off the}} horopter in normal subjects by using psychophysical means. The magnitude of crowding increased when the flanking bars were in close spatial proximity to the test, between 1 to 2 arc min, and returned to unflanked levels for wider separations of 4 arc min and beyond. The magnitude of crowding depended {{on the extent to which}} the test and the flanking bars width matched. When flankers were placed at the optimum crowding distance (OCD) and displaced off the horopter, crowding reduced but the flanker effect was restored at greater flanker disparity. On the contrary, flankers positioned at the least crowding distance (LCD) at the onset generally showed an increase in thresholds from the fixation plane with increasing flanker disparity. Crowding was produced at similar small test- flanker separation for the range of 0. 5 to 4 cpd flanker spatial frequency composition used. The magnitude of crowding was greater for test and flanker of similar spatial frequency, though some crowding was produced when their spatial frequency differed. Overall, the results confirm previous reports showing that depth discrimination thresholds increase in the {{presence of}} flanking contours, but in addition suggest that disparity integration relative to the fixation demonstrates a dichotomy of fine and coarse mechanisms driven by salience attraction. Additionally, the results show that the crowding effect can be reduced by depth cues related to the width, and disparity of flanking stimuli. The crowding effect may be attributed to the action of local disparity interactions, but suggest the involvement of Gestalt factors (for larger flanker widths) and luminance flux (for <b>thinner</b> <b>flanker</b> widths) factors...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{sedimentation}} rates within Galveston bay, TX, {{and their}} utility in estimating differential compaction in Texas coastal plain estuaries. Most modern Texas estuaries are situated over incised Pleistocene paleo-channels up to 30 m deep, filled primarily with unconsolidated mud-dominated Holocene fluvial and estuarine deposits. The Galveston Pier 21 tidal gauge has a 100 -year record which has recorded a relative sea-level rise rate 3 times the global average, and this rate {{is considered a}} regional rate. However, Pier 21 is situated over the Trinity River incised paleo-valley (TRIV). A CHIRP sub-bottom profile and multiple transects of vibra-cores were collected across the TRIV to investigate if sedimentation resulting from enhanced subsidence has increased over the TRIV compared to the TRIV flanks. Profiles of Hg and textural changes were used alongside sedimentation rates derived from excess ???Pb activity to determine the recent sedimentary history of the bay. Sedimentation rates ranged from 0. 34 ? 1. 48 cm yr??, with the highest rate being found directly over the TRIV. Correlations in Hg and textural data reveal a general deepening and extension of strata within cores collected directly over the TRIV. Analyses of the CHIRP line also reveals a localized thickening of individual stratigraphic layers within Holocene estuarine fill across the TRIV, with a <b>thinning</b> on the <b>flanks.</b> Taken together, {{the evidence suggests that}} differential compaction of the unconsolidated Holocene estuarine fill within the TRIV has produced localized, elevated sedimentation rates, suggesting enhanced localized subsidence up to four times as great within Trinity Bay over the TRIV, than in areas adjacent to it...|$|R

TYPE SPECIMEN: TAXONOMIC UNIQUENESS: Two of the five sub-species of Laterallus jamaicensis breed in North America, and include L. j. coturniculus and L. j. jamaicensis. DESCRIPTION: Smallest North American rail, sparrow-sized, total adult length 10 - 15 cm (3. 94 - 5. 91 in); mean mass 29 g. Adult generally shades of pale to blackish gray. Top of head darker than surrounding plumage (more evident in females); bill short and black. Underparts from chin to abdomen uniformly colored but lighter on chin and throat. Undertail coverts and flanks streaked with white and dark gray, washed with chestnut. Nape and upper back chestnut. Remainder of dorsum-back, uppertail coverts, and remiges- shades of dark gray, sometimes washed with chestnut or brown with scattered white spots. Spotting extends to wing coverts and secondaries, although much individual variation in amount of spotting. Rectrices brownish gray. Irises of adult shades of bright red, differing from other North American rails. Tarsi and toes grayish brown. Sexually dimorphic in plumage, but sexes similar in size (Eddleman et al 1994).

40|$|Thesis, (M. S.) Geological SciencesThe {{continental}} slope due west of Ensenada. Baja California, Mexico, is transected by an east-west trending submarine valley {{characterized by a}} flat floor and steep-walled, constricted mouth. Calcareous olive-green silts, containing abundant sand-size glauconitic grains, were deposited during Late Pleistocene time from turbid suspensions flowing across the valley floor. Geomorphic lineaments and sub-bottom acoustic relection profiles suggest that the submarine valley is a wedge-shaped graben that has undergone recurrent faulting along its northern boundary. Based on a microfossil assemblage, including foraminifers and calcareous nannoplankton, a calcareous ooze {{from the top of}} the {{continental slope}} is correlated with the Miocene Globorotalia ???fohsi??? Zone (s. l.) of Caribbean stratigraphy. Discrete layers of red radiolarian chert fragments occur in the ooze and are lithologically similar to chert from the Franciscan Group (s. l.) of California. Sedimentary aprons and fans at the base of the continental slope are characterized by Late Pleistocene gray silts and clays, including turbidity current deposits, that are overlain by postglacial, tan calcareous silts and clays. Climatic changes indicated by Globigerina pachyderma coiling ratios in these sediments agree well with established glacial, sea level, and lake level fluctuations during Main Wisconsin and post-glacial time in middle latitudes of North America. Olive-green clayey silts were deposited at sill depth along the northern end of Long Basin during post-glacial time at a rate approximately one-fourth that evidenced on the basin floor. Areal sedimentation in the study area during the Pleistocene Epoch was characterized by non-deposition and/or erosion on Patton Ridge, and fault-triggered sediment slumps and slides in the submarine valley. Sediment suspensions, associated with mass-movements, flowed across and down valley depositing glauconite-rich sand, silt, and clay along the valley floor and forming an alluvial fan at the valley mouth. An ESP record across a faulted nose of Patton Ridge suggests that the ridge is the crest of a broad fold, now truncated by faults on both <b>flanks.</b> <b>Thin,</b> layered sediments now blanket the seaward flank of the Ridge suggesting a low accumulation rate on the continental slope...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin and}} {{environmental}} dependencies of lamination in stalagmites from Katerloch, common in speleothems from other cave sites, are examined in detail. Petrographic observations and chemical analyses (including isotopes) of stalagmites and modern calcite were combined with multi-annual cave monitoring. All investigated stalagmites {{are composed of}} low-Mg calcite and show white, porous laminae and typically thinner, translucent dense laminae. The binary lamination pattern results from changes in the calcite fabric: white, porous laminae are characterized by a high porosity and abundant fluid inclusions and also by enhanced vertical growth and <b>thinning</b> towards the <b>flanks.</b> Translucent, dense laminae exhibit a compact fabric and constant thickness of individual growth layers. U-Th dating supports an annual origin of the lamination and the seasonally changing intensity of cave ventilation provides a robust explanation for the observed relationships between lamination, stable C isotopic compositions and trace elements (Mg, Sr and Ba). The seasonally variable air exchange, driven by temperature contrasts between the cave interior and outside atmosphere, modulates the rate and amount of CO₂ degassing from the drip water and affects the hydrochemistry and consequently {{the fabric of the}} precipitating calcite. Although cave air composition and drip rate are both major variables in controlling CO₂ degassing from the drip water, the seasonally changing ventilation in Katerloch exerts the primary control and the results suggest a secondary (amplifying/attenuating) influence of the drip rate. Drip rate, however, might be the controlling parameter for lamina development at cave sites experiencing only small seasonal cave air exchange. Importantly, the seasonally variable composition of drip water does not reflect the seasonal cycle of processes in the soil zone, but results from exchange with the cave atmosphere. The alternating porous and dense calcite fabric is the expression of a variable degree of lateral coalescence of smaller crystallites forming large columnar crystals. The white, porous laminae represent partial coalescence and form during the warm season: low calcite δ 13 C values are linked to low δ 13 C values of cave air and drip water during that time. This observation corresponds to times of reduced cave ventilation, high pCO₂ of cave air, low drip water pH, lower calcite supersaturation and typically high drip rates. In contrast, the translucent, dense laminae represent more or less complete lateral coalescence (inclusion-free) during the cold season (high calcite, drip water and cave air δ 13 C values), i. e. times of enhanced cave ventilation, low cave air pCO₂, increased drip water pH, relatively high calcite supersaturation and typically low drip rates. In essence, the relative development of the two lamina types reflects changes in the seasonality of external air temperature and precipitation, with a strong control of the winter air temperature on the intensity of cave-air exchange. Thick translucent, dense laminae are favoured by long, cold and wet winters and such conditions may be related closely to the North Atlantic Oscillation mode (weak westerlies) and enhanced Mediterranean cyclone activity during the cold season. Studies of speleothem lamination can thus help to better understand (and quantify) the role of seasonality changes, for example, during rapid climate events...|$|R
