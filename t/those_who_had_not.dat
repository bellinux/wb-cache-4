5|$|Three years later, in 1876, Colorado {{became a}} state. At the time {{settlement}} had pushed as far west from its capital, Denver, as Leadville. There was {{a variety of}} metals and minerals in the surrounding mountains, and some miners had become rich from their claims there. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been so successful heard about reports from prospectors of abundant silver deposits further west, over the Divide.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as}} a relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not.</b> Readers of the series {{were found to be}} more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E

5|$|The British {{casualties}} were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but {{a member of}} Howe's staff wrote in his diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded. David McCullough gives much higher figures of 90 killed and 300 wounded. The Americans had about 30 killed and 100 wounded, including Knowlton and Major Andrew Leitch among the dead. The American victory raised morale in the ranks, even among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been engaged. It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington's command.|$|E
5|$|Von Oppen {{was moving}} northwards from Tubas towards Beisan the next day, with about 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} of the 16th and 19th Divisions, when he learned {{it had already been}} captured. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh, where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders would order the establishment of a strong rearguard. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army, ordered him to cross the Jordan instead; he successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attack, which closed the last Jordan River gaps. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> crossed were captured.|$|E
5|$|When {{the report}} was {{submitted}} to the House of Representatives, detractors soon began to speak against it. The notion of programs that resembled British practice were wicked along {{with the power of}} balance being shifted away from the Representatives to the executive branch were some of the prejudices that resided within the House. William Maclay suspected that several congressmen were involved in government securities, saw Congress in an unholy league with New York speculators. Congressman James Jackson also spoke against New York, with allegations of speculators attempting to swindle <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet heard about Hamilton's report.|$|E

5|$|According to {{a captive}} from Barcoor, {{pregnant}} women often gave birth en route, and their babies {{had to be}} borne bundled about them. When they rested, the infants were suspended in cradles from the branches of trees. If anyone happened to die they were buried on the spot. Captives were not given any rations, and {{when the time came}} to move on, <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> finished cooking had to leave behind their rice and the cooking pots. The Barcoor Manuscript along with other British Government records suggest that 20,000 captives (one-third of the total) died on the march to Seringapatam due to hunger, disease, and ill treatment by soldiers. The journey to Seringapatam took six weeks. By 1787, some 30,000 captives, half the original number, had perished.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening {{with them on the}} set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E

5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet been called to the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were {{those who had been}} called to the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had been called to the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E
5|$|Reviews of the Nintendo DSi were {{generally}} positive; although IGN and bit-tech decried the console's lack of exclusive software and {{removal of the}} GBA cartridge slot, its added functionality caused many journalists to recommend it to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> purchased a previous DS model. Numerous critics were disappointed with the limited resolution of DSi's cameras, though others such as Ars Technica and GameSpot agreed they were adequate for the handheld's display. CNET and PCWorld considered the DSi Shop {{to be the most}} important buying incentive for current DS owners. Some critics believed the DSi XL was not an essential upgrade. GamePro and Wired UK, on the other hand, praised the DSi XL's larger screens for improving the gaming experience and revitalizing older DS games.|$|E
5|$|Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, was {{singled out}} in {{particular}} for his central {{involvement in the}} rebellion, and for him the multiple was seven rather than five.

5|$|Von Oppen's battalions {{and about}} 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} in the 16th and 19th Infantry Divisions were moving north towards Beisan on 22 September when they learned {{it had already been}} captured. He planned to continue his withdrawal north to Samakh during the night of 22 September, where he correctly guessed that Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army which included Asia Corps, ordered von Oppen to move eastwards across the Jordan River. Von Oppen got all the German and some of his Ottoman soldiers across the Jordan River before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and closed that line of retreat during fighting to close the Jordan River gaps.

5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both the content and graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. Mystery of the Emblem was initially only going to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light for <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem. Due to space limitations, some characters featured in the original version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, Mystery of the Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E
5|$|The Heath {{ministry}} {{continued to}} experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973, subsequently losing the February 1974 general election. Labour formed a minority government {{and went on}} to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election. Heath's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt. Thatcher was not initially seen as the obvious replacement, but she eventually became the main challenger, promising a fresh start. Her main support came from the parliamentary 1922 Committee and The Spectator, but Thatcher's time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist rather than that of an ideologue. She defeated Heath on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership. In the second ballot she defeated Whitelaw, Heath's preferred successor. The vote polarised along right–left lines, with the region, experience and education of the MP also having their effects. Thatcher's support was stronger among MPs on the right, those from southern England, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> attended public schools or Oxbridge.|$|E

5|$|In early August 1944, Bezen Perrot was {{evacuated}} from Rennes joining the Germans in their {{retreat to the}} east, as Allied troops continued their advance from the north. During the unit's stay in Paris, Chanteau deserted causing others to follow his example. Three of the deserters later defected to the French Forces of the Interior, fighting in the Liberation of Paris. On 15 August, it was stationed in Creney-près-Troyes where it participated in the execution of 49 suspected Maquis. It passed through Strasbourg in October, reaching Tübingen in December. On 16 December, the unit celebrated {{the first anniversary of}} its formation. Lainé and Péresse were promoted to Untersturmführer and Sturmscharführer respectively, 18 other members received promotions and Wound Badges when they were due. On 29 December, Lainé reorganized the unit into four groups of 8 to 10 men. The first group joined the Waffen-SS, the second and third groups were dispatched to the Black Forest where they received sabotage and radio operation training accordingly. The fourth group consisted of members who were unsuitable for all other tasks, a self-proclaimed propaganda section. The Allies continued to pressure on forcing the 2nd and 3rd Groups to relocate to Fürstenfeldbruck on 25 April 1945. The staff of Bezen Perrot moved to Marburg in the same month. As Germany's defeat seemed imminent members were instructed to return to Brittany and go into hiding to areas where they would not be likely to be recognized. <b>Those</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> joined the Waffen-SS were left on their own.|$|E
