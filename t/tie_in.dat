40|$|BACKGROUND: Two-layer {{intestinal}} anastomosis increases the inflammatory response while single-layer anastomosis {{results in a}} better wound healing. However the four main kinds of stitches which may be chosen in performing single layer intestinal sutures never before had been comparatively studied. AIM: To compare the four more commonly used types of single layer surgical anastomosis sutures of the digestive tract. METHODS: Six mongrel dogs were operated, each one receiving two anastomosis: one at 30 cm from de Treitz angle - sero-submucosal technique, and the other at 60 cm - total technique. This placement was alternatively inverted. The four more commonly used types of single layer surgical anastomosis sutures of the digestive tract, namely: sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen, over the submucosa; sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> {{the exterior of the}} organ, over the serosa; total stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen, over the mucosa; and total sutures <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior, over the serosa (Gambee's stitches) were tested. After euthanasia (7 th post-operative day) macro and microscopic features were evaluated. Friedman's test was applied for morphometry and for evaluation of the peritoneal adhesions. RESULTS: Statistical significance was demonstrated through major residual acute inflammation and proliferation in total sutures and more profuse adhesions with the sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the lumen. The sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior over the serosa, had excellent realignment and regeneration of the layers. CONCLUSION: The sero-submucosal stitches <b>tied</b> <b>in</b> the exterior, over the serosa, were the best ones...|$|R
5|$|In {{swimming}} {{there was}} a three-way <b>tie</b> <b>in</b> the men's 100m freestyle event, and three bronze medals were awarded; a tie for {{second place in the}} women's 100m freestyle event meant that no bronze was awarded.

In wushu, a tie for the silver-medal position in the men's changquan event (taolu discipline) resulted in no bronze being awarded; a three-way <b>tie</b> <b>in</b> the men's nanquan event (also taolu discipline) resulted in three bronze medals being awarded. In gymnastics, many shared medals were awarded. A tie for first place in the pommel horse resulted in two gold medals, and thus no silver was awarded; a tie for third place in the horizontal bar, pommel horse, rings, women's vault and women's floor exercises meant that two bronzes were awarded for each event. A four-way tie for second position in the parallel bars meant that no bronze medal was awarded.|$|E
