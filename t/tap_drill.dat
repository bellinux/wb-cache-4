50|$|Forming tap: A quite {{different}} kind of tap is a Forming Tap. A forming tap, aka a fluteless tap or roll tap, simply forcefully displaces the metal into a thread shape upon being turned into the hole, instead of cutting metal {{from the sides of}} the hole as cutting taps do. A forming tap closely resembles a cutting tap without the flutes, or very nearly just like a plain thread. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. The threads behind the lobes are slightly recessed to reduce contact friction. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need to}} periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in a cutting tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with a cutting tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Forming taps only work in malleable materials such as mild steel or aluminum. Formed threads are typically stronger than cut threads. Note that the <b>tap</b> <b>drill</b> size differs from that used for a cutting tap as shown in most <b>tap</b> <b>drill</b> tables, and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E
5000|$|Truncation is {{achieved}} by using a slightly larger [...] {{in the case of}} female threads, or by slightly reducing the diameter of the threaded area of workpiece in the case of male threads, the latter effectively reducing the thread's major diameter. In the case of female threads, <b>tap</b> <b>drill</b> charts typically specify sizes that will produce an approximate 75 percent thread. A 60 percent thread may be appropriate in cases where high tensile loading will not be expected. In both cases, the pitch diameter is not affected. The balancing of truncation versus thread strength is similar to many engineering decisions involving the strength, weight and cost of material, as well as the cost to machine it.|$|E

40|$|Furnace tap-holes vary {{in design}} {{depending}} on the type of furnace and process involved, but share one common trait: the tap-hole must be opened and closed periodically. In general tap-holes are plugged with refractory clay after tapping, thereby stopping the flow of molten material. Once a furnace is ready to be <b>tapped,</b> <b>drilling</b> and/or lancing with oxygen are typically used to remove tap-hole clay from the tap-hole. Lancing with oxygen is an energy-intensive, mostly-manual process, which affects the performance and longevity of the tap-hole refractory material as well as the processes inside the furnace. Computational modeling offers an opportunity to gain insight into the possible effects of oxygen lancing on various aspects of furnace operation. [URL] Science and Metallurgical Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|CNC mills use {{computer}} {{controls to}} cut different materials. They {{are able to}} translate programs consisting of specific numbers and letters to move the spindle (or workpiece) to various locations and depths. Many use G-code, which is a standardized programming language that many CNC machines understand, while others use proprietary languages created by their manufacturers. These proprietary languages, while often simpler than G-code, are not transferable to other machines. CNC mills have many functions including face milling, shoulder milling, <b>tapping,</b> <b>drilling</b> and some even offer turning. Standard linear CNC mills are limited to 3 axis (X, Y, and Z) which allows for 2.5D machining, but others may also have one or more rotational axes which allow for advanced 3D machining.

Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (EXWC) Port Hueneme provided four shroud designs in a 1 : 160 scale for analysis, including a model with a free-spinning wind turbine incorporated. These models were studied in the Naval Postgraduate School MAE wind tunnel. Tunnel velocity and model angle were varied. Additionally, static wall pressures and cross section flow were studied with the addition of a screen. The pressure measurements were collected by a Scanivalve pressure scanner from up to 90 <b>taps</b> <b>drilled</b> into the models at various locations as well as through an Aeroflow 5 -hole probe, which took various measurements at multiple planes of each model. Flow visualization tests, including oil and tufts, were also conducted to help determine the aerodynamic efficiency of each model and identify any sign of flow separation. These studies provided a good evaluation of the efficiency of these models from a fluid flow perspective. While none of the models proved ideal, certain attributes, most importantly the geometry of a wind lens or flange on the shroud and a gradually diverging shape, proved to accelerate the flow through the duct.

The particle velocity and the abrasive flow rate were low in all of the tests to reduce the interaction between the incident and the rebounding particles in the system.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWind loads on sun tracking solar reflector panels {{exposed to the}} atmospheric boundary layer were established through surface static pressure measurements to determine how wind affects them, specifically {{at the request of}} SPAWAR-Pacific, which has developed a custom design. A 1 : 8 scale model of a four-panel array was studied in the Naval Postgraduate School wind tunnel. Wind velocity, wind angle orientation, and individual panel positions, at which the highest pressure coefficient cases were anticipated, were varied. The pressure coefficients were measured by an array of Scanivalve pressure transducers with 16 pressure <b>taps</b> <b>drilled</b> into the top and bottom surfaces of each panel. Oil flow and smoke flow visualization techniques were performed to better understand the flow features that led to the greatest pressure coefficients. A parapet was included to observe the wind effects of various positions. Additionally, pressure measurements were observed using a rounded edge installed on the lead panel edges. This notion was to assist in not only minimizing wind loads, but also in determining a safe stow position of the array during high wind events. The measurements and the flow visualization studies both provided a cohesive and constructive picture of the flow. The windward panel was found to be subjected to the thrust of the wind loads in most cases, with a maximum recorded differential pressure coefficient of 3. 25. However, when in combination with attaching the rounded edge to the windward panel and setting it negative five degrees, pressure coefficients were decreased by more than 70 %. Parapets of the appropriate help also reduced the measured loads significantly. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

The foil model was a modified NACA 16 shape with a chord of 7 feet and a span of 10 ft. The baseline foil was tested at 0, - 1 and + 1 degrees angle of attack measure relative to the foil's flat pressure side. Additional data was collected on the foil with a modified trailing edge shape again at 0 degrees angle of attack. Data was collected at flow speeds ranging from 1. 5 to 18. 3 m/s and at temperatures ranging from 22 to 40 deg C (70 to 104 deg F), resulting in a chord based Reynolds number range of 3 to 60 million. The Reynolds number range extends from the existing model scale up to full scale for some naval applications.
