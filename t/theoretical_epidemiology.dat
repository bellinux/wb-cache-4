40|$|The {{social and}} {{cultural}} responses to the AIDS/HIV epidemic focus attention both on the limitations of reification in biomedicine and on the deficiencies of many interpretations of culture in anthropology. Within clinical medicine the focus on disease and isolated aspects of the patient's somatic body alienates the patient's person, the body incarnate. AIDS/HIV infection reveals deficiencies in much epidemiological theorising insofar as it is merely regarded as either making possible or carrying out interventions on the health practice of individual others whether practitioners or patients.

40|$|This article reviews {{research}} on the evolutionary mechanisms leading to different transmission modes. Such modes are often under genetic control of the host or the pathogen, and often in conflict with each other via trade-offs. Transmission modes may vary among pathogen strains and among host populations. Evolutionary changes in transmission mode have been inferred through experimental and phylogenetic studies, including changes in transmission associated with host shifts and with evolution of the unusually complex life cycles of many parasites. Understanding the forces that determine the evolution of particular transmission modes presents a fascinating medley of problems {{for which there is}} a lack of good data and often a lack of conceptual understanding or appropriate methodologies. Our best information comes from studies that have been focused on the vertical versus horizontal transmission dichotomy. With other kinds of transitions, <b>theoretical</b> approaches combining <b>epidemiology</b> and population genetics are providing guidelines for determining when and how rapidly new transmission modes may evolve, but these are still in need of empirical investigation and application to particular cases.

40|$|Background: Outbreaks of {{emerging}} infectious diseases, {{especially those of}} a global nature, require rapid epidemiological analysis and information dissemination. The final products of those activities usually comprise internal memoranda and briefs within public health authorities and original research published in peer-reviewed journals. Using the 2003 {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemic as an example, we conducted a comprehensive time-stratified review of the published literature to describe the different types of epidemiological outputs. Methods and Findings: We identified and analyzed all published articles on the epidemiology of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong or Toronto. The analysis was stratified by study design, research domain, data collection, and analytical technique. We compared the SARS-case and matched-control non-SARS articles published according to the timeline of submission, acceptance, and publication.

40|$|Parasite environments are {{heterogeneous}} {{at different}} levels. The first level of variability {{is the host}} itself. The second level represents the external environment for the hosts, to which parasites may be exposed during part of their life cycle. Both levels are expected to affect parasite fitness traits. We disentangle the main and interaction effects of variation in the immediate host environment, here the diatom Asterionella formosa (variables host cell volume and host condition through herbicide pre-exposure) and variation in the external environment (variables host density and acute herbicide exposure) on three fitness traits (infection success, development time and reproductive output) of a chytrid parasite. Herbicide exposure only decreased infection success in a low host density environment. This result reinforces the hypothesis that chytrid zoospores use photosynthesis-dependent chemical cues to locate its host. At high host densities, chemotaxis becomes less relevant due to increasing chance contact rates between host and parasite, thereby following the mass-action principle in <b>epidemiology.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> support for this finding is provided by an agent-based simulation model. The immediate host environment (cell volume) substantially affected parasite reproductive output and also interacted with the external herbicide exposed environment. On the contrary, changes in the immediate host environment through herbicide pre-exposure did not increase infection success, though it had subtle effects on zoospore development time and reproductive output. This study shows that both immediate host and external environment {{as well as their}} interaction have significant effects on parasite fitness.

40|$|Introduction Despite optimistic {{predictions}} [37], many {{infectious diseases}} of humans, other animals, and plants {{persist in the}} face of modern medicine and technology. Epidemiological theory has a vital role to play in disease control; even if medical and molecular science could provide a "magic bullet" [...] -a cheap, 100 % effective treatment with no side effects [...] -we would still need practical advice about how to target it effectively in the population. In the absence of perfect cures and unlimited resources, theory has to provide practical advice on how to predict, control, and (eventually) eradicate various infectious diseases. These practical challenges connect with particular issues in <b>theoretical</b> <b>epidemiology.</b> To predict the course of an epidemic requires us to understand the mechanisms of disease spread; to control disease, we need to know how much effort will reduce disease incidence to a certain level, which in turn requires us to understan...|$|E

40|$|Epidemiological {{models for}} the spread of {{pathogens}} in a population are usually only able to describe a single pathogen. This makes their application unrealistic in cases where multiple pathogens with similar symptoms are spreading concurrently within the same population. Here we describe a method which makes possible the application of multiple single-strain models under minimal conditions. As such, our method provides a bridge between <b>theoretical</b> models of <b>epidemiology</b> and data-driven approaches for modeling of influenza and other similar viruses. Our model extends the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to higher dimensions, allowing the modeling of a population infected by multiple viruses. We further provide a method, based on an overcomplete dictionary of feasible realizations of SIR solutions, to blindly partition the time series representing the number of infected people in a population into individual components, each representing {{the effect of a}} single pathogen. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method on five years of seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, estimated from Twitter data. We demonstrate that our method describes, on average, 44 % {{of the variance in the}} ILI time series. The individual infectious components derived from our model are matched to known viral profiles in the populations, which we demonstrate matches that of independently collected epidemiological data. We further show that the basic reproductive numbers (R 0) of the matched components are in range known for these pathogens. Our results suggest that the proposed method can be applied to other pathogens and geographies, providing a simple method for estimating the parameters of epidemics in a population...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{prevalence}} of panic disorder {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is up to 10 times greater than the overall population {{prevalence of}} 1. 5 – 3. 5 %, and panic attacks are commonly experienced. When present, clinically significant anxiety decreases quality of life for COPD patients, and also increases health care costs. Therefore, understanding why COPD patients have such high rates of panic attacks and panic disorder is important for optimal management of COPD. The cognitive model of panic anxiety is the most widely accepted theory of panic attacks and panic disorder in physically healthy adults. According to this model, panic attacks occur when catastrophic misinterpretations of ambiguous physical sensations (such as shortness of breath or increased heart rate) increase arousal, creating a positive feedback loop that results in panic. As the major symptom of a terminal illness that threatens our most basic physical requirement, dyspnea in COPD is open to catastrophic misinterpretation. There is some experimental and clinical evidence for the applicability of the cognitive model of panic anxiety in COPD, and of the utility of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), based on this model, for treating anxiety symptoms and panic attacks in COPD patients. However, there is much need for further studies. Evidence is increasing that mental health professionals, in collaboration with multi-disciplinary pulmonary teams, potentially have key roles to play in preventing and treating panic attacks and panic disorder in COPD patients.

40|$|To {{understand}} the contact patterns {{of a population}} [...] who is in contact with whom, and when the contacts happen [...] is crucial for modeling outbreaks of infectious disease.

40|$|A central <b>theoretical</b> goal of <b>epidemiology</b> is the {{construction}} of spatial models of disease prevalence and risk, including maps for the potential spread of infectious disease. We provide three continent-wide maps representing the relative risk of malaria in Africa based on ecological niche models of vector species and risk analysis at a spatial resolution of 1 arc-minute (9 185 275 cells of approximately 4 sq km). Using a maximum entropy method we construct niche models for 10 malaria vector species based on species occurrence records since 1980, 19 climatic variables, altitude, and land cover data (in 14 classes). For seven vectors (Anopheles coustani, A. funestus, A. melas, A. merus, A. moucheti, A. nili, and A. paludis) these are the first published niche models. We predict that Central Africa has poor habitat for both A. arabiensis and A. gambiae, and that A. quadriannulatus and A. arabiensis have restricted habitats in Southern Africa as claimed by field experts in criticism of previous models. The results of the niche models are incorporated into three relative risk models which assume different ecological interactions between vector species. The "additive" model assumes no interaction; the "minimax" model assumes maximum relative risk due to any vector in a cell; and the "competitive exclusion" model assumes the relative risk that arises from the most suitable vector for a cell. All models include variable anthrophilicity of vectors and spatial variation in human population density. Relative risk maps are produced from these models. All models predict that human population density is the critical factor determining malaria risk. Our method of constructing relative risk maps is equally general. We discuss {{the limits of the}} relative risk maps reported here, and the additional data that are required for their improvement.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe National Mongolian Livestock Programme 2010 – 21, {{approved}} by the Mongolian Parliament in 2010, includes activities to eliminate brucellosis from Mongolia. As part of this programme, the Mongolian authorities planned to vaccinate animals in Western Aimags in 2011 and in the Central Aimags in 2012. The current project was implemented between 2011 and 2014 and included three seromonitoring studies conducted after the mass vaccination of livestock in Mongolia. The {{aim of this study}} was to assist the government in effective planning of brucellosis control measures and capacity-building in epidemiology. MethodsThe project consisted of three components: <b>theoretical</b> training on <b>epidemiology,</b> field work, and data analysis training. We conducted a cross-sectional study to measure vaccination and immunisation coverage and the prevalence of human brucellosis in the central region of Mongolia. We randomly selected two aimags (provinces) —Dundgobi and Uvurkhangai—from the nine aimags in Central Mongolia. The selections of households and herds were done in a four-stage random cluster sampling, proportional to the size of the targeted livestock herd. FindingsHuman brucellosis seropositivity was higher in Dundgobi (26 / 254 [10 %]) than in Uvurkhangai Aimag (9 / 252 [3 · 8 %]). The reported vaccination frequency of livestock in a khot ail (a cluster of several households that share shelter, water, and pasture) was high (87 % for cattle herds, 100 % for yak, and 96 % for goat and sheep herds). Seropositivity was 44 % in cattle, 92 % in yak, 70 % in goats, and 65 % in sheep. As part of the project, 40 epidemiology professionals received training and they are now able to apply the knowledge gained from the programme to their work. Furthermore, the Mongolian government has data for rates of brucellosis in humans and livestock in Central and Eastern Mongolia as a result of this project. InterpretationThe project has provided the groundwork for sustainable development by training Mongolian professionals to monitor brucellosis vaccination at a national level. The fight against brucellosis requires long-term commitment and financial and technical support from various stakeholders, including herders, veterinarians, medical professionals, and decision makers. Among ongoing challenges is that there is resistance from some veterinarians who deny the benefits of the one health approach and the contribution of international experts.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{diversification}} in religions by studying selection on cultural memes that colonize humans hosts. In analogy to studying the evolution of pathogens or symbionts colonizing animal hosts, we use models for host-pathogen dynamics known from <b>theoretical</b> <b>epidemiology.</b> In these models, religious memes colonize individual humans. Rates of transmission of memes between humans, i. e., transmission of cultural content, and rates of loss of memes (loss of faith) are determined by the phenotype of the cultural memes, and by interactions between hosts carrying different memes. In particular, based on the notion that religion can lead to oppression of lower classes once a religious society has reached a certain size, we assume that the rate of loss increases as the number of humans colonized by a particular meme phenotype increases. This generates frequency-dependent selection on cultural memes, and we use evolutionary theory to show that this frequency dependence can generate the emergence of coexisting clusters of different meme types. The different clusters correspond to different religions, and hence our model describes the emergence of distinct descendent religions from single ancestral religions.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in <b>theoretical</b> <b>epidemiology</b> is the epidemic threshold phenomenon, which specify {{the conditions for}} an epidemic to grow or die out. In standard (mean-field-like) compartmental models {{the concept of the}} basic reproductive number, R 0, has been systematically employed as a predictor for epidemic spread and as an analytical tool to study the threshold conditions. Despite the importance of this quantity, there are no general formulation of R 0 when one considers the spread of a disease in a generic finite population, involving, for instance, arbitrary topology of inter-individual interactions and heterogeneous mixing of susceptible and immune individuals. The goal of this work is to study this concept in a generalized stochastic system described in terms of global and local variables. In particular, the dependence of R 0 on the space of parameters that define the model is investigated; it is found that near of the ``classical'' epidemic threshold transition the uncertainty about the strength of the epidemic process still is significantly large. The forecasting attributes of R 0 for a discrete finite system is discussed and generalized; in particular, it is shown that, for a discrete finite system, the pretentious predictive power of R 0 is significantly reduced.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assist the government in effective planning of brucellosis control measures and capacity-building in epidemiology. Methods: The project consisted of three components: <b>theoretical</b> training on <b>epidemiology,</b> field work, and data analysis training. We conducted a cross-sectional study to measure vaccination and immunisation coverage and the prevalence of human brucellosis in the central region of Mongolia. We randomly selected two aimags (provinces) —Dundgobi and Uvurkhangai—from the nine aimags in Central Mongolia. The selections of households and herds were done in a four-stage random cluster sampling, proportional to the size of the targeted livestock herd. Findings: Human brucellosis seropositivity was higher in Dundgobi (26 / 254 [10 %]) than in Uvurkhangai Aimag (9 / 252 [3 · 8 %]). The reported vaccination frequency of livestock in a khot ail (a cluster of several households that share shelter, water, and pasture) was high (87 % for cattle herds, 100 % for yak, and 96 % for goat and sheep herds). Seropositivity was 44 % in cattle, 92 % in yak, 70 % in goats, and 65 % in sheep. As part of the project, 40 epidemiology professionals received training and they are now able to apply the knowledge gained from the programme to their work. Furthermore, the Mongolian government has data for rates of brucellosis in humans and livestock in Central and Eastern Mongolia as a result of this project. Interpretation: The project has provided the groundwork for sustainable development by training Mongolian professionals to monitor brucellosis vaccination at a national level. The fight against brucellosis requires long-term commitment and financial and technical support from various stakeholders, including herders, veterinarians, medical professionals, and decision makers. Among ongoing challenges is that there is resistance from some veterinarians who deny the benefits of the one health approach and the contribution of international experts. Funding: The project has been funded by the “Animal Health” project implemented jointly by the Government of Mongolia and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, with financial support from the Swiss development agency...|$|R

This article reviews research on the evolutionary mechanisms leading to different transmission modes. Such modes are often under genetic control of the host or the pathogen, and often in conflict with each other via trade-offs. Transmission modes may vary among pathogen strains and among host populations. Evolutionary changes in transmission mode have been inferred through experimental and phylogenetic studies, including changes in transmission associated with host shifts and with evolution of the unusually complex life cycles of many parasites. Understanding the forces that determine the evolution of particular transmission modes presents a fascinating medley of problems for which {{there is a lack of}} good data and often a lack of conceptual understanding or appropriate methodologies. Our best information comes from studies that have been focused on the vertical versus horizontal transmission dichotomy. With other kinds of transitions, <b>theoretical</b> approaches combining <b>epidemiology</b> and population genetics are providing guidelines for determining when and how rapidly new transmission modes may evolve, but these are still in need of empirical investigation and application to particular cases. Obtaining such knowledge is a matter of urgency in relation to extant disease threats.

40|$|Background: Outbreaks of {{emerging}} infectious diseases, {{especially those of}} a global nature, require rapid epidemiological analysis and information dissemination. The final products of those activities usually comprise internal memoranda and briefs within public health authorities and original research published in peer-reviewed journals. Using the 2003 {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemic as an example, we conducted a comprehensive time-stratified review of the published literature to describe the different types of epidemiological outputs. Methods and Findings: We identified and analyzed all published articles on the epidemiology of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong or Toronto. The analysis was stratified by study design, research domain, data collection, and analytical technique. We compared the SARS-case and matched-control non-SARS articles published according to the timeline of submission, acceptance, and publication. The impact factors of the publishing journals were examined according to the time of publication of SARS articles, and the numbers of citations received by SARS-case and matched-control articles submitted during and after the epidemic were compared. Descriptive, analytical, <b>theoretical,</b> and experimental <b>epidemiology</b> concerned, respectively, 54 %, 30 %, 11 %, and 6 % of the studies. Only 22 % of the studies were submitted, 8 % accepted, and 7 % published during the epidemic. The submission-to-acceptance and acceptance-to-publication intervals of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic period were significantly shorter than the corresponding intervals of matched-control non-SARS articles published in the same journal issues (p, 0. 001 and p, 0. 01, respectively). The differences of median submission-to-acceptance intervals and median acceptance-to-publication intervals between SARS articles and their corresponding control articles were 106. 5 d (95 % confidence interval [CI] 55. 0 - 140. 1) and 63. 5 d (95 % CI 18. 0 - 94. 1), respectively. The median numbers of citations of the SARS articles submitted during the epidemic and over the 2 y thereafter were 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 8. 0 - 52. 0) and 8 (IQR 3. 2 - 21. 8), respectively, significantly higher than the median numbers of control article citations (15, IQR 8. 5 - 16. 5, p, 0. 05, and 7, IQR 3. 0 - 12. 0, p, 0. 01, respectively). Conclusions: A majority of the epidemiological articles on SARS were submitted after the epidemic had ended, although the corresponding studies had relevance to public health authorities during the epidemic. To minimize the lag between research and the exigency of public health practice in the future, researchers should consider adopting common, predefined protocols and ready-to-use instruments to improve timeliness, and thus, relevance, in addition to standardizing comparability across studies. To facilitate information dissemination, journal managers should reengineer their fast-track channels, which should be adapted to the purpose of an emerging outbreak, taking into account the requirement of high standards of quality for scientific journals and competition with other online resources. © 2010 Xing et al. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
