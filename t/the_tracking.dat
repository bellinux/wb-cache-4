50|$|Speedway Miramichi is a 1/3-mile short track {{located in}} Miramichi, New Brunswick. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> {{originally}} opened as a dirt track called Douglastown Speedway but was paved in 1968. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> closed {{a few years}} after opening in 1974. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> was reopened as Williston Speedway. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> ran races with large crowds for years as <b>the</b> <b>track</b> continued improvements. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> also went through several name changes including MacKay Speedway and Miramichi Speedway. In 1997 <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was sold to Reg Tozer and renamed Miramichi City Speedway. Shortly after, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> started running demolition events instead of stock car racing. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> shut down following the 2009 season. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> sat dormant for two seasons {{with the exception of one}} race weekend in September each year. In late 2011, <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was sold to Jason Carnahan and David Neilson. The owners renamed <b>the</b> <b>track</b> Speedway Miramichi and have made continuous improvements to the facility, which is currently running 5-6 races per season. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> once had a well known sportsman race called the Brunswick 100.|$|R
50|$|Midget {{car racing}} was invented at <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> <b>track</b> hosted midget car racing from <b>the</b> <b>track's</b> debut in May 1934 to 1950. The 1939 Turkey Night Grand Prix {{was held at}} <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> {{was closed}} from the 1970s to racing, until North Buncombe High School {{was built on}} the {{property}} of <b>the</b> former <b>track.</b> In <b>the</b> 1970s and 1980s <b>the</b> <b>track</b> was used as softball fields and sports practice fields. <b>The</b> <b>track</b> itself had been disabled by first placing earthen barriers on opposite sides of <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> and later, concrete barriers at 8 locations around <b>the</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fear of a Black Planet debuted {{at number}} 40 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart.

5|$|Keen gets to {{the girl}} first but loses her in a daring raid by Zamani's forces. Now aware of Keen, Zamani attacks her husband, Tom, in their home, gravely {{wounding}} him. Keen notes a stamp on the man’s hand and deduces the attack {{will take place at}} a zoo. Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani, revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI, he masterminded the ploy, as well as the attack on Tom. Reddington removes <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> device and places it with Zamani, which helps the FBI track down and kill the latter. Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack. Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband, with whom she is trying to adopt a baby, is not what he appears to be.|$|E

Kirk tells her of his mission and asks for <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> frequency for the whales, but she refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Scott, McCoy, and Sulu trade the formula of transparent aluminum for the materials needed for the whale tank. Uhura and Chekov locate a nuclear powered ship, the aircraft carrier Enterprise. They collect the power they need, but are discovered on board. Uhura is beamed back but Chekov is captured and severely injured in an escape attempt.|$|E
30|$|Since the MMP-CBMeMBer {{algorithm}} cannot give <b>the</b> <b>tracks,</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> maintenance {{algorithm is}} proposed by introducing the particle labeling method, which can effectively achieve <b>the</b> <b>track</b> continuity for <b>the</b> multiple maneuvering target <b>tracking.</b> <b>The</b> detailed process of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> maintenance is described as follows.|$|R
50|$|One plan to refloat <b>the</b> <b>track</b> with {{horsemen}} {{investing in}} <b>the</b> <b>track</b> failed. In May 1996, retired newspaper executive Michel St. Louis and 28 other investors purchased <b>the</b> <b>track</b> for $1.2 million and $500,000 in unpaid taxes. St. Louis, a horseman himself, and the investors pooled their RRSP savings to buy <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> <b>The</b> <b>track</b> reopened as Hippodrome d'Aylmer on September 29, 1996.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>track</b> listing {{for both}} editions is the same. However, the running time {{of most of}} <b>the</b> remastered <b>tracks</b> vary from <b>the</b> {{original}} release due to a different placement of <b>the</b> <b>track</b> marks between songs.

5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
5|$|The Mastiff RPVs went {{in first}} {{to cause the}} Syrian SAMs to turn on their radars by convincing the Syrians that many attack {{aircraft}} were overhead. Once the Mastiffs were tracked by Syrian radar, <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> signals were relayed to another Scout outside of the missiles' range. The Scout then relayed the signal to E2C Hawkeye aircraft orbiting off the coast. The data gathered was analyzed by the E2Cs and Boeing 707 ECM aircraft. Once the SAM crews fired missiles at the drones, the F-15s and F-16s provided air cover while F-4 Phantoms attacked the SAM batteries, destroying them with AGM-78 and AGM-45 anti-radiation missiles. The rapid flight time of the missiles minimized the F-4s' exposure to the SAMs. The Syrians reportedly fired 57 SA-6s, to no effect.|$|E
5|$|This motion {{camouflage}} {{strategy was}} discovered and modelled as algorithms in 1995 by M. V. Srinivasan and M. Davey {{while they were}} studying mating behaviour in hoverflies. The male hoverfly appeared to be using <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> technique to approach prospective mates. Motion camouflage has been observed in high-speed territorial battles between dragonflies, where males of the Australian emperor dragonfly, Hemianax papuensis were seen to choose their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals in 6 of 15 encounters. They made use of both real-point and infinity-point strategies.|$|E

5|$|Within the Southern Hemisphere {{tropical}} cyclones generally form on {{a regular}} basis between the African coast and the middle of the South Pacific. Tropical and Subtropical Cyclones have also been noted occurring in the Southern Atlantic Ocean at times. For various reasons including where tropical cyclones form, there are several different ways to split the area between the American and African coasts. For instance the World Meteorological Organization define three different basins for <b>the</b> <b>tracking</b> and warning of tropical cyclones. These are the South-West Indian Ocean between the African Coast and 90°E, the Australian region between 90°E and 160°E and the South Pacific between 160°E and 120°W. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the whole region, but splits it at 135°E into the South Pacific and the Southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Henry finds a {{backpack}} and disposable camera {{belonging to a}} boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains {{was the son of}} Ned (Mac Brandt), a fellow lookout. Brian had illicitly stayed with his father, though Delilah had kept this from her superiors, and both Brian and Ned had disappeared without a trace. The teenage girls are reported missing. Henry later discovers a radio and clipboard with transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is knocked out and finds the clipboard and radio gone. Henry proceeds to break into a government research area, discovering surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's lives and conversations. After taking a tracking device, he leaves the compound. As Henry hikes back, he witnesses it set afire by an unknown individual.
