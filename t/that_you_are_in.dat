500|$|In 2010 Jaywick was {{assessed}} {{as the most}} deprived area in England. In September 2015 it was again named as the most deprived, according to the indices of deprivation based on several factors including poverty, crime, education and skill levels, unemployment and housing, after being assessed in 2012–13. Referring to the older estates in Jaywick, the headmistress of Frobisher Primary School said [...] "When you go to certain parts of it, you are quite shocked <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> England." [...] In 2012 Jaywick was labelled the UK's youth unemployment hotspot. Randeep Ramesh, writing in The Guardian, noted {{that there has been}} little employment available since the Butlins holiday camp closed in 1983. Local charity Signpost has helped young people find employment, which has become difficult due to many jobs being a significant distance away in Colchester or Ipswich. Tightening of building regulations has meant that simple builders jobs for cash are now illegal without appropriate health and safety training. Drug abuse is a particular problem in the area. Because of the area's reputation for economic deprivation, private developers are unwilling to invest there. In August 2013 a [...] "one mile fresh food challenge" [...] in Jaywick, organised by The Big Issue, found only [...] "a bag of blackened bananas" [...] and [...] "potatoes at £2.29 per 2kg".|$|E

2500|$|About the performance-capture process Singer stated, [...] "It's fascinating... It {{takes you}} back to play-acting as a kid {{in your living room}} because you are running around and having to imagine <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when you are there other than {{styrofoam}} and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act as kids or do minimalist theatre. But in that way it's fascinating - I can see why Robert Zemeckis and James Cameron have started to shoot pictures this way".|$|E

Deirdre) which he (Conchobar) felt hardest to be taken from him, now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> his power. And it is to visit you that I have been sent,’ said Levarcham, ‘and to see whether her own form and figure remain to Deirdre.

2500|$|Li Chun {{was born}} in 778, {{during the reign of}} his {{great-grandfather}} Emperor Daizong, at the Eastern Palace (i.e., the palace of his grandfather, then-Crown Prince Li Kuo). [...] His father Li Song was Li Kuo's oldest son, and he himself was Li Song's oldest son. [...] His mother was Li Song's concubine Consort Wang. [...] When Li Chun was five or six, by which time Li Kuo was emperor (as Emperor Dezong), there was an occasion when Emperor Dezong held Li Chun on his lap and asked, [...] "Who are you, such <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> my lap?" [...] His response of, [...] "I am the third Son of Heaven" [...] surprised Emperor Dezong, who thereafter showed him much favor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{high cost}} of Titanic's set made it {{impossible}} for the show to have traditional out of town tryouts. [...] Titanic opened at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in 1997 to mixed reviews. The New Yorker's was a positive assessment from the New York press: [...] "It seemed a foregone conclusion that the show would be a failure; a musical about history's most tragic maiden voyage, in which fifteen hundred people lost their lives, was obviously preposterous.... Astonishingly, Titanic manages to be grave and entertaining, somber and joyful; little by little you realize <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the presence of a genuine addition to American musical theatre." [...] The show was championed by Rosie O'Donnell, who talked about the show daily on her television show, inviting the cast to perform musical numbers and giving theatre tickets to the members of her studio audiences. This publicity, along with the show's strong showing at the Tony Awards, sweeping all five categories in which it was nominated including Best Score, Best Book, and Best Musical, enabled it to outlast its competition. [...] It ran for 804 performances and 26 previews, toured America for three years, and has had national and international productions ever since. The most recent 2013 Southwark Theatre production in London swept all the Off-West End Awards as Best Musical Production.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
