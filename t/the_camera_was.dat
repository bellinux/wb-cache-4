5|$|A nearby Citgo {{service station}} also had {{security}} cameras, but a video released on September 15, 2006 {{did not show}} the crash because <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> pointed away from the crash site.|$|E
5|$|The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{developed}} a battery-powered pigeon camera now {{on display in}} the CIA Museum's virtual tour. According to the website, the details of the camera's use are still classified. News reports suggest that <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> used in the 1970s, that the pigeons were released from planes, and that it was a failure.|$|E
5|$|The new camera {{will allow}} Hubble to take large-scale, {{extremely}} clear and detailed photos over {{a wider range}} of colors than the old camera did. After the installation, controllers at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center sent commands to the camera to perform an aliveness test, which passed, indicating <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> installed correctly.|$|E
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> identical in every respect. <b>The</b> left <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated {{as a master}} while <b>the</b> right <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated as a slave but this distinction is merely {{the result of the}} way the outputs from <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> treated by <b>the</b> video concentrator.|$|R
30|$|After {{determining}} world coordinates, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> {{registered to}} obtain <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> matrix, namely focal length of camera, optical center, and radial distortion parameters of image. Therefore, <b>camera</b> labeling <b>is</b> required. In <b>the</b> work, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> labeled by Yang and Patras [31] to obtain <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> matrix.|$|R
5000|$|While some {{disposables}} {{contain an}} actual cartridge as used for loading normal, reusable cameras, others {{just have the}} film wound internally on an open spool. <b>The</b> whole <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> handed in for processing. Some of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> recycled, i.e. refilled with film and resold. <b>The</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> returned for [...] "processing" [...] {{in the same fashion}} as film cameras.|$|R
5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
50|$|Camera Shake Indicator - When {{the green}} and orange lamps blink, this means that <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> shaking, and <b>the</b> picture may blur. When the lamps stop {{blinking}} <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> held steady and is ready to take a picture.|$|R
50|$|Draw {{the child}} nodes of this node recursively. The child node closest to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> drawn first using a Scanline algorithm. This {{can be found}} from looking at {{which side of the}} node's {{dividing}} line <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> on.|$|R
5000|$|Adjustment - how {{the shutter}} angle can be {{adjusted}}. Most manual designs can only <b>be</b> adjusted when <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> not running, {{often with the}} lens removed. All electronic shutters allow adjustment at all times, including when <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> running.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, the data from <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority {{over the use of}} the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of operation of <b>the</b> NACA high-speed <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> completely explained. This <b>camera,</b> operating at <b>the</b> rate of 40, 000 photographs per second, took the photographs presented in numerous NACA reports concerning combustion, preignition, and knock in the spark-ignition engine. Many design details are presented and discussed, details of an entirely conventional nature are omitted. The inherent aberrations of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> discussed and partly evaluated. The focal-plane-shutter effect of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> explained. Photographs of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> presented. Some high-speed motion pictures of familiar objects [...] photoflash bulb, firecrackers, <b>camera</b> shutter [...] <b>are</b> reproduced {{as an illustration}} {{of the quality of}} the photographs taken by <b>the</b> <b>camera...</b>|$|R
25|$|Modern {{photography}} {{has raised}} {{a number of}} concerns on its effect on society. In Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954), <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing'.|$|R
50|$|TES has a pan {{chromatic}} {{camera for}} remote sensing. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> which {{is capable of}} producing images of 1 metre resolution. 1 m resolution means <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> able to distinguish between two objects which are separated at least a metre.|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> held by Debie.|$|E
5|$|There are two known {{photographs}} of Bahá'u'lláh, both {{taken at the}} same occasion in 1868 {{while he was in}} Adrianople (present-day Edirne). The one where he looks at <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> taken for passport purposes and is reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bahá'í Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the Bahá'í World Centre, and one is on display in the International Archives building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized pilgrimage. Outside of this experience Bahá'ís prefer not to view his photos in public, or even to display any of them in their private homes, and Bahá'í institution strongly suggests to use an image of Bahá'u'lláh's burial shrine instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camera</b> Style At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> movie, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> hand held and shaky. As {{the main character}} grows and changes, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> movement goes from hand-held to a steady cam. Finally by the end, when the main character has completed her journey, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> locked down and centered.|$|R

5000|$|In older analog {{security}} <b>camera</b> systems, <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> [...] "dumb" [...] devices only {{capable of}} producing a video signal continuously, and any video signal processing {{had to be done}} by the recording VMS.

5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} the game was {{postponed}} 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17p.m. The cast of the television series Glee (with Amber Riley singing lead) performed the national anthem prior to the game {{as part of a}} ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off solo home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 {{in the bottom of the}} second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the top of the wall, and the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> moved back for Game4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.|$|E
25|$|The Robotic Arm Camera (RAC) {{attached}} to the Robotic Arm just above the scoop {{was able to take}} full-color pictures of the area, as well as verify the samples that the scoop returned, and examined the grains of the area where the Robotic Arm had just dug. <b>The</b> <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> made by the University of Arizona and Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Germany.|$|E
