40|$|The {{provision}} of crops {{of a light}} fry colour, from store, is {{of the utmost importance}} to processors. Poor fry colour leads to rejection of crops on a quality basis. The application of Chlorpropham (CIPC) sprout suppressant, as a <b>thermal</b> <b>fog</b> is associated with a deterioration in fry colour. The BPC funded project at the University of Glasgow and its collaborator Sutton Bridge Experimental Unit investigates the effects of CIPC use on the processing quality of stored potatoes. CIPC is the only sprout suppressant available for medium and long-term storage for processing in Britain. In the UK the majority of CIPC treatments are conducted as <b>thermal</b> <b>fog</b> applications. This is considered to be the most practical means of achieving successful sprout control. The introduction of a hot fog into potato stores has a disruptive influence. It can physiologically alter the potatoes by creating a stressful environment. Tuber respiration rate increases and so the crop will age. Experimental trials conducted as part of this project have shown that it is the fogging process itself that is responsible for the decrease in crop quality following application, not the CIPC formulation applied. Studies revealed that both carbon dioxide and ethylene were produced naturally by crop and from the combustion of petrol used to generate <b>thermal</b> <b>fogs.</b> Initially the fry colour problems were linked with carbon dioxide in combustion gases and from increased respiration. However, carbon dioxide output from thermal fogger machines was less significant than expected. The levels were consistently lower than concentrations shown to have a deleterious effect in previous BPC funded work. Ethylene is present in <b>thermal</b> <b>fogs</b> as a by-product of burning the hydrocarbon fuel used to generate fog. The concentration of ethylene produced is associated with the running conditions of the fogger machine I. e. burner temperature, type and volume of fuel used etc. The ethylene created in a standard CIPC thermal-fog application is sufficient to induce a physiological response in tubers. Exposure of crop to ethylene effects respiration, dormancy period, sprout morphology, reducing sugar concentration and hence fry colour. The extent of the outcome depends on exposure time and concentration. Following assessment of the fogging situation, various means of reducing the impact of CIPC application on fry colour were evaluated. Different approaches were undertaken and included both attempting to control and remove the contaminants present in <b>thermal</b> <b>fogs.</b> By ventilating stores earlier than the recommended twenty-four hour period after treatment a vast improvement in fry colour was observed. In doing this the exposure time of crop to contaminants was greatly reduced. In the experimental work the stores were ventilated eight hours after treatment. This allowed adequate time for the effective fraction of the thermal god to settle. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The measuring system composes of ultrasonic transducer, glass water bath, He-Ne laser source, lens, and screen. An ultrasound <b>fog</b> <b>generator</b> used for producing an ultrasound with a frequency f of 1. 74 MHz was immersed in DI water. It was fixed at one side of water bath. When the sound wave travels in water {{along the length of}} water bath, a standing wave is obtained from the interference of the incidence wave and the wave reflected from the opposite side of water bath. The node and antinode of the standing wave act as an opaque and transparent medium. As a He-Ne laser beam with a wavelength of 632. 8 nm travelled to a convex lens with a focal length of 5 cm and diverged through the sound field, an enlarged standing wave pattern was shown on a white screen. The wavelength of sound wave λ was obtained using geometry (similar triangle). Therefore, the speed of ultrasound in water was calculated by v = fλ. In this work, the water temperature was varied in a range of 15 - 39 °C. The results showed that the speed of sound increased with increasing the water temperature.

The objective is to validate and improve Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools that will be useful in determining ship air wake impact on naval rotary wing vehicles. This project is funded by the Office of Naval Research and includes extensive coordination with Naval Air Systems Command. Currently, ship launch and recovery wind limits and envelopes for helicopters are primarily determined through at-sea in situ flight testing that is expensive and frequently difficult to schedule and complete.

40|$|We {{live in an}} {{age where}} our society faces the great {{challenge}} of generating, storing and transporting energy in responsible ways that minimize impact to the environment. Significant effort has been spent to develop new technologies capable of (1) efficiently converting renewable energy into usable electricity, (2) storing energy into high performance energy storage devices, and (3) fabricating advanced energy conversion and storage devices using environmentally benign technologies. One of the approaches is to genetically engineer M 13 bacteriophage (M 13 virus) to display proteins with specific functionalities, which allow the synthesis and organization of hybrid materials in environmentally friendly manners. The primary goal of my Ph. D. thesis has been to develop M 13 virus-enabled processes for building the electrodes of advanced energy conversion and energy storage devices, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), electrochemical capacitors, and perovskite hybrid solar cells (PSCs). In order to fabricate nanostructures for the DSC photoanodes, the M 13 viruses were crosslinked into a virus hydrogel {{that served as a}} multifunctional 3 D scaffold capable of binding gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to the virus proteins. The AuNP-virus hydrogel was encapsulated in titanium dioxide (TiO₂) to produce a plasmon-enhanced nanowire (NW) -based DSC photoanode that enabled a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8. 46 %. A theoretical model was developed that predicted the experimentally observed trends of plasmon-enhancement. Furthermore, to optimize the surface-to-volume ratio of the photoanodes to maximize PCE, a tunable fabrication process used individual free-floating M 13 virus as the template for TiO₂ NWs, and the assynthesized NWs were blended with sacrificial polymer to control the film porosity. The optimized semiconducting mesoporous networks were used as photoanodes in both DSCs and PSCs, and the effects of surface morphology on the photovoltaic properties was experimentally investigated. In order to construct the electrodes of electrochemical capacitors, M 13 viruses were genetically programmed to bind single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in a controlled fashion by aligning SWNTs {{along the length of the}} phage without aggregation. The SWNTs-virus complexes were used as the basis for the formation of crosslinked virus hydrogel scaffolds for the fabrication of porous 3 D polyaniline (PANI) nanostructures. The PANI-coated SWNT nanocomposites further improved the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity of thin films. In addition, by using a <b>fog</b> <b>generator</b> to deliver the crosslinker solution, larger-area virusbased hydrogels were fabricated for versatile material coatings, including PANI, MnOx, Ni, and Ni-MnOx. Lastly, an environmentally-responsible process to fabricate efficient PSCs was developed that recycled lead content from discarded car batteries. Perovskite films, assembled using materials sourced from either recycled battery materials or high-purity commercial reagents, showed the same material characterizations and the identical photovoltaic performance, indicating the practical feasibility of recycling car batteries for lead-based PSCs. by Po-Yen Chen.

40|$|Work {{described}} in this thesis was designed to address a number of environmental issues relating {{to the use of}} chlorpropham (CIPC) as a sprout suppressant in potato stores. Studies considered the behaviour of CIPC during the application process and storage and also the potential for it to be released into the environment. All commercial studies were carried out in box stores, rather than bulk stores. A survey of potato growers was carried out to provide up-to-date industry information on store management practice and {{to determine the extent of}} chlorpropham use in the UK. Results confirmed that the vast majority of crop held in the UK for both pre-packing and processing is treated with chlorpropham. In most cases, several applications are necessary to maintain sprout control throughout the season, which highlights the inefficiency of the application process. <b>Thermal</b> <b>fog</b> application (the industry standard) is known to be inefficient, and to result in uneven distribution of chlorpropham around the store. This can lead to unacceptably high chemical residues in crop at certain locations, and poor sprout control in places that do not receive the correct dose. The imminent introduction of a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for chlorpropham means that store managers must be able to predict with confidence the amount of chemical reaching each tuber. Analysis of crop from commercial stores found chemical levels ranging from 0 - 50 mg kg- 1 following conventional application. Washing significantly reduced these very high levels in most cases. Improvements in chemical distribution (and a lowering of the highest chemical levels) were seen when the movement of air and fog around the store were manipulated using fans or by restricting air flow using polythene sheeting. A method for the collection and analysis of air samples was developed and used to quantify CIPC in samples of air from treated stores. Vapour concentrations were found to be of the order of mg l- 1 (parts per billion), and to increase linearly with air temperature. 3 -chloroaniline (a metabolite of CIPC) was also identified in the air samples, suggesting significant breakdown of the CIPC molecule may occur during chemical application or storage. The mechanism of breakdown was not identified. Contaminated fabrics within the store are believed to provide a reservoir of chemical that can readily volatilise and be found in the vapour phase. The presence of chlorpropham in the air has implications for crop contamination and the extent of chemical loss from the store. Samples of effluent from potato washing plants were collected and analysed on several occasions. The CIPC concentration to liquid effluent (after removal of all suspended material) was found to range from several mg/l (parts per million) in untreated samples to < 0. 01 mg l- 1 following filtration and digestion.

Further generalisations define composition policies for repeated declarations so that classes, arrays, enumerations and functions may all be extended. These composition policies support the weaving necessary for re-useable implementation of design patterns and for Aspect Oriented Programming. A declarative form of meta-programming is supported by derivation rules, which specify how a declaration specified in a base class is to be reinterpreted in derived classes. Automated generation of derived functionality is important for a number of design patterns. More general meta-programming is provided by elevating most run-time concepts to the meta-level, allowing conditional and iterated manipulation of declarations at compile-time. Compile-time execution enables subsequent run-time code to be optimised to suit application requirements. The use of meta-variables and meta-functions together with a well-disciplined lexical context for meta-programming and meta-level execution provide a complete replacement for the traditional C preprocessor functionality, satisfying Stroustrup's goal of making Cpp redundant [Stroustrup 97]. The new functionality is integrated with the language, fits within an Object-Oriented framework and provides adequate support for modern Software Engineering practices. The C++ grammar is known to pose a significant parsing challenge and to require context dependent type and template knowledge. This creates considerable difficulties when meta-programming occurs in unresolved contexts. A new approach to parsing C++ has therefore been developed that defers the use of type and template information. This approach leads to a simpler grammar implementation. An extended form of regular expression is presented and used to predict known ambiguities and then show that this simpler grammar covers the C++ grammar...|$|R
