Moreover, the lack of roadblocks following the emergency call which had allowed the gunmen to flee in the getaway car through winding country backroads that were difficult to access and exit if one was not familiar with them led journalist Peter Taylor to allege that the UVF unit probably received help from the security forces.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{extension}} of a phrase-based decoder that dynamically chunks, reorders, and applies phrase translations in tandem. A maximum entropy classifier is trained based on the word alignments <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>positions</b> <b>to</b> chunk <b>the</b> source sentence. No language specific or syntactic information is used to build the chunking classifier. Words inside the chunks are moved together to enable the decoder to make longdistance re-orderings to capture the word order differences between languages with different sentence structures. To keep the search space manageable, phrases inside the chunks are monotonically translated, thus by eliminating the unnecessary local re-orderings, {{it is possible to}} perform long-distance re-orderings beyond the common fixed distortion limit. Experiments on German to English translation are reported. ...|$|R
2500|$|A key {{strategy}} in squash {{is known as}} [...] "dominating the T" [...] (the intersection of the red lines near {{the centre of the}} court, shaped like the letter [...] "T", where the player is in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> retrieve the opponent's next shot).

2500|$|Being [...] "out of his ground" [...] {{is defined}} as not having {{any part of the}} batsman's body or his bat {{touching}} the ground behind the crease – i.e., if his bat is slightly elevated from the floor despite being behind the crease, or if his foot is on the crease line itself but not completely across it and touching the ground behind it, then he would be considered out (if stumped). One of the fielding team (such as the wicket-keeper himself) must appeal for the wicket by asking the umpire.

2500|$|The rack, {{like other}} {{intermediate}} gaits, is smoother than the trot because the hooves hitting the ground individually rather in pairs minimizes {{the force and}} bounce the horse transmits to the rider. [...] To achieve this gait the horse must be in a [...] "hollow position". This means that, instead of a rounded back as seen in dressage horses and others that work off their hind quarters, the spine is curved somewhat downward. [...] This puts the racking horse in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> rack without breaking into another gait. If the rider sits back or leans slightly back, this will encourage the hollow position. This allows the hind legs to trail and makes the rack easier for the horse.

2500|$|Innovation in the {{construction}} business also included a definite commitment to finish the building on time. Hitherto the financial risk of delays were assumed by the clients.

[...] It is noteworthy that Kreuger & Toll's entire capital would have covered just two days of being late.

The supreme commander Werner von Blomberg ordered that aviation units in support of naval operations was the domain of the Luftwaffe but under Kriegsmarine control. It did not resolve the question of which service should be responsible for aerial operations at sea. After the naval staff complained again at the absence of a resolution on 10 March a new conference was organised with Albert Kesselring, Chief of the General Staff, and Göring on 1 April and 10 May with the same result. Göring attacked Blomberg's and Raeder's views and thus decided that air units should only be put at the disposal of the navy during specific operations. Perhaps exasperated and defeated, Raeder noted on 20 May 1937, [...] "Commander in Chief, Navy has decided that the demand of command by the Navy over all Naval Air units shall not be voiced." [...] Raeder noted that Göring did not accept that the navy should have control of air units, and likely never would.|$|E

The caravel of Dom Jerónimo de Castelo Branco was the first to vigorously ram and grapple two galleys, hurling a large number of clay fire bombs before boarding them. Thrown into disarray, many Turkish sailors and soldiers jumped to sea, where they were cut down by the shallow draught Portuguese foists.

6000|$|Now it {{is clear}} that the larger portion, if not the whole, of these plants must have reached New Zealand from Australia (or in a few cases Australia from New Zealand), by {{transmission}} across the sea, because we know there has been no actual land connection during the Tertiary period, as proved by the absence of all the Australian mammalia, and almost all the most characteristic Australian birds, insects, and plants. The form of the sea-bed shows that the distance could not have been less than 600 miles, even during the greatest extension of Southern New Zealand and Tasmania; and we have no reason to suppose it to have been less, because in other cases an equally abundant flora of identical species has reached islands at a still greater distance--notably in the case of the Azores and Bermuda. The character of the plants is also just what we should expect: for about two-thirds of them belong to genera of world-wide range in the temperate zones, such as Ranunculus, Drosera, Epilobium, Gnaphalium, Senecio, Convolvulus, Atriplex, Luzula, and many sedges and grasses, whose exceptionally wide distribution shows that they possess exceptional powers of dispersal and vigour of constitution, enabling them not only to reach distant countries, but also to establish themselves there. Another set of plants belong to especially Antarctic or south temperate groups, such as Colobanthus, Acæna, Gaultheria, Pernettya, and Muhlenbeckia, and these may in some cases have reached both Australia and New Zealand from some now submerged Antarctic island. Again, about one-fourth of the whole are alpine plants, and these possess two advantages as colonisers. Their lofty stations place them in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> have their seeds carried away by winds; and they would in this case reach a country which, having derived the earlier portion of its flora from the side of the tropics, would be likely to have its higher mountains and favourable alpine stations to a great extent unoccupied, or occupied by plants unable to compete with specially adapted alpine groups. {504} ...|$|E
