This approach does not enable precise control of the carbonate chemistry because it does not include a device to ensure full equilibration of added CO2 in seawater and its precise control. There are no experimental chambers to regulate water flow, and thus allows for natural near-bottom flow conditions, but it generates highly variable pH under variable current speed or direction.

To evaluate the role of the temperature on the gas mass transfer, k(L) a measurements have been used to supplement the existing published data.

At 15, 30, 45, and 70 degrees C, (k(L) a) (o) values (for oxygen) were determined under three different energy input conditions by the dynamic gassing in/out method. The (k(L) a) (o) was shown to increase under these conditions with increasing temperature, and straight lines were obtained when the logarithm of (k(L) a) (o) was plotted against the temperature. By multiplying the equilibrium concentration of O(2) in water with (k(L) a) (o) maximal, O(2) transfer capacities were calculated.

40|$|Cah 3 is {{the only}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase (CA) isoform located in the thylakoid lumen of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Previous studies demonstrated its association with the donor side of the photosystem II (PSII) where it {{is required for the}} optimal function of the water oxidizing complex. However this enzyme has also been frequently proposed to perform a critical function in inorganic carbon acquisition and CO(2) fixation and all mutants lacking Cah 3 exhibit very poor growth after <b>transfer</b> to low <b>CO(2)</b> conditions. In the present work we demonstrate that after <b>transfer</b> to low <b>CO(2),</b> Cah 3 is phosphorylated and that phosphorylation is correlated to changes in its localization and its increase in activity. When C. reinhardtii wild-type cells were acclimated to limiting CO(2) conditions, the Cah 3 activity increased about 5 - 6 fold. Under these conditions, there were no detectable changes in the level of the Cah 3 polypeptide. The increase in activity was specifically inhibited in the presence of Staurosporine, a protein kinase inhibitor, suggesting that the Cah 3 protein was post-translationally regulated via phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro dephosphorylation experiments confirm this hypothesis. In vivo phosphorylation analysis of thylakoid polypeptides indicates that there was a 3 -fold increase in the phosphorylation signal of the Cah 3 polypeptide within the first two hours after <b>transfer</b> to low <b>CO(2)</b> conditions. The increase in the phosphorylation signal was correlated with changes in the intracellular localization of the Cah 3 protein. Under high CO(2) conditions, the Cah 3 protein was only associated with the donor side of PSII in the stroma thylakoids.

UHT granulites are generally characterized by dry mineral assemblages, the stability of which require low water activities. The direct evidence for the involvement of CO2-rich fluids in generating diagnostic UHT assemblages has been recorded from the common occurrence of pure CO2 fluid inclusions in buffering the water activity and stabilizing the anhydrous mineralogy of UHT rocks {{have come from the}} finding of abundant pure CO2 fluid inclusions in these rocks. UHT metamorphism has been recently evaluated in the plate tectonic context using modern analogues and {{it has been suggested that}} both post-collisional extension and rifting play a crucial role. The abundant CO2 liberated by subsolidus decarbonation along consuming plate boundaries was probably one of the factors that contributed to the greenhouse effect thereby triggering the deglaciation of snowball Earth. Based on the distributions of carbonated subcontinental mantle and crustal domains that have undergone CO2-aided dry metamorphism at extreme conditions, Santosh and Omori (2008b) speculated that the UHT rocks might represent windows for the <b>transfer</b> of <b>CO2</b> from the mantle into the mid crust and ultimately to the atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|Increasing oceanic uptake of CO₂ is {{predicted}} to drive ecological change as both a resource (i. e. CO₂ enrichment on primary producers) and stressor (i. e. lower pH on consumers). We use the natural ecological complexity of a CO₂ vent (i. e. a seagrass system) to assess the potential validity of conceptual models developed from laboratory and mesocosm research. Our observations suggest that the stressor-effect of CO₂ enrichment combined with its resource-effect drives simplified food web structure of lower trophic diversity and shorter length. The <b>transfer</b> of <b>CO₂</b> enrichment from plants to herbivores through consumption (apparent resource-effect) was not compensated by predation, because carnivores failed to contain herbivore outbreaks. Instead, these higher-order consumers collapsed (apparent stressor-effect on carnivores) suggesting limited trophic propagation to predator populations. The dominance of primary producers and their lower-order consumers along {{with the loss of}} carnivores reflects the duality of intensifying ocean acidification acting both as resource-effect (i. e. bottom-up control) and stressor-effect (i. e. top-down control) to simplify community and trophic structure and function.

In an effort to determine the detailed promotion effect of PZ in aqueous ammonia-based solvents, overall mass transfer coefficients (K G) describing the absorption of CO₂ into aqueous PZ/NH₃ solutions were determined using a wetted-wall column apparatus at 25 °C. The effect of added PZ (from 0 to 0. 5 M) on the mass <b>transfer</b> of <b>CO₂</b> into 3. 0 M NH₃ solutions over a range of pre-loaded CO₂ concentrations of 0. 9 M at 25 °C are reported in this work.

Analysis of the kinetic measurements using a chemical model which incorporates the complete reaction sets of the individual amines with CO₂ (i. e., NH₃₋CO₂₋H₂O and PZ₋CO₂₋H₂O) resulted in good agreement with the experimental data.

The increased electronic conductivity with adsorption of CO2 indicates that dahlia-SWNHs are n-type semiconductors. On the other hand, the electronic conductivity increases after an initial drop for the oxidized SWNHs, implying that SWNHs can be transformed into p-type semiconductors after oxidation treatment. The initial drop is due to transfer of electrons from CO2 to ox-SWNH annihilates holes, reducing the conductivity, while the later increase is because of the further electron <b>transfer</b> from <b>CO2</b> after compensation of the hole carriers.

50|$|An {{integrated}} fluorometer is {{a system}} that measures the light reaction and the dark reaction of photosynthesis. Software allows combined operation of gas exchange measurement and chlorophyll fluorescence measurement of a leaf. These parameters are used to non-destructively measure the photosynthetic efficiency of plants. The use of an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer provides the opportunity to measure additional measuring parameters that allow for a more exact measurement of photosynthesis than with gas exchange alone. Advanced gas exchange instrumentation, by itself, is capable of measuring A/Ci curves, commonly used for plant characterization. “A” is the term for photosynthetic rate (rate of CO2 exchange in the leaf chamber), and Ci is Sub-stomatal CO2 concentration or intracellular CO2 level within the leaf. When measured over a range of CO2 levels above and below ambient conditions, A/Ci curves become possible. With the addition of an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer, it becomes possible to measure more accurate A/CC curves, or photosynthetic rate at the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. The integrated fluorometer allows measurement of mesophyll conductance, or the opposite of the resistance to <b>CO2</b> <b>transfer</b> from intracellular air spaces to the site of carboxylation in chloroplasts. Various integrated chlorophyll fluorometer measuring protocols, such as the Laisk Protocol, the Kok protocol and the Yin Protocol are used to measure or estimate gm or mesophyll conductance.

40|$|Teleost fishes {{constitute}} 95 % of extant aquatic vertebrates, and {{we suggest}} that this is related in part to their unique mode of tissue oxygenation. We propose the following sequence {{of events in the}} evolution of their oxygen delivery system. First, loss of plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the gill and venous circulations slowed the Jacobs–Stewart cycle and the transfer of acid between the plasma and the red blood cells (RBCs). This ameliorated the effects of a generalised acidosis (associated with an increased capacity for burst swimming) on haemoglobin (Hb) –O(2) binding. Because RBC pH was uncoupled from plasma pH, the importance of Hb as a buffer was reduced. The decrease in buffering was mediated by a {{reduction in the number of}} histidine residues on the Hb molecule and resulted in enhanced coupling of O(2) and <b>CO(2)</b> <b>transfer</b> through the RBCs. In the absence of plasma CA, nearly all plasma bicarbonate ultimately dehydrated to CO(2) occurred via the RBCs, and chloride/bicarbonate exchange was the rate-limiting step in CO(2) excretion. This pattern of CO(2) excretion across the gills resulted in disequilibrium states for CO(2) hydration/dehydration reactions and thus elevated arterial and venous plasma bicarbonate levels. Plasma-accessible CA embedded in arterial endothelia was retained, which eliminated the localized bicarbonate disequilibrium forming CO(2) that then moved into the RBCs. Consequently, RBC pH decreased which, in conjunction with pH-sensitive Bohr/Root Hbs, elevated arterial oxygen tensions and thus enhanced tissue oxygenation. Counter-current arrangement of capillaries (retia) at the eye and later the swim bladder evolved along with the gas gland at the swim bladder. Both arrangements enhanced and magnified CO(2) and acid production and, therefore, oxygen secretion to those specialised tissues. The evolution of β-adrenergically stimulated RBC Na^+/H^+ exchange protected gill O(2) uptake during stress and further augmented plasma disequilibrium states for CO(2) hydration/dehydration. Finally, RBC organophosphates (e. g. NTP) could be reduced during hypoxia to further increase Hb–O(2) affinity without compromising tissue O(2) delivery because high-affinity Hbs could still adequately deliver O(2) to the tissues via Bohr/Root shifts. We suggest that the evolution of this unique mode of tissue O(2) transfer evolved in the Triassic/Jurassic Period, when O(2) levels were low, ultimately giving rise to the most extensive adaptive radiation of extant vertebrates, the teleost fishes...|$|R

This Ph. D. project has been part of a larger U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored research project to demonstrate the feasibility of a system designed to tag CO₂ with radiocarbon at a concentration of one part per trillion, which is the ambient concentration of ¹⁴C in the modern atmosphere. Because carbon found at depth is naturally free of ¹⁴C, this tag would easily differentiate pre-existing carbon in the underground from anthropogenic, injected carbon and provide an excellent handle for monitoring its whereabouts in the subsurface. It also creates an excellent handle for adding up anthropogenic carbon inventories. Future inventories in effect count ¹⁴C atoms. Accordingly, we developed a ¹⁴C tagging system suitable for use at the part-per-trillion level. This tagging system uses small containers of tracer fluid of ¹⁴C enriched CO₂. The content of these containers is <b>transferred</b> into a <b>CO₂</b> stream readied for underground injection in a controlled manner so as to tag it at the part-per-trillion level. These containers because of their shape are referred to in this document as tracer loops. The demonstration of the tracer injection involved three steps. First, a tracer loop filling station was designed and constructed featuring a novel membrane based gas exchanger, which degassed the fluid in the first step and then equilibrated the fluid with CO₂ at fixed pressure and fixed temperature. It was demonstrated that this approach could achieve uniform solutions and prevent the formation of bubbles and degassing downstream. The difference between measured and expected results of the CO₂ content in the tracer loop was below 1 %. Second, a high-pressure flow loop was built for injecting, mixing, and sampling of the fast flowing stream of pressurized CO₂ tagged with our tracer. The laboratory scale evaluation demonstrated the accuracy and effectiveness of our tracer loops and injection system. The ¹⁴C/¹²C ratio we achieved in the high pressure flow loop was at the part per trillion level, and deviation between the experimental result and theoretical expectation was 6. 1 %. Third, a field test in Iceland successfully demonstrated a similar performance whereby ¹⁴CO₂ tracer could be injected in a controlled manner into a CO₂ stream at the part per trillion level over extended periods of time. The deviation between the experimental result and theoretical expectation was 7. 1 %. In addition the project considered a laser-based ¹⁴C detection system. However, the laser-based ¹⁴C detection system was shown to possess inadequate sensitivity for detecting ambient levels of ¹⁴CO₂. Alternative methods for detecting ¹⁴C, such as saturated cavity absorption ring down spectroscopy and scintillation counting may still be suitable. In summary, the project has defined the foundation of carbon- 14 tagging for the monitoring, verification, and accounting of geological carbon sequestration...|$|R
40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} {{carbon dioxide in the}} {{atmosphere}} have created numerous environmental and socio-economic problems, including climate change. The scientific community is experimenting with various emission reduction and carbon capture and storage strategies. Mineral sequestration of carbon with alkaline industrial residues is one such emerging emission reduction technology which is being researched for its ability to be integrated into industrial plants, where both carbon dioxide (CO₂) and alkaline solid residues are generated on site. This concept {{can be applied to the}} coal-fired power generation industry, which produces enormous quantities of coal fly ash as a solid by-product along with massive emissions of gaseous CO₂ with the flue gas stream. Therefore, the mineral trapping of CO₂ with coal fly ash can help to sustain coal-based power generation, while bringing added advantages to fly ash disposal due to the favourable chemical changes which occur in fly ash during the above carbonation process. However, mineral carbonation to date remains an immature technology due to its main drawbacks related to kinetics and extensive research is necessary to find acceleration to accelerate mineral sequestration. The main aim of the present thesis is to investigate the effect of operational parameters on the accelerated carbonation of coal combustion fly ash and to study the effect of carbonation on the final disposal of fly ash, especially in relation to agricultural soil amendment. The research work is based on experimental studies conducted in the laboratory and in a greenhouse facility. The accelerated carbonation tests for fly ash were conducted in a newly-developed reactor facility in the Deep Earth Energy Research Laboratory in the Civil Engineering Department at the Clayton campus of Monash University. The main component of this facility is a continuously stirred cylindrical tank equipped with adjustable temperature and pressure mechanisms and monitoring and data acquisition systems. The fly ash materials were collected from the collection ponds of three major power plants located in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria, Australia. The carbonation reactions were designed to test the effect of reaction temperature (in the range of 20 ⁰C to 80 ⁰C), initial CO₂ pressure inside the reactor (in the range of 1 MPa to 10 MPa), water-to-solid ratio or solid dosage (in the range of 0. 1 to 1) and the super-critical phase of CO₂. In addition, the effect of fly ash particle size was tested with five different particle size categories varying from < 100 µm to bulk samples. The results from the experimental work were analysed to evaluate the effect of the above parameters on the degree and rate of mineral carbonation of Latrobe Valley fly ash. The study found that no effect from the pressure was observed on the overall degree of fly ash carbonation, and hence on the amount of CO₂ sequestration. The increased initial pressure could <b>transfer</b> the <b>CO₂</b> into fly ash faster, which helped to complete the reaction within 3 to 4 hours, through increased dissolution of CO₂ in the solution. The temperature showed a dual effect on the carbonation rate, such that increased temperatures up to a critical value of 60 ⁰C increased the overall carbonation due to increased leaching out of Ca²⁺ ions into the solution. With further increase in temperature, the dissolution of the gas in the solution was hindered, as was the carbonation reaction. The application of temperature test results in a pseudo second-order kinetic model derived an important kinetic parameter: activation energy for three of the fly ash types tested. The values were in the range of 35 - 45 kJ/mole, which is favourable in terms of energy requirement compared to gas solid carbonation. The water-to-solid ratio of 0. 2 - 0. 3 was the optimum for the Latrobe Valley fly ash carbonation and there was no significant effect observed by changing the phase of CO₂ from gaseous to super-critical. A series of chemical tests was designed to observe any changes in the agronomically important chemical properties of coal fly ash after carbonation. Based on the knowledge gained from literature review, alkalinity, salinity and trace metal leachability were identified as those properties most affected by carbonation and the most crucial for the use of Latrobe Valley fly ash in agricultural applications. Extreme alkalinity in the pH range of 11. 3 to 11. 95 and salinity with electrical conductivity (EC) in the range of 6 to 7 dS/min the ash as received were shown to be lowered with the chemical stability gained during carbonation. Basically, the reduced alkalinity of fly ash after carbonation causes changes in the metal ion mobility which acts as the dominant mechanism of chemical stability. In addition, changes in speciation, co-precipitation and absorption also alter the status of metal ions, which ultimately reduces the salinity and trace metal leachability of the carbonated ash. The salinity of the ash after carbonation was reduced to the moderately saline range (3. 2 - 3. 8 dS/m), whereas the alkalinity and trace metal leachability were favourably reduced. The use of carbonated fly ash as a soil amendment or an amendment to crop-growing media was evaluated using greenhouse experiments. The experimental design was equivalent to a two-factor factorial experiment, with three types of fly ash (from three power plants in Latrobe Valley F 1, F 2 and F 3), two fly carbonation statuses (carbonated and non- carbonated) and two application dosages (5 % and 10 %w/w). Two sets of consecutive experiments were conducted, first with sweet corn plants followed by snow pea plants. The application of carbonated fly ash at 5 % dosage was found to be the best treatment in terms of plant growth, maturation and production. Non-carbonated Latrobe Valley fly ash cannot be recommended for agricultural applications, especially at high dosages, due to its excessive salinity, which is unfavourable for most agricultural crops. However, after carbonation, application at low dosages such as 5 % by weight is recommended, due to the potential saline toxicity, especially for non-salt-tolerant plant species. Snow peas are comparatively salt-tolerant, performed better than the sweet corn plants in terms of plant growth. The conclusion of the overall study is that the use of coal fly ash in agricultural soil amendment after neutralizing through accelerated carbonation can be introduced as a potential re-use pathway for coal ash, which will provide additional benefits in terms of emission reduction and waste management...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were used to}} investigate the mechanism of plant response to water stress by determining the sensitivity of leaf elongation, photosynthesis and transpiration in young corn plants to a decrease in leaf water potential. In initial experiments, 9 day old corn plants were grown at soil water potentials of - 0. 35 and - 2. 50 bars for 6 days using the polyethylene glycol semi-permeable membrane technique of controlling soil water potential. Leaf elongation and soluble carbohydrate content {{were found to be}} more sensitive to a reduction in soil water potential than net assimilation and transpiration. Lowering the soil water potential from - 0. 35 to - 2. 50 bars resulted in a 44 percent decrease in the rate of leaf elongation and a 42 percent increase in the soluble carbohydrate content of the plant, while the rates of net assimilation and transpiration were reduced by 26 and 24 percent respectively. The differing sensitivity of leaf elongation and photosynthesis to decreasing soil water potential was examined in detail in subsequent experiments by simultaneously monitoring the rates of net photosynthesis, transpiration, and leaf elongation and the leaf water potential of a young corn plant as it became water stressed. Leaf elongation ceased at a leaf water potential of - 9 to - 9. 5 bars, whereas the rates of net photosynthesis and transpiration were not reduced significantly until the leaf water potential reached - 12 to - 13 bars. The sharp decrease in rate of net photosynthesis in the vicinity of - 12 to - 13 bars was due to increases in both the stomatal and mesophyll resistances to <b>CO₂</b> <b>transfer.</b> It was concluded that the decreases in the rate of net photosynthesis due to water stress were caused by stomatal and nonstomatal effects of approximately equal magnitude. The nonstomatal or intracellular factors responsible for the decrease in the rate of net photosynthesis were not identified. It was hypothesized that the differing sensitivity of leaf elongation and photosynthesis to water stress, may result in the accumulation of photosynthate within a mildly water stressed plant. This mechanism was demonstrated in experiments where the soluble carbohydrate content of the top 3 leaves of a mildly stressed corn plant was shown to be significantly higher than in the corresponding leaves of a nonstressed control plant after a 6 hour stress period. This increase in the soluble carbohydrate content of the mildly stressed plant was accompanied by a significant decrease in the net photosynthetic rate of this plant. A similar response was obtained when leaf elongation rate was reduced by lowering the temperature of the apical meristem. The results were interpreted as evidence for the operation of a source-sink type control mechanism of photosynthesis in mildly stressed plants. The effect of water potential on the elongation rate, the adenylate energy charge, ATP content and free amino acid content of the youngest unrolled leaf of a 6 leaf corn plant was examined in a final series of experiments. These experiments sought to determine whether the decrease in photosynthate utilization, observed when cell expansion was limited by water stress, was due to a simple product inhibition feedback mechanism or to the direct effect of water stress on some aspect of cell metabolism. The ATP content of the elongating cells was found to be as sensitive as leaf elongation to small changes in leaf water potential. Adenylate energy charge did decrease with leaf water potential, but was not as sensitive as the ATP content to changes in leaf water potential. The free amino acid level was found to increase at leaf water potentials lower than - 10 bars, and this may indicate that the inhibition of protein synthesis during water stress {{may be due to the}} deficiency of chemical energy within the cell. It was concluded that during water stress, the biosynthetic activity of elongating cells may be limited by a low level of available energy in the form of ATP. This decreased synthesis of ATP may be due to a direct effect of water stress on respiration and ATP formation. The sensitivity of leaf enlargement to mild water stress and its subsequent effect on photosynthesis indicates that plant growth and production may be limited by mild stress in the field situation. The vegetative growth of plants depends on both the photosynthetic rate and the rate of increase of the photosynthetic surface area. The response of leaf enlargement to water stress in the field therefore warrants thorough further investigation...|$|R
40|$|I develop {{conceptual}} {{models of}} the biogeochemistry and physical circulation of the Southern Ocean in order to study the air-sea fluxes of trace gases and biological productivity and their potential changes over glacial-interglacial timescales. Mesoscale eddy transfers play a dominant role in the dynamical and tracer balances in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and the transport of tracers {{is driven by the}} residual mean circulation which is the net effect of the Eulerian mean circulation and the eddy-induced circulation. Using an idealized, zonally averaged model of the ACC, I illustrate the sensitivity of the uptake of transient tracers including CFC 11, bomb-[Delta]¹⁴C and anthropogenic CO₂ to surface wind stress and buoyancy fluxes over the Southern Ocean. The model qualitatively reproduces observed distribution of CFC 11 and bomb-[Delta]¹⁴C, and a suite of sensitivity experiments illustrate the physical processes controlling the rates of the oceanic uptake of these tracers. The sensitivities of the uptake of CFC 11 and bomb-[Delta]¹⁴C are largely different because of the differences in their air-sea equilibration timescales. The uptake of CFC 11 is mainly determined by the rates of physical transport in the ocean, and that of bomb-[Delta]¹⁴C is mainly controlled by the air-sea gas <b>transfer</b> velocity. Anthropogenic <b>CO₂</b> falls in between these two cases, and the rate of anthropogenic CO₂ uptake is affected by both processes. Biological productivity in the Southern Ocean is characterized with the circum- polar belt of elevated biological productivity, "Antarctic Circumpolar Productivity Belt". (cont.) Annually and zonally averaged export of biogenic silica is estimated by fitting the zonally averaged tracer transport model to the climatology of silicic acid using the method of least squares. The pattern of export production inferred from the inverse calculation is qualitatively consistent with recent observations. The pattern of inferred export production has a maximum on the southern flank of the ACC. The advective transport by the residual mean circulation is the key process in the vertical supply of silicic acid to the euphotic layer where photosynthesis occurs. In order to illustrate what sets the position of the productivity belt, I examined simulated biological production in a physical-biogeochemical model which includes an explicit ecosystem model coupled to the phosphate, silica and iron cycle. Simulated patterns of surface nutrients and biological productivity suggest that the circumpolar belt of elevated biological productivity should coincide with the regime transition between the iron-limited Antarctic zone and the macro-nutrients limited Subantarctic zone. At the transition, organisms have relatively good access to both micro and macro-nutrients. Kohfeld (in Bopp et al.; 2003) suggested that there is a distinct, dipole pattern in the paleo-proxy of biological export in the Southern Ocean at the LGM. I hypothesize that observed paleo-productivity proxies reflect the changes in the position of the Antarctic Circumpolar Productivity Belt over glacial-interglacial timescales. Increased dust deposition during ice ages is unlikely to explain the equatorward shift in the position of the productivity belt due to the expansion of the oligotrophic region and the poleward shift of the transition between the iron-limited regime and the macro-nutrient limited regime. (cont.) I develop a simple dynamical model to evaluate the sensitivity of the meridional overturning circulation to the surface wind stress and the stratification. The theory suggest that stronger surface wind stress could intensify the surface residual flow and perturb the position of the productivity belt in the same sign as indicated by the paleo-productivity proxies. Finally, I examined the relationship between the surface macro-nutrients in the polar Southern Ocean and the atmospheric pCO₂. Simple box models developed in 1980 s suggests that depleting surface macro-nutrients in high latitudes can explain the glacial pCO₂ drawdown inferred from polar ice cores. A suite of sensitivity experiments are carried out with an ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle model {{with a wide range of}} the rate of nutrient uptake in the surface ocean. These experiments suggest that the ocean carbon cycle is unlikely to approach the theoretical limit where "pre- formed" nutrient is completely depleted due to the dynamics of deep water formation. The rapid vertical mixing timescales of convection preclude the ventilation of strongly nutrient depleted waters. Thus it is difficult to completely deplete the "preformed" nutrients in the Southern Ocean even in a climate with elevated dust deposition in the region, suggesting some other mechanisms for the cause of lowered glacial pCO₂. by Takamitsu Ito.
