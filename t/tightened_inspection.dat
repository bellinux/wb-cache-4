40|$|An {{integral}} part of the MIL-STD- 105 D scheme for sampling inspection by attributes is the transfer from normal inspection to reduced or <b>tightened</b> <b>inspection</b> when the historical record of inspected lots suggests unusually good or bad quality. The switching rules in MIL-STD- 105 D have been criticized, especially by Japanese manufacturers, as being too severe when what is defined as acceptable quality material is submitted. This paper examines the long range fraction of lots rejected for several MIL-STD- 105 D sampling plans by using the MIL-STD- 105 D switching rules, using a modification suggested by the Japanese Standards Association, and by using a second modification developed by the authors. The Japanese Standards Association switching rules are more complex than those in MIL-STD- 105 D. It is demonstrated that they lead to improved long-range properties for Normal-Tightened-Reduced schemes, but to poorer properties for Normal-Tightened schemes. A simplified set of switching rules is suggested, wherein the “limit numbers” in MIL-STD- 105 D are eliminated. In comparison to MIL-STD- 105 D, the simpler rules lead to a lower probability of rejection for good lots and a comparable probability of rejection for bad lots...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 ANSI/ASQC Z 1. 4 is {{a widely}} used {{attributes}} acceptance sampling system. A necessary aspect of a scheme, from both a theoretical and psychological viewpoint, is the switching between normal, <b>tightened,</b> and reduced <b>inspection</b> {{as a function of}} quality history. In the latest revision of the standard the switching rules were altered {{to make use of the}} limit numbers for reduced inspection optional. Furthermore, a statement in the standard suggests that this action will have little effect on operating properties. A Markov model was developed to analyze the effect of the limit numbers. The no limit number model was solved analytically. The resulting closed-form results eliminate the need for matrix inversion and show that the maximum average run length on normal inspection is only 12. 7 lots. The results show that use with the limit numbers significantly impacts many performance measures. Averaged across all 152 single sampling schemes and with quality at the AQL, the average run length on normal inspection increases 287...|$|R

40|$| {{problems}} only via {{the institutions}} of civil society. The worsening of the socioeconomic situation of citizens that accompanied the first stages of renovation, combined with the disillusionment that replaced high initial hopes, alienated society from the authorities. The weakness of the judiciary {{is one of the}} main problems of the transitional period. The system of total party control taught people to seek protection in party committees and not in courts: suing was considered to be almost an indecent act. After the collapse of the socialist system, judicial weakness left a legal vacuum that remains unfilled. The weakness of Russian judiciary system manifests itself in the failure of the fiscal and executive branches of power to provide for salaries of judges and operation of courts. Court decisions are often not implemented. The low effectiveness of arbitrage courts results in long delays in case processing and, consequently, in paralysis of economic activity. There is a shortage of skilled and knowledgeable personnel to meet the requirements of the new economic conditions. The civil courts are consequently unutilized in the confrontation with corruption. The underdevelopment of the public legal conscience originates from the past system of Soviet quasi-law. Besides the weak implementation of laws and regulatory norms, the absence of culture and traditions of using the law by citizens, and the perception of legal immunity for state officials results in little or no resistance to grassroots corruption. The habitual bias of the law enforcement bodies and their representatives is protection of state interests and socialist property. Protection of the legal rights and interests of citizens, including private owners, has not become the main perceived task of law enforcement bodies. Not having found formal legal protection, entrepreneurs are obliged to seek special arrangements by buying unlawful services from state officials. This is exactly the purpose of this research, which is devoted to the EG activities and sub-optimal, second-best solutions which were born in the conditions of the transition. These second-best solution became more rational and more efficient than what the governance could propose for that moment. 1. 2. EG as the organized crime versus society and their functioning Organized crime is such a serious problem because the citizens perceive they have been "robbed" of the assets that they were to have inherited from the Soviet state. Instead of an emergent middle-class, almost all of the successor states have highly economically polarized populations with a small extremely rich new elite and a large impoverished population. This is particularly problematic in the former socialist societies where citizens were educated in an ideology committed to social equality. While economic inequality existed in the Soviet period, it was more hidden from view than that of the new elites who flaunt their wealth both domestically and overseas. The pervasive corruption and the penetration of organized crime into the political process is inhibiting the development of new laws needed to develop a democratic free market economy. The concept of "mafia", widely used to describe rackets, the most pervasive element of low level organized crime, is the most disturbing element of the crime problem in this research. It is connected with possible alliances of the former Party elite, members of the law enforcement apparatus and the gangs of organized criminals who together penetrate the licit and illicit sectors is the most pernicious element of the crime phenomena. The current diversification and flexibility of post-Soviet crime groups operating across all the successor states and the pervasiveness of corruption suggests that the phenomenon will not rapidly disappear once the initial transition period is over. Contacts with international crime groups will contribute to further diversification of criminal activity as domestic crime groups learn from their foreign associates. Former Soviet Union countries lack the legal framework to fight organized crime. Problems of corruption within the legislatures have inhibited the adoption of necessary laws. Members of the legislature who are personally benefiting from the transfer of property from state to private hands are reluctant to pass the laws needed to regulate the economy or to pass criminals laws that might eventually lead to their prosecution. Organized crime has filled the void left by a legal system which can not ensure the enforceability of contracts. Organized crime groups with their links not only inside but across borders help ensure deliveries and repayment of debts as well. 1. 3. Some evidence, data and development of EG Throughout the 1990 s private protection and enforcement agencies have created a hybrid sector between economy and the state. This creation did not figure on the agenda of those who designed Russian reforms. Rather, it was a combination of short-term political decisions aimed at reducing the power and capacity of the old Soviet state security institutions, adaptive responses of the state security personnel to these policies, and the institutional demands of emerging markets that led to the quick formation of this whole new business sector. So in contrast to the creation of the private economy which was the primary reform target from the start, the privatization of protection and enforcement came as an unintended and ambiguous development. The most impressing way to prove the existence of EG is to find out them in real life. There are many typical examples of that which you can watch living in C. I. S. or let us say in Russia. If not there are other ways to check such existence. One possibility to look at this via searching systems in Internet. I found many sites of security agencies in Russia there what really says that EG (in myriad forms as the guarding services) are the establishments of legitimated business in Russia nowadays. I lead some of them at the Internet references at the end (see I. S. [25]-[29]). Such sources can be supported by the looking at any kind of business. There are no firms which are working without protection in Russia now. Some of them use the protection as influences sphere distribution, others as the legitimated protection service, showing the brands of EG as their advertisement. The law defined the licensing procedures for three types of security agencies and their personnel: chastnye detektivnye agenstva, private detective agencies (PDA), chastnye sluzhby bezopasnosti, private (company) security services (PSS), and chastnye okhrannye predpriyatiya, private protection companies (PPC). PDAs normally execute narrow and specific tasks requested chiefly by private individuals with regard to their private matters. Consequently, autonomous detective agencies are few (just over a hundred for the whole country), and their services expensive. All these three types will be related to EG (extortion group(s)) term in this research because of possible composition of activities. I will lead my own division of EG below in the aspect of the creature source. Picture 1. 1. Development of the Private Security Industry in Russia, 1992 - 99 Soon after the adoption of the law on private security the new business sector began to expand at unprecedented rates, especially in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. By the end of 1999 the number of private security agencies reached 11, 652, including 6, 775 PPCs and 4, 612 PSSs, while the number of licensed security personnel reached 196, 266 (the total number of employees exceeds 850, 000). In 1998 the city of Moscow had the total of 3, 125 and Petersburg 816 private security agencies, which amounted to 29 and 7, 6 percent of their total number for the same year respectively. Between 1993 and 1996 the growth was especially dramatic; the number of private security agencies almost doubled, reaching nearly eight thousand. After 1996 the growth continued, but the rate slowed down (data are taken from Mir Bezopasnosti, 2, 1997; 3, 2000, [2]; Biznes i bezopasnost, 2, 1999, [3]). Dynamics of EG development is shown in the previous picture. Several factors were responsible for the leveling of growth after 1996. First, the reshuffle of the state security, which generated the supply of jobless specialists, receded. Second, the initial market demand for protection services was met, and possibilities of extensive growth were exhausted. Third, the MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) supervising organs <b>tightened</b> control and <b>inspection</b> measures, closing down, after 1995, more than 600 agencies each year for violating the regulations. In May 1995 the government of Moscow issued the decree that urged the regional MVD to intensify control over the activity of private security agencies on its territory and introduce an electronic accounting and identification system. The diagram also shows a structural trend: over the last three years the growth of the private security business has been caused by the growth of PPCs, while the number of PSSs decreased progressively. The head of the Committee for Licensing and Permissions of MVD I. Mayatsky explained the trend by two basic factors that time. First, many PSSs were created by banks during the period of their multiplication in the early 1990 s. As some banks subsequently went bankrupt, their security services disappeared too. Second, for a bank or a company to maintain a PSS proved more expensive than to contract an independent PPC, and gradually many turned to the latter, more efficient option. This second factor deserves attention, for it seems to point to an important trend, that of the externalization of protection. If in the beginning companies tended to internalize protection by creating their own security service, later, many turned to external protection. Because of the economy of scale and allegedly better technical equipment large PPCs are more cost-efficient. PSS has a different advantage. Being a subdivision of a private company or bank, it operates under two different authorities, public regulations for this kind of activity and private orders of the company's director general. The latter authority is naturally stronger, and in case the two authorities clash the PSS is likely to circumvent formal regulations of external (state) authorities. In contrast to that, autonomous suppliers tend to be less constrained by their customers (unless they are created by the latter). But because they produce services for sale rather than for internal consumption, they are constrained by the rules of the market. According to the public claims of their managers, PPCs prefer to conduct their business on the basis of the formal contract and respect the law. This, however, may be just a successful marketing strategy. Whatever the actual practice, the degree of autonomy of PPC vis-a-vis PSS is greater by definition. The growth of the former and the decline of the latter after 1996 may indicate that for customers, considerations of economy are becoming more important than the ability to exercise direct management of force. If this is correct, then the outcome would be a growing differentiation whereby economic and security enterprises are more clearly separated. As I noted before, this work is organized from the nature of EG and the source of their creation will be important in further analysis and modeling. Hence I will disregard such division (PDA, PSS and PPC) as the licensing formation further and lead another defining. 1. 4.

In the frames of these models there are different questions in studying. The question which I am interesting...|$|R
