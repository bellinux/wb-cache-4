5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> an invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, Evita set her {{sights on}} earning {{a place on}} the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers within the government. According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> Juan Perón's death was not something the military could accept.|$|E
5|$|In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, {{and felt}} nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the {{entirety}} of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant. Parliament passed an act making Philip regent in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> Mary's death in childbirth. In {{the last week of}} April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> Mary's death in childbirth, but {{in a letter to his}} brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E

Because of this, Goldberg's foreword acknowledges some discontinuity between <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> this novel and <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. The forewords put <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> this novel and the direct sequel Mr. Monk is Miserable before <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Mr. Monk Is On The Run" [...] and after <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season 6 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Paints His Masterpiece".|$|R

50|$|Medieval allegory {{began as}} a Christian method for synthesizing the {{discrepancies}} between the Old Testament and the New Testament. While both testaments were studied and seen as equally divinely inspired by God, the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians—for example the Jewish kosher laws. The Old Testament was therefore seen in relation to how it would predict <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Testament, in particular how <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament related to <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> Christ's life. <b>The</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament were {{seen as part of}} the story, with <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>of</b> Christ's life bringing these stories to a full conclusion. The technical name for seeing the New Testament in the Old is called typology.|$|R
5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> an attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> an attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E

5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively in the air as an emergency back-up in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
