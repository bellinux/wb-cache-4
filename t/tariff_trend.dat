This paper use an error correction model to measure the elasticity of import flows of goods in Albania, related to real demand, developments in trade liberalization, and transfers from abroad and fluctuations {{in the value of}} currency; as well as shed light on economic policies in restricting trade deficits. Econometric analysis of this study includes a set of variables part of demand for imports. Based on theoretical principles and research experience, the analysis in this paper consists in treating imports as a function not only of GDP (economic activity), effective exchange rate, but also as a function of remittances and the level of liberalization of the trade regime, represented by the average import <b>tariff</b> (<b>trend</b> which clearly shows the progress of trade liberalization). The assessment of the impact of these factors is achieved using the vector error correction model (VECM = vector error correction model). At first, the analysis begins by specifying tests theoretical hypotheses and analytical equations, which describes the theoretical relationship. The following step consists on the selection of econometric model, which in our case was chosen to be the VECM model. The following section consists on a deeper analysis in econometric model specification, and the steps to follow to calculate its parameters...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{provide new}} {{evidence}} on the impacts of trade reforms on wages and wage inequality in developing countries. While most of the current literature on the topic achieves identification by comparing outcomes before and after one episode of trade liberalization across industries, they propose a stronger identifying strategy. The authors explore the recent historical record of policy changes adopted by Argentina: from significant protection in the early 1970 s, to the first episode of liberalization during the late 1970 s, back to a slowdown of reforms during the 1980 s, to the second episode of liberalization in the 1990 s. These swings in trade policy comprise broken trends in trade reforms that they can compare with observed trends in wages and wage inequality. After setting up unusual historical data sets of <b>trends</b> in <b>tariffs,</b> <b>trends</b> in wages, and trends in wage inequality, the evidence supports two well-known hypotheses: trade liberalization, other things being equal, (1) has reduced wages, and (2) has increased wage inequality.

40|$|In this paper,firstly, <b>tariff</b> {{protection}} <b>trend</b> of Iran`s agriculture {{sector is}} analysed by statistical analysis approach {{during the years}} 1985 - 2005. Agriculture's tariff regime is characterized by i) high average tariff ii) extremely dispersion of tariff levels across tariff lines iii) significant amount of tariff escalation and ix) deep gap between average nominal tariffs and import-weighted average tariffs. consequently, Several analytical propositions are derived {{that are consistent with}} the observed patterns of tariff protection in developing countries: i) nominal protection rates escalate with the degree of processing ii) higher average tariff protection in agriculture sector compared to developed countries` agriculture and iii) higher non-agricultural tariff protection than agricultural tariff protection. Afterwards Tariff equation of agriculture is estimated for 156 staple products and political fitted tariff and political protection indicator are estimated for these products. This political-economy analysis allows us to identify two sets of protected products: First, Over-protected products are those which their actual tariffs are higher than their Political fitted tariffs. Tariff reduction should not be Politically costly and could be more speedy. In this case tariff reduction would improve resources allocation and income distribution(poverty reduction) within the agriculture sector. Second, Under-protected products are those which their actual tariffs are lower than their Political fitted tariffs. Most of agricultural crops are included in this group. Tariff reduction in this case is Politically costly and longer adjusted period may be necessary. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the PV market in Italy was done {{studying}} a number of installations of different sizes whose economic data were known and assessed. The Italian market has experienced a boom in the PV market after the first mechanism of feed-in tariffs was promoted in 2005. The variations of the tariff structure in the following years have caused {{significant changes in the}} market structure in terms of average size and technical characteristics of installed plants. However, an Italian PV industry was not stimulated by the incentives and only companies involved in installation and maintenance were created. At the same time, the cost of the PV plants components, design and commissioning have followed quite a particular trend, which is more determined by the tariffs than by the market development and structure. It is quite clear that the costs of PV plants component are not driven by the amount of installations but by the <b>tariffs,</b> with a <b>trend</b> that follows the decreases in the incentives and not the global installed power. It is therefore very important to study the right tariff mechanisms and benefits to avoid financial disturbances on the market and to promote a real competitive market instead of a simple financial operation under a fake fa√ßade of green econom...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDecreasing feed in {{tariffs and}} system prices {{combined}} with an increase of electricity <b>tariffs</b> supports the <b>trend</b> to install PV storage systems in private households. In the past years several investigations and field trials have shown, that these systems can increase the self consumption of PV-power and support the self sufficiency of private households [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. These systems also have {{a positive influence on}} the low-voltage grid [7], [8]. In recent years several investigations have been done to determine the optimal system configuration. They focus on the storage and PV generator size [9] or the applied storage technology [10]. In general, the mode of operation follows a simple regime: If PV production is larger than the actual consumption, PV power is stored. If the local consumption is higher than the actual PV production, stored power is used as long as available. Only slight modifications have been done, to map the price and efficiency effects of power electronics [11], [12]. Therefore, the results are limited to a single mode of operation. In this presentation, we derive a mathematical framework, which allows the calculation of the upper performance limit for a specific household and storage system, without any assumption on the operation strategy. We apply these analysis to a large set of German households and compare the upper performance limit for two different storage system designs: A system with relative short lifetime and small capacity {{on the one hand and}} another with a long lifetime and larger capacit...|$|R
