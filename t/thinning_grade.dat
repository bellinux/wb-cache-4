40|$|This piper propoundi a {{new method}} of calculating {{numerical}} thinning schedules for conifers which are detigned to give, on the average, any reasonable pattern of ring width at breast height in the ioo largest tree * in a plantation. It starts from the Forestry Commisjion'i Revised Tield Tablet for Conifers in Great Britain {{and is based}} on the principle that, if the current annual in-crement in a plantation is unaffected by the grade of thinning, the ring widths must be inveriely proportional to the bole area per acre, i. e. the total area of cambium on the main items of the trees. Sources of error in the method of calculation are discussed, and it i> considered that such errors are not so terioui as to endanger the use of the method as a means of calculating approxi-mate thinning schedules. Ai an approximate yield table can be constructed for each <b>thinning</b> <b>grade,</b> the method can be used to estimate the relative costs of growing trees of various diameters with various ring width patterns. THE Revised Tield Tables for Conifers in Great Britain by Hummel andChristie (8) contain sets of figures which enable us to visualize the effect of a <b>thinning</b> <b>grade</b> in a new and realistic manner.

40|$|Oak {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} noble hardwood species in Europe. The production of high-quality wood is associated with long rotations and high labour costs. The aim of this thesis was to quantify and model the effects of some silvicultural practices, mainly thinning, on crown size, volume growth and stem quality on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), to provide a scientific basis to modify contemporary oak silviculture. The response pattern of specific silvicultural practices was tested in nine long-term thinning experiments and one operational stand located in Northern Europe. Results showed that pruning led to an overall increase in the total production of new epicormic shoots, which decreased with increasing height along the stem and with decreasing stand density. This suggests that early, heavy thinning combined with high pruning at regular intervals may help shorten the rotation length. A set of models for predicting crown radius was presented, based on different levels of predictor variables that offer flexibility in terms of data availability. The models can be used, for example, to calculate the average area potentially available for final crop trees and therefore the potential number of trees at the end of the rotation. Models for individual tree volume were fitted separately for predicting total and stem volume, whilst accounting for thinning practice. Results showed an increase in prediction accuracy in comparison to similar models available in the literature. Stand volume growth was analysed and modelled in relation to age, thinning practice and site. The highest growth was for unthinned stands, decreasing with increasing <b>thinning</b> <b>grade.</b> Volume growth of 50 potential future crop trees ha- 1 increased with increasing <b>thinning</b> <b>grade</b> at all ages, demonstrating a positive effect of thinning on the growth of selected crop trees. The results lend support to the concept of crop tree silviculture based on early initiated, heavy thinning for the 'best' trees at regular intervals...|$|E
40|$|SCA has today almost 300 000 {{hectares}} of their forest land planted with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). Due to initial extensive planting in the 1970 ies {{the area of}} lodgepole pine forests in the thinning age has grown rapidly {{from the end of}} the 1990 ies. During the years 1996 - 2005 first commercial thinning of lodgepole pine at SCA took place. The goal of the hereby presented study was to investigate the growth and stability in those firstly-thinned lodgepole pine stands a few years after thinning. Furthermore, the objective was to investigate the relationship between stand stability and different stand parameters. Additionally, lodgepole pine stem quality was estimated. The study is mainly based on the data collected during an inventory project carried out at SCA in 2008. Altogether 91 lodgepole pine stands in northern Sweden were measured after the first thinning. Since the same stands were inventoried in 2004 and 2005, chosen results such as <b>thinning</b> <b>grade,</b> strip-road width and the distance between strip roads were used as additional data in correlation matrix. It was found that: • The average volume of dead trees in the inventoried 91 lodgepole pine stands was 3, 8 m 3 sk/ha being equal to 2, 3 % of the standing volume at the time of the inventory. • In terms of the number of trees, dead trees formed on average 3, 9 % of the total number of inventoried lodgepole pine trees. • No correlation between the volume of dead trees and soil type, soil moisture, stands dominant slope or stands dominant height above sea level was found. The share of the number of dead trees gave similar results. However, a positive and significant correlation between the share of the number of dead trees and soil moisture was found indicating higher risk for damages on wet soils than on dry soils. • Risk for mortality after thinning increases in stands thinned at larger dominant height, stands with high <b>thinning</b> <b>grade</b> and wide strip-roads. • No clear relation between types of dead trees and their distance to the closest trip-road centre was found. • 49 % of measured stems were estimated to have sawn-timber quality.

40|$|The {{theories}} of Metzger, who described the tree stem as {{a beam of}} uniform resistance, and of Gray, who claimed that the tree stem was not 'fixed ' but anchored in a relatively weak substratum, are described and discussed. The equation describing Gray's taper line is D 2 = a—bH, where D is diameter at height H and a and b are constants. This equation was found to give satisfactory results when tested on seventy-three trees from the coastal forest region of British Columbia and twenty-two plantation-grown Scots pine trees from the south of England. Taper, as expressed by the regression coefficient, b, is not affected by stand age or site index and varies very little between the species tested. Over ninety-five per cent, {{of the variation in}} b could be removed by a combined variable diameter breast height (d. b. h.) 2 /(total height). Taper increases throughout the life of the tree as long as it remains in the dominant crown class but begins to decrease with age as the trees become dominated.

40|$|Thinning trees by {{form and}} defects (tree-class thinnings) and {{practical}} or free thinning (according {{to the surrounding}} trees) were unsuitable for comparing thinning methods by the subjectivity of the involved tree classification methods. A thinning criterion based on 'top height' and 'stem number' proved objective. By assuming different ratios between crown diameter and height at a certain developmental stage of the trees, reduction in stem number could be obtained, related to the mean 'top height', which was height, measured and averaged on the 100 highest trees, uniformly distributed over 1 ha. Assuming different ratios gave different stem number reductions. Thus the results of different objective <b>thinning</b> <b>grades</b> could be compared. Initial stem number {{was determined by the}} ratio crown diameter: height and by the relation between spacing and amount of thinning.

40|$|Forest site {{productivity}} is the production {{that can be}} realised at a certain site with a given genotype and a specified management regime, and depends on both natural factors inherent to the site, and on management related factors. This review {{of the evolution of}} site assessment highlights three tenets of forest {{site productivity}}: the height-age site index, Eichhorn’s rule, and the thinning response hypothesis. These tenets rely on the hypotheses that height growth correlates well with stand volume growth; that total volume production of a given tree species at a given stand height should be identical for all site classes; and that stand volume growth is independent of thinning practice {{for a wide range of}} <b>thinning</b> <b>grades.</b> The maturation of long-term field experiments has provided for the revision of these hypotheses, and contributed to an understanding of situations where they do not hold. Stand volume growth per unit of height growth has been called the yield level. The use of the yield level theory for estimating site productivity has facilitated the development of a three-dimensional model of the relationship between stem number, quadratic mean diameter and stand basal area.
