25|$|The {{preliminary}} hearing opened on December 11, 2006, with Reiser being represented by attorney William Du Bois. At the hearing, a forensic technician testified that blood matching Nina Reiser's DNA {{had been found}} on a bag in Hans Reiser's car, and on a pillar in his mother's (Beverly Palmer's) house, {{where he had been}} living since the separation. It later emerged that a mistake had been made when the police analysed <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pillar, rendering the evidence inconclusive. Police also testified that they had found a 40-piece socket set which may have been used to remove the passenger seat, a receipt for the purchase of the socket set from Kragen Auto Parts, four seat bolts, and a ratchet wrench with a socket on it, suggesting that the seat may have been removed recently. A traffic officer who had pulled Reiser over nine days after Reiser's wife went missing testified later in the trial that the passenger seat had been present at the time, and that he had not seen any blood.|$|E
25|$|Norma is lured from Dr Stillingfleet by {{an ad in}} the {{newspaper}} to meet David, and is again drugged. Frances kills David. She sets it up to appear that Norma did it, but <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> knife was congealed when Norma found herself holding it. With police and family gathered in the flat, Poirot announces that Andrew did die in Africa. Robert Orwell poses as her father to gain the wealth of the family. He had David paint portraits of him and his late wife in the style of a painter popular 20 years earlier as part of the ruse. Most cruelly {{he and his wife have}} been giving Norma various drugs that give her hallucinations and an altered sense of time, to set her up as guilty. Further, the wife had poisoned herself hoping to pin that on Norma, too. Louise wrote to Andrew on learning he was back in England, so Frances killed Louise; this is the murder Norma feared she did. The woman posing as stepmother was also Frances, who used a blonde wig to cover her dark hair when changing roles. Poirot takes the wig from her bag to make that point. Murder of the two who could expose the imposters was just one of her crimes. Sonia is exonerated when she finds the papers Sir Roderick misplaced, and the two will marry. Poirot had chosen Dr Stillingfleet to help him with Norma in hopes the two would marry, and they will.|$|E
500|$|The inquest {{was unable}} to {{determine}} Cancellor's exact cause of death, but noted several inconsistencies in Hopley's explanation of events.

Hopley attempted to explain away <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> candlestick by attributing it to a broken blister on his hand, but did not offer an explanation for Cancellor's injuries. Hopley aroused further suspicion when he asked journalists present at the inquest not to include details of the corporal punishment in their stories, [...] "in order to spare {{the feelings of the}} deceased family as of my own". Cancellor's family was deeply affected by the case, as they had been [...] "disinclined" [...] to see Cancellor beaten; his father died shortly after the inquest of a [...] "broken heart".|$|E

2500|$|Preparation for {{the film}} began with Scorsese {{shooting}} some 8mm color footage featuring De Niro boxing in a ring. One night when the footage was being shown to De Niro, Michael Chapman, and his friend and mentor, the British director Michael Powell, Powell {{pointed out that the}} color of the gloves at the time would have only been maroon, oxblood, or even black. Scorsese decided to use this as one of the reasons to film Raging Bull in black and white. Other reasons would be to distinguish the film from other color films around the time and to acknowledge the problem of fading color film stock—an issue Scorsese recognized. Scorsese went to two matches at Madison Square Garden to aid his research, picking up on minor but essential details such as the blood sponge and later, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ropes (which would later be used in the film). According to the brief comments on the inlay card of the Raging Bull DVD, Scorsese was not—and still is not—a fan of sports or boxing, which he describes as boring. When he saw the blood-soaked sponges being dipped in a bucket, he recalls thinking to himself, 'And they call this sport.' ...|$|E
