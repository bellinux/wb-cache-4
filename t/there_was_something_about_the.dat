[...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> setting for this painting that {{reminded him of}} his homeland. [...] He asked his brother Theo to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands, named Tersteeg. Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague. [...] He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named Sien.|$|E
500|$|More than a {{thousand}} young actresses were considered for the part of Max. Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when the field had been narrowed down to twenty or thirty applicants. He was initially not impressed with Alba's audition tape, saying [...] "she had her head down, she was reading out of the script... she didn't present herself all that well. But <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked." [...] Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but {{kept coming back to}} Alba's, eventually deciding that he needed to meet her. Alba was hired for the role before the script was written. Eglee said: [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] To train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kristen Bell {{was cast}} {{as the voice of}} Anna on March 5, 2012. Lee {{admitted}} that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World". Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened. Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film [...] "probably 20 times," [...] which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving. As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} {{entertainment}} industry magazine Variety praised The Projected Man, writing that the screenplay [...] "is a mosaic compiled from other films but the pieces hang together fairly well." [...] However, Variety criticised the character's motives, saying that [...] "the origin and motives {{of the third}} party are never fully explained." [...] The magazine wrote that the performances in the film were [...] "generally good," [...] and that [...] "the characters do not fall prey to the usual cliches." [...] Writing for Ottawa Citizen, Gordon Stoneham, reviewing the double bill of The Projected Man and Island of Terror, called The Projected Man [...] "dreadful stuff," [...] saying that the film was [...] "badly written, woodenly acted, and abounding in the cliches of the horror film genre." [...] However, he wrote that [...] "it is short and to the point" [...] and wrote that [...] "although it trods a familiar path, {{every now and then}} it comes up with some arresting bit of cinematic coloring that rivels the attention." [...] Comparing the two films, he stated that The Projected Man was [...] "the best." [...] A TV Guide review wrote that the [...] "characters are better portrayed than usual in films of this nature, keeping the actors from becoming mere stereotypes" [...] and that [...] "subtle artistic direction and first-quality special effects give this picture a strong visual presence." [...] The review graded The Projected Man with two stars out of four. The anonymous reviewer for the British Kinematograph Weekly called the cast [...] "competent" [...] and noted that, while the [...] "plot [...] at least as old as H. G. Wells", <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film that would challenge the [...] "hard-boiled child of today".|$|E

60|$|Evelyn smiled. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> man which {{appealed to}} her. Perhaps {{it was the}} mystery that seemed to shroud him and the Enchantress. She noticed {{now that he was}} casting furtive glances about the dining-room.|$|E
