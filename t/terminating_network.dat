50|$|In the European mobile {{telecommunications}} sector, absent a {{bill and keep}} arrangement, the wholesale markets have traditionally applied the calling party pays (CPP) principle in which an originating network pays the <b>terminating</b> <b>network</b> a charge called the mobile termination rate (MTR) or fixed termination rate (FTR) for calls to the <b>terminating</b> <b>network.</b> The MTRs paid under the CPP model, therefore, act as a cost floor to the retail pricing, preventing lowering of prices and innovation of retail propostitions. In many countries including the UK, the CPP model has thus led to {{a high level of}} regulatory activity aimed at capping the MTRs at a competitive level, which inevitably acts to reinforce the cost floor rather than being pro-competitive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The recent {{emergence}} of multimedia applications {{has led to}} the deployment of various telecommunication technologies (e. g. IP, wireless) in addition to traditional PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) circuit switched networks. In this heterogeneous telecommunication world, users make calls without regard {{to the fact that the}} originating network may differ from the <b>terminating</b> <b>network,</b> and the call may be routed through one or more intermediate networks. For instance, users from two different PSTN networks may communicate through an IP network using Voice over IP (VoIP) technology. In this framework, multimedia gateways perform call routing, call signaling conversions and media format conversions among different networks. This paper investigates algorithms and queuing delays on multimedia gateways in regard to call routing aimed at minimizing the expected call delay. Both centralized and distributed queuing models are considered, and performance measures are derived...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A {{methodology}} for the modeling of superconductinginsulator- superconducting (SIS) junction arrays {{will be presented}} and compared with measured results. In many cases, junction arrays (either in parallel or series) are treated as a single equivalent junction. The APEX Band 3 (385 - 500 GHz) receiver design has been implemented with two junctions connected in parallel via a section of inductive microstrip line. In this case, it is desirable to separately model each junction as the pumping between junctions is no longer symmetrical across the entire band. Since {{the performance of the}} SIS junction depends on its <b>terminating</b> <b>network,</b> a complicated interaction occurs when another junction is part of the embedding impedance and, therefore, there remain aspects of its performance that are difficult to analyse. A simplified model, demonstrated with MATLAB, will be given and compared with a more complete model implemented using a common circuit simulator, Agilent ADS. In both cases, each junction is represented by a quasi 5 -port network determined using the quantum theory of mixing. The model is then used to predict the performance of the APEX Band 3 mixer and compared with measured results...|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to generate 2 -D filters having variable magnitude characteristics has been proposed. In this work, 2 -D digital filters starting from a singly <b>terminated</b> <b>network</b> is generated. A new type of Continued Fraction Expansion obtained from a singly <b>terminated</b> <b>network</b> is considered, its stability defined and stable 2 -D analog lowpass filters have been generated. The 2 -D analog lowpass filters have been transformed to digital domain by applying generalized bilinear transformation. The 2 -D digital lowpass filters give rise to 2 -D digital highpass, bandpass and bandstop filters. The 2 -D highpass and bandstop filters have been generated from 2 -D lowpass filters using appropriate transformations. The 2 -D bandpass filter has been obtained {{by a combination of}} lowpass and highpass filters. The 2 -D digital filters are classified into four sets. The classification of four sets is based on the coefficients of the Continued Fraction Expansion. Each set is further classified into four cases. The classification of four cases in each set is based on the coefficients of the generalized bilinear transformation. The effects of the coefficients of the generalized bilinear transformation in each case and the effects of the coefficients of the Continued Fraction Expansion (CFE) in each set are studied. In the end, some basic examples of implementation of 2 -D digital lowpass filters in image processing are illustrated. The examples include reducing added Gaussian noise from images by using 2 -D lowpass filtering...|$|R

The technique presented differs somewhat from present methods employed in the synthesis of networks with resistive terminations.

Matching also enables the telephone hybrid coil (2- to 4-wire conversion) to operate correctly. As the signals are sent and received on the same two-wire circuit to the central office (or exchange), cancellation is necessary at the telephone earpiece so excessive sidetone is not heard. All devices used in telephone signal paths are generally dependent on matched cable, source and load impedances.

50|$|AAUI {{was part}} of a system of Ethernet {{peripherals}} that tried to make connecting to Ethernet much easier. At the time, Ethernet systems usually were 10BASE2, also known as thinnet. Apple's system was called FriendlyNet. A FriendlyNet 10BASE2 system did not use BNC T-connectors or separate 50 Ω terminators. Instead of a single BNC connector that was inserted into a T-connector placed inline in the cable, the AAUI transceiver had two BNC connectors, one on each side to which the cables were attached. The transceiver would automatically <b>terminate</b> the <b>network</b> if a cable was not attached to one of the sides. Additionally, Apple 10BASE2 cables would <b>terminate</b> the <b>network</b> if no device was attached to them. Thus the number of mistakes that could be made hooking up a thinnet network was reduced considerably. Since any of these mistakes would disable the network in an area this was a significant improvement.|$|R

40|$|In {{competitive}} telecommunications markets each carrier {{relies on}} competing <b>networks</b> to <b>terminate</b> internetwork calls. Regulators typically require the calling party's network {{to pay a}} termination fee to the called party's network equal to the <b>terminating</b> <b>network's</b> "incremental cost" of completing the call, effectively imposing all of the costs on the calling party's network. These payments can affect retail prices and therefore consumption. I show that when both parties benefit from a call, they should bear its costs {{in proportion to the}} benefit they receive. Therefore, imposing all of the costs of an internetwork call on the calling party's network can be inefficient if these costs are reflected in the calling party's usage rates. A system in which two networks exchange traffic at specified points on a bill-and-keep basis imposes some of the cost on each network, which will then be imposed on the parties. This can generate more efficient network utilization, even with unbalanced traffic between networks. Thus, regulators may improve the efficiency of telecommunications markets by establishing bill-and-keep intercarrier compensation rules.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to generate 2 -D filters having variable magnitude characteristics from an active analog doubly <b>terminated</b> <b>network</b> has been proposed. An active analog circuit with reactance elements in T section in the feedback has been considered. Its stability has been ensured and a 2 -D analog lowpass filter has been generated. The impedance values for the filter is obtained in comparison with type I Chebyshev filter with 1 db ripple in the pass band. The 2 -D analog lowpass filter has been transformed to digital domain by applying the generalized bilinear transformation. Similarly 2 -D digital high pass filter has been obtained. The 2 -D digital bandpass filter has been obtained by cascading the lowpass and highpass filters. The 2 -D digital filters are studied under five different cases. These five different cases {{are based on the}} coefficients of generalized bilinear transformation and the op-amp gain parameter. The effect of each generalized bilinear transformation coefficient and the op-amp gain on the filter output is studied by individually varying them. Finally, performance comparison between the infinite gain and finite gain configuration has been done for the lowpass filter with a basic image processing application. A basic application for 2 -D digital highpass filter with finite gain has been illustrated in image processing...|$|R
