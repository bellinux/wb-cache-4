50|$|The <b>TIR</b> <b>procedure</b> {{is mostly}} used with Eastern European {{countries}} {{that are not in}} the EU (e.g. Russia and Ukraine), Turkey, and parts of the Near East. Since the formation of the European single market, the <b>TIR</b> <b>procedure</b> has become unnecessary for intra-EU goods transport.|$|E
50|$|Truckers {{making use}} of the <b>TIR</b> <b>procedure</b> must first obtain an internationally {{harmonised}} customs document, {{referred to as a}} TIR carnet. TIR carnets are issued by national road transport associations. This customs document is valid internationally and as well as describing the goods, their shipper and their destination, represents a financial guarantee. When a truck arrives at a border customs post it need not pay import duties and taxes on goods at that time. Instead the payments are suspended. If the vehicle transits the country without delivering any goods, no taxes are due. If it fails to leave the country with all the goods, then the taxes are billed to the importer and the financial guarantee backstops the importer's obligation to pay the taxes. TIR transits are carried out in bond, i.e. the lorry must be sealed as well as bearing the carnet. The security payment system is administered by the International Road Transport Union (IRU).|$|E
