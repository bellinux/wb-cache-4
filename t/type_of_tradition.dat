Understood as repeated, patterned, and contextualized performances, rituals could be in “low contexts” meaning that they are less formally, unplanned in advance, and do not demand for complicated performances, or in “high contexts” that they are realized in a highly stylized and formalized occasions, and set as public events. This article attempts to describe an access ritual, called paariyangu (ritual of being a guest and a host), conducted {{by the people of}} (eastern) Sumba living in the east part of Indonesia. Visiting somebody’s house is an act of entering somebody else’s private domain. It is therefore necessary for the both parties (i. e. the guest and the host) to abide to certain manners so as to maintain a desirable social encounter.

40|$|The {{concepts}} <b>of</b> {{transition and}} <b>tradition</b> {{have not been}} the object of much original theoretical work in recent Anglophone socio-cultural anthropology. The term transition has been applied loosely {{to the demise of}} socialist regimes in Eastern Europe and their replacement by market economies and more pluralist forms of government. However, these objectives have proved elusive and most anthropologists therefore speak of open-ended »transformation processes« rather than a linear shift to capitalist democracy. Use of the concept <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> has been much influenced by the work of historians on the »invention of tradition«. This paper explores how societies, in particular elite groups, construct different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>tradition</b> in the wake of historical caesurae. Paying particular attention to the concept of nostalgia, it compares perceptions of the past in Britain, where social change has been largely gradual, with those in empires and states which experienced sharp political discontinuities in the twentieth century. To explain and understand nostalgia for socialism in large sections of the population in many postsocialist states, it is necessary to investigate not only economic and social mobility and related material factors but also factors pertaining to identity, especially collective identities...|$|R

40|$|There {{are nearly}} 14000 exegetical hadiths, narrated from Prophet's family, {{collected}} by some Shi'ah scholars {{in a number}} of commentaries well-known as Tafasir –e Ma'thur (traditional commentaries) in Shi'ah. In the 12 th century, most <b>of</b> these <b>traditions</b> were collected in the two large collections entitled Al-Burhan fi Tafsir al-Qur'an, the work of Bahrani (d. 1107 A. H), and Nur al-Thaqalayn, the work of Huwayzi (d. 1112 A. H). These hadiths can generally be classified in three categories: 1. the hadiths explaining outward meanings of the Qur'an, 2. the hadiths expressing the inward meanings of the Qur'an, and 3. the hadiths applying the Qur'anic concepts to the certain individuals and groups of people. For example, some verses of the Qur'an have been interpreted as symbols for the Prophet, the Prophet's household and the opponents of the Prophet's family. The last <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditions</b> is called the hadiths of Jary (flow). The term comes from Shi'ah hadith concerning ta'wil. According to some hadiths, the Qur'an is like the sun and the moon; it flows through history as same as the sun and the moon flows in cosmos. Among 14000 exegetical hadiths of shi'ah, more than 2100 hadiths are classified as hadiths of Jary. These hadiths have been extremely criticized by some of Sunni Muslim scholars. However, some modern Quranic Shi'ah exegetes such as Muhammad Husayn Tabatabayi, the author of Al-Mizan fi Tafsir al-Qur'an hold that it was the method of Imams of Ahl al-bayt to apply a Quranic verse to all things it might be applied to.
