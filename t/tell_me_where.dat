5|$|The Sunday, July 5, 2015, {{installment}} of Amy Dickinson's advice column Ask Amy unwittingly featured a hoax letter that derived its situational premise from The Room and, even after being edited for publication, retained phrases from the film's dialogue; Dickinson addressed the hoax {{in the following}} Saturday's July 11 edition of the National Public Radio comedy and quiz show Wait Wait... Don't <b>Tell</b> <b>Me!,</b> <b>where</b> she appears as a regular panelist, and her July 20, 2015 column.|$|E

[...] She {{therefore}} understood him to speak of , who was said to be the son of her father, and was then, on account of his love of literature, exiled to the Scottish islands.|$|E

TV Guide Network also produced {{a series of}} related discussions with high-profile guest stars, media pundits, and prominent social figures called [...] "Curb: The Discussion" [...] debating the moral implications depicted in each episode. David {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "Finally, thanks to the TV Guide Network, I'll get a chance to watch actual, intelligent people discuss and debate the issues addressed on 'Curb'.

500|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of its revival, {{the race was}} subject to criticism in light of Azerbaijan's human rights record as the race was established with the financial support of the Azerbaijani government. On 7 June 2016, the organisation Sport for Rights called for Bernie Ecclestone to speak out about the human rights situation in the country, having written {{an open letter to}} him to which Ecclestone had not replied. Sport for Rights {{made it clear that they}} did not call for a cancellation of the race, but instead urged the sport to use the race to promote these issues in public. Ecclestone replied a week later, saying that Formula One had [...] "a clear conscience" [...] on human rights and added: [...] "I tell you what we ought to do. As far as we are concerned, not have any races where there is corruption in the country. Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> we are going to be racing?" ...|$|E
500|$|Sellers's last {{film was}} The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous {{adventure}} novels by Sax Rohmer; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson. The {{production of the}} film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors—Richard Quine and John Avildsen—fired before the script had been completed. Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu with his ill-health often causing delays. Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. Tom Shales of The Washington Post described the film as [...] "an indefensibly inept comedy", adding that [...] "it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. [...] "Manchu" [...] will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> It Hurts, The Bobo and The Prisoner of Zenda".|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} became a hot topic. When Sean Penn met Malick, he told him, [...] "Give me a dollar and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> to show up". Scripts were also sent to Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Tom Cruise. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, {{numerous}} actors approached him, flooding the casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn't be accepting more requests. Some A-list actors including Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Gary Oldman, and George Clooney offered {{to work for a}} fraction and some even offered to work for free. Bruce Willis even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, to get a few lines for the movie. At Medavoy's home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with Martin Sheen delivering the screen directions, and Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Peter Berg, Lukas Haas, and Dermot Mulroney playing the main roles. In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of Where Eagles Dare and playing Japanese taiko drums. Malick met with an interested Johnny Depp about the project at the Book Soup Bistro on the Sunset Strip.|$|E

2500|$|The Resurrection Mary {{story is}} a type of {{vanishing}} hitchhiker story, a type of folklore that is known from many cultures. On his 1996 album The Artful Dodger, singer/songwriter Ian Hunter included the song [...] "Resurrection Mary", in which a driver in or near Chicago picks up a beautiful young woman with an [...] "incandescent glow" [...] who asks him [...] "I'm tryin' to get to Heaven/Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> that is?" ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Where</b> it Hurts {{started from}} a small [...] {{newspaper}} article {{about a group of}} women in Queens who got together to just talk. The [...] film starred Maureen Stapleton and won two Emmys. The following year, she wrote and co-produced Hustling based on Gail Sheehy's non-fiction book. The film was about a prostitute recounting her life to a reporter, and starred Jill Clayburgh and Lee Remick, respectively. For weeks, Kanin interviewed working girls at [...] the Midtown North police station, and after the film aired, she received letters complimenting her on how fairly she had treated them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{location}} of Moore's grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: [...] "The odd {{thing is that}} my father was such a good story-teller but he couldn't or wouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> my grandfather was buried. It was if there was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2003, British musicologists {{stumbled}} upon superficial {{similarities between the}} lyric and rhyming schemes of [...] "Yesterday" [...] and Nat King Cole's and Frankie Laine's [...] "Answer Me, My Love"; originally a German song by Gerhard Winkler and Fred Rauch called Mütterlein, it was a number 1 hit for Laine on the UK charts in 1953 as [...] "Answer Me, O Lord", leading to speculation that McCartney had {{been influenced by the}} song. McCartney's publicists denied any resemblance between [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] and [...] "Yesterday". [...] "Yesterday" [...] begins with the lines: [...] "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay." [...] In its second stanza, [...] "Answer Me, My Love" [...] has the lines: [...] "You were mine yesterday. I believed that love was here to stay. Won't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I've gone astray".|$|E
2500|$|Owner Tom Gerun {{contracted}} {{for several}} more show runs with Sophie Tucker through the 1940s. The club put on two floor shows a night, one at 9 or 9:30 and one starting around midnight. Gerun took the show some [...] south to Fort Ord to entertain U.S. Army troops for a special engagement in August 1941. Other bands {{taking part in the}} show were Carl Ravazza and his Palace Hotel Band, and Robert Nurok and his band from the Alcazar nightclub. Coming from the Bal Tabarin were Bob Saunders and his band, Señor Wences (a ventriloquist), singer-actress Gertrude Niesen, and the Duncan Sisters with their vaudeville act. After World War II started in earnest for the United States, Martinelli joked with a Billboard reporter that it was easy to get big-name stars to perform at his club, but asked [...] "can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> I can get one waiter and two dishwashers? Those are the rare birds these days." [...] After the war, Gerun hosted NBC broadcasts of Ted Lewis and his band, announced by Bill Roddy, performed live from the nightclub's stage. This activity was not enough to keep the club solvent—in 1947 Billboard reported their doors shut for a time so that the owners could save money as they attempted to sign a major musical artist. Gerun and Martinelli also admitted they were seeking a buyer for the place.|$|E
2500|$|In the dashcam audio/video of the {{incident}} Yanez can be heard being questioned by St. Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde within minutes of the shooting, and telling her: {{was sitting in the}} car, seat belted. I told him, 'Can I see your license?' And then, {{he told me he had}} a firearm. I told him not to reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet .... And I don't know where the gun was, he didn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>where</b> the fucking gun was, and then it was just getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring ahead, and then I was getting fucking nervous, and then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.According to the official Minnesota Department of Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) transcript of the interview of Yanez and his attorneys Tom Kelly and Robert Fowler, Yanez stated that his justification for the shooting was based on fear for his own life because he believed that Castile's behavior was abusive toward a young girl passenger (Reynolds' daughter) in the car. Yanez said: [...] "I thought, I was gonna die, and I thought if he's, if he has the, the guts and the audacity to smoke marijuana in front of the five-year-old girl and risk her lungs and risk her life by giving her secondhand smoke and the front seat passenger doing the same thing, then what, what care does he give about me?" [...] The victims' previous marijuana use later became a focus of the defense, with a mason jar containing a small amount having been found in the car.|$|E
