5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E

The Western Roman Empire proved less fortunate.

While there, he addressed a local Democratic Committee, reminiscing about his childhood and how his adopted mother overcame alcoholism. He also discussed his policy on the Iraq War, advocating devolving control to the Iraqi government: [...] "It's their country, it's their future and they should be willing <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and they certainly should be willing to die for it." [...] He returned to Iowa for a fundraiser later in the week.|$|E

[...] Most delegates to the 1912 Republican National Convention in Chicago selected by primary supported Roosevelt, but as most states held conventions to select delegates, Taft's control of the party machinery gave him the advantage. [...] A number of states, especially in the South, had contested delegate seats, matters which would be initially settled by the Republican National Committee. Borah was Idaho's Republican National Committeeman and was one of those designated by the Roosevelt campaign <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> on the RNC. As Taft controlled the committee, Borah found few victories. [...] Borah was among those who tried to find a compromise candidate, and was spoken of for that role, but all such efforts failed.|$|E

[...] The soldiers drew their weapons; Colonel Sidney Sherman announced that he [...] "had come to Texas <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and had as soon commence in the town of Nacogdoches as elsewhere". [...] Eventually, the troops were allowed to vote. With rumors that Santa Anna was preparing a large army to advance into Texas, rhetoric degenerated into framing the conflict as a race war between Anglos defending their property against, in the words of David G. Burnet, a [...] "mongrel race of degenerate Spaniards and Indians more depraved than they".|$|E

500|$|Although Warner Brothers studio {{had assumed}} that the many costumed films that studios like MGM had earlier {{produced}} would never succeed {{during the years of}} the Great Depression, they nonetheless took a chance by producing Captain Blood in 1935. The film is a swashbuckler action drama based on the popular novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz. It would star a then unknown extra, Errol Flynn, alongside the little-known de Havilland. According to film historian Tony Thomas, both actors had [...] "classic good looks, cultured speaking voices, and a sense of distant aristocracy about them". Filmed between August 5 and October 29, 1935, Captain Blood gave deHavilland the opportunity to appear in her first costumed historical romance and adventure epic, a genre to which she was well suited, given her beauty and elegance. In the film, she played Arabella Bishop, the niece of a Jamaica plantation owner, who purchases at auction an Irish physician wrongly condemned to servitude. The on-screen chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn was evident from their first scenes together, where clashes between her character's spirited hauteur and his character's playful braggadocio did not mask their mutual attraction to each other. Arabella is a feisty young woman who knows what she wants and is willing <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The bantering tone of their exchanges in the filmthe healthy give-and-take and mutual respectbecame the basis for their on-screen relationship in subsequent films. Captain Blood was released on December 28, 1935, and received good reviews and wide public appeal. DeHavilland's performance was singled out in The New York Times and Variety. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The popular success of the film, as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple, led to seven additional collaborations.|$|E

His salvation {{comes in the form of}} Suzanna as well as the Fugue's inhabitants who collectively encourage him <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Part of Cal's character development is a rite of passage less so of a boy to a man or even the reverse, but of a person self actualizing. His progression is charted through his recollections and imaginings of his grandfather; a poet dubbed [...] "Mad Mooney". Through Cal's contact with the Seerkind he gradually inherits the identity of Mad Mooney himself.|$|E
2500|$|... "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] had {{a limited}} radio release {{as the first}} single off The Open Door on July 31, 2006. This was {{followed}} by a wider release in the following week. Since the track leaked onto the Internet two days before its scheduled release to radio airplay, the band's record label Wind-up Records allowed radio stations to play the single ahead of schedule. Subsequently, the recording was made available for digital download on September 4, 2006, and a physical release as a single followed on September 25. Rumors began to surface that Wind-up was responsible for the track's selection as the album's first single, which Lee denied in a post on the band's then-active fansite Evboards.com: [...] "Wind up didn't choose this single- I did, and I had <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> I love this song. Also, they didn't change anything about it. This is the way we made it. We fought over the guitar part but eventually just got the mix right." ...|$|E

25|$|By early 2009 he was {{considered}} a fading force, despite going 4-1 the previous year, with two wins in K-1. However, he had not competed in the World Grand Prix 2008, and ended the year with a loss to Freddy Kemayo. Dropped out of almost every top 10 heavyweight rankings, Leko began to compete almost exclusively in the Netherlands and Germany, with varying results. He returned <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>It's</b> Showtime in May 2009, facing another smaller but popular big name heavyweight in Melvin Manhoef. On the back of two consecutive losses in K-1, Leko went into the fight as an underdog, but he ended up dominating Manhoef for two rounds, picking him apart with boxing and leg kicks. Unfortunately, {{in the final round}} he broke his foot, and the fight was called off. Manhoef magnanimously admitted that Leko had outclassed him, and offered a rematch to the Golden Glory fighter.|$|R

2500|$|The Mexica {{story is}} that they came from a place called Aztlán, {{described}} as {{an island in the}} middle of a lake. Their god Huitzilopochtli told them to go and look for a promised land. They first arrived around the territory known as Culiacán by 960CE, but then left and returned to Aztlan. [...] Wandering from Aztlan again around the year [...] "1 Tecpatl" [...] or 1064–65 according to the codices Chimalpahin, Aubin and the Anales de Tlalteloco, they soon arrived at Pátzcuaro. They thought that was the land promised to them by Huitzilopochtli, but the god told them to continue. They went east and arrived at Chapultepec, on the edge of what was then Lake Texcoco. The god told them that their promised land was close but that they would have <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Their first opponent was a chief named Cópil, son of a witch named Malinalxochitl and sister of Huitzilopochtli. The Mexica surrounded Cópil's forces, captured and sacrificed the chief's heart to Huitzilopochtli.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, the state of Missouri had chosen not to secede from the Union but not <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> or against it either: its position, as determined by an 1861 constitutional convention, was officially neutral. Missouri, however, had been the scene of much of the agitation about slavery leading up to the outbreak of the war, and was home to dedicated partisans from both sides. In the mid-1850s, local Unionists and Secessionists had begun to battle each other throughout the state, {{and by the end of}} 1861, guerrilla warfare erupted between Confederate partisans known as [...] "bushwhackers" [...] and the more organized Union forces. The Missouri State Guard and the newly elected Governor of Missouri, Claiborne Fox Jackson, who maintained implicit Southern sympathies, were forced into exile as Union troops under Nathaniel Lyon and John C. Frémont took control of the state. Still, pro-Confederate guerrillas resisted; by early 1862, the Unionist provisional government mobilized a state militia to fight the increasingly organized and deadly partisans. This conflict (fought largely, though not exclusively, between Missourians themselves) raged until after the fall of Richmond and the surrender of General Robert E. Lee, costing thousands of lives and devastating broad swathes of the Missouri countryside.|$|E
