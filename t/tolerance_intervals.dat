Since in this work {{we deal with the}} computation of one - sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval,</b> for the two-sided case we recomend, for instance, Krishnamoorthy and Mathew [5].

In this paper we introduce a unified analytical approach to the construction of <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> for discrete distributions in exponential families with quadratic variance functions.

This article proposes procedures to compute the exact minimum and average coverage probabilities of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> for Poisson and binomial variables. These procedures are illustrated with examples and real data applications. Based on these procedures, improved <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are proposed that can ensure that the true minimum or average coverage probabilities {{are very close to}} the nominal levels...|$|E
40|$|Statistical <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> {{are another}} tool for making {{statistical}} inference on an unknown population. The tolerance interval is an interval estimator {{based on the}} results of a calibration experiment, which can be asserted with stated confidence level 1 −, for example 0. 95, to contain at least a specified proportion 1 −, for example 0. 99, of the items in the population under consideration. Typically, the limits of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> functionally depend on the tolerance factors. In contrast to other statistical intervals commonly used for statistical inference, the <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are used relatively rarely. One reason is that the theoretical concept and computational complexity of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> is significantly more difficult than that of the standard confidence and prediction intervals. In this paper we present a brief overview of the theoretical background and approaches for computing the tolerance factors based on samples from one or several univariate normal (Gaussian) populations, as well as the tolerance factors for the non-simultaneous and simultaneous two-sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> for univariate linear regression. Such <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are well motivated by their applicability in the multiple-use calibration problem and in construction of the calibration confidence intervals. For illustration, we present examples of computing selected tolerance factors by the implemented algorithm in MATLAB. </p...|$|E

The <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval</b> method {{implemented in the}} widely utilized 0. 95 | 0. 95 methodology is analyzed. We point out a remarkable weakness of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval</b> method concerning the principle of repeatability. It is proved that repeating twice the procedure, {{the probability that the}} second maximum will be larger/smaller than the first one is 50 %. This statement is not surprising, it holds for any random variable with continuous distribution function. In order to demonstrate the undesirable consequences of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval</b> method in the decision making, the results of the analysis of an elementary example are discussed. Instead of the <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval</b> method, we suggest another method based on the sign test which has more encouraging features, {{especially in the case of}} several output variables. The problematic aspects of the method are also discussed. Finally, we suggest a simple test case which is able to reveal if the <b>tolerance</b> <b>interval</b> method would not be capable of determining the risky states of the system, when there are only a few of them.

40|$|A {{review on}} {{statistical}} <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> {{shows that the}} derivation of two-sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> is far more challenging than that of their one-sided counterparts. Much of the existing construction of two-sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are through a numerical approach. This study addresses the problems of constructing two-sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> in balanced one-way random effects models and for a general family of distributions. The Bayesian tolerance interval developed by Ong and Mukerjee (2011) using probability matching priors (PMP) is compared via Monte Carlo simulation with the modified large sample (MLS) tolerance interval of Krishnamoorthy and Mathew (2009) for normal and non-normal experimental errors with respect to coverage probabilities and expected widths. Data generated from normal and nonnormal experimental errors were studied to see the effects on the <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> since real data may not necessarily follow the normal distribution. Results show that the PMP tolerance interval appears to be less conservative for data with moderate and large number of classes while the MLS tolerance interval is preferable for smaller sample sizes. For {{the second part of}} the study, the PMP as well as frequentist two-sided <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are constructed for a general family of parametric models. Simulation studies show that the asymptotic results are well-reflected in finite sample sizes. The findings are then applied to real data.

40|$|The use of {{regression}} models for prediction purposes {{is one of}} the most common applications of chemometrics. In most cases, only reporting the point predictions is unsatisfactory and intervals are needed to quantify the uncertainty involved. It is common practice to use the 95 % prediction interval for this goal and to interpret such an interval as if 95 % of the future responses will be contained within this interval. However, this is inappropriate, and it can result in a gross underestimation of the real uncertainty of the predicted response, especially in cases where the degrees of freedom is small. To correctly quantify the uncertainty of a prediction, so-called <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> should be used. Although the theoretical background on <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> is well documented in the statistical literature, practical guidelines to calculate and use <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> in real-world applications are lacking. Another less known concept is that of simultaneous versus non-simultaneous intervals. In this tutorial, we explain the origin, interpretation and practical calculation of confidence, prediction, and <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals,</b> both in their simultaneous and non-simultaneous form. Depending on the case, equations for exact or approximate <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are provided. The accuracy of the approximations is discussed.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the {{association of}} experimentally induced pain threshold and tolerance with socioeconomic status. [...] - MATERIAL/METHODS: The study sample consisted of 319 adult subjects from the population of the island of Vis, Croatia, which was previously shown to have a high level of social homogeneity. A manual dolorimeter was used to measure mechanical pressure pain threshold (least stimulus intensity) and pain tolerance (maximum tolerance stimulus intensity) on both hands.

The mixed modeling analysis, controlled for the effects of age, gender, and 4 psychological variables, indicated that education was not a significant predictor in any of the 3 models.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Issues {{regarding}} {{tolerance and}} confidence intervals are discussed {{within the context}} of educational measurement and conceptual distinctions are drawn be-tween these two types of intervals. Points are raised about the advantages of <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> when the focus is on a particular observed score rather than a particular examinee. Because <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> depend on strong true score models, a practical implication of the study is that true score <b>tolerance</b> <b>intervals</b> are fairly insensitive to differences in assumptions among the five models studied. Perhaps the most important practical use that can be made of the concept of measurement error in educational testing is in discouraging too literal inter-pretations of observed scores. Confidence intervals for true scores are often used for this purpose. In this paper, I analyze an alternative to confidence intervals for encouraging cautious interpretation of observed scores. The al-ternative, referred to here as a tolerance interval, covers a chosen proportion of the conditional distribution of true scores for a given observed score.
