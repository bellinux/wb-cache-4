The Dutch took the fort of Kalutara by surprise and laid siege to the city of Colombo, in October 1655. On their first attack on 12 November, the Dutch lost 300 people, and 350 were seriously wounded. Half a year later Hulft died in action, being hit from the <b>townwall</b> by an arquebus in his right shoulder. This happened a month before the surrender of Colombo and two weeks after his visit to the Royal Palace, as described by the Dutch minister and orientalist Philippus Baldaeus. His corpse was decorated with flowers and fruits and transported to Galle. His ensign Pieter de Bitter brought the news to Batavia.|$|E
