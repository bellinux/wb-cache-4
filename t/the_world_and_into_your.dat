5000|$|Under Downs as host, 20/20 {{changed into}} a more {{standard}} yet unique newsmagazine and received kinder reviews from critics. The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978-79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, so you be in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> home, {{the stories that touch your}} life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E

50|$|Hals' work remains popular today, {{particularly}} with young painters who can find many lessons about practical technique from his unconcealed brushstrokes. Hals' works {{have found their}} way to countless cities all over <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> museum collections. From the late 19th century, they were collected everywhere — from Antwerp to Toronto, and from London to New York. Many of his paintings were then sold to American collectors.|$|R
5000|$|The film's title character, Francis, {{lives with}} his invalid, abusive mother in a dingy {{tenement}} apartment, and has suffered a life of unrelenting misfortune and brutality, further impacted by a stutter. Over time, he has withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> himself, silently observing others rather than interacting with them. His only solace has been his Catholic faith, but he has begun to question his belief in a loving God who could countenance so much evil and pain.|$|R

Frustrated and irate, Count Gruemon ordered Puss 'N Boots (Pero) {{to find and}} destroy the mouse. However, Pero was a kind-hearted cat and had become friends with the mouse, and so, helped the little creature to escape.

The Cubby is ephemeral and passes from our childhood exploration of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dreams <b>and</b> memories of adulthood. These cubby huts are primarily built from and located in the landscape and are intrinsically linked to this context; they are landscape as architecture and architecture as landscape and in construction they articulate {{a connection between the}} imagination and landscape and decay as they return to the land and the psyche...|$|R

30|$|Thermal {{molecular}} jiggling (spontaneous erase), {{photon absorption}} (photolysis), or bindings with other molecules can erase {{the information in}} a metastable chemical (Fig. 1). This latter process is common in metabolic reactions where the partial loss of previously stored chemical energy occurs. In all of these cases, chemical (or physical) potential energy dissipates into low-level thermal quantum information, which eventually diffuses out of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> colder universe as heat through an increase in entropy. The irradiation of the quantum ‘ash’ of the ‘dead’ information into the universe makes such information irrecoverably lost to <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{inquiry into}} the three great quests of the twentieth century–the South Pole, Mount Everest, and the Moon–examines our motivations to venture into these sublime, yet life-taking places.

In our age, the Thin Place quest has morphed into a challenge to evolve {{beyond the confines of}} our own physiology; through human ingenuity and invention, we reach places not meant to accommodate human life. The early Antarctic explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard defined exploration as “the physical expression of intellectual passion. ” Our quests to explore the end of the earth, the top of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> outer space exemplify this definition.
