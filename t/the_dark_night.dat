25|$|John of the Cross (Juan de Yepes) (1542–1591): Wrote three related {{instructional}} works, with Ascent of Mount Carmel as {{a systematic}} approach to mystic prayer; {{together with the}} Spiritual Canticle and <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Night</b> of the Soul, these provided poetic and literary language for the Christian Mystical practice and experience. Influenced by and collaborated with Teresa of Ávila.|$|E
25|$|The Ascent of Mount Carmel {{is a more}} {{systematic}} study of the ascetical endeavour of a soul looking for perfect union, God and the mystical events happening along the way. Although it begins as a commentary on the poem <b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Night,</b> it rapidly drops this format, having commented {{on the first two}} stanzas of the poem, and becomes a treatise. It was composed sometime between 1581 and 1585.|$|E

Finally the destroyer put a searchlight on the floating wreckage and it was identified as the remains of the Helena. The bow would sink later the next day.|$|E
25|$|Despite Sheridan's later {{criticism}} of Warren for moving slowly and his removal of Warren from command the next day, when {{at the end}} of the Battle of White Oak Road Warren heard the sound of the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan intending that Bartlett attack Pickett's flank. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since it was dark when Bartlett's men reach Gravelly Run, they did not try to cross but engaged the Confederates on the other side with sniper fire. <b>The</b> <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> hid the size of Bartlett's force from close scrutiny.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Night</b> (from {{which the}} spiritual term takes its name) narrates {{the journey of}} the soul from its bodily home to union with God. It happens during the night, which {{represents}} the hardships and difficulties met in detachment from the world and reaching {{the light of the}} union with the Creator. There are several steps in this night, which are related in successive stanzas. The main idea of the poem {{can be seen as the}} painful experience that people endure as they seek to grow in spiritual maturity and union with God. The poem of this title was likely written in 1578 or 1579. In 1584-5, John wrote a commentary on the first two stanzas and first line of the third stanza of the poem.|$|E
25|$|Diwali or Deepavali is the Hindu {{festival of}} lights celebrated {{every year in}} autumn in the {{northern}} hemisphere (spring in southern hemisphere). It is an official holiday in Fiji, Guyana, India, Malaysia, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago. One {{of the most popular}} festivals of Hinduism, it spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair. Its celebration includes millions of lights shining on housetops, outside doors and windows, around temples and other buildings in the communities and countries where it is observed. The festival preparations and rituals typically extend over a five-day period, but the main festival night of Diwali coincides with <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> of the Hindu Lunisolar month Kartika in Bikram Sambat calendar (the month of Aippasi in Tamil Calendar), on the 15th of the month. In the Gregorian calendar, Diwali night falls between mid-October and mid-November.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, the Arab tribes were given the option of joining either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraysh. Should any of these tribes face aggression, the party to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu Bakr joined Quraysh, and Khuza'ah joined Muhammad. They thus lived in peace for some time; but ulterior motives {{stretching}} back to the pre-Islamic period, ignited by unabated fire of revenge, triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without concern for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza'a in a place called Al-Wateer in Sha'ban, in 8 AH. Quraysh helped Banu Bakr with men and arms, taking advantage of <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>night.</b> Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza'ah sought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary to all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chased them in the sanctified area — where no blood should be shed — and massacred his adversaries. Khuza'ah at once sent a delegation to Medina to inform Muhammad, of this breach of truce and to seek help from Muslims of Medina being their allies.|$|E

25|$|It was {{discovered}} by the British that {{on the night of}} 1 October, the battalion of Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 21, which had faced the 141st Brigade, had been due for relief that night and left before the replacements arrived. The Germans had quickly rushed up a battalion from support; two companies occupied the Flers Line opposite Eaucourt and one company moved east of Eaucourt but small-arms fire from the foremost troops of the 141st Brigade and British artillery-fire forced the Germans under cover. Another company came west of the village through the gap and re-occupied trenches, just in time to meet the attack of the 1/23rd London the next morning. <b>The</b> <b>dark</b> <b>night,</b> pouring rain and the lack of time for reconnaissance of the captured ground had made the positions captured by the British difficult to defend. The success of III Corps in capturing Eaucourt and Le Sars a few days later, was the last big victory of the Fourth Army in 1916, the subsequent attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt were costly failures. The German infantry opposite the Fourth Army had to defend improvised positions, which were destroyed by British heavy artillery-fire, causing many casualties. (The defeats inflicted by the French led to the sacking of the 2nd Army Chief of Staff, Colonel Bronsart von Schellendorf). The 5th Army at Verdun was ordered to retire from every piece of ground not necessary for the defence of the front to create reserves for the Somme. The six divisions holding the line from Le Transloy to the Ancre were replaced by seven fresh divisions from the end of September to 13 October, two of which were relieved in turn.|$|E

2500|$|Saint John of the Cross is {{considered}} one of the foremost poets in the Spanish language. Although his complete poems add up to fewer than 2500 verses, two of them—the Spiritual Canticle and <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Night</b> of the Soul—are widely considered masterpieces of Spanish poetry, both for their formal stylistic point of view and their rich symbolism and imagery. His theological works often consist of commentaries on these poems. All the works were written between 1578 and his death in 1591, meaning there is great consistency in the views presented in them.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} quatrain, Shakespeare {{focuses on the}} [...] "twilight of such day" [...] as death {{approaches}} throughout the nighttime.

Thus he believes that as the sunset fades, <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>night</b> [...] "doth take away" [...] his life, which he {{will not be able to}} regain, after the [...] "black night". As a result, as the night approaches the individual's youth begins to fade away and his old age leads him to the path of death.|$|E

2500|$|In Montfort's view {{it takes}} effort to {{progress}} along {{the scale of}} achieving closer union with God through consecration to Mary and that different individuals reach different levels along this scale, depending on their efforts and purity of intentions.

Montfort's classification of the multiple levels of spiritual progress is similar to the [...] "spiritual dwelling places" [...] described by Saint Teresa of Avila in the Interior Castle. Yet Montfort's view differs from Teresa's contemporary, Saint John of the Cross in that Montfort sees the Marian path to Jesus as far more positive, encouraging and smooth than the path followed by Saint John in <b>the</b> <b>Dark</b> <b>Night</b> of the Soul.|$|E
