5000|$|Some {{scissors}} are {{marketed as}} ambidextrous. These have symmetric handles {{so there is}} no distinction between the thumb and finger handles, and have very strong pivots so that the blades simply rotate and do not have any lateral give. However, most [...] "ambidextrous" [...] scissors are in fact still right-handed in that the upper blade is on the right, and hence is on the outside when held in the right hand. Even if they cut successfully, the blade orientation will block the view of <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> for a left-handed person. True ambidextrous scissors are possible if the blades are double-edged and one handle is swung all the way around (to almost 360 degrees) so that the back of the blades become the new cutting edges.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and a device for cutting a brittle body using laser radiation. The cutting of brittle bodies, in particular hollow bodies or plates, for example made of glass or ceramics, is a widely used technology.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process and a device for cutting a brittle body using laser radiation. The cutting of brittle bodies, in particular hollow bodies or plates, for example made of glass or ceramics, is widespread in technology. With previously known laser cutting processes, a mechanically complex movement of the laser beam relative to the body is required. In the process described here, {{the surface of the}} body to be cut is heated along <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>line</b> by the effect of the laser beam {{in such a way that}} a thermo-mechanical stress builds up leading to rupture of the body to be cut along <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>line.</b> According to the invention, the laser beam is projected onto the surface of the body by means of a special imaging optics so that the body is radiated simultaneously along the entire cutting line. The rupture is induced by temporal modulation of the beamed laser intensity. When an annular mirror arrangement is used, the process described, for example for cutting the press edge of drinking glasses, can be use...|$|E
