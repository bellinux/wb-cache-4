5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and <b>the</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for <b>the</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso that it would never be made into a film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E

5000|$|Translation also {{influenced}} the Arabic repertoire of imageries and ideas. Most importantly, it introduced new literary genres, such as novels, plays, short stories, articles, etc. The first effect of translation was in <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> <b>of</b> foreign plays. It began with Maroun al-Naqqash's (1855) <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> Moliere, and Najib Haddad's (1866) translations of Corneille, Hugo, Dumas, and Shakespeare. However, {{the most successful}} attempts in <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> <b>of</b> foreign dramas were on the hands of Muhammad Othman Jalal (1898), who adapted from Molière, and Arabized the novel [...] "Paul and Virginie" [...] Despite all these efforts, the play, as a distinct literary genre, did not reach its full popularity until the 20th Century.|$|R

5|$|Echolocation {{probably}} first derived in bats from communicative calls. The Eocene bats Icaronycteris and Palaeochiropteryx had cranial adaptations suggesting {{an ability}} to detect ultrasound, implying they used echolocation. This {{may have been used}} at first mainly for communicative purposes or for mapping out their surroundings during their gliding phase, only being used for hunting insects while foraging on the ground or among vegetation. After <b>the</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey. Bats may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor, in which case it was then lost in the Old World fruit bats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, echolocation evolved independently in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera lineages.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, RedOctane, {{a company}} {{specializing in the}} {{manufacture}} of unique game controllers, was inspired to create Guitar Hero based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game.

The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by Activision in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create the Rock Band series of music games in the same vein as Guitar Hero. Activision brought Neversoft (primarily known for their Tony Hawk series of skateboarding games) on board for future development duties.

5|$|Plant ecology is {{the science}} of the {{functional}} relationships between plants and their habitats—the environments where they complete their life cycles. Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, <b>the</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. Some ecologists even rely on empirical data from indigenous people that is gathered by ethnobotanists. This information can relay {{a great deal of}} information on how the land once was thousands of years ago and how it has changed over that time. The goals of plant ecology are to understand the causes of their distribution patterns, productivity, environmental impact, evolution, and responses to environmental change.|$|E
