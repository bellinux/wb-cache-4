40|$|Even {{before the}} first flight of the Space Shuttle, it was {{understood}} low liquid hydrogen (LH 2) Net Positive Suction Pressure (NPSP) at the inlet to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) can have adverse effects on engine operation.

40|$|Abstract—Modern {{processors}} crudely manage thermal emer-gencies through Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM), {{where the}} processor monitors the die temperature and dynamically adjusts the processor {{voltage and frequency}} (DVFS) <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> the processor when necessary. However, DVFS tends to yield marked degradation in both application performance and system reliability. Thus, pro-active scheduling techniques that avoid thermal emergencies are preferable over reactive hard-ware techniques like DTM. Based on our previously introduced thermal Chaotic Attractor Predictors (CAPs), which take into account key thermal indicators and system performance metrics for overall energy consumption estimation, we have developed and evaluated an effective thread scheduler for multicore systems. Besides CAPs, our scheduler makes use of two basic principles to minimize server energy consumption: (1) selecting the thread with the least probability of causing a DTM during the subse-quent time quantum, for execution in each core, and (2) migrating execution threads on thermally overextended cores to other cool cores via load balancing so as to observe the thermal envelope. Our developed scheduler is evaluated in practice to assess its potential advantage resulting from thermal-awareness by incor-porating thermal CAPs (for temperature prediction) and basic principles (for energy reduction) into the existing scheduler in the FreeBSD operating system. Our implemented scheduler is run on a server with the Intel Xeon processor for gathering measures of interest (including die temperature readings and run times) when benchmark codes from the PARSEC suite are executed. The gathered results reveal that our proposed scheduler exhibits reduction in mean core on-die temperatures by up to 12. 8 ◦C while mostly experiencing only 1 % to 4 % performance degradation.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} homogeneous {{gas phase}} photochemical model is developed {{to study the}} problem of stability of the Martian atmosphere. The one-dimensional model extends {{from the ground up}} to 220 km, passing through the homopause at 125 km. The model thus couples the lower (neutral) atmosphere to the ionosphere above which provides significant downward flux of carbon monoxide and oxygen atoms. It is concluded on the basic of currently accepted values for globally and seasonally averaged water vapor abundance, dust opacity and the middle atmospheric eddy mixing coefficient, as well as the relevant laboratory data (particularly the temperature dependence of CO 2 absorption cross section and the rate constant for CO+OH reaction), that the rate of re-formation of carbon dioxide exceeds its photolytic destruction rate by about 40 %. Furthermore, it is found that this result is virtually independent of the choice of eddy mixing coefficient, unless its value in the middle atmosphere exceeds 10 (exp 8) sq cm/sec or is far smaller than 10 (exp 5) sq cm/sec, or the dust opacity, unless it exceeds unity, or the water vapor mixing ratio at the surface, unless it is far smaller (less than or = 1 ppm) or far greater (greater than or = 500 ppm) than the average value (approximately 150 ppm). Since none of these extremes represent globally and seasonally averaged conditions on Mars, we propose that the present model requires existence of a mechanism <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> the recycling rate of carbon dioxide on Mars. Therefore, it is suggested that a heterogeneous process which provides a sink to the species that participate in the recycling of CO 2, i. e., H 2 O, H 2 O 2, OH, CO or O, in particular, may be necessary to bring about the balance between the CO 2 recycling rate and its photolytic destruction rate. Aerosols of dust or ice (pure or doped water or carbon dioxide ice present in the atmosphere of Mars) can provide the appropriate adsorption sites for the above heterogeneous process. Despite our conclusion that some heterogeneous process may be needed, {{it is important to recognize}} that one-dimensional models can only provide first-order results which, most likely, represent globally and seasonally averaged conditions. However, it is only after actual temporal, latitudinal and longitudinal variations of relevant atmospheric parameters are included in the model that one can determine fuly whether the problem of atmospheric stabiltiy still continues to persist and whether some heterogeneous process is required to correct it...|$|E
5000|$|Around 30 seconds into ascent, the SSMEs were <b>throttled</b> down—usually <b>to</b> 72%, {{though this}} varied—to reduce the maximum {{aerodynamic}} forces {{acting on the}} Shuttle at a point called Max Q.

50|$|Flight 400 {{was to be}} an IFR {{flight to}} Newark International Airport (EWR) in Newark, NJ. On this {{particular}} flight, the first officer was in the left seat, as he was being line-checked by the captain. As the aircraft became airborne, a sharp yaw was experienced while the first officer reduced power {{at an altitude of}} approximately 100 feet (30 m). Almost immediately, the fire warning light for the number one engine illuminated; however, the fire warning bell never sounded. At this point, the first officer is thought <b>to</b> have <b>throttled</b> <b>down</b> the number one engine. The captain had only noted the loss of power shown by the BMEP gauge, but never saw the fire warning light. He pulled the mixture to idle cutoff. As the first officer reached for the manual feathering button, the captain stopped him. The captain indicated that the autofeather device would feather the no. 1 prop. This never occurred, due <b>to</b> the <b>throttle</b> lever being retarded to a position aft of the switches that arm the auto-feathering system. The no. 1 prop created sufficient drag, causing the aircraft to continue to yaw to the left. At only 1,690 feet (515 m) past the runway's end, at 7:20 PM, the aircraft crashed.|$|R
50|$|The NF-104A {{was able}} to reach great altitudes through a {{combination}} of zoom climbing (building up a high speed in a shallow dive at high altitude, and then climbing steeply, converting speed and momentum into altitude) and use of the rocket engine (to reach higher level speeds and to maintain climb rate {{for as long as possible}} after entering the zoom climb). A typical mission involved a level acceleration at 35000 ft to Mach 1.9 where the rocket engine would be ignited, and on reaching Mach 2.1 the aircraft would be pitched up to a climb angle of 50-70° by carefully applying a load equal to 3.5 g. The J79 afterburner would start <b>to</b> be <b>throttled</b> <b>down</b> at approximately 70000 ft followed shortly after by manual fuel cutoff of the main jet engine itself around 85000 ft to prevent fast-rising engine temperatures from damaging the turbine stages of the jet engine.

40|$|There are {{currently}} three dominant TSTO class architectures. These are Series Burn (SB), Parallel Burn with crossfeed (PBw/cf), and Parallel Burn without crossfeed (PBncf). The {{goal of this}} study was to determine what factors uniquely affect PBncf architectures, how each of these factors interact, and to determine from a performance perspective whether a PBncf vehicle could be competitive with a PBw/cf or SB vehicle using equivalent technology and assumptions. In all cases, performance was evaluated on a relative basis for a fixed payload and mission by comparing gross and dry vehicle masses of a closed vehicle. Propellant combinations studied were LOX: LH 2 propelled orbiter and booster (HH) and LOX: Kerosene booster with LOX: LH 2 orbiter (KH). The study conclusions were: 1) a PBncf orbiter should be throttled as deeply as possible after launch until the staging point. 2) a detailed structural model is essential to accurate architecture analysis and evaluation. 3) a PBncf TSTO architecture is feasible for systems that stage at mach 7. 3 a) HH architectures can achieve a mass growth relative to PBw/cf of < 20 %. 3 b) KH architectures can achieve a mass growth relative to Series Burn of < 20 %. 4) center of gravity (CG) control will be a major issue for a PBncf vehicle, due to the low orbiter specific thrust to weight ratio and to the position of the orbiter required to align the nozzle heights at liftoff. 5) thrust to weight ratios of 1. 3 at liftoff and between 1. 0 and 0. 9 when staging at mach 7 appear to be close to ideal for PBncf vehicles. 6) performance for all vehicles studied is better when staged at mach 7 instead of mach 5. The study showed that a Series Burn architecture has the lowest gross mass for HH cases, and has the lowest dry mass for KH cases. The potential disadvantages of SB are the required use of an air-start for the orbiter engines and potential CG control issues. A Parallel Burn with crossfeed architecture solves both these problems, but the mechanics of a large bipropellant crossfeed system pose significant technical difficulties. Parallel Burn without crossfeed vehicles start both booster and orbiter engines on the ground and thus avoid both the risk of orbiter air-start and the complexity of a crossfeed system. The drawback is that the orbiter must use 20 % to 35 % of its propellant before reaching the staging point. This induces a weight penalty in the orbiter in order to carry additional propellant, which causes a further weight penalty in the booster to achieve the same staging point. One way to reduce the orbiter propellant consumption during the first stage is <b>to</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>down</b> the orbiter engines as much as possible. Another possibility is to use smaller or fewer engines. Throttling the orbiter engines soon after liftoff minimizes CG control problems due to a low orbiter liftoff thrust, but may result in an unnecessarily high orbiter thrust after staging. Reducing the number or size of engines size may cause CG control problems and drift at launch. The study suggested possible methods to maximize performance of PBncf vehicle architectures in order to meet mission design requirements...|$|E

Early in the Space Shuttle Program s history, the relevant Flight Rule for the Booster flight controller in Mission Control did not distinguish between ET and Orbiter MPS failures and the same crew action was taken for both. However, after a review of all Booster operational techniques following the Challenger disaster in the late 1980 s, it was determined manually <b>throttling</b> the SSME <b>to</b> a lower power was only effective for Orbiter MPS failures and the Flight Rule was updated to reflect this change.
