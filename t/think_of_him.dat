25|$|The most {{important}} reform {{of all was}} the emancipation of the serfs, a policy that was unpopular with large sections of the nobility. When the committee appointed to bring it about dug in their heels and made difficulties, Alexander II asked Konstantin to join the committee in September 1857. Where the Tsar was unsure of himself, his younger brother was more forceful, quick tempered, and cared not what others might <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{is known}} for his blunt {{speaking}} and candor, which are rarely meant to be taken personally. [...] This tendency has grown as he has gotten older and less bothered by what others <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> [...] When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, [...] "Well, as Rhett Butler once said in Gone With the Wind, if I'm gone, quite frankly, I don't give a damn."

He was loyal, honest; just a solid-gold individual. He didn't have a malicious {{bone in his}} body". Garland often slept {{during the day and}} stayed awake at night, leading his peers to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a vampire. Before becoming a senior, he led the Pride to sixth place at the under-17 national AAU tournament in Orlando, Florida. The team finished with an 8–1 record due largely to Garland's contributions.|$|E
500|$|The Joker's {{controlling}} and abusive relationship with Harley Quinn has been analysed {{as a means}} of the Joker reinforcing his own belief in his power in a world where he may be killed or neutralized by another villain or Batman. Joker mirrors his identity through Harley in her appearance, and even though he may ignore or act indifferent towards her, he continues to try and subject her to his control. When Harley successfully defeats Batman in [...] (1994), the Joker, emasculated by his own failure, severely injures her out of fear of what the other villains will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> However, while Harley recovers, the Joker sends her flowers which she accepts, reasserting his control over her.|$|E
500|$|Dissenting {{from the}} general tone of praise for Bewick, Jacob Kainen cites claims that [...] "many of the best tailpieces in the History of British birds were drawn by Robert Johnson", and that [...] "the greater number of those {{contained}} in the second volume were engraved by Clennell. Granted that the outlook and the engraving style were Bewick's, and that these were notable contributions, {{the fact that the}} results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to the outpourings of genius." [...] Kainen argues that while competent, Bewick [...] "was no Holbein, no Botticelli—it is absurd to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in such terms—but he did develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving." ...|$|E

The Government of Canada ordered flags across the country lowered to half mast, an unprecedented honour that was usually reserved for statesmen. Addressing the House of Commons, Trudeau said, [...] "It occurs very rarely {{in the life of}} a nation that the courageous spirit of one person unites all people in the celebration of his life and in the mourning of his death ...

500|$|A {{turning point}} in the book occurs when Rita {{falls in love with a}} gambler named L. D. Tolbrook, who seduces Rita and {{introduces}} her to prostitution. Her mother's hospitalization and death of her brother Bailey's wife drives Rita to her mother's home. She leaves her young son with a caretaker, Big Mary, but when she returns for him, she finds that Big Mary had disappeared with Clyde. She tries to elicit help from Tolbrook, who puts her in her place when she finds him at his home and requests that he help her find her son. She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her, but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to Bakersfield, California, and has an emotional reunion with her son. She writes, [...] "In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield, I began to understand that uniqueness of the person. He was three and I was nineteen, and never again would I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a beautiful appendage of myself".|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} pilot, [...] "The Thing You Love Most" [...] was co-written by series co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Smallville co-executive {{producer}} Greg Beeman served as director. The episode {{focuses on the}} rivalry between Emma and Regina, as each believes they know {{what is best for}} Henry. In an interview with TV Overmind, actress Lana Parrilla explained that viewers would see a [...] "vulnerable" [...] side of Regina/The Evil Queen in this episode. Says Parrilla, [...] "What I’ve been trying to show is not the hatred for Snow White, but where it derives from. It’s not so surfaced. That brings a vulnerability to the character. You’ll see into her history and that exposes her in a very vulnerable way as well." [...] As for Regina's troubled relationship with Henry, Parrilla noted that [...] "she may have a cold heart, but I think she really, genuinely loves her son. She doesn’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as an adopted son, she thinks of him as her son." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{his time}} at Somerset, he was known for [...] " [...] a match with his {{cracking}} strokes in an hour." [...] Alan Gibson wrote: [...] "We hardly <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a stylist, and he was mostly a back-foot player, getting the greater number of his runs in the segments fanning out from point and square-leg. But he was enjoyable to watch, compact, tidy, combining powerful hitting with delicate placing. In the best Somerset tradition, he was always after the bowling, and in the best Australian tradition, he always relished a fight." [...] But he also adapted his style to suit English pitches: in an early innings for Somerset, he was out trying to hook a ball from Trevor Bailey. [...] "The hook, he decided, was a stroke to be used sparingly on English pitches... McCool was constantly amending his technique that season , whenever he spotted a flaw in his method. Again and again he held the Somerset batting together. Nothing in his previous experience had equipped him for the task of holding up a losing side in a damp English summer." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1802, Cavendish's cousin John Ponsonby, Viscount Duncannon (her mother's sister's son), {{whom she}} had known her entire life, began to show romantic {{interest}} in her. Cavendish was unsure whether she cared for him enough, and they agreed to wait a year before deciding [...] "whether they liked each other well enough to marry". Their two families, especially his mother (and her aunt) Lady Bessborough approved of the match, but Cavendish was still undecided. During this period, John had romantic relationships with Lady Maria Fane and others; Cavendish presented an ultimatum that he [...] "must promise to cure himself completely of flirting, for she could not bear it". John angrily refused {{that he was not}} ready to marry her after all, nor [...] "bear rules to be prescribed to him by any woman living". He became engaged to Fane shortly thereafter. Her family later encouraged a match with another cousin John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, though, during her stay at Althorp, she stated that [...] "no reasonable woman" [...] could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as anything [...] "but as an eager huntsman".|$|E
500|$|Musial was {{assigned}} to the Class AA Columbus Red Birds to begin 1941, though manager, Burt Shotton, and Musial himself quickly realized that the previous year's injury had considerably weakened his arm. He was reassigned to the Class C Springfield Cardinals as a full-time outfielder, and he later credited manager Ollie Vanek for displaying confidence in his hitting ability. During 87 games with Springfield, Musial hit a league-leading [...]379 before being promoted to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. He was noted for his unique batting stance, a crouch in which his back was seemingly square to the pitcher. This stance was later described by pitcher Ted Lyons as [...] "a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops were coming". According to a 1950 description by author Tom Meany, [...] "The bent knees and the crouch give him the appearance of a coiled spring, although most pitchers <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a coiled rattlesnake." [...] Musial continued to play well in Rochester—in one three-game stretch, he had 11 hits. He was called up to the Cardinals for the last two weeks of the 1941 season.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally positive reviews. Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} song a positive review, {{calling it a}} [...] "club banger". Thomas Gonlianpoulous of Spin commended Swizz Beatz' [...] "bombastic production", Wayne's [...] "energetic yet nonsensical rap", and Brown's [...] "joyful, brisk vocals." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song, serving as lead single, says [...] "Brown's promise {{for the future is}} to be an altogether more interesting kind of RB& artist." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly referred to the song as a [...] "swaggering" [...] lead single. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times referred to the song as a type that he has made his specialty, and called it an [...] "electric, brassy collaboration." [...] Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy called the song [...] "a brutal, tuneless hunk of industrial R - as musically ugly as something like 'With You' was pretty", he said [...] "for that matter, this track rocks", commenting [...] "Whatever you may <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> you can't deny that Chris Brown lacks balls."

500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, {{what you see is}} what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "I'm for gun legislation myself. I don't hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered. I don't think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. They're worried that all guns {{are going to be}} recalled. It's impossible to take guns out of circulation, and that's why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted." [...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of the Brady Bill, with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air on 'Larry King Weekend'... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls.
