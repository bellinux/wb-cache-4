Controlling shareholders expropriated firm resources even when their ownership concentration was small.

The crop is cultivated in wet (rain fed) or irrigated conditions, requiring on average 2, 500 mm water per year, and in many countries it is cultivated in flooded plots. {{it is estimated that}} taro production could decrease by 40 % {{as a result of the}} increase in drought and other severe events. In this work, Thirty three accessions, including local cultivars, selected and hybrid lines were submitted to long duration drought stress and screened for tolerance. Twelve physiological, morphological and agronomic traits were measured at harvest, and subject to multivariate analysis. Stress indices, Water Use Efficiency and Factorial Analysis were useful for discriminating accessions regarding drought tolerance and yield stability, and drought tolerant and susceptible cultivars were identified. Our results confirm that different taro cultivars have different drought avoidance and tolerance strategies to cope with water scarcity.

40|$|Abstract Landnams in {{the west}} The export of the Norwegian central farm model to the landnam {{societies}} in the Faroe Island, Iceland and Greenland. This thesis aims to examine {{the extent to which}} the Norwegian central farm was exported to the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norse Greenland by smaller Norwegian chieftains in spe during the landnam periods. These people where the entrepreneurs of the migration and the landnams. Settled down in their new countries they reproduced the central farm structure that they knew well from Norway. This structure where one of the contributory factors for how the new societies developed. The power of the chieftains relied to a large degree on how the structure <b>transferred</b> <b>resources</b> from the land to the centre. Not only did the central farm influence the societies, the new countries also changed the central farm. In Iceland the farm kept its original shape with centre and surrounding client farms as we know it from the descriptions of Skallagrim in Egil Skallagrimsson saga. In the Faroes the topography and the resource zones centralized the whole farm when the first settlers built their farms together in bylingar. The Greenlandic farm also got the central farm structure even if the pattern is not as clear as in Iceland. The thesis focus on how the settlers both the free farmers and the chieftains utilized the resources in their new countries. It asks questions about why we see the differences we see in the archaeological records, both in zoo archaeology and when it comes to the farm structures and building sizes. There were clearly huge differences in the economy of the people, not only between the countries but also in each country. The situation seems to be that all the landnamsmenn started out with the same type of animals and the same type of longhouse. This situation changes after some time and the different farms and the different countries goes in separate directions. Why? I also investigate how the Norse in the North Atlantic organized the land and the estates. Also at this point it looks as if they all started out with the same kind of model: All land organizes as common land, allmenning and then after some time they reorganized it. The Faroes got their markatal model organizing all land in lots, where the owners of land in the home fields have right in a corresponding amount of the out field. The Icelandic model seems to part in to with to kinds of common owned. Greenland seems to keep the allmenning model knewn from Norway...|$|E

Several national policy reviews as well as academic papers suggest that the reforms aiming at decentralizing power and responsibility for urban public transport management lead to successful outcomes. Yet, there is no literature on the effects of decentralization of tax raising on public transport provision although an increasing number of subnational governments reports a mismatch between <b>transferred</b> <b>resources</b> and devolved responsibilities and the public finance literature indicates that decentralization of finance authority can improve the results of decentralization reforms. (cont.) The objective of this thesis, thus, is to test if the theoretical benefits of fiscal decentralization (i. e. decentralization of taxing power in addition to management responsibilities) apply to the urban public transport sector and to what extent. Using a sample of five European cities (Madrid, Barcelona, Paris, Milan and Stockholm) in decentralized countries as case studies, the thesis identifies three major outcomes of fiscal decentralization. First it increases the expenditure in public transport infrastructure. Second it increases the entrepreneurship of the local policy-makers. Third it generally improves the predictability of the revenues and therefore helps planning in the medium to long term. On the other hand, the research also shows that there is no increased willingness to tax at the local level therefore the stability of funding and its adequacy to the needs is not guaranteed by local fiscal autonomy. The thesis moreover suggests that a mixed system of national dedicated taxation and local capacity to incrementally adapt the tax rates is an optimal scheme for financing local public transport. Finally, in light of the case studies, the thesis provides some recommendations to Transport for London (TfL), in order to guide the ongoing debate on the necessity of increased fiscal autonomy for the local authorities in the UK to solutions that are likely to improve TfL's situation. by Giorgia Favero.

Agriculture's role in development is reviewed briefly, as are the methods of <b>transferring</b> <b>resources</b> from agriculture: <b>transfers</b> on private account, government tax and expenditure policies, and policies aimed at changing the terms of trade of the agricultural sector. The bulk of the paper reviews the recent experience of developing countries and the literature related to this topic. It is organized around three basic themes. First is {{a review of the}} policies including tariff protection that have influenced the domestic terms of trade between agriculture and industry and the effects of those policies on the agricultural sector (which has usually been left to pay the bill for protected industrialization). Second is a discussion of the implications of productivity growth (or the lack of it) in both the agricultural sector and in protected import substituting industries for the questions of <b>resource</b> <b>transfers</b> and of general economic growth in both sectors. Third, the growing concern with unemployment and income distribution is reviewed in connection with the choice of policies to tax agriculture and <b>transfer</b> <b>resources</b> to industry.
