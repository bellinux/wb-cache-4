25|$|As in {{the case}} in World War I, Hillman used the {{influence}} of the federal government to advance both labor's social goals and its immediate organizing needs. Hillman was not able to persuade the Board to debar labor law violators, but did help introduce arbitration as an alternative to strikes in defense industries. At times, however, Hillman identified so closely with the government <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to have lost sight of his roots in the labor movement; his denunciation of the UAW members who struck North American Aviation in 1941, only to face troops sent by the Roosevelt administration to guard the plant, brought down a great deal of criticism from others within the CIO.|$|E
25|$|Capone {{was born}} in Brooklyn in New York City to Italian immigrants. He was {{considered}} a Five Points Gang member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as brothels. In his early twenties, he moved to Chicago and became a bodyguard and trusted factotum for Johnny Torrio, head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol—the forerunner of the Outfit—and that was politically protected through the Unione Siciliana. A conflict with the North Side Gang was instrumental in Capone's rise and fall. Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to Capone. Capone expanded the bootlegging business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor William Hale Thompson and the city's police meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> safe from law enforcement.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{presents}} Jack as initially likable and well-intentioned but {{haunted by}} the demons of alcohol and authority issues. Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by the evil forces in the hotel. At the novel's conclusion, the hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceed to destroy {{all that is left}} of his mind during a final showdown with Danny, leaving a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Halloran escape. The film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner. Jack actually kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel. King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> vaguely sinister {{from the very beginning of}} the film, and had suggested Jon Voight among others for the role.|$|E
25|$|In 305 BC the consuls {{were sent}} to Samnium. Lucius Postumius Megellus marched on Tifernum and Titus Minucius Augurinus on Bovianum. There was a battle at Tifernum where some of Livy's sources say that Postumius was defeated, while others say that the battle was even and he withdrew to the {{mountains}} at night. The Samnites followed him and encamped near him. Livy said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to have wanted to gain {{a position where he}} could get abundant supplies. Postumius then left a garrison at this camp and marched to his colleague who was also encamped facing the enemy. He instigated Titus Minucius to give battle, which dragged on until the late afternoon. Then Postumius joined in and the Samnites were slaughtered. The next day the consuls begun the siege of Bovianum, which fell quickly. In 304 BC the Samnites sent envoys to Rome to negotiate a peace. The suspicious Romans sent the consul Publius Sempronius Sophus to Samnium with an army to investigate the true intentions of the Samnites. He travelled all over Samnium and everywhere he found peaceable people who gave him supplies. Livy said that the ancient treaty with the Samnites was restored. He did not specify what the terms were.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{assigned}} as a supervising animator on The Lion King, Nik Ranieri did character {{designs and}} test animation for Timon, but {{moved over to}} Pocahontas growing frustrated with an indecisive vision from the directors. There, {{he was assigned to}} animate Redfeather until Jeffrey Katzenberg ordered for the animals to be mute. Finding feathers difficult for Redfeather to gesture with, he was again assigned to animate Meeko using a Little Golden Books animal book illustrated by Alice and Martin Provensen as reference. Duncan Marjoribanks utilized geometric shapes to create Ratcliffe. In early drafts of the character, he had the body similar to a pear, but to make him appear more arrogant, the animator increased the force of gravity on his chest so <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> more pompous and physically threatening. Chris Buck served as the supervising animator for Percy, Wiggins, and Grandmother Willow. For Grandmother Willow, the face was traditionally animated by Buck, while the cowl and the trunk of the tree was digitally animated under the supervision of Steve Goldberg. Assisted with the effect animators, a 3D software program was employed for the bark to be individually manipulated and for the face to match with the computer-generated texture. The following supervising animators included Anthony DeRosa for Nakoma, Michael Cedeno for Kocoum, Ken Duncan for Thomas, T. Daniel Hofstedt for the settlers Lon and Ben, and Dave Pruiksma for Flit. While Mulan was within its pre-production stages, 18 minutes were animated by 170 animators and artists at the Disney-MGM Studios.|$|E

500|$|Morgan's script {{turned out}} to be the most comedic episode of the series so far. The {{departure}} from The X-Files usual style made some of the crew, including director Kim Manners, uncomfortable, and some of the more explicitly comic scenes were cut. After [...] "Humbug", Morgan went on to write three more comedy-infused stories for the show: [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] and [...] "Jose Chung's From Outer Space". David Duchovny later commented, [...] "what I loved about his scripts was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to be trying to destroy the show."

He also felt that there wasn't much follow up on Manheim's experiments and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to be left to cause a more serious accident in the future. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com in July 2011. He thought that Michele Phillips was [...] "incredibly radiant", and said, [...] "there’s nothing I can point to at this episode and say is wrong, but it’s one of the more forgettable episodes", giving it a score of four out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Stravinsky {{worked through}} the winter of 1909–10, in close {{association}} with Fokine who was choreographing The Firebird. During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> immature and gauche for his age (he was 21). On the other hand, Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration, [...] "the very essence of a great personality". The Firebird was premiered on 25 June 1910, with Tamara Karsavina in the main role, and was a great public success. This ensured that the Diaghilev–Stravinsky collaboration would continue, {{in the first instance}} with Petrushka (1911) and then The Rite of Spring.|$|E

Onassis failed his exams at a Paris lycée at age 16, and began working for his father at his Monaco headquarters in 1965. Onassis earned a modest salary of $12,000 working for his father despite his father's great wealth. Onassis was not an enthusiastic employee.

In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person.

500|$|W. G. Grace, the Victorian era's {{most famous}} cricketer, brought an English team to Australia in 1873–74. Wills {{was desperate to}} play for Victoria against Grace and rival cricketing factions fought over his {{possible}} inclusion. Hammersley, a selector, ensured his omission. Wills toured with the team, playing for country sides. Irked by Wills' constant presence, Grace remarked <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to regard himself {{as a representative of}} the whole of Australia. It was assumed that, on his homeward journey, Grace would play a final match in the South Australian capital of Adelaide, but he bypassed the city when Kadina, a remote mining town in the Copper Triangle, offered him more money. Wills coached the locals. Played in an open, rock-strewn plain of baked earth, the game was deemed a farce. Wills made a pair and Grace later wrote derisively of the [...] "old Rugbeian" [...] as a has-been. Grace neglected to mention that Wills bowled him, ending with 6/28.|$|E
500|$|He {{also built}} a roughly semi-circular, terraced amphitheater at the {{foundation}} of the Pyramid which he called the [...] "foyer". He intended to rent this out and use the revenue for the pyramid project. The land for the amphitheater was first dug in late 1923, and construction continued off and on {{for the next five years}} whenever financing, building materials, and labor were available. Unlike other Monte Ne building projects designed by architect A. O. Clark, the amphitheater apparently had no architectural input and was not built according to blueprints or a single design. Those who worked with Harvey noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> to just [...] "work it out in his mind from day to day". The result was a unique structure, irregular in formation, with seating capacity for anywhere from 500 to 1,000. The amphitheater averaged [...] high and [...] long. In the middle of the amphitheater was a small island with two concrete chairs and a concrete couch, intended for an orchestra to play or a speaker to make a presentation. Harvey dedicated the amphitheater before 500 people in 1928.|$|E
