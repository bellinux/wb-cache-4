5|$|Active solar {{techniques}} use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, {{solar thermal}} collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs. Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> circulate air, and referencing {{the position of}} a building to the Sun. Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand side technologies.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were {{infected with the}} beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae into {{the central nervous system}} is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{important}} source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> circulate air.|$|E
25|$|This {{disease is}} {{considered}} to be a zoonosis (an infectious disease <b>that</b> is <b>naturally</b> transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans), with the exception of Leishmania tropica — which is often an anthroponotic disease (an infectious disease <b>that</b> is <b>naturally</b> transmissible from humans to vertebrate animals).|$|R

5|$|Slither.io is a massively {{multiplayer}} browser game {{developed by}} Steve Howse. Players control an avatar resembling a snake, which consumes multicolored pellets, both from other players and ones <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> spawn {{on the map}} in the game, to grow in size. The objective {{of the game is}} to grow the longest snake in the server. Slither.io is similar in concept to the popular 2015 web game Agar.io and is reminiscent of the classic arcade game Snake.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{models of}} {{naturally}} occurring disease and condition. Certain domestic and wild animals {{have a natural}} propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans. Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus. Certain breeds of dog suffer from narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition. Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> suffer from leprosy; as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture, armadillos are {{the primary source of}} bacilli used in leprosy vaccines.|$|E
5|$|The journal had {{an archaeological}} and {{historical}} focus, {{and in the}} late nineteenth century <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> meant that epigraphy (the study of inscriptions as writing rather than as literature) would be one of the principal subjects covered in its pages. Indeed, the Antiquary was the premier source of European scholarship on Indian epigraphy until the twentieth century and the official Indian government journal of epigraphy, the Epigraphia Indica, was published as a quarterly supplement to the Antiquary between 1892 and 1920.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{transfers}} naturally between organisms. Several natural mechanisms allow {{gene flow}} across species.

This is facilitated by transposons, retrotransposons, proviruses and other mobile genetic elements <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> translocate DNA to new loci in a genome. Movement occurs over an evolutionary time scale.|$|E

25|$|Some systems use Null Current systems (also {{sometimes}} called Null Flux systems). These use a coil that is wound {{so that it}} enters two opposing, alternating fields, so that the average flux in the loop is zero. When the vehicle is in the straight ahead position, no current flows, but any moves off-line create flux that generates a field <b>that</b> <b>naturally</b> pushes/pulls it back into line.|$|E

By most standards of measurements, gaur is the largest wild bovid alive today.
