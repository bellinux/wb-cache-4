5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part,</b> also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|The Andean condor is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. 2500 BCE onward, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the Andean condor was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The Andean condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the bones and organs of the Andean condor possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting, a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free.|$|E

25|$|Currently, S.rubra can be {{described}} as having five subspecies, though it is sometimes argued that the subspecies should be elevated to species rank in recognition of the species complex that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of. This division would yield S.alabamensis, S.gulfensis, S.jonesii, S.rubra sensu stricto, and S.wherryi. Others have argued that only some of these demand recognition at the species rank.|$|E

25|$|Suggestions {{that the}} Frisiavones were {{actually}} the Frisii {{center on the}} similarity in names, combined with the Roman classification of 'Lesser Frisii' {{to the west of}} the Zuiderzee and 'Greater Frisii' to the east of it (which provides a reason as to why the Frisii might have been known by two different names). However, Pliny's placement of the Frisiavones in northern Gaul is not near the known location of the Frisii, which is acceptable if the Frisavones are a separate people, but not if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of a greater Frisian tribe.|$|E

25|$|Although place {{cells are}} part of a non-sensory {{cortical}} system, their firing behavior is strongly correlated to sensory input. Place cells fire when an animal is located in parts of the environment known as place fields. These circuits may have important implications for memory, as they provide the spatial context for memories and past experiences. Like many other parts of the brain, place cell circuits are dynamic. They are constantly adjusting and remapping to suit the current location and experience of the brain. Place cells do not work alone to create visuospatial representation; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of a complex circuit that informs place awareness and place memory.|$|E
25|$|To Freud {{sexuality}} {{is composed of}} partial drives (i.e. the oral or the anal drives) each specified by a different erotogenic zone. At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), {{it is only in}} puberty that they become organized {{under the aegis of the}} genital organs. Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but 1) rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that drives are partial in that they only represent sexuality partially not in the sense that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the whole. Drives do not represent the reproductive function of sexuality but only the dimension of jouissance.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{may find}} that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of a lower {{socioeconomic}} status group in the United States {{than they were in}} their home country. Immigration research shows that it is rarely the poorest citizens of the sending countries that immigrate to the United States, simply because they cannot afford the associated costs. This is particularly true when they come from countries where the cost of living is not as high as in the United States. Individuals who may have held professional occupations in their country of origin may find themselves in low-paying jobs if their certifications are not recognized by the United States. When families migrate to the United States from a country with a patriarchal society, men in particular may experience a loss of status.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{clothing}} that the Crow People decorated with beads included robes, vests, pants, shirts, moccasins and {{various forms of}} celebratory and ceremonial gear. In addition to creating a connection with the land, from which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part,</b> the various shapes and colors reflected one's standing and achievements. For example, if a warrior were to slay, wound or disarm an enemy, he would return with a blackened face. The black color would then be incorporated in {{the clothing}} of that man, most likely in his war attire. A beaded robe, which was often given to a bride to be, could take over a year to produce and was usually created by the bride's mother-in-law or another female relative-in-law. These robes were often characterized {{by a series of}} parallel horizontal lines, usually consisting of light blue. The lines represented the young women's new role as a wife and mother; also the new bride was encouraged to wear the robe at the next ceremonial gathering to symbolize her addition and welcoming to a new family. In modern times the Crow still often decorate their clothing with intricate bead designs for powwow and everyday clothing.|$|E
25|$|Lika and Gorski Kotar {{are marked}} by several {{significant}} rivers draining north towards the Pannonian Basin. Those are the Kupa, tracing the northern boundary of the region, Dobra, Mrežnica and the Koranaforming travertine barriers and waterfalls before discharging into Kupa in area of Karlovac, as well as Una, {{in the eastern part}} of the region, at the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, there are losing streams such as Gacka, Krbava and Lika rivers, reflecting a high degree of karstification of the terrain in the region, resulting in increased permeability of soil and rocks. Ingress of water underground resulted in formation of subterranean watercourses and lakes. Probably the finest example of interaction of karst terrain and watercourses in the area are Plitvice Lakes16 interlinked lakes between Mala Kapela and Plješevica, through which Korana River flows. The area is abundant in travertine barriers, waterfalls and caves of biological origincreated through deposition of calcium carbonate through agency of moss, algae and aquatic bacteria. The Plitvice Lakes are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of one of three Croatia's national parks located in the Mountainous Croatia, along with Risnjak and Sjeverni Velebit.|$|E
