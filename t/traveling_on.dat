5|$|Greyhound Express routes are {{assigned}} new or refurbished buses that {{are equipped with}} Wi-Fi, power outlets, leather seats, and extra legroom. In many stations Greyhound Express customers {{can take advantage of}} dedicated waiting areas, separate from passengers <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> other Greyhound services or other carriers. Some stations also board passengers onto Greyhound Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the order in which the ticket was purchased, which means that passengers who bought their tickets earlier get to board the bus and choose their seats earlier.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{intention of}} the Metropolitan & St. John's Wood Railway was to run to underground north-east to Hampstead Village, and indeed this appeared on some maps.

5|$|Widerøe reintroduced direct {{flights to}} Oslo on 10 May 2010. Statoil started using {{scheduled}} services {{instead of their}} previous charter flights on 2 January 2011. This caused Widerøe {{to increase the number}} of direct flights to Oslo to three per day on 1 April 2011. Widerøe introduced irregular charter flights to Manchester in April 2012, largely targeting English tourists <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> holidays and Norwegian football patriots.|$|E
5|$|After {{construction}} of the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge was completed in late 1902, tolls were immediately charged along the one lane structure. However, unlike the other two bridges, the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge cost $0.22 (1902 USD). A person <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> foot {{did not have to}} pay to cross the structure. This decision was different compared to the other bridges, which made it separate. Another decision was that ministers were not tolled so they could better serve their communities. However, when one minister began to abuse the special privilege, he was charged $0.05 for crossing. The tollhouse for collection was in Milanville and was run by the Dexter family.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale (James A. Woods) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by {{returning}} her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min (Troy Baker), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal (Naveen Andrews), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.|$|E
5|$|Blue Streak {{service on}} Route 41 began on September 8, 1970, <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> local streets between Sand Point, Lake City and Northgate Mall, and {{proceeding}} onto Interstate 5 non-stop to Downtown Seattle. Blue Streak buses were given exclusive {{use of the}} Columbia and Cherry ramps on the Interstate 5 reversible express lanes, {{as well as a}} bus-only lane on 5th Avenue. Buses traveled primarily on 3rd Avenue through Downtown, heading northbound during morning inbound trips and southbound during afternoon outbound trips towards Northgate. Buses ran at a frequency of 7 to 15 minutes from 7a.m. to 7p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays. The trip between Northgate and downtown took an average of 15 minutes, and took near-full busloads on the first day. The 22 buses on Blue Streak service were initially colored red, but were later repainted blue to match the branding.|$|E
5|$|Casey had {{intended}} to come ashore {{on the first day}} of the landing at Lingayen Gulf in January 1945 but was delayed a day because the destroyer he was <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> had to escort a crippled transport. Despite enormous difficulties ASCOM was able to finish numerous projects on time and some ahead of schedule. On 13 February 1945, ASCOM was transferred to USASOS and redesignated the Luzon Base Section (LUBSEC). Casey then resumed his old post, now renamed Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific. For his services as commander of ASCOM, he was awarded the Legion of Merit. He was subsequently awarded a bronze oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal for his services as Chief Engineer, US Army Forces Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> Mars in 3-D with Curiosity.|$|E
5|$|US730 {{was created}} with the {{original}} United States Highways on November 11, 1926, <b>traveling</b> <b>on</b> the existing Columbia River Highway, established in 1917, from US30 in Umatilla to US410 south of Wallula. The Washington section of US730 {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1923 as a branch of State Road3, later becoming a branch of Primary State Highway3 (PSH3) in 1937. The highway was concurrent with US395 from 1937 until 1985, traveling from Cold Springs Junction to US410. US30 was moved to a new route bypassing Umatilla and Irrigon in 1946, allowing for US730 to be extended southwest to Boardman, later to an interchange with I-84.|$|E
