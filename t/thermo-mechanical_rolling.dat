40|$|Residual {{stresses}} in {{seamless steel}} tubes {{have a significant}} influence on the mechanical stability and reliability of industrial constructions. In this contribution, triaxial residual stresses in seamless rolled tubes with an outer diameter of 82 mm and a wall thickness of 9. 8 mm were analyzed at synchrotron source PETRA III at DESY in Hamburg using the HZG beamline HEMS (P 07) with a photon energy of 75 keV. The position-resolved measurements were performed using a conical-slit measurement technique with a spatial resolution {{in the direction of}} the X-ray beam of 0. 8 mm. The tubes were produced under dedicated thermal conditions resulting in complex microstructure and residual stress profiles across the tube walls. The (experimental) measurements allowed determining axial, tangential and radial residual stress profiles. The results reveal tensile stresses up to 150 MPa on the outer wall side and compressive stress of about - 120 MPa on inner wall side. The measurements document the importance of the cooling process control during the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>rolling,</b> which represents a key factor for the design of dedicated microstructure and residual stress levels in the tubes...|$|E
40|$|Micromagnetic NDT {{techniques}} {{like the}} measurement of the magnetic Barkhausen noise, the incremental permeability and the harmonic analysis of the tangential magnetic field allow deriving inspection procedures to online monitoring and control machinery parts and components in production processes in order to characterize mechanical properties like hardness, hardening depth, yield and tensile strength. These types of inspection procedures continuously were further developed {{in the last two}} decades so that today the forth generation of system hard and software is in industrial use. The application is in steel industry where steel sheets in hot-dip-galvanizing lines were annealed after cold rolling but also in heavy plate rolling mills where after <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>rolling</b> special textures and texture gradients can occur. An increasing number of applications are also to find in the machinery building industry and here especially in case of machinery parts of the car supplying industry. The contribution introduces in the methodology of the micromagnetic, multiparameter, microstructure and stress analysis (3 MA), which, however, only can be applied at ferromagnetic materials and describes the physical basics of the techniques. The applied technology is especially sensitive for mechanical property determination as the relevant microstructure is governing the material behavior under mechanical loads (strength and toughness) in a similar way as the magnetic behavior under magnetic loads, i. e. during the magnetization in a hysteresis loop. In different case studies the advantage to implement 3 MA into the industrial processes is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFracture {{properties}} {{of a mother}} plate for API grade X 100 line pipe were investigated using tensile notched bars, CT and SENB pre-cracked specimens. The material had an anisotropic plastic behaviour due to the <b>thermo-mechanical</b> control <b>rolling</b> process. In addition, anisotropic rupture properties were also observed. Specimens tested along the rolling direction were more ductile and more crack growth resistant than those tested along the long transverse direction. Unit cell calculations were used to show that this fracture behaviour {{is not related to}} plastic anisotropy. Assuming that fracture is controlled by internal necking between anisotropically spaced voids, a model combining GTN and Thomason models is proposed which enables describing rupture anisotropy. A modified phenomenological model is also proposed so as to reduce the computational cost...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the behavior of silicon nitride rolls in rolling copper wire. Experimental tests and FE-based simulations were conducted for this purpose. After running the experiments, several inspections were carried out to examine the surfaces of the used specimens. In order to furnish the final conclusions, experimental findings were compared to the outcomes of the simulations. The FE simulations predicted very low <b>thermo-mechanical</b> stresses. Hot <b>rolling</b> experiments showed considerable metallic adhesion on the surface of the ceramic rolls, which was significantly reduced by applying cooling lubricants. Rolling-contact experiments showed moderate wear rates when the proper lubrication was applied. Due to severe selective corrosion of silicon nitride, the same ex periments showed high wear rates when carried out in distilled water. The nature of adhesion between copper and silicon nitride was investigated through reaction experiments. Bulk ceramic materials with different sintering additives as well as synthesized pure secondary phase compositions were tested. Non-wetting behavior was observed between silicon nitride bulk ceramics and copper. The secondary phase samples also showed no significant reaction with copper...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Limitation on the {{capacity}} for a wide application of intermetallics from the Fe-Al system results fromtheir insufficient plasticity. It is a factor which inhibits further development of intermetallics as constructionalmaterials. Under this study, {{research has been conducted}} on {{the capacity}} for forming alloys based on intermetallicphases from the Fe-Al system, via thermo-mechanical processing. Design/methodology/approach: After casting and annealing, alloy specimens were subjected to axialsymmetriccompression in the Gleeble 3800 simulator in the range of 600 ÷ 1200 °C. In order to analyse theprocesses which take place during deformation, the specimens after deformation were intensely cooled withwater. Structural examination was carried out using light and electron microscopy. Findings: The capacity for alloys’ hot deformation and limited plasticity of an alloy in ambient temperaturehave been shown. In addition, the processes of structural reconstruction, which take place during and afterdeformation, have been detected. Practical implications: The research carried out enabled the understanding of the phenomena taking placeduring deformation and annealing of the investigated alloy. The results will constitute the basis for modellingthe structural changes. Originality/value: The results will be used to design the basis for a <b>thermo-mechanical</b> processing technologyvia <b>rolling</b> and inter-operational annealing of the investigated compound with an intermetallic Fe-Al phasematrix...|$|R
40|$|Low carbon {{bainitic}} steels microalloyed with Nb, Ti and V {{are widely}} used for the pipeline, construction and automobile industries because of their excellent combination of strength, toughness and weldability. Boron as another major alloying element has been also frequently used {{in this type of}} steels since the 1970 s. The purpose of adding boron is to improve the hardenability of the steel by promoting bainite formation. It has been realized that Boron can only be effective as a strengthening element when it is prevented from forming BN and/or Fe 23 (C, B) 6 precipitates. Therefore, Boron is always added together with other alloying elements which are stronger Nitride or Carbide formers, such as Ti and Nb. However, the formation of complex bainitic structures and the interaction with precipitates at industrial coiling temperature are not adequately understood. In this study, the effect of boron on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a low carbon Nb-B steel was studied by a hot compression test (50 % reduction at 850 °C) followed by quenching samples into a salt bath. The microstructures of the tested samples were examined through optical microscopy and SEM; and the mechanical properties of these samples were investigated by micro-hardness and shear punch tests. The results indicate that during <b>thermo-mechanical</b> controlled <b>rolling</b> (TCR), the final properties of the products not only depend on the applied deformation but also depend on the coiling temperature where phase transformation takes place. According to the investigation, two strengthening mechanisms are responsible for the strength of the steel at the coiling temperature: phase transformation and precipitation. Under optical microscopy, the microstructures of all specimens appear to be bainite in a temperature range from 350 °C to 600 °C without distinct differences. However, the SEM micrographs revealed that the microstructures at 550 °C are very different from the microstructures transformed at the other holding temperatures. Two strength peaks were observed at 350 °C and 550 °C in the temperature range studied. It is believed that the NbC precipitates are the main contributor to the peak strength observed at 550 °C because the kinetics of NbC is quite rapid at this temperature. The strength peak at 350 °C is mainly due to the harder bainitic phase, which formed at relatively lower temperature...|$|R
