25|$|Most of the time, ‘artificial’ {{tissue is}} grown from the patient’s own cells. However, when {{the damage is}} so extreme that it is {{impossible}} to use the patient's own cells, artificial <b>tissue</b> <b>cells</b> are grown. The difficulty is in finding a scaffold that the cells can grow and organize on. The characteristics of the scaffold must be that it is biocompatible, cells can adhere to the scaffold, mechanically strong and biodegradable. One successful scaffold is a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid.|$|E

25|$|Free {{testosterone}} (T) is transported {{into the}} cytoplasm of target <b>tissue</b> <b>cells,</b> {{where it can}} bind to the androgen receptor, or {{can be reduced to}} 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than testosterone, so that its androgenic potency is about 5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.|$|E
25|$|Adipose {{tissue and}} {{lactating}} mammary glands also take up glucose {{from the blood}} for conversion into triglycerides. This occurs {{in the same way}} as it does in the liver, except that these tissues do not release the triglycerides thus produced as VLDL into the blood. Adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>cells</b> store the triglycerides in their fat droplets, ultimately to release them again as free fatty acids and glycerol into the blood (as described above), when the plasma concentration of insulin is low, and that of glucagon and/or epinephrine is high. Mammary glands discharge the fat (as cream fat droplets) into the milk that they produce under the influence of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin.|$|E
25|$|The ovary is {{differentiated}} into {{a central}} part, the medulla of ovary, {{covered by a}} surface layer, the germinal epithelium. The immature ova originate from cells from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac. Once they have reached the gonadal ridge they are called oogonia. Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective <b>tissue</b> <b>cells</b> (pre-granulosa cells) In this way, the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed. The embryological origin of granulosa cells, on the other hand, remains controversial. Just as in the male, there is a gubernaculum in the female, which pulls it downward, albeit {{not as much as}} in males. The gubernaculum later becomes the proper ovarian ligament and the round ligament of the uterus.|$|E

25|$|The {{framework}} is formed by large collections of anatomical, physiological, and pathological data stored in digital format, typically by predictive simulations developed from these collections and by services intended to support {{researchers in the}} creation and maintenance of these models, {{as well as in}} the creation of end-user technologies to be used in the clinical practice. VPH models aim to integrate physiological processes across different length and time scales (multi-scale modelling). These models make possible the combination of patient-specific data with population-based representations. The objective is to develop a systemic approach which avoids a reductionist approach and seeks not to subdivide biological systems in any particular way by dimensional scale (body, organ, <b>tissue,</b> <b>cells,</b> molecules), by scientific discipline (biology, physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioengineering) or anatomical sub-system (cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, etc.).|$|E
2500|$|An average adult human {{contains}} about 0.7kg of phosphorus, about 85–90% in bones and {{teeth in the}} form of apatite, and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids (~1%). The phosphorus content increases from about 0.5 weight% in infancy to 0.65–1.1 weight% in adults. Average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about 0.4 g/L, about 70% of that is organic and 30% inorganic phosphates.

Polarity is anchored to tissues through organisers located at boundaries. We show how this intracellular partitioning-based framework can be applied to both plant and animal systems, allowing different processes to be placed in a common evolutionary and mechanistic context...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} an in vitro DNA amplification assay named the ligase chain reaction (LCR) for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis cryptic plasmid DNA in urine from men and women, in comparison with urethral swab culture in men and cervical swab culture in women. Methods 591 patients (394 men with urethritis and 197 female sex partners) attending a center for sexually transmitted diseases in northern Italy between January 1994 and January 1995 were enrolled in this study. A cervical swab was collected from women and a urethral swab from men for standard <b>tissue</b> <b>cell</b> culture. From each patient 20 mL of the first stream of the urine (FVU), taken at least 2 h after the last urination, were collected for LCR analysis. Discrepant results were further analyzed by direct fluorescence and a LCR with alternative primers. ResultsIn men the prevalence of C. trachomatis infection by urethral culture was 13. 45 % and, after resolution of discordant results, the LCR method performed on FVU showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 89. 4 %, 100 %, 100 % and 98. 2 %, respectively; the sensitivity of <b>tissue</b> <b>cell</b> culture was 92. 8 %. In female sex partners, the prevalence of C. trachomatis infection by cervical culture was 3. 04 %; LCR detected eight true positive samples, two more than <b>tissue</b> <b>cell</b> culture, and no false-negative results. ConclusionLCR analysis of FVU is a rapid, non-invasive technique and represents a good alternative to <b>tissue</b> <b>cell</b> culture. Further study is needed to investigate possible LCR inhibitors present in urine samples...|$|R
