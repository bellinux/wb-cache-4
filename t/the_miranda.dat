5|$|The Supreme Court granted certiorari to {{determine}} whether <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> custody analysis includes consideration of a juvenile suspect’s age. The American Civil Liberties Union, American Bar Association, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers were among the organizations that filed amicus briefs in support of J. D. B. The attorneys general of 30 states and 2 unincorporated territories filed an amicus brief in support of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new protections for newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E

5|$|Relative to {{the other}} Caracas municipalities, El Hatillo has the region's lowest crime rate. Data from 2003 shows that 53,555 crimes {{occurred}} within the five municipalities of Caracas, but only 418 (about 0.78%) took place within El Hatillo. El Hatillo's population is significantly {{lower than that of}} its sister municipalities; viewing 2003 crime data relative to 2001 census data, El Hatillo had an annual rate of 7.7 crimes for every one thousand citizens, while the average of the five Caracas municipalities was 19.4 for every one thousand citizens. The main police force in El Hatillo is the municipal police, sometimes referred to as Poli-Hatillo. Other police forces can also intervene in the municipality, including the Metropolitan Police, and <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> State Police.|$|E
5|$|WCSP-FM is {{the first}} radio station to {{broadcast}} audiotape of historical U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments, with announcers explaining the court decision {{at the end of}} the recording. The broadcasts of the Supreme Court arguments have provided listeners in the U.S. and Canada with the opportunity to hear spoken words during oral arguments for several of the Court's most influential cases, including the Texas v. Johnson argument over flag-burning in 1989, and <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> v. Arizona argument in 1966. In September 2010 the Supreme Court began releasing audio recordings of the week's oral arguments each Friday, thereby allowing C-SPAN Radio to broadcast a selection of current arguments. Prior to this arrangement, recordings of oral arguments were occasionally made available on a same-day basis, which C-SPAN would request in cases of high public interest.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{found in}} Harris v. New York, , that a {{confession}} obtained {{in violation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> standards may nonetheless be used for purposes of impeaching the defendant's testimony: that is, if the defendant takes the stand at trial and the prosecution wishes to introduce the defendant's confession as a prior inconsistent statement to attack the defendant's credibility, <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> holding will not prohibit this.|$|E

25|$|The Sixth Amendment (1791) {{provides}} several protections {{and rights}} {{to an individual}} accused of a crime. The accused {{has the right to}} a fair and speedy trial by a local and impartial jury. Likewise, a person has the right to a public trial. This right protects defendants from secret proceedings that might encourage abuse of the justice system, and serves to keep the public informed. This amendment also guarantees a right to legal counsel if accused of a crime, guarantees that the accused may require witnesses to attend the trial and testify {{in the presence of the}} accused, and guarantees the accused a right to know the charges against them. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that, with the Fifth Amendment, this amendment requires what has become known as <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> warning.|$|E
500|$|There was no {{good reason}} why the {{standard}} for invoking <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> {{right to remain silent}} and <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> right to counsel should differ.

"In sum, {{a suspect}} who has {{received}} and understood <b>the</b> <b>Miranda</b> warnings, {{and has not}} invoked his Miranda rights, waives {{the right to remain}} silent by making an uncoerced statement to the police.

500|$|Scalia {{strongly}} disfavored the Court's {{ruling in}} Miranda v.

Alito argued the decision shifted custody determination from a simple test to an inquiry that must account for individualized characteristics. Alito emphasized that age is not the only characteristic that may affect a subject under interrogation and that in future cases the court will be tasked with adding additional characteristics to custody determination or by [...] "arbitrarily distinguishing a suspect's age from other personal characteristics".|$|E
