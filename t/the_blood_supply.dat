5|$|After an apoplexy, the {{pressure}} inside the sella turcica rises, and surrounding {{structures such as}} the optic nerve and {{the contents of the}} cavernous sinus are compressed. The raised pressure further impairs <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> to the pituitary hormone-producing tissue, leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply.|$|E

30|$|In open myomectomy, {{temporary}} haemostatic occlusion of <b>the</b> uterine <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> {{was first}} described in 1932 using metal clamps [17] following the even earlier ligation of the uterine arteries [18]. This technique of total vascular occlusion of <b>the</b> uterine <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> is still recommended by some authors [19].|$|R
2500|$|The {{microscopic}} {{structural and}} functional {{unit of the}} kidney is the nephron. It processes <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supplied</b> to it via filtration, reabsorption, secretion and excretion; the consequence of those processes is the production of urine.|$|R
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, {{and the difference between}} this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With {{disruption of}} the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} a fast tissue {{and might be}} in {{supersaturated}} state in the early phase of decompression. It acts as a gas reservoir and feeds any local bubble which will grow. The bubble may just proceed through the capillaries to the venous side for another cycle, but may be trapped and will then grow in place, causing local restriction of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> and finally ischemia. This may develop into central neurological symptoms.|$|E

40|$|The {{rarity of}} hepatic {{infarction}} {{in the human}} being is commonly explained as due to <b>the</b> double <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> via <b>the</b> hepatic artery and the portal vein. This explanation cannot be accepted, because, if <b>the</b> arterial <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> alone is arrested <b>the</b> portal <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> does not protect the liver from infarction. The factor of importance is that <b>the</b> arterial <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> comes by three different routes {{and it is difficult}} to obstruct these collateral supplies simultaneously. Infarction of the liver can be caused by thrombosis or ligation of the main hepatic artery between the origin of the right gastric artery and the hilum of the liver, but the more common causes are infected emboli or polyarteritis nodosa; these presumably interfere not only with the main arterial supply but also with some of the collateral arterial supply...|$|R
50|$|Doctors and healers well {{understood}} the medicinal use {{of plants and}} herbs and were regularly consulted about menstruation, contraceptives, and abortion aids.

5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply.</b> The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery also plays a role.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E

5|$|The US FDA has {{approved}} two Chagas tests, including one approved in April 2010, and has published guidelines that recommend testing of all donated blood and tissue products. While these tests {{are not required}} in US, an estimated 75–90% of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> is currently tested for Chagas, including all units collected by the American Red Cross, which accounts for 40% of the U.S. blood supply. The Chagas Biovigilance Network reports current incidents of Chagas-positive blood products in the United States, as reported by labs using the screening test approved by the FDA in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of bright pink, very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the esophagus. <b>The</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> also twists around the esophagus, suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Other, more {{invasive}} procedures, {{also exist}} for larger bone defects including mobilization of the inferior alveolar nerve to allow placement of a fixture, onlay bone grafting using the iliac crest or another large source of bone and microvascular bone graft where <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> {{to the bone}} is transplanted with the source bone and reconnected to the local blood supply. The final decision about which bone grafting technique that is best {{is based on an}} assessment of the degree of vertical and horizontal bone loss that exists, each of which is classified into mild (2–3mm loss), moderate (4–6mm loss) or severe (greater than 6mm loss). Orthodontic extrusion or orthodontic implant site development can be used in selected cases for vertical/horizontal alveolar augmentation.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supply</b> to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E

40|$|On Day 10 of the {{oestrous cycle}} in pigs, after {{laparotomy}} noradrenaline (NA), methoxamine (α 1 -adrenomimetic, M), Prazosin (α 1 -adrenolytic, Pr) in total doses of 4 [*]μmol, and saline were infused (10 [*]min) into the superficial layer of mesovarium {{on both sides}} of the ovarian pedicle vasculature, close to <b>the</b> ovary. <b>Blood</b> flow in <b>the</b> ovarian artery, heart rate and progesterone (P 4) and androstenedione (A 4) secretion from the ovary and their concentrations in the ovarian venous effluent, as well as the concentrations of P 4 and A 4 in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>the</b> oviduct and the uterus, were determined. A significant increase of P 4 and A 4 secretion after NA and M infusion and increased concentrations of P 4 and A 4 in the ovarian venous effluent were found, but these changes did not influence the counter current transfer of hormones from the venous effluent into arterial <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>the</b> oviduct and the uterus. Infusion of Pr caused a significant decrease of P 4 and A 4 secretion and their concentrations in the ovarian venous effluent and significantly increased A 4 concentration in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>the</b> oviduct and uterus. The results indicate that stimulation of α 1 -adrenoceptors in the area of ovarian vasculature did not influence, whereas block of α 1 -adrenoceptors affected, the local concentration of steroid hormones in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>the</b> oviduct and the part of the uterus proximal to the ovary, despite the changes in the concentrations of steroid hormones in the ovarian effluent...|$|R
