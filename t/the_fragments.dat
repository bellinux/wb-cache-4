40|$|The {{traditional}} {{consensus that}} the New Testament Canon was formed {{by the end of}} the second century has been weakened by the results of modern studies. The traditional viewpoint now depends primarily upon the evidence of <b>the</b> Muratorian <b>Fragment.</b> Albert C. Sundberg, Jr., in his argument for a revision of the history of the Christian Canon, has called for the redating of <b>the</b> Muratorian <b>Fragment.</b> Through a careful analysis of <b>the</b> <b>Fragment's</b> traditional dating, and of its place within the history of the Canon, this study will confirm Sundberg's theory. The second century date of <b>the</b> <b>Fragment</b> is ultimately dependent upon the simple Latin phrase, nuperrime temporibus nostris, within a series of references to The Shepherd of Hermas. Sundberg has attempted to broaden the common interpretation of this phrase, but the commonly held interpretation is dubious in itself because of the known poor transcription and the suspected careless translation of <b>the</b> <b>Fragment,</b> and because <b>the</b> other references to The Shepherd are erroneous and late. No other references within <b>the</b> <b>Fragment</b> support a conclusive second century date. Within the history of the Christian Canon, <b>the</b> <b>Fragment,</b> if traditionally dated, is a serious anomaly in terms of concept, form, and contents. There is nothing to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>Fragment</b> from <b>the</b> fifteen undisputed Catalogues which appear in the fourth and early fifth century, and nothing to suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Fragment</b> is earlier. Indeed, there are numerous elements within <b>the</b> <b>Fragment</b> that are unparalleled in the West or are exceptional until later. The cumulative evidence is too siqnificant to be dismissed because of one, most likely incorrect, association of Hermas with Pius of Rome. <b>The</b> Muratorian <b>Fragment</b> redated as a fourth century Eastern document, possibly originating from Palestine or western Syria around 375, is a more reasonable conclusion of the evidence available. </p...|$|R

5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Wales fired unopposed {{until she}} began a port turn at 05:57, when Prinz Eugen took her under fire. After Hood {{exploded}} at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the starboard side of the compass platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> from the shell's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on the starboard side of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, conservative Christians who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential to salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of <b>the</b> <b>fragments</b> suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E
5|$|The Stone has {{suffered}} repeated desecrations and damage {{over the course}} of time. It {{is said to have been}} struck and smashed to pieces by a stone fired from a catapult during the Umayyad Caliphate's siege of Mecca in 683. <b>The</b> <b>fragments</b> were rejoined by Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr using a silver ligament. In January 930, it was stolen by the Qarmatians, who carried the Black Stone away to their base in Hajar (modern Eastern Arabia). According to Ottoman historian Qutb al-Din, writing in 1857, the Qarmatian leader Abu Tahir al-Jannabi set the Black Stone up in his own mosque, the Masjid al-Dirar, with the intention of redirecting the hajj away from Mecca. However, this failed, and pilgrims continued to venerate the spot where the Black Stone had been.|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} a hitherto unpublished prose fragment by Swedish author Viktor Rydberg (1828 – 1895). <b>The</b> <b>fragment,</b> {{in accordance with}} Rydberg’s notes entitled “En besynnerlig bibliotekarie” (“A Peculiar Librarian”), is here published for the first time, together with a list of variants in the original manuscript, which itself is preserved in the collections of the Royal Library in Stockholm. Following upon an initial overview of <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>fragment’s</b> place in Rydberg’s production, the setting and theme of <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> are compared to a contemporary and more famous work by the same writer, the romantic novella Singoalla. Romantisk Sagodigt, first published in 1857. Similarities between the two texts are presented in order to cast further light upon the imaginary world of Rydberg {{during one of his}} most productive periods as an author. In a concluding discussion, the citings of literary works in <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> are taken into consideration. The mentioning of the popular German author August Lafontaine’s adventure novels is, among other things, used to interpret <b>the</b> <b>fragment’s</b> title figure as obsolete and foolish. This is, in fact, his “peculiarity”, and <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> can accordingly be read as a satire...|$|R
5|$|Before King {{published}} {{the discovery of}} <b>the</b> <b>fragment,</b> she asked AnneMarie Luijendijk and fellow papyrologist Roger S. Bagnall of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University to review <b>the</b> <b>fragment.</b> They determined that it was likely authentic, both because of the skills {{which would have been}} required to forge <b>the</b> <b>fragment,</b> and because <b>the</b> papyrus seemed to have been in a collection for many years without having been announced. Luijendijk and Bagnall both doubted that the text was forged. Giovanni Maria Vian the editor of L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, dismissed <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> as fake. In a television documentary about <b>the</b> <b>fragment</b> that was presented on the Smithsonian Channel in September 2012, Professor Alberto Camplani of Sapienza University of Rome suggested that he considered it more likely to be authentic.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} issue of fragmentation and homogenization of forest communities in urban areas. The habitat fragmentation could be natural or anthropogenic.

In <b>the</b> <b>fragmented</b> habitat, a decrease in the number of species can take place with some delay.
