In 1996, Filipino National Artist Napoleon Abueva created <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> marble {{sculpture}} Three Women Weaving the Filipino Flag at the UP Diliman to commemorate Agoncillo {{and the other two}} women who assisted her in their important task. Renowned Filipino painter Fernando Amorsolo painted the historical sewing and is nationally known as The Making of the Philippine flag.|$|E
5|$|Time, wear, {{and severe}} weather {{conditions}} led to many identified problems, {{the single most}} pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed {{to take into account}} how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.|$|E

25|$|Wright {{had planned}} in the {{beginning}} to have the house blend into its natural settings in rural Pennsylvania. In doing this, he limited his color choices to two colors, light ochre for <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> his signature Cherokee red for the steel.|$|E
25|$|Ultimate failure {{leading to}} {{collapse}} {{can be caused}} by crushing the concrete, which occurs when compressive stresses exceed its strength, by yielding or failure of the rebar when bending or shear stresses exceed the strength of the reinforcement, or by bond failure between <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> the rebar.|$|E
25|$|When {{the cement}} paste within the {{concrete}} hardens, this {{conforms to the}} surface details of the steel, permitting any stress to be transmitted efficiently between the different materials. Usually steel bars are roughened or corrugated to further improve the bond or cohesion between <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> steel.|$|E

25|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{can fail}} due to inadequate strength, leading to mechanical failure, or {{due to a}} reduction in its durability. Corrosion and freeze/thaw cycles may damage poorly designed or constructed reinforced concrete. When rebar corrodes, the oxidation products (rust) expand and tends to flake, cracking <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> unbonding the rebar from the concrete. Typical mechanisms leading to durability problems are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with the quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> steel, it was initially envisioned that the bridge would be dismantled and replaced by a newly designed footbridge. Due to complaints about this course of action, plans for its removal were not finalised until 2012. Construction of a replacement structure, designed for walking, cycling and fishing, was scheduled for 2015, the centenary of the opening of the old bridge.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of concrete produces water vapor and carbon dioxide, which may further react with the metals in the melt, oxidizing the metals, {{and reducing the}} gases to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The {{decomposition of}} <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> volatilization of its alkali components is an endothermic process. Aerosols released during this phase are primarily based on concrete-originating silicon compounds; otherwise volatile elements, for example, caesium, can be bound in nonvolatile insoluble silicates.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy {{commissioned}} {{a study of}} Fallingwater’s structural integrity. Structural engineers analyzed {{the movement of the}} cantilevers over time and conducted radar studies of the cantilevers to locate and quantify the reinforcement. These showed that the contractor had indeed added reinforcement over Wright's plan; nevertheless, the cantilevers were still insufficiently reinforced. An architecture firm was hired to fix the problem. Both <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> its steel reinforcement were close to their failure limits. As a result, in 1997, temporary girders were installed beneath the cantilevers to carry their weight.|$|E
25|$|The {{reinforcement}} in a RC structure, {{such as a}} steel bar, has {{to undergo}} the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete {{in order to prevent}} discontinuity, slip or separation of the two materials under load. Maintaining composite action requires transfer of load between <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the tensile stress in the reinforcing bar along its length, this load transfer is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops {{in the vicinity of the}} steel-concrete interface.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{surfaces}} (specifically, Portland cement concrete) {{are created}} using a concrete mix of Portland cement, coarse aggregate, sand and water. In virtually all modern mixes {{there will also}} be various admixtures added to increase workability, reduce the required amount of water, mitigate harmful chemical reactions and for other beneficial purposes. In many cases {{there will also be}} Portland cement substitutes added, such as fly ash. This can reduce the cost of <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> improve its physical properties. The material is applied in a freshly mixed slurry, and worked mechanically to compact the interior and force some of the cement slurry to the surface to produce a smoother, denser surface free from honeycombing. The water allows the mix to combine molecularly in a chemical reaction called hydration.|$|E

25|$|As {{stated in}} his biography, in a match in 1994, Arn {{was thrown into}} the ring ropes. The top rope broke from the turnbuckle, but {{he was able to}} land on his feet. Six months later, the same event {{happened}} again, but this time he landed full-force on to <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> hit his head, neck, and upper back. He never took time off to heal. As time passed, with no down time, the injuries worsened. In his biography, Anderson states that the first sign of problems was, during a match, his left arm suddenly went numb and unresponsive. Later on, they found a rib, possibly torn away from the spine during the accident, was popping in and out of joint, causing shoulder discomfort and weakness.|$|E
25|$|The Germans were {{apprehensive}} of a British {{attempt to}} exploit the victory over Group Wytachaete at Messines, with an advance to the Tower Hamlets (Bassevillebeek) spur beyond {{the north end of}} the ridge. Since early 1917 there had three German defensive positions behind the front line. The Albrechtstellung ran from Bixschoote in the north, behind Pilckem Ridge and across the Gheluvelt Plateau. The Wilhemstellung began at Langemarck, ran south to Gravenstafel then crossed the Gheluvelt Plateau to Zandvoorde to the east of Messines Ridge. The Flandernstellung (Flanders Position) had been built earlier in the year, along Passchendaele Ridge and across the Gheluvelt Plateau behind Polygon Wood and in front of Becelaere, across the Menin road and south to the Lys river. Because of the flat ground and high water table hundreds of pillboxes and blockhouses rather than deep dugouts, had been built above ground and camouflaged with mud and turf. The many stone farmhouses dotted around had also been fortified; from two to forty men could be accommodated in <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> steel shelters, immune to anything smaller than a hit by an 8-inch shell.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} <b>the</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>and</b> the corium melt. Free and chemically bound water is {{released from the}} concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the corium mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the corium and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the corium. The oxide phase, in which the nonvolatile fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten zircaloy, iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of zirconium dioxide and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the corium penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the metal layer is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete. Decomposition of concrete and volatilization of the alkali metal compounds consumes {{a substantial amount of}} heat.|$|E
