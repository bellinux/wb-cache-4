5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> <b>of</b> white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and {{there were to be}} no African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E

After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The demon praises Rama, who purified the demon by his sword. The demon urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth. At last, the demon transforms into a radiant divine being as {{he was telling the truth}} and plunges into the sky.|$|E

He wanders through the wilderness, acquiring supporters along the way and eventually ends up encamping in Kangaba, from where musters his forces to destroy the Sosso scouts' forward base. He then seeks to undermine the power of Sumanguru with his allies, Tabon and Wagadou by taking a sacred relic cart to his enemies Niger, Sangaran, Labe, forcing these villages to submit to his rule. He then cuts off Sumanguru's resources by plundering gold {{from the city of}} Djenne; following that, he then takes over the Niger River and destroys all of Sumanguru's military camps in the region, acquiring the allegiance of Sumanguru's former vassals Fakoli and Mema. Sundjata finally assaults the enemy base in Koumbi Saleh, killing Sumanguru once and for all and establishing his sovereignty over the Malian Empire.|$|E
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> <b>of</b> yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Indiana Jones {{narrowly}} escapes <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> <b>of</b> Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai, China. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and {{the nightclub}} singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai {{on an airplane}} that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While {{the three of them}} sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute out, and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by Shiva to retrieve the sacred sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone {{may be one of the}} five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.|$|E
5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> <b>of</b> Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had been dealt with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E

25|$|Another {{divergence}} from Samkhya is {{that while}} the Samkhya holds that knowledge is the means to liberation, Patañjali's Yoga insists on the methods of concentration and active striving.

25|$|It is said by {{some that}} Zia-Junejo rift was {{encouraged}} by late Mahboob-ul-Haq and Junejo's insistence on signing Geneva pact without deciding the composition of next government of Afghanistan before Soviet withdrawal.
