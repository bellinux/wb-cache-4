5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgery.</b> During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., who was in charge of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgery,</b> as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity.|$|E

50|$|A {{thoracotomy}} {{is a major}} surgical procedure—it is {{the first}} step in many <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgeries</b> including lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung cancer—and as such requires general anesthesia with endotracheal tube insertion and mechanical ventilation.|$|R
40|$|There may be {{significant}} difference between measurement of end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure (PetCO 2) and arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure (PaCO 2) during one-lung ventilation with low tidal volume for <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure (PtcCO 2) monitoring can be used continuously to evaluate PaCO 2 in a noninvasive fashion. In this study, we compared the accuracy between PetCO 2 and PtcCO 2 in predicting PaCO 2 during prolonged one-lung ventilation with low tidal volume for <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Eighteen adult patients who underwent <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgeries</b> with one-lung ventilation longer than two hours were included in this study. Their PetCO 2, PtcCO 2, and PaCO 2 values were collected at five time points before and during one-lung ventilation. Agreement among measures was evaluated by Bland-Altman analysis. Ninety sample sets were obtained. The bias and precision when PtcCO 2 and PaCO 2 were compared were 4. 1 ± 6. 5 mmHg during two-lung ventilation and 2. 9 ± 6. 1 mmHg during one-lung ventilation. Those when PetCO 2 and PaCO 2 were compared were - 11. 8 ± 6. 4 mmHg during two-lung ventilation and - 11. 8 ± 4. 9 mmHg during one-lung ventilation. The differences between PtcCO 2 and PaCO 2 were significantly lower than those between PetCO 2 and PaCO 2 at all five time-points (p < 0. 05). PtcCO 2 monitoring was more accurate for predicting PaCO 2 levels during prolonged one-lung ventilation with low tidal volume for patients undergoing <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgeries...</b>|$|R
25|$|Types of {{specialised}} hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, {{and hospitals}} {{for dealing with}} specific medical needs such as psychiatric problems (see psychiatric hospital), certain disease categories such as cardiac, oncology, or orthopedic problems, and so forth. In Germany specialised hospitals are called Fachkrankenhaus; an example is Fachkrankenhaus Coswig (<b>thoracic</b> <b>surgery).</b>|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic (and especially surgical) pathology {{that deals}} with diagnosis and characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of the lungs and thoracic pleura. Diagnostic specimens are often obtained via bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, or video-assisted <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgery.</b> These tests can be necessary to diagnose between infection, inflammation, or fibrotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Prof. Udekwu {{was born}} in Enugu-Agidi, Anambra State, Nigeria.

25|$|Economic demand {{influences}} {{the location of}} particular specialties. For example, more orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry {{are more likely to}} practice in high income areas. Small populations can usually only support primary care. A large population is needed to support specialists who treat rare diseases. Some specialties need to cooperate and thus locate near each other, such as hematology, oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgery</b> and pulmonology.|$|E

25|$|Archibald's work in {{investigating}} the disease of pancreatitis {{led to the}} development of the sphincterotomy, a procedure still in use today. His earlier experience with tuberculosis prompted him to look beyond neurosurgery into other areas of the body, and his work in fighting tuberculosis led to the refining of <b>thoracic</b> <b>surgery.</b> When World War I began, Archibald went with the Third Canadian General Hospital to France, where he was able to apply his experience in combating the disease to the patients he encountered on the war front. The surgeon was also greatly interested in the education of new surgeons, and believed that the standard of doctor education had been declining, leaving incapable surgeons to perform procedures. Archibald returned to McGill University, this time as a staff member in the Department of Surgery, and revitalised it following almost thirty years of stagnation. In 1929, he served as a member of the first Royal College of Surgeons of Canada Examining Board in Surgery, and after becoming President of the American Surgical Association in 1935, made a speech entitled Higher Degrees in the Profession of Surgery, triggering the formation of the American Board of Surgery. He was also considered a key influence in the surgical education of Norman Bethune, however he reportedly disapproved of Bethune and his actions. Additionally, he was a mentor to Wilder Penfield, another famous physician who worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital.|$|E

[...] The doctors and nurses laughed, and Giordano, a liberal Democrat, replied, [...] "Today, Mr. President, we are all Republicans." [...] Reagan's post-operative course was complicated by fever, which was treated with multiple antibiotics. The surgery was routine enough that they predicted Reagan would be able to leave the hospital in two weeks and return to work at the Oval Office within a month.|$|E
