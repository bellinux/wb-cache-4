Leaving US 101, SR 198 {{passes through the}} Priest Valley, climbs the Diablo Range as a two-lane road and crosses over an unnamed pass. It then descends along Warthan Canyon {{to the town of}} Coalinga in the agricultural Central Valley, where it briefly runs concurrently with SR 33. On both sides of Coalinga the road passes through the enormous Coalinga Oil Field.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Division was {{assigned}} to III Corps of the Fourth United States Army, and transferred to Longview, Washington, in August 1941 to participate in tactical maneuvers. Following this training, the division moved back to Fort Ord, California, where it was located when the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor caused the United States to declare war. The formation proceeded almost immediately to San Jose, California, arriving 11 December 1941 to help protect the west coast and allay civilian fears of invasion. The 53rd Infantry Regiment {{was removed from the}} 7th Division and replaced with the 159th Infantry Regiment, newly deployed from the California Army National Guard. For the early parts of the war, the division participated mainly in construction and training roles. Subordinate units also practiced boat loading at the Monterey Wharf and amphibious assault techniques at <b>the</b> <b>Salinas</b> River in California.|$|E

50|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>salina’s</b> sub-sealevel position, seepage of {{seawater}} into <b>the</b> <b>salina</b> is continuous year round. During {{the winter}} wet season, {{the amount of}} water coming into <b>the</b> <b>salina</b> is substantially increased by the influx of meteoric groundwater. Hutt Lagoon has a Mediterranean climate; high evaporation rates (2150 - 2400 mm) are characteristic of the summer. There is moderate rainfall in the winter. These factors combine to form a setting within which salt is deposited seasonally and the rates and style of precipitation follow a balance between influx of water and removal by evaporation. During the summer about 95% of <b>the</b> <b>salina</b> surface is a dry salt flat.|$|R

25|$|A tragedy {{occurred}} {{early in}} Carlos Salinas's life. On 18 December 1951, {{when he was}} three years old, he, his older brother Raúl, then five, and an eight-year-old friend were playing and <b>the</b> <b>Salinas</b> family's twelve-year-old maid, Manuela, was shot. It was never determined which of the three boys pulled the trigger and the incident was declared an accident; it was given newspaper coverage in Excélsior at the time. A judge blamed <b>the</b> <b>Salinas</b> parents for leaving a loaded weapon accessible to their small children. <b>The</b> <b>Salinas</b> family {{did not know the}} last name of their 12-year-old maid Manuela—only that she came from San Pedro Atzcapotzaltongo—and it is unknown whether her family ever claimed her body. They were also exonerated with the assistance of Gilberto Bolaños Cacho, maternal uncle of legendary Mexican comedian Chespirito. He has not commented publicly on this tragic early childhood incident.|$|E

40|$|The depositional {{environment}} of the A and B units of <b>the</b> Upper Silurian <b>Salina</b> Formation in <b>the</b> Appalachian and Michigan basins has been a contentious issue for the past century. In large measure, {{this is due to}} the fact that exposures of <b>the</b> <b>Salina</b> Formation are rare and that many published models are based only on data obtained from drill cores. Also, most studies have concentrated on the basins themselves and have largely ignored the intervening area across the positive high of the Algonquin arch. The Domtar Construction Materials gypsum deposit is situated in the Niagara peninsula, on the eastern flank of the Algonquin arch. Stratigraphic correlation from drill cores and underground mapping indicates that the mined gypsum bed is <b>the</b> <b>Salina</b> Formation B anhydrite unit. This is overlain by shales and gypsiferous rocks of <b>the</b> <b>Salina</b> Formation B unit and underlain by shales, dolomite, dolomitic shales, and gypsum of <b>the</b> <b>Salina</b> A- 2 unit, dolomitic shales of <b>the</b> <b>Salina</b> A- 1 unit, and dolomite of the Guelph Formation.

The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E
