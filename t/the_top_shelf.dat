[...] and she feels the biggest advantages are in sports where her prestigious height has afforded her advantages. She stated, “I feel I have a presence on the court.

Another advantage Taylor possesses, as she has expressed, is because of her larger stature then other players she has what she describes [...] "a bird's eye view of everything" [...] on the court. Literally she can see over other players. Taylor's height has also {{made it difficult for}} other players to guard and block her and are generally unable to overpower her.|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{is known}} {{only from a}} single manuscript, which is {{estimated}} to date from close to AD 1000, in which it appears with other works. The Beowulf manuscript {{is known as the}} Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is [...] "British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV" [...] because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's holdings in the Cotton library {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own library classification systems. [...] "Cotton Vitellius A.XV" [...] translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (<b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>shelf)</b> of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a tutor to his ward, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.|$|E
5000|$|The Gor novels {{have been}} criticized for their focus on {{relationships}} between dominant men and submissive women, the latter often in positions of slavery. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy has stated that the first several books are [...] "passable exercises" [...] of Edgar Rice Burroughs style fiction while [...] "later volumes degenerate into extremely sexist, sadomasochistic pornography involving the ritual humiliation of women, and as a result have caused widespread offence". Science fiction/fantasy author Michael Moorcock has suggested that the Gor novels should be placed on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>shelves</b> of bookstores, saying, [...] "I’m not for censorship but I am for strategies which marginalize stuff that works to objectify women and suggests women enjoy being beaten." ...|$|R

Even the water-color drawings failed to interest me in my present frame of mind. I observed languidly that they were most of them portraits of ladies--fair idols, no doubt, of the Major's facile adoration--and I cared to notice no more.

5000|$|Oink! proved {{somewhat}} controversial, {{with various}} conservative groups and {{a chain of}} newsagents branding it offensive and unsuitable for children. A notably controversial item was the story [...] "Janice and John and the Parachute Jump", a parody of the Janet and John readers which appeared in issue 7, which prompted an official complaint to the Press Council. The Council ruled in Oink's favour (and the strip was subsequently reprinted in the comic alongside an editorial about the affair) but the negative publicity resulted in some newsagents, including WHSmith, placing it on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>shelves</b> away from other comics, thus damaging its sales potential to its young target audience.

60|$|Here the {{collection}} of books exhibited a greater variety. The volumes were smaller, and were not so carefully arranged as on the lower shelves. Some were bound in cloth, some were only protected by paper covers; one or two had fallen, and lay flat on the shelves. Here and there I saw empty spaces from which books had been removed and not replaced. In short, there was no discouraging uniformity in these higher regions of the book-case. <b>The</b> untidy <b>top</b> <b>shelves</b> looked suggestive of some lucky accident which might unexpectedly lead the way to success.
