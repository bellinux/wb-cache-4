5|$|During the {{movement}} for independence (1818), it was mainly the British who formed <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Navy, {{under the command of}} Lord Cochrane.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, after {{a series}} of struggles about {{multinational}} nitrate interests, Chilean President José Manuel Balmaceda refused to sign the national budget passed by <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> National Congress. Balmaceda then dissolved Congress. The dissolution split both <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Army and Navy, with some forces remaining loyal to Congress and others to the President. An armed conflict ensued after a mutiny by the navy, which at that time was docked at Valparaíso.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chilean</b> Civil War (1891), {{rather than}} calming the naval ambitions of Chile, {{escalated}} them. In that conflict, <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Navy {{played a significant}} role on the congressional side against the president and the army. The resulting victory of the congressional side and subsequent presidency of Admiral Jorge Montt led to a large increase in prestige and consequent funding for the navy. Argentine naval units assisted failed revolts in Argentina, but the continuing acrimony with and naval acquisitions of Chile meant this had little effect.|$|E
50|$|Here come <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> (1886).|$|R
50|$|Suarez' Corps reached Chorrillos and {{attacked}} <b>the</b> incoming <b>Chilean</b> forces. Sotomayor's division, along with Urriola's brigade attacked the town; meanwhile Barcelo marched to Morro Solar {{in order to}} take Panizo's position. The Peruvians garrisoned in the town, so <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> had to fight in every house {{in order to take}} it. To make this objective easier, <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> set Chorrillos on fire. Being surrounded, Suarez withdrew to Barranco, part of the Miraflores defensive line.|$|R
50|$|For <b>the</b> <b>Chileans,</b> <b>the</b> {{goal of the}} Tarapacá {{campaign}} was to secure the department and to hold it as ransom until war reparations were paid once the war ended.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chilean</b> SERNAGEOMIN {{published}} a volcano alert rating for Lastarria. It {{is considered the}} 45th most dangerous volcano in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Viajes por Europa, África, y América 1849. A {{description}} and observations while travelling {{as a representative}} of <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> government to learn more about educational systems around the world.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos {{is one of}} 44 Holocene epoch volcanoes {{located in}} central Chile and Argentina. It is {{included}} within the Southern Volcanic Zone, the most active section of <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Andes. The date of its last known eruption is not known with precision, though it {{took place during the}} Holocene.|$|E
50|$|The Peruvian {{casualty}} {{levels in}} the battle were so high {{because many of the}} wounded Peruvian prisoners were shot by <b>the</b> Chileans.  <b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> ransacked buildings, started fires and attacked Peruvian consulates amongst other crimes.  <b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> justified these acts saying they were seeking revenge for explosions caused by Peruvians in a few <b>Chilean</b> mines during <b>the</b> battle that caused some casualties.|$|R
50|$|Thus the Battle of Arica began. <b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> struck first, attacking fort Ciudadela {{where the}} battalions of Grandaderos (Tacna) and Artesanos  (Arica) fought fiercely. The old Colonel Justo Arias y Araguez died in combat, while Corporal Alfredo Maldonado {{was killed in}} the {{explosion}} of a powder keg, that killed Peruvian, as well as ten <b>Chilean</b> soldiers. <b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> responded by issuing the command to take no prisoners.|$|R
50|$|The {{point is}} named after First Lieutenant Emiliano Figueroa González, {{navigation}} officer aboard the transport ship Angamos during <b>the</b> 1950-51 <b>Chilean</b> Antarctic Expedition, and the rocks are named respectively after Sargeant Dovizio, member of <b>the</b> 1948-49 <b>Chilean</b> Antarctic Expedition; Second Lieutenant Mario Ibar, {{in charge of the}} marines onboard of the frigate Iquique during <b>the</b> 1946-47 <b>Chilean</b> Antarctic Expedition; Captain Federico Bonert, second in command of the transport ship Angamos during <b>the</b> 1950-51 <b>Chilean</b> Antarctic Expedition; and Sergeant Rosales, coppersmith in the frigate Iquique during <b>the</b> 1947 <b>Chilean</b> Antarctic Expedition.|$|R
5|$|Cocktails {{similar to}} the pisco sour include <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Piscola and the Peruvian Algarrobina Cocktail. Piscola is made by mixing pisco with cola. The Algarrobina Cocktail is made from pisco, {{condensed}} milk, and sap from the Peruvian algarroba tree. Another similar cocktail, from the United States, is the Californian pisco punch, originally made with Peruvian pisco, pineapples, and lemon.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, {{disagreements}} over guano and nitrate-rich lands led Chile {{to start the}} War of the Pacific with Bolivia and Peru. The ex-Peruvian turret ship Huáscar, captured by the Chileans at the Battle of Angamos, attacked the Peruvians at Arica on 27 February 1880, fighting an inconclusive duel with Manco Cápac. The Peruvian failed in her attempt to ram <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> ironclad, although the Huascars captain {{was killed in the}} engagement. <b>The</b> <b>Chilean</b> fleet continued to blockade Arica as the army closed in on the city from the rear. Manco Cápac hit the schooner Covadondga on blockade duty on 6 June, but the monitor was scuttled to prevent her capture when the city fell the following day.|$|E
5|$|In 1922 Gaudí was commissioned, by the Franciscan Padre Angélico Aranda, to {{construct}} a church dedicated to the Assumption in <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> city of Rancagua. Gaudí apologised {{and said that he}} was occupied exclusively with the Sagrada Família, but sent some sketches of the Assumption chapel which he had designed for the apse of the Sagrada Família, which more or less coincided with what Padre Aranda had asked for. Unfortunately this project was not carried out, though there are currently plans by <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> architect Christian Matzner to take up the project. The President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, has announced that building will begin in 2015, with an expected completion in 2017 and at a cost of $7million. Once completed it will become the first of Gaudí's works to be constructed in the Americas.|$|E
50|$|Salazar's guerrillas {{occupied}} the roofs and walls, attacking <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> {{in their last}} positions inside the church.|$|R
50|$|By 12:30 am, <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> had {{depleted}} their {{ammunition and}} the attack faded. The Allies saw {{the opportunity and}} a general charge was ordered. All of Castro Pinto’s infantry attacked Barceló, while the Peruvian II and III divisions along with the Aroma and Alianza battalions attacked Amengual. With almost no bullets, <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> had to fall back with several casualties. The Atacama Regiment alone lost almost half of its personnel.|$|R
50|$|Chile {{launched}} an amphibious operation at Pisagua on 2 November, successfully pushing the Allies inland and isolating the strongholds of Arica and Iquique. <b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> continued {{moving into the}} Peruvian department seeking water supplies to support the beach head of Pisagua. When {{the news of the}} invasion reached Tacna, the Allied headquarters decided that another army led by General Daza would encounter Buendía and reject <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> to <b>the</b> sea.|$|R
5|$|On 14 February 1879, Chilean forces entered Antofagasta to {{the welcome}} {{of most of}} the local population, {{beginning}} the War of the Pacific against Bolivia and Peru. Many locals enlisted in <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Army, and Morales enlisted as a soldier to avenge her husband by disguising herself as a man and slipping in unnoticed amid the frenzy of patriotism.|$|E
5|$|The Central Volcanic Zone is thinly {{inhabited}} {{and most}} volcanoes are not under reconnaissance, but Irruputuncu is watched by <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> SERNAGEOMIN geologic service. The possibility of geothermal energy production from the volcano has been examined.|$|E
5|$|Thus in 1868 Jaussen could recover {{only a few}} tablets, {{with three}} more {{acquired}} by Captain Gana of <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> corvette O'Higgins in 1870. In the 1950s Barthel found the decayed remains {{of half a dozen}} tablets in caves, in the context of burials. However, no glyphs could be salvaged.|$|E
50|$|On 24 February 1880 {{approximately}} 11,000 men in nineteen ships {{protected by}} the warships Blanco Encalada, Toro and the Magallanes and two torpedo boats sailed from Pisagua and arrived off Punta Coles, near Pacocha, Ilo on 26 February 1880. The landing took several days and occurred without resistance The Peruvian commander, Lizardo Montero, refused to try to drive <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> from <b>the</b> beachhead, as <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> had expected.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> renamed <b>the</b> ship O'Higgins after Bernardo O'Higgins, the South American Independence {{leader and}} first Chilean head of state.|$|R
50|$|Determined {{to secure}} the supply lines needed for the {{invasion}} of Perú, <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> committed every possible unit to hunt down Huáscar.|$|R
5|$|To {{the west}} of <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Andes are an early group of eruptions, dated from the Oligocene and the Early Miocene (33.3–20.2mya). The scale of the eruptive events that {{produced}} these features remains unclear. Further east, in the actual range, are huge numbers of eruptions. Between 15.3 and 6.4mya, widespread volcanism took place, followed by extensive folding; this process then repeated itself from 18.4 to 13.7 mya during the Miocene. Beginning 6.4 mya <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> Andes were quiet, though {{whether or not this}} quiet period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown. Central Chilean volcanoes became active once again around 2.5mya, and have erupted almost continuously since.|$|E
5|$|After a {{month at}} Valparaíso, Yorktown took on {{refugees}} from the American, Spanish, and Italian legations in mid-January 1892. She got underway on the 19th and arrived at Callao, Peru, on the 25th. While Yorktown lay anchored there, tension between the United States and Chile relaxed and the crisis abated, and <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> later government provided compensation {{for the families of}} the American sailors that were killed.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to {{the east coast of}} the United States in late 1914, Vermont resumed her normal routine of training cruises and exercises. The ship was temporarily placed in reserve from 1 October to 21 November 1916, though after {{returning to}} service she supported a Marine expeditionary force sent to Haiti. This duty lasted from 29 November to 5 February 1917, after which she took part in battle training in Cuban waters. Vermont arrived back in Norfolk on 29 March before proceeding to Philadelphia for maintenance on 4 April. While she was in dry dock, the United States entered World War I be declaring war on Germany. Vermonts overhaul was completed on 26 August, and she was assigned as a training ship for engine room personnel, based at Hampton Roads. On 28 May 1918, the remains of <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> ambassador to the United States were brought aboard the ship. The US ambassador to Chile, Joseph Hooker Shea, came aboard the ship on 3 June, and Vermont departed Norfolk that day. She transited the Panama Canal on 10 June, stopped briefly in Tongoy, Chile on the 24th, and arrived in Valparaiso three days later. Admiral William B. Caperton and Ambassador Shea escorted <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> ambassadors remains ashore.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> largely {{exhausted}} their ammunition {{trying to}} repel this new attack. The Peruvians managed {{to set the}} church roof on fire.|$|R
50|$|A {{few days}} after the Battle of Chacabuco Chilean revolutionaries {{commissioned}} their first ship, the old US-smuggler ship Eagle, once captured by the Spaniards and now in the hand of <b>the</b> <b>Chileans.</b> Eagle was first renamed Águila and then later Pueyrredón. <b>The</b> regular <b>Chilean</b> navy began to grow steadily and soon was able to man the East Indiaman Windham, which arrived at Valparaíso in March 1818, and Cumberland, which arrived at Valparaíso in May 1818. <b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> had bought both in England and renamed and Lautaro and San Martín. In July 1818 the Columbus, a US-origin 18-gun brig, reached Valparaíso and was bought and renamed Araucano.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese {{residents}} who betrayed their adoptive country and {{joined forces with}} Chilean army also fought alongside <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> in <b>the</b> battles of San Juan-Chorrillos and Miraflores, {{and there was also}} rioting and looting by non-Chinese workers in the coastal cities. As Heraclio Bonilla has observed; Peruvian oligarchs soon came to fear the popular clashes more than <b>the</b> <b>Chileans,</b> and this was an important reason why they sued for peace.

5|$|Although the Argentine and Chilean navies possessed {{insignificant}} {{naval forces}} in the 1860s, with zero and five warships, respectively, Argentina's concern over a strong Brazilian Navy and <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> war against Spain caused them to add capable warships to their fleets in the 1870s. During this time, diplomatic relations between Argentina and Chile soured due to conflicting boundary claims, particularly in Patagonia. By {{the beginning of the}} 1880s, after the War of the Pacific, <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> government possessed possibly the strongest navy in the Americas. They planned to add to it with an 1887 appropriation for one battleship, two protected cruisers, and two torpedo gunboats. Argentina responded a year later with an order for two battleships of its own. The naval arms race unfolded over the next several years, with each country buying and ordering vessels that were slightly better than the previous ship, but the Argentines eventually pulled ahead with the acquisition of multiple Garibaldi-class cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Aries {{peaked at}} {{number one on}} the Billboard Latin Pop Albums chart and stayed at the top for 19 weeks. It ended 1993 as the second best-selling Latin pop album in the US after Romance. In Argentina, the album peaked at number two on the album chart and was {{certified}} diamond by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers for sales of 500,000 copies. Elsewhere in South America, the album peaked at number one on <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> albums chart and was certified platinum in Colombia. Aries sold over two million copies worldwide through 2000.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th and the {{beginning}} of the 20th centuries, Chile was engaged in an intense naval competition with its neighbor Argentina. This ended peacefully in 1902, but less than a decade later Argentina responded to Brazil's order for two dreadnoughts with two of its own. <b>The</b> <b>Chilean</b> congress responded by allocating money for its own dreadnoughts, which were ordered from the United Kingdom despite a strong push from the American government for the contracts, probably due to Chile's traditionally strong ties with the British.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Chileans</b> had an {{advantage}} with the Belgian Comblain rifle, which was rear loaded allowing a superior rate of fire, and the cavalry had Winchester carbines.|$|R
5000|$|Chile and the Dominican Republic were relegated down to Americas Zone Group II for {{the next}} year. <b>The</b> <b>Chileans</b> placed equal third, while the Dominicans placed equal seventh.|$|R
