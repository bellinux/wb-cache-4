5|$|Because Lichfield {{had been}} {{established}} by the papacy, any change in its status required papal assent. Coenwulf's first embassy to Leo III in 797 about demoting Lichfield did not succeed, mainly because Leo seems to have resented the implied criticism of his predecessor Hadrian I, who had approved the elevation of Lichfield. Coenwulf's embassy bore {{a letter to the}} pope <b>that</b> <b>asked</b> for papal advice on how to resolve the problems surrounding Lichfield and Canterbury. The letter reminded the papacy of Pope Gregory the Great's old scheme to have two metropolitans in Britain, one in the north and one in the south, with the southern one being based in London. The letter implied that Coenwulf was asking for Æthelhard's metropolitan see to be moved to London. The same embassy carried a letter from Æthelhard also, which has not survived. The pope, however, did not agree with the embassy. The papal reply to Coenwulf stated that the southern archbishopric must remain at Canterbury, as well as excommunicated Eadberht and authorised his expulsion from Kent if he persisted in keeping Æthelhard from Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Crispi’s good {{intentions}} {{got lost in}} the outcry for strong measures. In the three weeks of uncertainty before the government was formed, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti’s ban on the use of firearms. In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government building were burned as well as flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished. Eleven people were killed on December 10, 1893, in Giardinello after a rally <b>that</b> <b>asked</b> for the abolition of taxes on food and disbandment of the local field guards (guardie campestri). The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. On December 17, 1893, many people were wounded when troops fired on a manifestation in Monreale. Another 11 protestors were killed in Lercara Friddi on December 25. On January 1, 1894, 20 people were killed and many wounded in Gibellina and Pietraperzia. On January 2, there two dead in Belmonte Mezzagno and the next day 18 dead and many wounded in Marineo. Two days after, on January 5, thirteen dead and many wounded closed the series in Santa Caterina.|$|E

40|$|Currently {{there is}} no {{established}} way to measure expenditure {{in the context of}} a general purpose survey. Therefore NatCen's Questionnaire Development Testing (QDT) Hub, working in collaboration with the Institute for Fiscal Studies and collaborators from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, are looking at how best to measure expenditure in a social survey context. This report provides findings from the cognitive testing of four different question formats: 1. A 'one-shot' question i. e. a single question asking 'How much did you spend on everything in the last month?' 2. A 'two-part' question i. e. two questions, one <b>that</b> <b>asks</b> about spending on essentials and one <b>that</b> <b>asks</b> about spending on everything else. 3. A 'breakdown' question i. e. <b>that</b> <b>asks</b> respondents to say how much they spend on each item on a list of common types of expenditure 4. And 'income minus surplus' question <b>that</b> <b>asks</b> respondents to work out how much money they receive per month and how much of that income remains unspent. It is possible that spending can be calculated from this information. This project is funded by the Nuffield Foundation...|$|R
40|$|Contact {{hypersensitivity}} (CHS) {{is a form}} of delayed-type hypersensitivity {{triggered by}} the response to reactive haptens (sensitization) and subsequent challenge (elicitation). Here, we show <b>that</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 promotes CHS and <b>that</b> suppression of <b>ASK</b> 1 during the elicitation phase is sufficient to attenuate CHS. ASK 1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited impaired 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) -induced CHS. The suppression of ASK 1 activity during the elicitation phase through a chemical genetic approach or a specific inhibitory compound significantly reduced the CHS response to a level similar to <b>that</b> observed in <b>ASK</b> 1 KO mice. The reduced response was concomitant with the strong inhibition of production of IL- 17, a cytokine that {{plays an important role in}} CHS and other inflammatory diseases, from sensitized lymph node cells. These results suggest <b>that</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 is relevant to the overall CHS response during the elicitation phase and <b>that</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 may be a promising therapeutic target for allergic contact dermatitis and other IL- 17 -related inflammatory diseases...|$|R

25|$|A {{sample of}} 240 {{undergraduate}} business students was randomly split into forty teams (half {{of the teams}} were 4-person and half 8-person) which {{were randomly assigned to}} either a collocated or distributed setting.

They were to find and discuss alternatives, and at the end submit their alternative with rationale. Collocated groups worked at a table together, while distributed groups did the same task at separate computers that allowed for electronic, networked communication. The same technology was used by both collocated and distributed groups.|$|E

Unfortunately, he wrote the letter at a time that a number of his most faithful supporters were on leave for illness or wounds. Bragg's critics, including William J. Hardee, interpreted the letter as having an implied secondary questionhad Bragg lost the confidence of his senior commanders? Leonidas Polk did not reply to the implied question, but he wrote directly to his friend, Jefferson Davis, recommending that Bragg be replaced.|$|E

25|$|Don DeLillo, {{who rose}} to {{literary}} prominence {{with the publication}} of his 1985 novel, White Noise, a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling as a piece of comic social criticism, began his writing career in 1971 with Americana. He is listed by Harold Bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary American writers, in the company of such figures as Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Thomas Pynchon. His 1997 novel Underworld chronicles American life through and immediately after the Cold War and is usually considered his masterpiece. It was also the runner-up in a survey <b>that</b> <b>asked</b> writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years. Among his other important novels are Libra (1988), Mao II (1991) and Falling Man (2007).|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies have}} {{observed}} {{the effects of}} volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and lower in depression, anxiety, and somatization. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% {{of those who did}} not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study <b>that</b> <b>asked</b> participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.|$|E
