500|$|Because {{the series}} uses few {{standing}} sets, set designer Jerry Wanek {{often had to}} construct entirely new sets for each episode. Outside elements had an influence on some designs, with the bar in the hotel of [...] "Playthings" [...] being an homage to The Shining. A Wisconsin native, Wanek was able to incorporate personal items into the motel set for the Wisconsin-based episode [...] "Nightshifter"; because polka {{is part of the}} state's culture, he used posters from his father's old polka band, as well as photos of his nephews and Wisconsin landmarks. Due to [...] "Tall Tales"'s atmosphere, that episode's motel was designed to be [...] "over the top". Wanek noted, [...] "They were in this really odd-looking motel that had crystal chandeliers and carved beds, turquoise stove and refrigerator, and <b>this</b> <b>wonderful</b> period linoleum on the floor. I thought it really matched the tempo and emotion of the show." [...] At times, however, Wanek was able to reuse old sets.

500|$|In 1989, Myles {{took the}} project to Beacon Communications, an {{independent}} film company established that year by Tom Rosenberg, a former real estate developer, and Armyan Bernstein, a former television journalist turned screenwriter and producer. Clement and La Frenais traveled to Los Angeles to discuss the project with Alan Parker, {{and gave him a}} copy of the novel. Upon reading the novel, Parker was intrigued by its dialogue and humor, stating, [...] "The book was all dialogue with very little description, but by the use of <b>this</b> <b>wonderful</b> language, and almost nothing but language, in a few lines [...] was able to make his characters as vivid and strong as a dozen pages of purple Joycian prose."

Randall-Cutler's The First Film Company and Parker's Dirty Hands Productions, both based in England, were enlisted as production companies. Parker and the producers later attended the 1990 Cannes Film Festival to secure worldwide pre-sales.|$|E
