40|$|Development drivage of Tailgate 21 {{commenced}} in May 2000. Difficult roof conditions {{associated with}} the splitting of the G ply coal away from the immediate seam into the roof were anticipated. 4. 1 m Coupled Bolts {{were considered to be}} a potentially cheaper and more effective reinforcement system than long tendon cables for these conditions. Coupled bolts have been used very effectively in similar conditions at Alliance Colliery. Coupled bolts were trialed {{for the first time at}} Oaky No. 1 between 18 - 19 c/t TG 21 where the interburden thickness between the roof and the G Ply seam split was between 1. 4 m and 4 m. Indicators of slight horizontal stress (slight guttering) were observed in headings and cut <b>throughs</b> inbye of 10 c/t. Horizontal stress conditions became significant inbye of 23 c/t with buckling roof conditions occurring in cut <b>throughs.</b> Coupled bolts have been used in cut <b>throughs</b> to control roof deterioration.
