5|$|For the {{production}} of the show, Gaga enlisted choreographer Richard Jackson and together with him and the Haus of Gaga, they came up with ideas regarding how the show should be constructed and what music should be performed. They also had <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> co-mingle all the different ideas to make a single, coherent show. For the choreography, which encompassed all the stages present, Jackson had to employ a different approach, so that the audience could see the performance from every angle.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and a seasoned attorney, was trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get his company into the booming video game market. In April, he learned {{of the success of}} Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) invites Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to a {{corporate}} retreat, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles, for moral support. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) employs method acting for her Janis Joplin role, which Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) quickly takes advantage of. After Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is diagnosed with diabetes, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) attempts <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> dissuade Tracy from eating sugary food.|$|E
5|$|Riders {{entered the}} science {{laboratory}} of Dr. Bruce Banner with many televisions showing {{the story of}} the Hulk. Bruce tries <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reverse the effects, which the guests are about to take part in. While walking through the lab they encountered items including the generator, the gamma core and the towers of power. Riders were also able to watch the roller coaster through large holes in the walls as well as listen to the ride as it does a number of passes.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright and co-written by Jill Condon and Amy Toomin. The idea for Kudrow's character Phoebe becoming a surrogate mother coincided with the actress' real-time pregnancy. The producers wanted <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> use the pregnancy in a narrative for the fourth season and designated the task to the writers. Ribisi and Rupp reprised their recurring roles of Frank Jr. and Alice respectively which was initially difficult as both had filming commitments.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. Appel was looking for new locales to put Bart and {{thought it would be}} funny to have him work at a burlesque house. The problem was <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> put such a house in Springfield, which was solved with the bit with the toy airplane. There were a dozen different possible names for the Burlesque house, some of which were raunchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons {{was to build}} thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving sides {{were more likely to}} deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.|$|E
5|$|When casting for {{the role}} of Dorothy, Warner Bros. {{declined}} to audition any actresses younger than the age of 30; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced the studio to audition his client, who was only 22 at the time. O'Neill auditioned {{for the role}}, albeit hesitantly, not wanting to perform any nude scenes. O'Neill got the role and Mulligan agreed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make the film work without blatant nudity.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archer is {{confined}} in a Cargo bay, and the aliens are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no currency or valuable materials. They set-off {{to find the}} vault themselves, leaving Krem and Archer to transfer the loot. Archer sees Tucker and sends him to the launch-bay to retrieve the Ferengi's hypospray. Doing so, Tucker revives Sub-Commander T'Pol, and they try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> stop the Ferengi. She assumes the gas-machine was intentionally placed on the surface as a 'Trojan Horse'. In Sickbay, {{three of the four}} Ferengi search for the non-existent vault, and T'Pol uses a PADD to distract and then start an argument between them.|$|E

It is the first installment in the Clock Tower series. The story follows orphan Jennifer Simpson soon after she is adopted by the Barrows family along with other orphaned girls. With the introduction of Scissorman, the game's antagonist, {{one of the other}} children is killed. Jennifer must then explore the Barrows Mansion <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> escape while evading Scissorman, leading to one of the game's multiple endings. Clock Tower utlizes a point and click interface with the player controlling a cursor to direct Jennifer's actions.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{showcase}} the PlayStation Portable's capabilities, {{the team had}} to develop a download system that could provide the game with future downloadable content, which included new tracks, music and ships. In addition, Burrows realised that new downloadable content {{had the potential to}} bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. In order to achieve this, the team had <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files. The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable; in which a dummy file would be used on a web-based Java application.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee was <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because {{the two types of}} uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{battle was}} bloody, but was decided when Li Shimin {{and a part}} of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment, {{planting}} the Tang banners in full view of both armies. Possibly coupled {{with the arrival of the}} flanking Tang cavalry, this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army: trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs, 3,000 Xia soldiers fell in the field or the subsequent pursuit, but more than 50,000 were taken prisoner. These included Dou Jiande himself, who was wounded and captured while trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> cross the Yellow River.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} community made repeated unsuccessful attempts {{to end the}} fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by some European Community members for the Western European Union to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed an arms embargo {{on all of the}} Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under Security Council Resolution 713, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and have <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons {{to turn it into}} a smokeasy. They do a roaring trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E
