5|$|The smog {{event of}} 1966 {{was preceded by}} two other major smog episodes in New York City: one in November 1953, and one in January–February 1963. Using {{statistical}} analysis that compares <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> during periods of smog with <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> {{during the same time}} in other years, medical scientists led by Leonard Greenburg were able to determine that excess deaths occurred during those smogs, from which it can be inferred that the smog caused or contributed to those deaths. An estimated 220–240 deaths were caused by the six-day 1953 smog, and an estimated 300–405 deaths were caused by the two-week 1963 smog. Other episodes of smog had occurred in the city prior to 1966, but were not accompanied by significant excess deaths.|$|E

5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia urged senior {{officials}} in Dhaka and coastal districts {{to prepare for}} the storm. Officials in Chittagong asked that all 24ships be moved out of the harbor and river channel. In coastal areas, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm. Winds destroyed bamboo huts, uprooted trees, and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the Bay of Bengal. Torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages, forcing thousands to evacuate. Heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of Dhaka, inundating streets, which caused a shutdown of electricity and interrupting public transportation. One death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern Bhola Island. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150men sank near Cox's Bazar; only 11 of them were known to have survived. An additional eight fishing boats transporting 60people was reported missing off of Barisal Division. By November15, 47fishing vessels were still unaccounted for. A navy motor boat also sunk near Kutubdia, though its six crew members swam ashore. In the aftermath of the storm, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>deaths</b> in Bangladesh rose to 49.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} how climate change affects blood vessel-related heart disease and hypertension and to estimate the associated economic damage. In this paper, both the panel data model and the contingent valuation method (CVM) approaches are applied. The empirical results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from cardiovascular diseases would be increased by 0. 226 % as the variation in temperature increases by 1 %. More importantly, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> from cardiovascular diseases would be increased by 1. 2 % to 4. 1 % under alternative IPCC climate change scenarios. The results from the CVM approach show that each person would be willing to pay US$ 51 to US$ 97 per year in order to avoid the increase in the mortality rate of cardiovascular diseases caused by climate change...|$|R
