5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E

60|$|The cottage was {{so small}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> quite lost in the large garden all round it. There was a ground-floor and a floor above it--and that was all.|$|R
25|$|Local names {{recorded}} by Jerdon include Nalanchi (Telugu), Wannatikuruvi (Tamil, Washerman bird), Kalchuri (Hindi) and Paan kiriththaa (Sinhala). The genus name indicates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> similar to Saxicola, the genus of the pied bushchat, a bird {{often found in}} similar habitats.|$|E
25|$|The logo itself, {{featuring}} their mascot, Sarge, gritting {{his teeth}} is also army olive green, {{a mix of}} yellow and beige, white, fleshish pinky-orange, black, and red. The name Battalion, emblazoned on their uniform is pure red, and is created in a way <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> three-dimensional.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in lightly used {{wilderness}} areas, {{it is best}} {{to replace}} anything that was moved while preparing the fire site, and scatter anything that was gathered, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as natural as possible. Make certain that anything that was in or near the fire is cool first.|$|E
50|$|A less {{successful}} work was his £102,000 sculpture of Southampton FC chairman Ted Bates. This was removed {{a week after}} unveiling, due to fans' complaints <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> nothing like Bates.|$|R
60|$|Sir Henry {{laid his}} hand upon my arm, and remarked <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> {{as though we}} were going to meet with a warm reception. Something in his tone {{attracted}} Infadoos' attention.|$|R

25|$|Jaceron or Pearl purl {{is similar}} to buillion, but with a much wider piece of metal which has been shaped (rounded) prior to purling it, such <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like a string of pearl-like beads when couched down between the wraps of metal. Lizerine is a similar thread that has a flat {{appearance}} having not been shaped prior to purling.|$|E
25|$|Mirror box therapy uses {{a mirror}} box, or a {{stand-alone}} mirror, {{to create a}} reflection of the normal limb such that the patient thinks they are looking at the affected limb. Movement of this reflected normal limb is then performed so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> to the patient as though they are performing movement with the affected limb (although it will be pain free due to the fact it is a normal limb being reflected).|$|E
25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Yosemite Valley from a {{distance}} similar to the first view Lafayette Bunnell had {{in the winter of}} 1850. At the time he knew nothing about the valley, just <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> intriguing.|$|R

60|$|Every thing was, however, on {{so small}} a scale, and so {{scrupulously}} neat and pretty, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> {{more like a}} toy village than one built for the every-day residence of real men.|$|R
25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a {{time base}} generator {{to produce a}} smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The time base is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves so rapidly <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like a solid line. The return signal is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the time base. For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear on the display. The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale on the display.|$|E
25|$|A week later, Jake {{leaves to}} go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> as if a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since {{returning}} from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction ("Oh, Doctor Jesus"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares ("Vendors' Trio"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay, she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her {{what would happen if}} there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her, and he promises that she will never have to be afraid again ("I Loves You, Porgy").|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} has {{overlapping}} features so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like that the actors are ghost-like, appearing and disappearing.

Actors include Robert Patrick as Kenny's father, Greg Trock as Kenny, Will Estes as the grieving friend (young Meat Loaf), Joshua Diaz as the childhood iteration of Meat Loaf, and an unidentified model as [...] "The Beauty on the Edge of Town".|$|E

500|$|Nomura created Squall's gunblade {{with silver}} accessories. The weapon is a sword with {{components}} of a revolver, sending vibrations through the blade when triggered; this inflicts additional damage if the player presses the R1 trigger on the controller as Squall strikes an enemy. Although the weapon {{was intended as a}} novel way for players to control weapons in battle, Nomura said he feels (in retrospect) <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> odd. Additionally, he felt {{it was very difficult to}} master. Square's Hiroki Chiba said that his favorite moment in the Final Fantasy franchise was when Squall and Rinoa embrace in space due to the use of Faye Wong's [...] "Eyes On Me" [...] music in the background and having to work every frame to make it work.|$|E
