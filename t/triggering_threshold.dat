5000|$|Observing {{high speed}} signals, {{especially}} non-repetitive signals, with a conventional CRO is difficult, due to non-stable or changing <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold</b> {{which makes it}} hard to [...] "freeze" [...] the waveform on the screen. This often requires the room to be darkened or a special viewing hood to be placed over the face of the display tube. To aid in viewing such signals, special oscilloscopes have borrowed from night vision technology, employing a microchannel plate electron multiplier behind the tube face to amplify faint beam currents.|$|E
5000|$|When {{one or more}} of the {{automatic}} sprinkler heads is triggered, it opens allowing the air in the piping to vent from that sprinkler. Each sprinkler operates independently, as its temperature rises above its <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold.</b> As the air pressure in the piping drops, the pressure differential across the dry pipe valve changes, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flow from sprinklers, needed to control the fire, is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers. In regions using NFPA 13 regulations, the time it takes water to reach the hydraulically remote sprinkler from the time that sprinkler is activated is limited to a maximum of 60 seconds. In industry practice, this is known as the [...] "Maximum Time of Water Delivery". The maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced, depending on the hazard classification of the area protected by the sprinkler system.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{comprehensive}} investigation {{of the influence of}} current transformer (CT) saturation on restricted earth fault (REF) protection during power transformer magnetization inrush are presented. Since the inrush current during switch-on of unloaded power transformer is stochastic, its values are obtained by: (i) laboratory measurements and (ii) calculations based on the input data obtained by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. To make a detailed assessment of the current transformer performance the uncertain input data for the CT model were obtained by applying the MC method. In this way, different levels of remanent flux in CT core are taken into consideration. By the generated CT secondary currents, the algorithm for REF protection based on phase comparison in time domain is tested. On the basis of the obtained results, a method of adjustment of the <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold</b> in order to ensure safe operation during transients, and thereby improve the algorithm security, has been proposed. The obtained results indicate that power transformer REF protection would be enhanced by using the proposed adjustment of <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold</b> in the algorithm which is based on phase comparison in time domain...|$|E

To calculate the response functions of SNO, we have used the latest theoretical values of the {{cross section of the}} neutrino-deuteron CC process.

30|$|The {{inflammation}} {{theory was}} developed in gerontology (Franceschi et al. 2000, 2007) and is mainly based on clinical data. The starting point for this theory was the empirical observation that a systemic inflammation {{is often associated with}} aging (inflammaging) and the onset of chronic and degenerative diseases, {{as well as with the}} acceleration of death probability. According to Baylis et al. (2013), inflammaging derives from a cumulative lifetime exposure to antigenic load. In particular, each time the immune system reacts to aggression, it also produces irreversible cellular damage to tissues and organs, which once a <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold</b> has been reached, takes on a chronic proinflammatory state. This, in turn, has been shown to increase susceptibility to age-related diseases/disabilities.|$|E

30|$|The results {{indicate}} that P-waves from the Tohoku-Oki earthquake most likely triggered seismicity in Izu, the Noto peninsula, the Kii peninsula, and western Shikoku. In these regions, the dynamic strain changes by the initial P-waves are {{of the order of}} 10 − 8 to 10 − 7, while Miyazawa (2011) shows that values exceeding 10 − 6 seem to be necessary for the triggering of earthquakes by surface waves. This suggests that the events detected triggered by P-waves may not be usual earthquakes, but seismic events with other mechanisms such as volcanic source and fluid related fracture. Otherwise, there may be the possibility of an overestima-tion of the <b>triggering</b> <b>threshold</b> for tectonic earthquakes in the previous study.|$|E

30|$|The {{severity}} of job loss and persistent labor market weakness {{during and after}} the recession of 2007 – 09 resulted in an unprecedented expansion of UI benefit availability. Between mid- 2008 and late 2009, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program was slowly phased in. It initially provided for 13 additional weeks of benefits in July 2008. As listed in Table[*] 1, additional benefit tiers (based on <b>trigger</b> <b>thresholds)</b> were added in December 2008 and November 2009. From that latter date until late 2012, the combined benefits availability through four EUC tiers remained at 53 weeks. In conjunction with normal UI benefit durations of 26 weeks and a maximum of 20 weeks through the EB program, the maximum duration of available UI benefits during this EUC program peak was 99 weeks. Table[*] 1 also lists the subsequent legislative changes that raised the unemployment <b>trigger</b> <b>thresholds</b> in May 2012 and scaled back maximum EUC durations slightly in September (through changes in three of the four tiers). These provisions remained in place through the termination of the program at the end of 2013.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} lead {{contamination}} in topsoils and stream sediments of public access areas in a largely urban UK catchment. It compares severity of contamination with accepted <b>trigger</b> <b>thresholds,</b> examines spatial patterns relative to urban and industrial development, and explores potential mobility of lead using ‘plant available’: total lead ratios. Total and ‘plant available’ lead concentrations, organic content and pH were determined on 298 topsoil and 54 stream sediment samples using standard laboratory procedures. At the lowest total lead <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold,</b> approximately {{two thirds of}} topsoil and one third of stream sediment samples were contaminated. For ‘plant available’ lead the proportions were somewhat lower. The spatial pattern was characterised by ‘hot spot’ contamination, with highest values occurring in central and southern parts of the catchment which have a long urban and industrial history. Potential lead mobility is greatest in rural western and northern parts of the catchment where the lead fractions are probably derived from pedological alteration and weathering of soil parent materials. Conversely, in the urban and industrial areas, much of the lead probably consists of less mobile particulate forms. The implications of these findings for assessment, monitoring and management of contaminated areas are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{detection}} efficiency to neutrons {{of a small}} prototype of the KLOE Pb-scintillating fiber calorimeter has been measured at the neutron beam facility of The Svedberg Laboratory, TSL, Uppsala, in the kinetic energy range 5 - 175 MeV. The measurement of the neutron {{detection efficiency}} of a NE 110 scintillator provided a reference calibration. At the lowest <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold,</b> the overall calorimeter efficiency ranges from 40 % to 50 %. This value largely exceeds the estimated 8 - 16 % expected if the response were proportional only to the scintillator equivalent thickness. A detailed simulation of the calorimeter and of the TSL beamline has been performed with the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. The simulated response of the detector to neutrons is presented, {{as well as a}} first data Monte Carlo comparison. The results show an overall neutron efficiency of about 50 %, when no <b>trigger</b> <b>threshold</b> is applied. The reasons of such an efficiency enhancement, in comparison with the typical scintillator-based neutron counters, are explained, opening the road to a novel neutron detector. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
