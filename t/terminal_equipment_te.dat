Third-generation wireless systems, known as IMT- 2000 within the ITU, offer opportunities to support a wide range of multimedia services. Packet data services will {{play a major role in}} these new multimedia services. A key component of packetized data services is to ensure end-to-end QoS requirements through efficient management of the networkâ€™s resources. In this article we present an overview of radio resource scheduling schemes including architecture, radio interface protocol, and interactions in a wideband CDMA environment. We then present an example of QoS architecture followed by a discussion on end-to-end provisioning and interworking from wireless to fixed networks...|$|E

The ATT is an expansion card for the IBM PC and compatibles, which implements a number of functions supported by ATM <b>Terminal</b> <b>Equipment</b> (<b>TE).</b> The ATT, being the first component to be implemented for such purposes, can emulate a variety of traffic sources; furthermore, it can receive, store, and analyze traffic coming from an ATM network. A major feature of the ATT {{is that it is}} highly configurable and {{can be used as a}} Terminal Equipment in various networks, thus serving as a testing tool for a wide range of network equipment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-This paper {{presents}} a simulation tool used to dem-onstrate {{the effects of}} 3 rd generation wireless network access on IP-based multimedia applications. In 3 rd generation wireless networks like, e. g., the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), complex control and transport mechanisms influence the link quality for a given application, while the ap-plication itself influences the control mechanisms by generating load on the wireless link. To {{study the effects of}} such a dynamic system on the user-perceived Quality of Service (QoS) of a real-time multimedia application it is necessary to simulate the wire-less link in real-time. Our tool allows to interface standard IP-based multimedia applications with an UMTS-specific link simulator. The system comprises essential layer 2 and 3 protocol functionality of the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) for <b>Terminal</b> <b>Equipment</b> (<b>TE)</b> and Base Station (BS). We motivate and describe the concept, system architecture and implementation in terms of timing, QoS mapping, packet- and circuit-switched (CS) services integration, and physical link parameters.
