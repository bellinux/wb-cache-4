5000|$|On January 20, 1922, the Capitol Commission {{requested}} Goodhue {{to consult}} with Dr. Hartley Burr Alexander, of the University of Nebraska's department of philosophy, [...] "to work out the inscriptions to be used on the Capitol Building." [...] In addition to the inscriptions, Alexander began {{to work closely with}} Goodhue and Lawrie on the themes of the exterior sculptures. When Goodhue died in 1924, Alexander feared that the thematic development in future portions of the capitol would be inconsistent with the established schemes. He therefore wrote an overarching <b>thematic</b> <b>program,</b> [...] "Nebraska State Capitol: Synopsis of Decorations and Inscriptions," [...] in July 1926. Alexander's synopsis thus served as a guide for the remaining interior and exterior decorations, and Alexander was bestowed with the title of Thematic Consultant.|$|E
5000|$|The Gatherin {{program was}} founded by John Lair, former {{producer}} of the National Barn Dance, who founded the Renfro Valley Barn Dance and {{what would become the}} Renfro Valley Entertainment Center around it in 1939.

The Gatherin was, and is, a <b>thematic</b> <b>program.</b> The original concept of the show was to recreate the atmosphere of the pioneer [...] "getherins" [...] which were held in Renfro Valley [...] "in the days of long ago." [...] At the start, CBS wanted a Sunday morning companion program to the popular Saturday night Renfro Valley Barn Dance which would not be strictly a religious program, but would fit the Sunday morning format of the time. The [...] "Gatherin" [...] was John Lairs answer to this. During this time, both shows were headquartered at WHAS in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} new methods to deal with big data is a common theme in most {{scientific}} fields, although its definition tends to vary with the context. Statistical ideas are {{an essential part of}} this, and as a partial response, a <b>thematic</b> <b>program</b> on statistical inference, learning, and models in big data was held in 2015 in Canada, under {{the general direction of the}} Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute, with major funding from, and most activities located at, the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences.
