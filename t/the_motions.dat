5|$|The first civilization {{known to}} have a {{functional}} theory of the planets were the Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia {{in the first and}} second millennia BC. The oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, a 7th-century BC copy of a list of observations of <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the planet Venus, that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC. The MUL.APIN is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the 7th century BC that lays out <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the Sun, Moon, and planets {{over the course of the}} year. The Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology. The Enuma anu enlil, written during the Neo-Assyrian period in the 7th century BC, comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the planets. Venus, Mercury, and the outer planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn were all identified by Babylonian astronomers. These would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times.|$|E
5|$|During the 18–19th centuries, {{the study}} of the three body problem by Euler, Clairaut, and D'Alembert led to more {{accurate}} predictions about <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the Moon and planets. This work was further refined by Lagrange and Laplace, allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations.|$|E
5|$|In early times, {{astronomy}} only {{comprised the}} observation and predictions of <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of objects {{visible to the}} naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, an important factor in knowing when to plant crops, as well as in understanding the length of the year.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>motion</b> of any mass is {{affected}} by the gravitational field. <b>The</b> <b>motion</b> of planets {{is affected}} by the Sun's enormous gravitational field. Likewise, a heavier object will influence <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of other objects of smaller mass in its vicinity. However, this change in <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> is very small compared to <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> of heavenly bodies. Hence, special instruments are required to measure such a minute change.|$|R
5000|$|Featureless {{approach}} : When <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> between <b>the</b> {{two images}} is small, <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> parameters are estimated using optical flow. On the other hand, when <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> between <b>the</b> two images is large, <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> parameters are estimated using generalised cross-correlation. However, this approach requires a computationally expensive resources.|$|R
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation to finally explain <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E
5|$|Later Greek philosophers, observing <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of {{the heavenly}} bodies, were {{concerned}} with developing models of the Universe-based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, celestial spheres eternally rotate with uniform motion around a stationary Earth. Normal matter is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere.|$|E
5|$|Newton's {{contribution}} to gravitational theory was to unify <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of heavenly bodies, which Aristotle had assumed {{were in a}} natural state of constant motion, with falling motion observed on the Earth. He proposed a law of gravity that {{could account for the}} celestial motions that had been described earlier using Kepler's laws of planetary motion.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> estimator, <b>the</b> unidirectional <b>motion</b> estimation and <b>the</b> bidirectional <b>motion</b> estimation processes are combined by multiple objective minimization technique. <b>The</b> unidirectional <b>motion</b> estimation estimates <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> trajectory by comparing the blocks from opposite parity fields while <b>the</b> bi-directional <b>motion</b> estimation compares blocks from the same parity fields. By combining <b>the</b> two <b>motion</b> estimations, <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> trajectory can be accurately predicted. In addition, a quality analyzer is proposed to evaluate the visual quality of the reconstructed frame, which chooses the appropriate interpolation scheme {{in order to provide}} maximum de-interlacing performance.

5|$|The angular {{value of}} the {{obliquity}} is found by observation of <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of Earth and other planets over many years.

5|$|The early {{astronomy}} {{of ancient}} Greece {{was influenced by}} knowledge transmitted from the Mesopotamian culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with Nergal, their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war, Ares. During this period, <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the planets were of little interest to the Greeks; Hesiod's Works and Days (c. 650 BCE) {{makes no mention of}} the planets.|$|E
5|$|Using the Very Large Telescope {{to study}} <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of about 300 {{planetary}} nebulae, {{it has been}} shown that M87 has absorbed a medium-sized galaxy over the last billion years.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} to the 12 (b) (6) <b>motion</b> to dismiss. <b>The</b> idea works as follows. Defendant moves to dismiss exactly as under current practice. Plaintiff either responds to <b>the</b> <b>motion,</b> thus submitting <b>the</b> matter for decision, or files an affidavit proposing a plan of targeted discovery. After receiving defendant’s response, the court approves, rejects, or revises the proposed discovery plan. If the judge allows discovery, defendant either withdraws <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> or produces <b>the</b> information. If defendant withdraws <b>the</b> <b>motion,</b> <b>the</b> litigation proceeds in the usual way. If defendant continues <b>the</b> <b>motion</b> <b>the</b> parties engage in targeted discovery.

5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} {{predictions of the}} times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, {{it was observed that}} when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|Ford and Martin (2010) {{proposed}} that Psittacosaurus was semi-aquatic, swimming with its tail like a crocodile, and paddling and kicking. They based their interpretation on evidence including: the lacustrine (lake) depositional setting of many specimens; {{the position of}} the nostrils and eyes; interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the arms and legs; tails with long chevrons (and with the bristles on the tail interpreted as possibly skin-covered, forming a fin), providing a propulsive surface; and the presence of gastroliths, interpreted as ballast.

5|$|From {{the surface}} of Mars, <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of Phobos and Deimos appear {{different}} from that of the Moon. Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just 11 hours. Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit – where the orbital period would match the planet's period of rotation – rises as expected in the east but slowly. Despite the 30-hour orbit of Deimos, 2.7 days elapse between its rise and set for an equatorial observer, as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.|$|E
5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During geomagnetic storms two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and {{can also be a}} hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.|$|E

5|$|In 1610, Galileo Galilei {{discovered}} the four largest moons of Jupiter (now {{known as the}} Galilean moons) using a telescope; {{thought to be the}} first telescopic observation of moons other than Earth's. One day after Galileo, Simon Marius independently discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his discovery in a book until 1614. It was Marius's names for the four major moons, however, that stuck—Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These findings were also the first discovery of celestial motion not apparently centered on Earth. The discovery was a major point in favor of Copernicus' heliocentric theory of <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican theory placed him under the threat of the Inquisition.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Dutch {{graduate}} student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made {{a determination of}} the mass of Mars based upon <b>the</b> <b>motions</b> of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%.

Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, {{as well as the other}} planets in the inner Solar System, from the planet's gravitational perturbations of the asteroid. His estimated margin of error was 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.|$|E
