25|$|That the Canberra was {{a foreign}} {{aircraft}} meant that its superiority {{in terms of}} performance did not guarantee political support, {{in spite of the}} urgent need, particularly in light of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs; there were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> with USAF demands, as well as questions over continued spares support. In March 1951, many of these questions were answered when, in part due to its production lines being sustained at full capacity to meet orders from the Royal Air Force in addition to those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company, under which it was proposed that Martin would receive a license to domestically build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing many of the political opponents that had opposed the project.|$|E

500|$|The {{economy was}} a great concern during the Ford administration. One of the first acts the new {{president}} took {{to deal with the}} economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, the Economic Policy Board. In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to [...] "Whip Inflation Now". As part of this program, he urged people to wear [...] "WIN" [...] buttons. At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment. To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending. To try <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> service and sacrifice, [...] "WIN" [...] called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption. On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the [...] "WIN" [...] campaign. Over the next nine days 101,240 Americans mailed in [...] "WIN" [...] pledges. In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems. The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals. This plan would also take $4.4billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300billion. At the time, inflation was over twelve percent.|$|E

Anita Moran of The New Zealand Herald opined that the tracks were [...] "easy to listen to" [...] and had [...] "wide appeal". She also considered that the record was [...] "too short" [...] and that Lo's voice {{did not have}} the same intensity of Ellie Goulding's. Writing for BBC News, Mark Savage said that the EP [...] "contains more hooks than a coat rack". Furthermore, he ranked the record at number two on his list of the top ten singles of 2014, writing that, [...] "Every track hits you like a hurricane – the pop hooks deployed like rock riffs as Tove excavates her darkest secrets". Ben Oliver of We Listen Hear called it an [...] "excellent debut EP" [...] and [...] "a collection that not only showcases a sharp new talent but sets a new standard for emotional pop music". Panisch of Out noted that the singer [...] "manages <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> together a warts-and-all narrative [...] with polished dance floor-ready beats". John Calvert of NME gave the extended play a mixed review; though he praised Lo's sincerity in the lyrics of [...] "Habits (Stay High)", he criticized the production of Truth Serum, writing that it is not [...] "anywhere near as boundary pushing, sonically – instead, it's dominated by anodyne, cliché-packed Scandi-pop". Tord Litleskare of the Norwegian publication Gaffa also gave the EP a mixed response, stating that the lyrics of the tracks were [...] "silly and sad" [...] and [...] "too focused on heartbreaks and drugs".|$|E

500|$|Masato Kato {{directed}} {{and wrote the}} main story, leaving sub-plots and minor character events to other staff. The event team sometimes struggled <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> their work on the plot due {{to the complexity of}} the parallel worlds concept. Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds, as well as the fate of Schala, which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger. Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city, he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their own lives, and that this realization would [...] "not... stop with the game". He later added, [...] "Paraphrasing one novelist's favorite words, what's important is not the message or theme, but how it is portrayed as a game. Even in Cross, it was intentionally made so that the most important question was left unanswered." [...] Kato described the finished story as [...] "ole' boy-meets-girl type of story" [...] with sometimes-shocking twists. Kato rode his motorcycle to relieve the stress of the game's release schedule. He continued refining event data during the final stages of development {{while the rest of the}} team undertook debugging and quality control work. Square advertised the game by releasing a short demo of the first chapter with purchases of Legend of Mana. The North American version of Cross required three months of translation and two months of debugging before release. Richard Honeywood translated, working with Kato to rewrite certain dialogue for ease of comprehension in English. He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes. To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters, Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast. Although the trademark Chrono Cross was registered in the European Union, the game was not released in Europe.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{story and}} script {{were written by}} Sakurai. With video game stories, Sakurai {{believes}} that developers lack an ability to balance story-based gameplay hindrances with the prerequisite of victory over enemies. To this end, he was obsessed with striking that balance with Uprising, and so wrote the entire story script himself. He did this so he could write a story that [...] "jibed" [...] with the flow and style of gameplay. The characters' roles and personalities were shaped by their roles {{in the game and}} the game structure itself. He also wanted the dialogue <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> perfectly with the story and music: by writing the script himself, Sakurai was able to sidestep the necessity of explaining to another writer all the time. This also made fine tuning much easier for him. While retaining the first game's Greek mythic influences, the mythology itself had no direct influence on the story of Uprising. Sakurai also {{wanted to make sure that}} the game's Greek influence did not stray in the same direction as the God of War series. For the main story, Sakurai avoided portraying a simple good versus evil situation; instead, he had the various factions coming into conflict due to clashing views rather than openly malicious intentions, with their overlapping conflicts creating escalating levels of chaos for players to experience. Rather than relying on stand-alone cutscenes, the majority of story dialogue was incorporated into gameplay. What cutscenes there were made as short as possible. Events after Chapter 6 were deliberately kept secret during the run-up to release so players would be taken by surprise by what they experienced. The character of Palutena, a damsel in distress in the original game, was reworked as Pit's partner and support. The original idea was for Pit to have a mascot character as his support, but it was abandoned in favor of Palutena. Pit and Palutena's dialogue was influenced by the traditions of Japanese double acts. Dark Pit was written as a mirror image of Pit rather than an evil twin. A key element was retaining the humorous elements from the first game, such as anachronistic elements and silly enemy designs. This attitude, as observed by Sakurai, contrasted sharply with the weighty or grim character stories present in the greater majority of video games. The story was originally three chapters longer than the final version, but these additional parts needed to be cut during early development.|$|E
