[...] The song was played during the Miss Universe 2007 Introductory Ceremony, the 2006 American Music Awards, and Concert for Diana.|$|E
500|$|Federer {{plays with}} the Wilson Prostaff RF97 Autograph, a 97 square inch tennis racquet with 21.5mm beam, 360 g weight, 331 swing weight and 16x19 string pattern (all strung with overgrip). Since the 1998 Wimbledon Junior Championships Federer played with a Pro Staff 6.0 85 racquet. He {{switched}} to a bigger custom-built 90 tennis racquet since 2003, which is characterised by its smaller hitting area of 90 square inches, heavy strung weight of 364grams, and thin beam of 17.5 millimetres. His grip size was 4 3/8inches (sometimes referred to as L3). [...] Federer strung his racquets at 21.5kg mains/20kg crosses pre-stretched 20 percent, using Wilson Natural Gut 16 gauge for his main strings and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough 16L gauge (polyester) for his cross strings. When asked about string tensions, Federer stated [...] "this depends on how warm the days are and with what kind of balls I play and against who I play. So you can see– it depends on several factors {{and not just the}} surface; <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> have is most important." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Equus October" [...] {{was born}} out of a song that the band were {{considering}} discarding because they were never able to finish it until they entered the studio and changed their minds, wanting more material on the album. They decided to use a riff from it only as an interlude that ran 30 seconds long, but they came up with more ideas {{about what to do with}} it during the mixing process, eventually increasing the length of the song. Rubalcaba explained that the bass guitar line remained a constant fixture on jam sessions between himself and Eginton, and they decided to give it a chance by recording it at the album's sessions. Once Mitchell also began adding material to the song, Rubalcaba felt it started taking on a [...] "strong & majestic yet mournful" [...] sensation, almost as if it were about a ritualistic sacrifice. He later discovered the ritual of the October Horse and based the song's title on that of the ritual. [...] "It took on <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> had about the jam & how it just completely comes crashing down so abruptly at the end," [...] he explained. Expanding the song in the studio led the group to want to use it as an interlude that leads into the album's title track.|$|E

500|$|The band {{contributed to}} Bosnian relief efforts to enhance {{humanitarian}} and {{public awareness of}} the issue, and Bono and Carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary Miss Sarajevo, which showcased the war-torn city during Carter's six months living there. In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] as a response to [...] "the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo". One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their [...] "lipstick and heels". During the pageant, all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, [...] "Don't let them kill us". [...] The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogić, later said the pageant [...] "was a crazy thing to do during a war. But we tried to live a normal life. It was some kind of a defence mechanism we all had." [...] Years later, Bono said, [...] "It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song." [...] Of the song's meaning, he said, [...] "Everywhere people had heard their call for help—but help never came. That was <b>the</b> <b>feeling.</b> <b>I</b> had tried to tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way." [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] was recorded with Luciano Pavarotti and released as the first single from U2's side-project with Eno entitled Original Soundtracks 1; the record was released under the pseudonym [...] "Passengers".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the upper}} deck, {{looking over the}} railing, {{there was a young}} man with a straw hat. The shape of the hat was round. He was {{watching}} the men and women and children on the lower steerage deck…A round straw hat, the funnel leaning left, the stairway leaning right, the white drawbridge with its railing made of circular chains – white suspenders crossing on the back of a man in the steerage below, round shapes of iron machinery, a mast cutting into the sky, making a triangular shape…I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> had about life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later this {{affinity}} for Great Britain prompted Buechner to make frequent sojourns and {{visits to the}} United Kingdom. [...] He cultivated profound, enduring, and mutually supportive relationships with prominent Britons. [...] He spoke regularly at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury and was friendly with former deans, The Very Rev. Michael Mayne (Westminster) and The Very Rev. Hugh Dickinson (Salisbury). In fact, his most recent collection, The Yellow Leaves, was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Michael Mayne and, with love, to his wife Allison. [...] In that work, Buechner expresses [...] "the feeling that from the beginning I had had in England that in some sense I had come home, <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> had always had, in Westminster Abbey especially, that all the dead past enshrined there was far from dead in me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and wrote, [...] "Watching High Fidelity, I had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>I</b> could {{walk out of the}} theater and meet the same people on the street [...] and want to, which is an even higher compliment." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Desson Howe praised Jack Black as [...] "a bundle of {{verbally}} ferocious energy. Frankly, whenever he's in the scene, he shoplifts this movie from Cusack." [...] In his review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised Cusack's performance, writing that he was [...] "a master at projecting easygoing camaraderie, he navigates the transitions with such an astonishing naturalness and fluency that you're almost unaware of them." [...] USA Today did not give the film a positive review: [...] "Let's be kind and just say High Fidelity doesn't quite belong beside Grosse Pointe Blank and The Sure Thing in Cusack's greatest hits collection. It's not that he isn't good. More like miscast." [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "In High Fidelity, Rob's music fixation is a signpost of his arrested adolescence; he needs to get past records to find true love. If the movie had had a richer romantic spirit, he might have embraced both in one swooning gesture." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a January 2015, {{interview}} Scott Weiland {{explained that}} he hadn't felt this excited about making an album {{since the early days}} of Stone Temple Pilots, saying: [...] "If you take out the fact that we had to break up the recording process when touring, the album came very easily because of the vibe between the band members.

It was his endorsement that really made people take notice. Everyone needs that first hand up into the business, and Steve extended his to me.
