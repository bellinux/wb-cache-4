5|$|Army {{football}} {{began in}} 1890, when Navy challenged the cadets {{to a game}} of the relatively new sport. Navy defeated Army at West Point that year, but Army avenged the loss in Annapolis the following year. The rival academies still clash every December in what is traditionally the last regular-season Division I college-football game. The 2015 football season marked Navy's fourteenth consecutive victory over Army, the longest streak in the series since inception. On December 10, 2016 Army won {{for the first time}} in 14 years, beating Navy, 21â€“17. Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds became the first Navy QB to beat Army in four consecutive seasons, and set the NCAA rushing touchdown record in the 2015 rivalry game. Army's football team reached its pinnacle of success under coach Earl Blaik when Army won consecutive national championships in 1944, 1945 and 1946, and produced three Heisman trophy winners: Doc Blanchard (1945), Glenn Davis (1946) and Pete Dawkins (1958). Past NFL coaches Vince Lombardi and Bill Parcells were Army assistant coaches early in their careers. The football team plays its home games at Michie Stadium, where <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> named after Earl Blaik. Cadets' attendance is mandatory at football games and the Corps stands for the duration of the game. At all home games, one of the four regiments marches onto the field in formation before the team takes the field and leads the crowd in traditional Army cheers. From 1992 through 1996, Army won all of the games against Navy for the first time since the legendary days of Blanchard and Davis, and it introduced the fraternal group of players identifying themselves as the Fat Man Club, initiated by the offensive linemen of the Class of 1996. Between the 1998 and 2004 seasons, Army's football program was a member of Conference USA, but has since reverted to its former independent status.|$|E

25|$|The batsman and bowler are {{spring loading}} {{equipment}} where {{the direction and}} speed of the ball, power, timing and positioning of the batsman's shot can be controlled. The ball is a small metal ball-bearing. <b>The</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> typically a large green sheet or carpet of cloth which is {{laid out on the}} table, and on which the game is played.

25|$|The {{first part}} of a pinball machine's {{construction}} involves the wiring for the game's electronic system. A color-coded wiring arrangement is wrapped around pins and connectors on a circuit board. Technicians then follow through using a meticulous set of instructions {{to ensure that the}} almost-half mile of wire is engineered properly. During this time <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> set onto foam strips and a bed of nails. The nails are then pressed in the playing board as the bed raises and compresses them against the header. Afterward anchors come and are hammered into place. The anchors help secure a metal railing that keeps the balls from exiting the playing field.|$|E
25|$|The {{stadium is}} also the largest stadium-integrated solar power plant in the world. On {{the roof of the}} Stade de Suisse are enough solar cells to {{generate}} 700,000 kWh. The electricity powers the stadium and some houses around the Wankdorf area. Just below <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> one of the largest shopping centres in Switzerland and a parking facility with over 700 places. The stadium also includes schools, homes, a fitness center, several gyms and some restaurants. The stadium is near a highway interchange and only a few minutes' drive from the main railway station in Bern and only a few minutes' walk from the new Wankdorfquartier station. Furthermore, there are both a bus and a tram stop near Wankdorf.|$|E
500|$|Matches are {{formatted}} into segmented turns {{during which}} players can act. [...] Each turn a player draws two cards {{to add to}} their hand, and cards in a hand can be put onto the playing field. [...] <b>The</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> made of up individual rows where cards can be placed; there are six rows for each player. [...] Cards are played by spending [...] "resource points" [...] which act {{as a form of}} energy. [...] The more powerful a card is, the more resource points are required to play it. [...] Resource points are gained by specifically assigning any card in the hand to a resource row, and only one card can be made into a resource each turn. [...] More powerful cards, such as Magneto, require a higher available pool of resources and so can only be played in later turns in a match.|$|E

500|$|Described as a [...] "shoot-and-lift-up puzzle" [...] game, Meteos core {{gameplay}} mechanic has players move colored blocks (known as meteos) {{that fall}} {{from the top of}} the screen with the Nintendo DS stylus. Aligning three (or more) meteos of the same color horizontally or vertically cause them to ignite and rise; if they (or any blocks above them) move off the screen, they are removed from the playing area. The speed and frequency of falling meteos can be adjusted with the [...] "Speeder" [...] gauge. Power-ups can be used to help or hinder the player or opponents; one example is a giant hammer which can destroy multiple meteos with a few swings. Each meteo sent out of <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> cached in a virtual bank, from which they can be unlock new planets, aliens, and sounds. The player can play as one of thirty-two aliens and their respective planets. Each planet has its own unique gravitational pull that affects how the meteos launch.|$|E
500|$|Inside Zimbabwe, the {{reaction}} was hostile to the players. Zimbabwe's Minister of Information, Jonathan Moyo, called Olonga an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] who had [...] "a black skin and a white mask". Zanu PF information secretary Nathan Shamuyarira claimed they were forced into it by the British media, and [...] "No true Zimbabwean would have joined in," [...] but [...] "Olonga is not a Zimbabwean, he is a Zambian". Olonga was charged with treason, an offence punishable by death. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai released a statement {{in support of the}} protest. He was charged with treason, although the charge was later dropped. Givemore Makoni, the President of Takashinga Cricket Club where Olonga played said [...] "It is disgraceful what Henry Olonga and Andy Flower have done. Taking politics on to <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> a thing the International Cricket Council and all sports organisations have been trying to avoid," [...] and that [...] "by taking politics on to the field and bringing the game into disrepute Henry appears to have breached Takashinga's code of conduct". Olonga was immediately suspended and later sacked by Takashinga Cricket Club. Stephen Mandongo, the President of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union also condemned the protest, saying [...] "What Flower and Olonga did is very wrong. They have jeopardised our reputation when given this once in a lifetime chance to host the World Cup ... It would be wrong if they wore black armbands again." [...] They referred the matter to the International Cricket Council, who deemed that they had taken a political action, but refused to charge them with a formal offence. Instead, they released a statement reiterating the apolitical nature of the organisation, and asked the players not to wear black armbands {{for the rest of the}} tournament, with the threat of more serious punishment if they continued to wear them.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> , {{the area}} of {{approximately}} six soccer fields, while arena polo is 96 x 46 metres. <b>The</b> <b>playing</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> carefully maintained with closely mowed turf providing a safe, fast playing surface. Goals are posts which are set eight yards apart, centred {{at each end of}} the field. The surface of a polo field requires careful and constant grounds maintenance to keep the surface in good playing condition. During half-time of a match, spectators are invited to go onto the field to participate in a polo tradition called [...] "divot stamping", which has developed not only to help replace the mounds of earth (divots) that are torn up by the horses' hooves, but also to afford spectators the opportunity to walk about and socialise.|$|E
