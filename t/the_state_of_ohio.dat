5|$|In 1996, the Department of Energy, {{which had}} succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided {{that since the}} Dayton sites already had been decontaminated, they did not warrant {{inclusion}} in the Army Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were concerned that the cleanup did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ohio</b> asked the United States Congress to have the Army Corps of Engineers conduct a review. This {{was carried out in}} 2004 and 2005.

5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ohio</b> also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|Serving as a {{link between}} Steubenville, Ohio and Weirton, West Virginia, the Fort Steuben Bridge opened as a toll bridge in November 1928. The bridge was the main carrier of U.S. Route 22 over the Ohio River, its traffic {{included}} trucks and heavy duty vehicles associated with the industrial facilities in Weirton-Steubenville area and along the Ohio River. The Fort Steuben Bridge provided a more direct route for the flow of traffic which previously {{had to use the}} Market Street Bridge. As of 1940 the toll for the bridge was 5 cents (US$ with inflation) for pedestrians and 25 cents (US$ with inflation) for automobiles. The toll was removed in 1947, when ownership of the bridge was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ohio.</b> Improvements to the bridge were made in 1956.|$|E

5|$|In April 1963, {{the state}} of Pennsylvania {{proposed}} renumbering I-80S to I-76 and I-280 to I-276 because the spurs of I-80S did not connect to I-80 in northern Pennsylvania. The renumbering {{was approved by the}} Federal Highway Administration on February 26, 1964. With this renumbering, the tollway would carry I-80S between the Ohio border and Pittsburgh, I-76 between Pittsburgh and King of Prussia, I-70 between New Stanton and Breezewood, and I-276 between King of Prussia and Bristol. In 1971, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ohio</b> wanted to eliminate I-80S, replacing it with a realigned I-76. The state of Pennsylvania disagreed with the change and recommended that I-80S become I-376 instead. The Pennsylvania government later changed its mind and supported Ohio's plan to renumber I-80S as I-76. In December of that year, the change was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials. As a result, I-76 would follow the highway between the Ohio border and King of Prussia.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, 2006 at 4:45 pm, a {{structural}} {{failure in the}} 'Rose Bowl' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train {{to come to an}} abrupt stop. Twenty-seven injuries were reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders. Most of the injuries were of the chest or neck. Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident, and two were admitted. None of the injuries were life-threatening. After an inspection the following day, the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood. The ride was shut down {{for an extended period of}} time, while the park worked with <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ohio</b> to complete a full investigation. The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again.

5|$|The {{original}} {{boundaries of}} the Indiana Territory included {{the area of the}} Northwest Territory west of a line running from the bank opposite the mouth of the Kentucky River northeast to Fort Recovery, and from there due northward along a line approximately 84 deg 45 min W longitude. The territory initially included most of present-day Indiana and all of present-day Illinois, and Wisconsin, as well as fragments of three other states: the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River, almost all of the Upper Peninsula of present-day Michigan and the western half of the Lower Peninsula, and finally, a narrow strip of present-day Ohio lying to the north and west of Fort Recovery. This latter parcel became part of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ohio</b> when it was admitted to the Union in 1803. At the same time in 1803, the southeast boundary shifted to the mouth of the Great Miami River from its former location at the point opposite the mouth of the Kentucky River. The eastern part of Michigan was added to the Indiana Territory at that time. The area of the Indiana Territory was reduced in 1805 by the creation of the Michigan Territory, and in 1809 by the creation of the Illinois Territory.|$|E
