5|$|Shepard {{is brought}} to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to {{investigate}} a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues about the Reapers working by proxy through an insectoid species called <b>the</b> <b>Collectors.</b> The Illusive Man explains that <b>the</b> <b>Collectors</b> reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned. Shepard is given command of a new starship, the Normandy SR-2, piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI, and begins to assemble a team to stop <b>the</b> <b>Collectors.</b> Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before receiving intel from the Illusive Man that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard successfully defends the colony, but is unable to stop {{a large portion of}} the population from being captured.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1902, {{the colonial}} {{government}} appointed him their {{representative to the}} Ewondo people, and interpreter and clerk for the Germans posted in Jaunde. He was tasked with organising a census and tax collection system. He chose 300 headmen to be tax collectors, of whom the Germans approved 233. Atangana negotiated a cut of 5% for <b>the</b> <b>collectors,</b> much to their delight.|$|E
5|$|Shepard then {{recruits}} former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally {{replaced by}} Morinth), before {{being sent to}} explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship. There, Shepard learns that <b>the</b> <b>Collectors</b> were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the Reapers. With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by <b>the</b> <b>Collectors.</b> Although Shepard's squad escape, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap. After optionally earning the loyalty of the squad, Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an IFF necessary to safely travel through the Omega-4 Relay. Shepard may also acquire a disabled geth that, if activated, voluntarily joins the squad and is named Legion.|$|E
40|$|Augmentation {{of solar}} {{radiation}} absorbed {{on a flat}} plate solar thermal collector by a flat plate bottom reflector was numerically determined {{when there was a}} gap between <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> and reflector. <b>The</b> inclination of both <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> and reflector was assumed to be adjustable according to the season. A mirror-symmetric plane of <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> to <b>the</b> reflector was introduced, and a graphical model was proposed to calculate the amount of solar radiation reflected by the reflector and then absorbed on <b>the</b> <b>collector.</b> <b>The</b> performance was analyzed for three typical days at a latitude of 30 °N. Solar radiation absorbed on <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> can be increased by the bottom reflector even if there is a gap between <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> and reflector. <b>The</b> optimum inclinations of both <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> and reflector are almost the same while the gap length is less than the lengths of <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> and reflector. However, the range of inclination of the reflector that can increase the solar radiation absorbed on <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> decreases with an increase in gap length, and the solar radiation absorbed on <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> rapidly decreased with an increase in the gap length when <b>the</b> reflector and/or <b>collector</b> were not set at a proper angle...|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Collector</b> uses Larry as a decoy, so {{the trap}} kills Larry instead. Arkin then sends Hannah {{down to the}} {{basement}} where she hides. Before Arkin can go down <b>the</b> chute, <b>the</b> <b>Collector</b> attacks and knocks out Arkin. <b>The</b> <b>Collector</b> then takes Arkin captive and brutally tortures him. A police officer responding to Jill's 911 call tries to arrest <b>the</b> <b>Collector</b> and is killed by <b>the</b> <b>Collector's</b> dog, but manages to call for backup before dying. The distraction gives Arkin time to free himself, but he discovers Victoria dead and armed explosives in the basement. After killing <b>the</b> <b>Collector's</b> dog with a flaming bucket and trapping <b>the</b> <b>Collector</b> in one of his own traps, Arkin finally escapes with Hannah. Arkin and Hannah run into several approaching police officers, who accidentally run down Arkin before taking him and Hannah to safety. An injured Arkin learns from a police officer that <b>the</b> <b>Collector</b> was an exterminator also working at the Chase house. The explosives promptly detonate and destroy the house, seemingly killing <b>the</b> <b>Collector.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Normandy {{integrates}} the IFF {{into her}} systems while Shepard and the squad leave in a shuttle. During their absence, <b>the</b> <b>Collectors</b> attack and board the Normandy. Only Joker avoids capture and, with EDI's help, {{is able to}} extract the Normandy to safety. After Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the Galactic Center. The team rescues any surviving Normandy crew members and fights {{their way to the}} central chamber. Squad members will either survive or perish depending on their loyalty to Shepard, the upgrades made to the Normandy, and the tasks they are assigned in battle. In the central chamber, Shepard discovers that <b>the</b> <b>Collectors</b> have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists.|$|E

5|$|Tali later {{appears on}} the planet Haestrom, a former quarian colony, where Shepard is sent to recruit her. She {{and a team of}} quarian {{soldiers}} were sent to investigate a star aging faster than usual and are under attack by a geth patrol that spotted their activity. After Shepard eliminates the attacking geth and meets her in the bunker in which she had been trapped with her equipment, Tali departs with Shepard on the mission to investigate and stop <b>the</b> <b>Collectors,</b> receiving permission from the Admiralty Board after the fact.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>collector</b> {{depletion}} region {{also increases}} under reverse bias, more than does {{that of the}} base, because <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> is less heavily doped. The principle governing these two widths is charge neutrality. The narrowing of <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> {{does not have a}} significant effect as <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> is much longer than the base. The emitter-base junction is unchanged because the emitter-base voltage is the same.|$|R
40|$|The F-Chart {{method of}} solar {{collector}} performance evaluation is extended to a flat-plate collector system augmented with planar side reflectors. The modified F-Chart evaluations {{show that the}} augmentation of <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> has approximately <b>the</b> effect of increasing <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> area by 60 %, and the energy supplied by <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> better matches <b>the</b> load. The installed reflector cost of about 10 % of <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> cost is shown to be well justified...|$|R
5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after <b>the</b> <b>collectors</b> left and were not replaced. The council have not yet decided {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This has proved to be problematic as the revenue collected from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is not a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|E
5|$|Mass Effect 2 is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by BioWare {{and published by}} Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in 2010, and for PlayStation 3 in 2011. Mass Effect 2 is the second installment of the Mass Effect series and a sequel to the original Mass Effect. The game takes place within the Milky Way galaxy during the 22nd century, where humanity is threatened by an insectoid species known as <b>the</b> <b>Collectors.</b> The player assumes the role of Commander Shepard, an elite human soldier who must construct and gain the loyalty of a diverse team and stop the enemy in a suicide mission. With {{the use of a}} completed saved game of its predecessor, the player can impact the story of the game in numerous ways.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatise}} Tractatus of Glanvill, {{which is}} traditionally attributed to Osbert's uncle Ranulf de Glanvill, {{and to which}} Osbert himself may have contributed, names only seven judges, including Osbert. He {{was one of a}} group of royal justices that included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, and Richard Herriard, used by Hubert Walter, the Justiciar of England during Richard's reign, and chosen for their ability rather than any familial ties. This group replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and represent the first signs of a professional judiciary. In 1194 Osbert was one of <b>the</b> <b>collectors</b> of the carucage in eastern England, along with Barre and de Warrene.|$|E

Thus <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> usually leans opposite to the direction of travel; when the time comes to travel in the opposite direction, <b>the</b> <b>collector</b> must be swung over. To allow this to happen, the overhead wire must be raised by several inches at places where the bows are swung over, such as terminals and turn-outs.

5|$|Abir {{collected}} 70 tons {{of dried}} rubber in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 {{by which time}} it had eleven operational posts. At {{the same time the}} price of rubber also increased from 6.30–6.50 fr per kilogram in 1894 to 8.04–10.00 fr per kilogram in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per kilogram to purchase the rubber from <b>the</b> <b>collectors</b> (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export duty paid to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per kilogram. In the same year Abir could sell on the rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr per kilogram. Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price of rubber, for the first two years (1892–94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year. As a result, the dividend paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving rubber to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Hassinger still {{owned the}} rights to The Electric Prunes's name, and was {{encouraged}} {{by the success of}} Mass in F Minor, which prompted him to assemble a new line-up. He was steered toward the Colorado group, Climax, by Rich Fifield. Fifield had worked in fellow Colorado band, Hardwater (previously the surf rock band The Astronauts), which was managed by Poncher, and produced an album with Axelrod. The new Electric Prunes line-up included Climax members Richard Whetstone (vocals, guitar), John Herron (organ), and Mark Kincaid (guitar) with Brett Wade (bass guitar), who was recommended by <b>The</b> <b>Collectors.</b> With the group restructured, Axelrod, again, composed all the material for their next album, in the same vein as the previous effort, and centered it around the Jewish prayer, Kol Nidre. The album, titled Release of an Oath, utilized several session musicians including Howard Roberts, Carol Kaye, and Earl Palmer, and saw Whetstone as the only band member to contribute to the recordings. Although the album was considered more cohesive and progressive than its predecessor, it failed to chart upon its release in November 1968. Afterwards, Axelrod returned to his past position at Capitol Records, and The Electric Prunes toured as a supporting act for bands such as Steppenwolf, Canned Heat, and New Buffalo Springfield.|$|E

40|$|Flat {{collectors}} {{are usually}} not air or water tight. Therefore, they can exchange air and moisture with the environment.
