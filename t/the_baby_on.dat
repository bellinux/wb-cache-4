5|$|A prophecy {{states that}} a female {{child with a}} special {{birthmark}} will herald {{the downfall of the}} evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent fulfillment of the prophecy. When the prophesied child Elora Danan is born, the mother begs the midwife to hide the infant and smuggle her to safety. The midwife reluctantly accepts and leaves Nockmaar castle unnoticed. The mother is executed, the midwife is hunted down and eventually found. Knowing she cannot escape, she sets <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> a makeshift raft of grass and sends her down the river hoping for fate to run its course. The midwife is killed by Nockmaar hounds. Bavmorda, furious about the escape, summons her daughter Sorsha and her army's commander, General Kael, to find the baby.|$|E
25|$|Pain caused from mis-positioning <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> {{the breast}} or a {{tongue-tie}} in the infant can cause {{pain in the}} mother and discourage her. These problems are generally easy to correct (by re-positioning or clipping the tongue-tie).|$|E
25|$|The story {{continues}} with King Herod asking his advisers about ancient prophesies describing {{the birth of}} such a child. As {{a result of their}} advice, he sends soldiers to kill every boy child under the age of two in the city of Bethlehem. But Joseph has been warned in a dream, and flees to Egypt with Mary and the baby, Jesus. The gruesome scene of the Massacre of the Innocents, as the murder of the babies is generally referred, was particularly depicted by Early Renaissance and Baroque painters. The Flight into Egypt was another popular subject, showing Mary with <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> a donkey, led by Joseph (borrowing the older iconography of the rare Byzantine Journey to Bethlehem).|$|E

25|$|Oedipus {{was the son}} of Laius and Jocasta, {{king and}} queen of Thebes. Having been childless for some time, Laius {{consulted}} the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi. The Oracle prophesied that any son born to Laius would kill him. In an attempt to prevent this prophecy's fulfillment, when Jocasta indeed bore a son, Laius had his ankles pierced and tethered together so that he could not crawl; Jocasta then gave the boy to a servant to abandon ("expose") on the nearby mountain. However, rather than leave the child to die of exposure, as Laius intended, the servant passed <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> to a shepherd from Corinth and who then gave the child to another shepherd.|$|E
25|$|At birth, {{the baby}} {{receives}} an Apgar score at, at the least, {{one minute and}} five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> five different areas—each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The midwife checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The midwife ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The midwife performs these checks {{as close to the}} mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby's heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature—and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Wong {{sent the}} {{newsreel}} footage on a U.S. Navy ship to Manila and from there, {{the film was}} flown to New York City aboard a Pan American World Airways airliner. Beginning in mid-September 1937, the newsreel was shown to movie theater audiences, estimated a month later to number 50 {{million people in the}} U.S. and 30million outside of the U.S. and the still image of the crying baby was printed in Hearst Corporation newspapers and affiliates, some 25 million copies. A further 1.75million non-Hearst newspaper copies showed the image in the U.S., and 4million more people saw it as a matte reproduction in other newspapers. Some 25million people saw it internationally. It first appeared in Life magazine on October 4, 1937, at which point it was estimated that 136million people had seen it. On the facing page in Life magazine, another photograph showed <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> a stretcher receiving medical care.|$|E

50|$|The {{film has}} the {{distinction}} of being the first full-length feature to use computer-generated imagery for the synthesis of human visual speech. 2D warping techniques were used to digitally animate the mouth viseme shapes of <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> which were originally shot with their mouths closed. The viseme shapes were sampled from syllables uttered by <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set.|$|R

Meanwhile, Olivia kidnaps Sam to threaten Julian, but Sam tries to escape. Unfortunately, in the ensuing struggle, Sam gets pushed off a bridge by Olivia into a ravine. Jason tries to track down Sam after realizing she's missing, but is unable {{to see her in}} the dark. Just as Jason gives up, a beam of moonlight helps him find Sam after the moon comes out. Jason gets to Sam, who is already in labor, and ends up having to deliver their baby girl. He gets them to the hospital, where Sam ends up in a coma after surgery. Jason begs her to wake up, saying he can't go on without her. Alexis brings their newborn daughter to visit Sam. When Jason lays <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> Sam's chest, Sam wakes up and recovers. She and Jason name their daughter Emily Scout Morgan.|$|E
500|$|A {{writer from}} Rolling Stone gave a mixed review for the video saying that [...] "It's a goofy and fun clip, though the faceless cheerleaders in the {{background}} are more creepy than amusing." [...] In a pre-release screening of MDNA, Matthew Todd from Attitude believed that the last scene showing Madonna throwing off a baby doll implied that she was moving away from domestic life and embracing a party attitude. Amanda Dobbins from New York found some [...] "attempted weirdness" [...] in the video with the scenes of the triple Marilyns and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> Madonna's lap, but added that [...] "Madonna still looks crazy bonkers good".|$|E

As she emerged from the anesthesia, Scott recorded Zelda saying, [...] "Oh, God, goofo I'm drunk. Mark Twain. Isn't she smart—she has the hiccups. I hope it's beautiful and a fool—a beautiful little fool." [...] Many of her words found their way into Scott's novels: in The Great Gatsby, the character Daisy Buchanan expresses a similar hope for her daughter.|$|E

500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> the ground: [...] "After they had hung them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of my neighbors was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E
500|$|Rescued by Rover was {{predominantly}} {{a family}} affair – Cecil Hepworth's wife, Margaret, wrote the scenario and {{played the role of}} the mother on screen. Hepworth himself directed, painted the scenery and acted as the father. Their child was <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> screen, and the part of Rover was played by the family dog, Blair. Two professional actors were paid to appear, Sebastian Smith as the soldier, and his wife as the old woman who stole the baby. The two actors were paid half a guinea each; Hepworth would recall [...] "We couldn't get them for less". The film is often cited as the first film to have used paid actors. Completing the cast was Mabel Clark, who had previously played Alice in Hepworth's version of Alice in Wonderland, as the child's nurse. Clark was also the cutting room assistant.|$|E
500|$|Hayward is {{credited}} with putting his naval career [...] "on the line" [...] by bringing <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> the ship, which was against regulations, and he subsequently received orders to get the baby off the ship. However, having a baby on board boosted sailors' morale, and Hayward later said that a leader must [...] "know when to intelligently disregard regulations." [...] A visa was obtained by intervention of Richard Nixon's staffers, and a passport was secured by winning a poker game against the South Korean who issued passports. The baby, adopted by Navy surgeon Hugh Keenan, who was also in port at Inchon, was later named Daniel, and was transferred to a civilian ship in Japan. Daniel Keenan was raised in Seattle and began attending reunions of {{the crew of the}} Point Cruz in 1993. The story of Daniel Keenan was made into a television movie, A Thousand Men and a Baby, which aired on CBS in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|Antigonus, meanwhile, {{abandons}} <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> {{the coast}} of Bohemia, reporting that Hermione appeared {{to him in a}} dream and bade him name the girl Perdita. He leaves a fardel (a bundle) by the baby containing gold and other trinkets which suggest that the baby is of noble blood. A violent storm suddenly appears, wrecking the ship on which Antigonus arrived. He wishes to take pity on the child, but is chased away in one of Shakespeare's most famous stage directions: [...] "Exit, pursued by a bear." [...] (It is not known whether Shakespeare used a real bear from the London bear-pits, or an actor in bear costume.) Fortunately, Perdita is rescued by a shepherd and his son, also known as [...] "Clown." ...|$|E
2500|$|The podaegi ( [...] , also spelled podegi) is a Korean carrier with {{a medium}} to large {{rectangle}} of fabric {{hanging from a}} very long strap. Traditionally the rectangle is quilted for warmth and wraps around the mother's torso, while the straps are wrapped snug under the baby's bottom and tied {{around to the front}} to support and secure <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> the mother's back. Western interest in the podaegi style has led to new wrapping methods which do go over the shoulders, and to narrower [...] "blankets". Variants of this shape include the Iu-Mienh/Hmong carrier and the Chinese bei bei. Iu-Mienh/Hmong carriers and bei beis are both customarily used with over-the-shoulder wrapping and often have stiff sections which help provide head support or block wind.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent storylines {{featuring}} Diane included {{involvement in}} the plight of pregnant runaway Disa, whom Diane brought back to Walford to bond with her baby—Disa had initially abandoned <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>on</b> Diane's doorstep on Christmas Day 1990. The bulk of the character's narrative concerned a blossoming romance with one of EastEnders original characters, Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), who returned to the serial as a regular character in 1990 after a three-year absence. The relationship was never consummated however, because in January 1991 Mark revealed to Diane that he was HIV positive—he was the first mainstream soap opera character to be diagnosed. The episode, written by Tony McHale, {{has been described as}} the [...] "important" [...] beginning to Mark's HIV storyline, as Mark's secret HIV status was finally revealed to the audience as well as Diane. In the on-screen events, Diane tried to be supportive to Mark and persuaded him to have counselling at the Terrence Higgins Trust, though their relationship was never quite the same again; when Mark, prompted by his mother Pauline, asked Diane to marry him, she turned him down and left the serial to move to France shortly after.|$|E

He is swindled and left for dead by {{merchant}} Salomon van der Merwe but is saved by Banda, van der Merwe's servant, and they steal a fortune in diamonds from van der Merwe to fund their vengeance against the man who mistreated them both. A now unrecognizable Jamie returns to Klipdrift under a new name and impregnates van der Merwe's daughter, Margaret. He announces his true identity and says he had repaid van der Merwe's [...] "hospitality" [...] with a present: [...] MacGregor seed in his daughter's belly.
