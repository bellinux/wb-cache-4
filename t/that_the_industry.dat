5|$|The federal {{minister}} for forests from 1998 to 2001, Wilson Tuckey, {{was a strong}} advocate of Plantations 2020. He also held the federal seat of O'Connor in Western Australia, which included much of the Great Southern region and significant areas of plantation forests. Tuckey and the forest industry had a close relationship, to the extent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> paid for newspaper advertisements that reproduced a letter from Tuckey, following critical coverage of forestry MIS schemes in the media. Great Southern also reproduced Tuckey's letter in their 2000 Annual Report.|$|E
5|$|The few {{species of}} demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with no hard {{elements}} {{have been used}} by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been overfished so heavily <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. Dolphins have been observed using sponges as tools while foraging.|$|E

5|$|Widespread strikes marked 1922, {{as labor}} sought redress for falling wages and {{increased}} unemployment. In April, 500,000 coal miners, led by John L. Lewis, struck over wage cuts. Mining executives argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> was seeing hard times; Lewis {{accused them of}} {{trying to break the}} union. As the strike became protracted, Harding offered compromise to settle it. As Harding proposed, the miners agreed to return to work, and Congress created a commission to look into their grievances.|$|E
5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, and felt the need to keep the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights game—he felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.|$|E

50|$|Another 2017 {{study found}} that {{relatively}} unpopular industries provide larger contributions to candidates.

25|$|Greyhound racing {{has been}} a source of {{controversy}} since the 1980s.

25|$|Beginning in late 2008 {{and early}} 2009, the {{industry}} came under financial stress {{due to that}} year's economic crisis. Motorists drove less and gasoline prices dropped sharply, while bank financing shrank.

The Energy Information Administration raised concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> would not meet the legislated targets.|$|E

50|$|Commerce Bank’s {{economic}} model rested on <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fixed {{costs of a}} bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry's</b> reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, {{to the detriment of}} consumers who prioritised in-person service.|$|R
25|$|In January 1951 it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> manufacturing slot machines in the United States, then almost entirely based in Chicago, Illinois, had suffered a major blow. A bill had been signed which banned slot machines from federal property and prohibited their shipment in commerce between states. At that time slot machines were allowed only in the states of Nevada, Montana and Maryland (where they were allowed in only four counties) but were operated illegally throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{kauri gum}} {{industry}} became established around Matakohe in 1867-70, possibly {{the first place}} in the Kaipara District <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> developed amongst settlers. A flax mill was built in 1870, but it was not profitable and was soon converted to a timber mill. This was replaced by a larger timber mill in the 1880s. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1906. Matakohe held a race-day each February, in which were entries from as far as Kaiwaka and Waipu.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these complex economic conditions, thrift managers resorted to several innovations, such as alternative mortgage instruments and interest-bearing checking accounts, {{as a way to}} retain funds and generate lending business. Such actions allowed the industry to continue to record steady asset growth and profitability during the 1970s even though the actual number of thrifts was falling. Despite such growth, there were still clear signs <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> was chafing under the constraints of regulation. This was especially true with the large S in the western United States that yearned for additional lending powers to ensure continued growth. Despite several efforts to modernize these laws in the 1970s, few substantive changes were enacted.|$|E
50|$|Also in the 1930s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry's</b> technical terminology had become chaotic.

25|$|DuPont {{was founded}} in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and {{gunpowder}} machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after {{he and his family}} left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. The company began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{deterioration}} of the rail network, Argentina had a greater number of rolling stock manufacturers which supplied trains and cars throughout the railways, however today only a few companies like Materfer, Grupo Emepa, TecnoTren and Fabricaciones Militares remain. While Materfer make the CMM 400-2 diesel multiple units and the MTF-3300 diesel cargo locomotives, Emepa manufacture the Alerce EMU/DMU which is to be used on the Belgrano Norte Line. At the same time, Fabricaciones Militares only makes freight cars, such as those used in the Belgrano Cargas network, though in the past they made electric trains for suburban and underground lines. There have been signs <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> is reviving and expanding, {{while at the same time}} there are many workshops around the country which refurbish and modernise older rolling stock.|$|E
25|$|Prescott had {{a stormy}} {{relationship}} with the privatisation of the railway industry. He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party's policy, established in 1996 just before the flotation of Railtrack on the London Stock Exchange, of committing to renationalise the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning {{that it would never}} be done. Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by then shadow transport secretary Clare Short, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created Strategic Rail Authority (in the case of the passenger train operators) and the Rail Regulator (in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack). The policy was spelled out in some detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares.|$|E
