He determined that as many fighters as possible should remain on sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with the bombers. For now, this would be the main tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E

25|$|After the {{specific}} threat against children was delivered, many school groups curtailed field trips and outdoors athletic activities based upon safety concerns. At {{the height of}} the public fear, some school districts, such as Henrico County Public Schools and Hanover County Public Schools, after the Ponderosa shooting, simply closed school for the day. Other schools such as the MJBHA, cancelled all outdoor activities after the shooting at the Connecticut and Aspen Hill intersection. Others changed after-school procedures for parents <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> kids to minimize the amount of time children spent in the open. Extra police officers were placed in schools because of this fear. In addition to this, Joel Schumacher's film Phone Booth was deemed potentially upsetting enough that its release was delayed for months.|$|E

When he did dine he shared the family table, which he had saved (and which still exists), with 12 indigent guests. To the needy living in wealthy homes he sent meals he had cooked with his own hands as gifts to spare them the indignity of receiving charity. Hearing of the death of an indigent in a back room he was depressed for days, entertaining for a time the conceit that he had failed in his duty and was a murderer.|$|E
25|$|On 22 September Southampton hosted Aston Villa, in a match {{which they}} had to win {{in order to avoid}} their worst ever start to a season. After a {{relatively}} even first half hour, it was Villa who broke the deadlock in the 36th minute when Darren Bent took advantage of a defensive error to score, putting the visitors one up going into half time. The Saints started the second half much more aggressively though, and in the 58th minute equalised courtesy of a Rickie Lambert strike. With the added momentum, Southampton went ahead five minutes later when Nathaniel Clyne scored his first goal for the club, with Gastón Ramírez providing the assist for the goal. Jason Puncheon put the club 3–1 up another nine minutes later, with Lambert and Ramírez working together to provide the assist for the goal. Lambert scored his second of the match from the penalty spot in stoppage time, and the Saints saw the game out until the end <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> first points of the season and move out of the relegation zone.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{occupation}} of the town, a night curfew was imposed which remained in force until the «ethnic cleansing» was completed. During the day, men were allowed to move around only with a permit issued by the Serbian police at Zvornik. Many {{of the men who}} went to Karakaj (or later to the police office in Zvornik) in order to apply for a «permit» were suddenly deported into one of the camps in the industrial district of Karakaj. While at the camp, they were subjected to severe torture and murder, in particular by members of the paramilitary troops whose quarters were partly in the same buildings as those in which the prisoners were detained. Many of the men, therefore, did not dare <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>their</b> passes themselves, but remained in hiding in houses. However, even persons with a pass were not safe from random aggressions by the numerous paramilitary units in town. It was reported by some witnesses that immediately upon leaving the police station, they had their passes taken away or torn into pieces by members of a paramilitary group. Some of them were attacked and deported into camps.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} defensive {{strategy is}} the man-to-man defense (also known as [...] "one-to-one"), where each defender guards a specific offensive player, called their [...] "mark".

The defensive players will usually choose their mark {{at the beginning of}} the point before the pull. Often players will mark the same person throughout the game, giving them an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> on <b>their</b> opponent's strengths and weaknesses as they play.|$|R
