500|$|Run-D.M.C. rapped {{over the}} most sparse of musical backing tracks. In {{the case of}} [...] "Sucker MCs", <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud,</b> Oberheim DMX drum machine, a few {{scratches}} and nothing else, while the rhymes harangued weak rappers and contrasted them to the group's success. [...] "It's like That" [...] was an aggressively delivered message rap whose social commentary has been defined variously as [...] "objective fatalism", [...] "frustrated and renunciatory", and just plain [...] "reportage". Run-D.M.C. wore street clothes, tracksuits, sneakers, one even wore glasses. Their only possible concession to an image extraneous to that of kids on the street was the stylistic flourish of black fedoras atop their heads. This stood {{in sharp contrast to}} the popular artists of the time, who had variously bedecked themselves with feathers, suede boots, jerri curls, and red or even pink leather suits.|$|E
500|$|There were no fatal {{accidents}} at {{the production}} plant, {{although it had}} a higher accident rate than other Manhattan Project production facilities due to the haste to get it into operation. When the crews attempted to start the first rack <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> noise and a cloud of vapor due to escaping steam. This would normally {{have resulted in a}} shutdown, but under the pressure to get the plant operational, the Fercleve plant manager {{had no choice but to}} press on. The plant produced just [...] of 0.852% uranium-235 in October.

With four circuits per rack, each rack could produce [...] per day. By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12, which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons. Total S-50 production was [...] It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week. [...] "If I had appreciated the possibilities of thermal diffusion," [...] Groves later wrote, [...] "we would have gone ahead with it much sooner, taken a bit more time on the design of the plant and made it much bigger and better. Its effect on our production of U-235 in June and July 1945 would have been appreciable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not suspecting {{anything}} untoward, I continued my level climb. All of {{a sudden}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> noise in my cockpit— I'd taken cannon [...] fire.

Fuel gushed into the cockpit; it began smoking and then I completely {{lost control of the}} Bf 109, spiraling down on my back through the Curtisses.

2500|$|Passengers {{further back}} in the train heard explosions. [...] "The thing that precipitated people really {{starting}} to freak out and break the glass and open the door was <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> 'bam,' explosion-type thing," [...] said Fred Buonocore, {{who was in the}} fourth car. [...] "And once we jumped off the side, there was another explosion to a lesser degree." [...] At the very rear, passengers said they felt only a small jolt.

2500|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 17 August 2009 at 08:13 local time (00:13 GMT). [...] <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> bang from turbine 2.

[...] As a result, the machinery hall and rooms below its level were flooded. [...] At the same time, an alarm was received at the power station's main control panel, and the power output fell to zero, resulting in a local blackout.

5000|$|A {{more modern}} {{tradition}} where <b>there</b> <b>are</b> full-circle bells {{is to use}} [...] "half-muffles" [...] when sounding one bell as a tolled bell, or all the bells in change-ringing.

5000|$|The {{music of}} this {{movement}}, [...] "Of Beauty" [...] (for alto), is mostly soft and legato, meditating {{on the image}} of some [...] "young girls picking lotus flowers at the riverbank."
