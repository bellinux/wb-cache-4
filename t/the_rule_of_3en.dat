40|$|Talk of {{law reform}} {{is in the}} air {{throughout}} East Asia. Whether in Beijing or Tokyo or here, law reform is spoken of in terms <b>of</b> strengthening <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. But what is <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law? Different legal systems have different roads to reach <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. These different roads are noticeable mainly in the different emphases different systems place on two critical elements in <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law State, namely <b>rules</b> and <b>the</b> machinery for implementing <b>the</b> <b>rules,</b> i. e., courts and administrative agencies. <b>The</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law makes demands on both <b>the</b> legal <b>rules</b> themselves and on the institutions charged with implementing the law. Fulfillment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law requires both rules and institutions. But among those countries that have <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, there are noticeable differences in how their rules and institutions contribute to fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. While there is considerable knowledge in Taiwan about western models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, Taiwanese scholars who look abroad to consider <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law, should be aware of differences in how <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law is implemented among the countries they consider as models. The road to <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law is unique for each state. Thus, after exploring the experiences of the German, American and Japanese systems, Professor Maxeiner points out how infirmities in <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law necessarily cause you to have to choose among roads to <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law and to suggest how these choices may affect law reform. He would like to stress that these differences among legal methods demonstrate that there is no one right road to implement <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> <b>of</b> Law. Taiwanese reformers should not seek for a preferred foreign choice, but to develop their own solution that works best for Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|Formal conceptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{are popular}} among {{contemporary}} legal philosophers.

Most authors tend to trace <b>the</b> ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and natural law back to classical Greece, but I show that they are already recognisable and intertwined as far back as Homer. Because the founding moment of the tradition of western intellectual reflection on <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law placed concerns about substantive justice at <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law ideal, it may be hard for this ideal to entirely shrug off its substantive content. It may be undesirable, too, given the rhetorical power <b>of</b> appeals to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law. <b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law means something quite radical in Homer; this meaning may provide a source of normative inspiration for contemporary reflections about <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law...|$|R

40|$|This essay next makes {{three key}} {{observations}} concerning <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law: (1) <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and human rights; (2) the interrelatedness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{to a local}} <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law; and (3) the insights <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law affords to {{the exploration of the}} nexus between trade and human rights.

In the United States, the Supreme Court's controversial decision in Bush v.

40|$|Pan Wei {{argues that}} what China needs first is <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, not democracy.

According to Pan, the first combination is actually the worst outcome since a democracy without <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law is {{likely to result in}} chaos, corruption, and general governance problems. This is why most third world democracies are not successful in terms of political stability and sustainable development. According to Pan, the second pattern, nondemocratic government with <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, has been proven to be a viable political option, especially for countries without democratic traditions. Hong Kong and Singapore are well-governed societies with efficient and clean government. Therefore Pan concludes that at least in the mid-term future, China should focus its political reform on building up <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, since that can best ensure the emergence of successful democracies as in the West.

It investigates how the court has defined and interpreted <b>the</b> notion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in its jurisprudence. It places this analysis {{against a background of}} more theoretical accounts of <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law, drawing in ideas of political philosophy. It also provides a comparative assessment, demonstrating how <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law has evolved in the UK, France, and Germany. The book argues that at the core of <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law are <b>the</b> notions of legality and judicial safeguards. It states that the Court has developed the requirements of legality, which the work analyses in detail, based on that concept. It assesses the independence of the judiciary as an aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law in <b>the</b> context of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> substantive contents of law. The book posits that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law as seen at the Court is not mainly utilised with regard to ‘freedom’ rights, but is more concerned with procedural rights. It discusses the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> view of the Convention as a constitutional instrument of the European public order, and shows that <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and democracy are inextricably linked in the case law of the Court.

Whereas <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law {{has long been}} stressed as an indispensable element in the sustained survival of democracy, we point out that, like the rule-of-man-based institution, it is subject to potential deterioration. When deterioration does occur, the sustainability of democracy cannot solely depend on perpetuating <b>the</b> existing <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law system. <b>The</b> alternative we propose is to utilize the constitutive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law and <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> man to initiate institutional change that will halt this deterioration. Leaders in this constitutive structure are required to exhibit two pivotal qualities: (1) the ability to initiate institutional change to halt deterioration in the existing system; and (2) willingness to submit to <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> law institution once it has been established so as to ensure the sustainability of democracy.
