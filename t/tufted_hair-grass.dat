50|$|Little Bookham Common is {{a mosaic}} of rough {{grassland}} and scrub; much of this common is poorly drained {{and there are several}} old gunpits and bomb craters. The areas of open grassland are dominated by <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa).|$|E
50|$|These woods {{are one of}} {{the largest}} {{remnants}} of the ancient Royal Forest of Rockingham. They are mainly ash and pedunculate oak on wet calcareous clay soils. The ground flora is diverse, and there are grasses such as <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> rough meadow-grass and wood melick.|$|E
50|$|The {{semi-natural}} ancient broadleaved woodland is a surviving {{fragment of}} the Royal Forest of Rockingham. It is mainly ash, {{and the ground}} flora on base rich soil includes <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> dog's mercury and enchanter's nightshade. The meadow is agriculturally unimproved, and it has surviving medieval ridge and furrow.|$|E
50|$|Geddington Chase is a {{surviving}} {{fragment of}} the medieval Royal Forest of Rockingham. Most of the Chase is commercially managed, and the SSSI {{is an area of}} semi-natural wet ash/maple woodland on Midland boulder clay. The ground flora is diverse, with plants including bluebell, dog's mercury, <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> and a few wild daffodils.|$|E
50|$|Marsh {{varieties}} of plants include marsh pennywort, lesser spearwort, marsh speedwell, common marsh-bedstraw, floating sweet-grass and {{various types of}} sedge. Where there are drier areas {{at the edge of}} the water, purple moor-grass, common bent, <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> and various rushes flourish. Uncommon bog asphodel is present and is recorded as an increasing population.|$|E
50|$|Although Campanula gelida is {{critically}} endangered {{and was on}} the edge of extinction in the 1970s, at present the population of the species seems (despite their small number and limited area of occurrence) to have stabilized. Current threats include skiers trespassing in the protected area and expansion of other species including <b>Tufted</b> <b>Hair-grass,</b> Red Raspberry and Hypericum maculatum.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of five fields off Glebe Lane, some managed for hay {{while others are}} grazed by horses. It contains flower-rich unimproved grassland which is dominated by Yorkshire Fog, with a good variety of other grasses, and <b>Tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> is dominant in damper areas. The most important feature of the site is the diversity of its old meadow plants.|$|E
50|$|In the UK and Canada {{this species}} uses {{several species of}} violet as its food plant. In drier areas, dog violets are used whilst in wetter areas the food plant is bog violet (Viola palustris) or marsh violet growing amongst purple moor-grass or <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass.</b> They prefer the damper areas more often. They also occur amongst bracken, where this is shading the {{appropriate}} violet species.|$|E
50|$|The {{pastureland}} {{is dominated}} by soft rush (Juncus effusus) and <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa). Locally uncommon plants include meadow rue (Thalictrum flavum), brown sedge (Carex disticha), water violet (Hottonia palustris), whorl-grass (Catabrosa aquatica) and the carnivorous bladderwort (Utricularia australis). Five specimens of black poplar (Populus nigra ssp. betulifolia) grow on site; this tree, uncommon in the UK, is near the northwestern limit of its range.|$|E
50|$|The {{woodland}} {{cover is}} very variable, being {{dependent on the}} soil and drainage. In wetter areas, alder, Alnus glutinosa, is dominant, over a ground cover that includes soft rush, Juncus effusus, meadowsweet, Filipendula ulmaria, and <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> Deschampsia cespitosa. In one side valley, {{there is a small}} population of small-leaved lime, Tilia cordata, which occurs here close to its northern limit and at an unusually high altitude.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is {{unimproved}} grassland {{and supports}} {{a variety of}} plants. There {{is a mixture of}} plants which flourish on neutral and calcareous soils. The ridges support a diverse flora and these include Cowslip, Burnet-saxifrage, Common Restharrow, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus) and Field Scabious. Lady's Bedstraw and Meadow Barley are also recorded. The furrows being damper support <b>Tufted</b> <b>Hair-grass,</b> Cock's-foot and Hard Rush (Juncus inflexus).|$|E
5000|$|A {{striking}} feature at Lillsjön are the Highland cattle residing {{there from}} May to October. Not {{only do they}} attract many Stockholmers of all ages, they also affect the local fauna as they eat reed and <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> thus preventing these species from taking over the area [...] - [...] and thereby allowing space to flowers such as cowslips and bitter vetch, as well as birds and insects attracted by water.|$|E
50|$|On the plateau, brambles, bracken and {{rosebay willowherb}} occupy {{extensive}} patches, {{but a more}} mixed ground flora occurs between these, including creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), hairy brome (Bromus ramosus), <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood millet (Milium effusum) and wood melick (Melica uniflora). Pill sedge (Carex pilulifera), hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa) and slender St. John's-wort (Hypericum pulchrum) are found in more heathy areas, and the rushes Juncus effusus and J. conglomeratus are present in damper areas.|$|E
50|$|Rocky {{outcrops}} on {{the site}} support hard shield-fern (Polystichum aculeatum) and hart’s-tongue (Phyllitis scolopendrium). By contrast, wet flushes {{on the site}} support giant fescue (Festuca gigantea), <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa), bugle (Ajuga reptans), yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum) and meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria). Dark and damp areas of the woodland give rise to rare lichens such as (Biatorella monasteriensis), (Lobaria laetevirens) and (Leptogium teretiusculum), as well as mosses and ferns including epiphytic polypody (Polypodium vulgare) and oak fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris).|$|E
50|$|The Palisades harbor many {{rare species}} for the Bluegrass {{due to the}} unusual landscape. The state {{endangered}} plants found on Tom Dorman's cliffs are starry cleft phlox (Phlox bifida var. stellaria), Eggleston's violet (Viola egglestonii), and <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa); the latter being {{one of only two}} populations known in the state. The plants listed as state threatened found here are Kentucky viburnum (Viburnum molle) and False melic (Schizachne purpurascens). The rare Yellowwood tree is also found in this preserve.|$|E
50|$|The common {{also has}} grassland, {{scattered}} trees, overgrown hedgerows and several pockets of scrubby woodland. The woodland is mainly composed of sycamore and elm. Other trees include two young native black poplar (Populus nigra ssp betulifolia), a rare tree in Britain and a priority {{species in the}} London Biodiversity Action Plan. There are also some fine mature oaks and horse-chestnuts scattered throughout the common. The grassland has a fairly good range of wild flowers, and damp areas near some of the ponds contain much <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass.</b>|$|E
50|$|Northern coastal grasslands, or coastal prairies, are {{generally}} found below 1000 ft on coastal terraces or mountain balds. In areas where fire has been suppressed, coastal scrub plants invade.

50|$|A notable {{feature of}} Lough Derravaragh, as found at Lough Lene, are {{the range of}} {{stoneworts}} that occur within the lake. Eight species have been recorded here, several of which have a restricted range in Ireland. Fringing the lake's shores, a range of habitats has been created {{as a result of}} drainage of the River Inny. At the western side are extensive reed beds and swamps of downy birch and willows. Nearby, there is also freshwater marches vegetation dominated by sedges (Carex spp.) and often tussock-forming grasses such as <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa) and fescues (Festuca spp.), with a flowering herbs including Bidens cernua, and trifid bur-marigold.|$|E

5000|$|Totteridge Croft Field is a 2.4 hectare Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade I, between Totteridge Green and Darland's Lake at Grid Ref [...] It {{is a field}} {{bounded by}} tall {{unmanaged}} hedges on unimproved clay grassland. It {{appears to have been}} a hay meadow in the past which is now reverting to rough grassland and scrub. Much of the field is covered with <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass,</b> and it has scattered oak and crab apple trees and a good variety of wild flowers. There are some uncommon species, such as sneezewort and pignut. The field provides a good habitat for birds and cover for mammals such as rabbits and muntjac. It is private land with no public access.|$|E
50|$|Coalville Meadows covers an area 15.3 acre, bounded on the West by {{a former}} {{minerals}} railway line, to the South by social housing, the east by Holly Hayes Woodland, and to the North by an aggregate storage area, and have developed on soils derived from the clays of the Triassic Keuper Marl. The grassland is poorly drained and is dominated by <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> Deschampsia caespitosa, Yorkshire fog Holcus lanatus, red fescue Festuca rubra and great burnet Sanguisorba officinalis. Additionally, flora typical of relatively basepoor clay soils, such as pignut Conopodium majus, betony Betonica officinalis, heath bedstraw Galium saxatile, tormentil Potentilla erecta, devil's-bit scabious Succisa pratensis, and mat grass Nardus stricta, are present.

5000|$|A stunted {{woodland}} {{grows on}} a landslip {{from the top}} of the cliff (...) down to sea-level. Exposure to salt-laden winds has resulted in a tight wind-pruned canopy with trees from 1 to 8 metre high. Sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is the dominant species with pedunculate oak (Q. robur), birch (Betula spp), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and a few wild-service trees (Sorbus torminalis). Many of the trees are swathed in lichens and moss with 131 species of lichen recorded and there are a number of species that are largely confined to a few north Cornwall and Devon sites. One hundred and twenty flowering plants have been found including, bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), heath pearlwort (Sagina subulata), primrose (Primula vulgaris), sanicle (Sanicula europaea), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), small bristle club rush (Isolepis setacea), wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca), wood garlic (Allium ursinum) and wood vetch (Vicia sylvatica). Damp areas are dominated by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense), <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa) and the ferns broad buckler fern (Dryopteris dilatata) and royal fern (Osmunda regalis) are abundant. The hay-scented buckler-fern (Dryopteris aemula) is of interest. There was a heronry here in the first decades of the 20th-century.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to assess and compare energy inputs and outputs of various crop managements in 2011 – 2012. Two main crops on arable land and three {{permanent}} grasslands were investigated. Silage maize (Zea mays L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown on lowland, whilst two semi-natural grasslands and grassland infested by <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> (Deschampsia caespitose (L.) P. Beauv) were located in mountainous regions of Slovakia. In these crops and grasslands the dry matter yield was measured and subsequently the supplementary energy, energy gain and unifying energy value – {{tonne of oil equivalent}} (TOE) – were calculated. Silage maize with 233. 37 GJ*ha- 1 has provided the highest energy gain. In the group of grasslands, grassland infested by <b>tufted</b> <b>hair-grass</b> has offered the highest energy gain (59. 77 GJ*ha- 1). And this grassland had the lowest requirement on the supplementary energy (3. 66 GJ*ha- 1), contrary to silage maize with highest one (12. 37 GJ*ha- 1). The total energy potential of the crop biomasses was confronted with energy consumption in Slovakia. Winter wheat has the biggest energy potential, but it could cover only 19. 6 % and 11. 3 % total consumption of electricity or natural gas, respectively. Large area of permanent grasslands and their spatial location make them an important energy reservoir for bioenergy production. But, {{it is not possible to}} replace all consumed fossil fuels by bioenergy from these tested renewable energy sources...|$|E
