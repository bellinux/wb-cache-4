500|$|Ponche de Leona {{delivered}} Mucho Macho Man {{three weeks}} after her due date. [...] At birth, the foal was lifeless with no heartbeat. Farm staff tried to revive him by massaging and shaking him. [...] He was unresponsive for several minutes, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> opened and he [...] "just got up and galloped away". As a result, his foalhood nickname was [...] "Lazarus". [...] In {{addition to being a}} late foal, he was very big and hence slow to reach full development. Because the young horse was so tall and skinny, John Rio called him [...] "Mr. Green Jeans", though no one else did. [...] His official name is derived from the Village People song [...] "Macho Man", and owner Dean Reeves' nickname for him is [...] "Macho".|$|E
2500|$|Ja’far’s widow Asma recalled: “God’s Messenger {{came to me}} and asked, ‘Where are Jafar’s children?’ I {{brought them}} to him and he embraced them and smelled them, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> welled up and he cried. ‘O God’s Messenger,’ I asked, ‘Have you heard {{something}} about Jafar?’ ‘Yes,’ he replied. ‘He was killed today.’ I stood up and screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, ‘O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!’” Her son Abdullah remembered: “He said, ‘O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja’far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!’” Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatima, “Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for they are preoccupied today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Case 8. This case {{illustrates}} {{that children with}} Panayiotopoulos syndrome may be misdiagnosed and treated for encephalitis. This boy had a first seizure at age 4 years and 2 months. Whilst sleeping in his mother’s lap, he suddenly vomited. <b>Then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> stared into the space upwards, his head deviated to the right, his face turned green and he became incontinent of urine and faeces. The seizure lasted for 15 min {{and there were no}} convulsions. Abdominal ultrasound performed because of the vomiting was normal. A second seizure occurred 16 months later at age 5 years and 6 months. At around 10 in the morning he walked into lounge looking pale and irritable. He fell to the floor and developed writhing movements, shaking arms and legs, hypersalivation and incontinence of urine. Convulsions stopped 15 min later with rectal diazepam. He recovered but remained very sleepy. He was febrile ~38.5°C. He was treated in a major teaching hospital with triple therapy for suspected encephalitis but in the third day after admission this was stopped and he was discharged home. Brain CT scan, EEG and CSF were normal. [...] Subsequent EEGs showed infrequent occipital and frontal spikes. [...] At follow-up aged 7, he was normal and had experienced no further seizures.|$|E

60|$|He poured some brandy between George Forester's lips, {{and held}} a bottle of ammonia to his nose. Presently there was a deep sigh, and <b>then</b> Forester opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> For a minute he looked round vaguely, and <b>then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell upon Ronald.|$|R
60|$|Something {{that was}} like a grunt escaped the Chevalier, <b>then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fastened}} upon me, and his anger boiled up.|$|R

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed {{themselves}} {{upon his}} daughter's face with one long, searching look, and closed.|$|E
60|$|Messer Pier Luigi hesitated, {{entirely out of}} countenance. <b>Then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{turned to}} Bianca, and his {{expression}} softened.|$|E
60|$|He was on {{the verge}} of saying {{something}} further and <b>then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> wandered down the table and he stopped short.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your sister?" [...] began Frank, and <b>then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell on her crape trimmings. He {{touched her}} sleeve, {{and made a}} low wail. [...] "Oh! is every one dead?" ...|$|R
60|$|The man's {{hand went}} furtively to <b>his</b> pocket. <b>Then,</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{caught sight of}} the revolver, which Jimmy had placed on the table. With a sudden dash, he seized it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Richard!" [...] {{cried the}} captain, and grasped {{my hand in}} both his own. I {{returned}} his pressure, too much pleased to speak. <b>Then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> was caught by my finery.|$|R

60|$|Bellecour eyed them in cold disdain, until {{presently}} Charlot and {{his bride}} were abreast of him. <b>Then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{seemed to take}} life and his sallow face to kindle into expression. He leant lightly from the saddle.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell upon}} {{the date on}} the title page, and a strong spasm of relief shook him. The clouds rolled away, and he loved her still. This frightful volume had been {{published}} five years ago.|$|R

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell upon}} another {{postcard}} {{that had come}} from Chitterlow by the morning's post, and which now lay by him on the mantel-shelf. He took it up, glanced at its imperfectly legible message, and put it down.|$|R

60|$|Indeed, in a minute, Mr. Will {{did come}} to himself.
