5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|No, if we {{make this}} screen machine <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> asking for, it will spoil everything.

With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E

5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (<b>that)</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (<b>that)</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
