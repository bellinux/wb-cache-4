5|$|Eris is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) and {{a member}} of a high-eccentricity {{population}} known as the scattered disk. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. , its distance from the Sun was , roughly three times that of Pluto. With the exception of some long-period comets, Eris and Dysnomia are currently the second-most-distant known natural objects in the Solar System, <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> object being V774104 discovered in November 2015 at 103 AU.|$|E
5|$|Geologically, {{the ground}} of Queen Maud Land is {{dominated}} by Precambrian gneiss, formed c.1 to 1.2Ga, before {{the creation of the}} supercontinent Gondwana. The mountains consist mostly of crystalline and granitic rocks, formed c.500 to 600Ma in the Pan-African orogeny during the assembly of Gondwana. In <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> western parts of the territory, there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Research on the thickness of the ice has revealed that without the ice, the coast would be similar to those of Norway and Greenland, with deep fjords and islands.|$|E

5|$|Some Solar System models {{attempt to}} convey the {{relative}} scales involved in the Solar System on human terms. Some are small in scale (and may be mechanical—called orreries)—whereas others extend across cities or regional areas. The largest such scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the 110-metre (361-ft) Ericsson Globe in Stockholm as its substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-metre (25-foot) sphere at Arlanda International Airport, 40km (25mi) away, whereas <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> current object, Sedna, is a 10-cm (4-in) sphere in Luleå, 912km (567mi) away.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. In total, about 487 people have visited outer space and reached orbit , and, of these, twelve have {{walked on the}} Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually {{replaced}} every six months. <b>The</b> <b>farthest</b> that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171km, achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.|$|E

All three stations are in the Common Tunnel. The least-used station is Lillevann, which serves the recreational area of Nordmarka.

5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{holds the}} record for being <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> {{northeast}} forming tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin. The seventh named storm of the slightly below average 2009 Atlantic hurricane season, Grace formed from an extratropical cyclone over the Azores on October4. It strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) and developed an eye-like feature, although cold sea surface temperatures inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity near the center. The storm lost its tropical characteristics on October 6, though the remnants merged with a separate system near the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Vince {{was named}} on October 9 {{in the east}} Atlantic near Madeira (east-southeast of the Azores) and was {{upgraded}} to a hurricane later that day though later analysis indicated that it had formed as a subtropical storm the previous day. Although Vince was a very small and short-lived storm that only briefly reached hurricane strength, it was notable for developing in the eastern Atlantic, well away from where hurricanes are usually found. This may be <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> north and east a tropical cyclone has ever formed in the Atlantic Basin.|$|E

He was commissioned as a lieutenant in September. He landed at Anzac on 25 April 1915, and his battalion made <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> advance of any Australian unit that day. Invalided to Australia, he became commander of the 33rd Infantry Battalion, which he led on the Western Front at Messines, Passchendaele, Villers-Bretonneux, and Amiens.|$|E

5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (<b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|Christian Hedemann (1852–1932) {{counts as}} among the {{earliest}} Danish photographers who emigrated <b>the</b> <b>farthest</b> distance. Though educated in Denmark, he left Copenhagen in 1878 and settled in Hawaii. Primarily occupied as a mechanical engineer at the Hana Sugar Plantation, Island of Maui, and later as a technical manager at the Honolulu Iron Works, as an avid amateur photographer he helped found the Hawaiian Camera Club (1889–1893). He became an American citizen in 1903 and in 1909 accepted an appointment as Danish Consul. His remarkable photographs of the Hawaiian royal family and native social elites remain {{as some of the}} earliest images available of pre-annexed Hawaii.|$|E
