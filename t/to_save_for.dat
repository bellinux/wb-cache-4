Marquis and a colleague at the Herald resolved <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>for</b> a similar trip, working every shift available. In the end, however, the other printer dropped out and Marquis went alone. He boarded a train for Helena, Montana, on July23, 1890, arriving on the 27th. He soon found temporary work at the Helena Independent-Record. It was in Helena that Marquis first met Native Americans. Perhaps more remarkably, {{it was there that}} he first experienced a Chinese restaurant.|$|E

25|$|Many factors {{played a}} role in Britain’s {{long-term}} economic growth, such as the industrial revolution in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age. Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family. Child Labour first started to occur in England when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths. Although there are many counts of {{children under the age of}} ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also transitioning <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>for</b> their own future families.|$|E

25|$|English {{trust law}} {{concerns}} {{the creation and}} protection of asset funds, which are usually held by one party for another's benefit. Trusts were a creation of the English law of property and obligations, but also share a history with countries across the Commonwealth and the United States. Trusts developed when claimants in property disputes were dissatisfied with the common law courts and petitioned the King for a just and equitable result. On the King's behalf, the Lord Chancellor developed a parallel justice system in the Court of Chancery. Historically, trusts were mostly used where people left money in a will, created family settlements, created charities, or some types of business venture. After the Judicature Act 1873, England's courts of equity and common law were merged, and equitable principles took precedence. Today, trusts {{play an important role}} in financial investments, especially in unit trusts and pension trusts, where trustees and fund managers usually invest assets for people who wish <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>for</b> retirement. Although people are generally free to write trusts in any way they like, an increasing number of statutes are designed to protect beneficiaries, or regulate the trust relationship, including the Trustee Act 1925, Trustee Investments Act 1961, Recognition of Trusts Act 1987, Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, Trustee Act 2000, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and the Charities Act 2011.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, Congress has enacted laws {{to promote}} consumer-driven {{healthcare}} with health savings accounts (HSAs), which {{were created by}} the Medicare bill signed by President George W. Bush on December 8, 2003. HSAs are designed to provide tax incentives for individuals <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>for</b> future qualified medical and retiree health expenses. [...] Money placed in such accounts is tax-free. To qualify for HSAs, individuals must carry a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). The higher deductible shifts some of the financial responsibility for health care from insurance providers to the consumer.

2500|$|In a {{traditional}} 401(k) plan, introduced by Congress in 1978, employees contribute pre-tax earnings to their retirement plan, also called [...] "elective deferrals".

[...] The IRS sets a limit {{on the amount of}} funds deferred in this way, and includes a [...] "catch up" [...] provision intended to allow older workers <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>for</b> their approaching retirement. These limits are adjusted each year to reflect changes in the cost of living due to inflation. [...] For tax-year 2015, this limit is $18,000 for those under age 50, and $24,000 for those 50 and over.|$|E
2500|$|The Waldheim neighborhood, {{an estate}} {{subdivision}} in Flushing constructed primarily between 1875 and 1925, {{is a small}} district of upscale [...] "in-town" [...] suburban architecture that preservationists have tried <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>for</b> at least twenty-five years. Waldheim, German for [...] "home in the woods", known for its large homes of varying architectural styles, laid out in an unusual street pattern, was the home of some of Flushing's wealthiest residents until the 1960s. Notable residents include the Helmann family of condiment fame, the Steinway family of piano notability, as well as A. Douglas Nash, who managed a nearby Tiffany glass plant. The neighborhood was rezoned by the City of New York in 2008, in order to halt the destruction of its original housing stock, {{which began in the}} late 1980s, and to help preserve the low density, residential character of the neighborhood. As with the Broadway neighborhood, preservationists have been unable to secure designation as an Historic District by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission to date. Today, Waldheim stretches between Sanford and Franklin Avenues on the north, 45th Avenue on the south, Bowne Street on the west and Parsons Boulevard on the east. The area is immediately southeast of the downtown Flushing commercial core, and adjacent to Kissena Park.|$|E

2500|$|Over the 20th century, trusts {{came to be}} {{used for}} {{multiple}} purposes beyond the classical role of parcelling out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to be able <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>for</b> retirement through occupational pensions. After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, but if people wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement. After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's [...] "pension promise" [...] was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee {{for the benefit of the}} employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report, was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in other financial investments, though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding [...] "units" [...] in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, gilts or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do much the same thing, but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in [...] "tax havens", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a [...] "resulting trust" [...] or (more normally today) a [...] "constructive trust". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity.|$|E
