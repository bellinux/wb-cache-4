40|$|Metaphysical {{modalities}} are definable from counterfactual conditionals, and the epistemology of {{the former}} is a special case of the epistemology of the latter. In particular, the role of conceivability and inconceivability in assessing claims of possibility and impossibility can be explained as a special case of the pervasive role of the imagination in assessing counterfactual conditionals, an account of which is sketched. Thus scepticism about metaphysical modality entails a more far-reaching scepticism about counterfactuals. The account is used to question {{the significance of the}} distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge. 1 § 0. Philosophers characteristically ask not just whether things are some way but whether they could have been otherwise.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the Knoop hardness of a dual-cured resin-based luting cement irradiated with different light sources as well energy density through a ceramic sample. Three light-curing unit (LCUs) were tested: tungsten halogen light (HAL), light-emitting diode (LED) and xenon plasma-arc (PAC) lamp. Disc-shaped specimens were fabricated from a resin-based cement (Enforce). Three energy doses were used by modifying the irradiance (I) of each LCU and the irradiation time (T) : 24 Jcm- 2 (I/ 2 x 2 T), 24 Jcm- 2 (IxT) and 48 Jcm- 2 (Ix 2 T). Energy doses were applied through a 2. 0 -mm-thick ceramic sample (Duceram <b>Plus).</b> <b>Three</b> <b>groups</b> underwent direct irradiation over the resin cement with the different LCUs and a chemically-activated group served as a control. Thirteen groups were tested (n= 10). Knoop hardness number (KHN) means were obtained from cross-sectional areas.

Application of 48 J. cm- 2 energy dose through the ceramic using LED (50. 5 ± 2. 8) and HAL (50. 9 ± 3. 7) produced significantly higher KHN means (p< 0. 05) than the control (44. 7 ± 3. 8).
