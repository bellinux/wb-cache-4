5|$|After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's {{shirt and}} found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to {{dislodge}} a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; he learned <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing.

5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> {{made the}} front pages of newspapers, because they went beyond the war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup may have been the most vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the bands}} <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> played the university, {{including}} Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, they were particularly impressed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and recruited an organist, Nick Pearne, {{to match the}} format of Arthur Brown's band. Along with two female dancers, the initial line-up was Hammill on guitar and vocals, Smith on drums, wind instruments and vocals, and Pearne on organ (though he did not initially have an instrument). According to Smith, the band initially played as a two-piece, with Smith occasionally using a typewriter as a percussion instrument; their first gig as a three-piece was in the student union, which lasted five minutes before the group's amplifiers blew up.|$|E
5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.|$|E
5|$|By sea: Banton is {{accessible}} via wooden launches and motorized boats <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> travel from Lucena City, Quezon.

5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E
5|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by Kamikene and Daisuke Ishizaka of Hatos. It {{features}} two overlapping circles colored deep blue and bright blue, {{in order to create}} , a color close to indigo. The bright blue was chosen as it was a synthetic ink <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> occurs in Japanese printing, while the deep blue was taken naturally, isolating a color taken from a photo of the sky just before dawn. The center of the artwork features the Kikuuiki typography, as well as a logo of two overlapping circles. The mix of natural and artificial blue circles was used to represent Kikuuikis theme of mixing points.|$|E

5|$|MD 177 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena {{just north of}} MD 2's interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). The state highway heads east as a six-lane divided highway which drops to four lanes at its intersection with a ramp from southbound MD 10 (Arundel Expressway) and ramps to and from westbound MD 100. MD 177 passes under MD 10, spawns a ramp onto northbound MD 10, and meets {{the southern end of}} MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard) at Lipin's Corner. At the next intersection, unsigned MD 915 (Long Hill Road) splits to the south. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> gains a center turn lane. The state highway intersects another section of MD 648 (Waterford Road), Catherine Avenue, and Edwin Raynor Boulevard on its way to Jacobsville. In the center of Jacobsville, MD 177 intersects MD 607, which heads south as Magothy Bridge Road and north as Hog Neck Road.|$|E
5|$|The French Indian Ocean {{territories of}} Île de France and Île Bonaparte were heavily {{fortified}} island bases from which French frigates {{were able to}} launch raids against British trade routes across the Indian Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars. In late 1808, a squadron of four frigates departed France for the region under Commodore Jacques Hamelin with orders to prey on the convoys of East Indiamen <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> crossed the Indian Ocean. During the late spring of 1809, these frigates dispersed into the Bay of Bengal, attacking British shipping and coastal harbours around {{the rim of the}} Eastern Indian Ocean. The Royal Navy was also preparing an operation in the region, a staggered campaign intended to blockade, isolate and subsequently capture both Île deFrance and Île Bonaparte, eliminating the final French territories and bases east of Africa.|$|E
5|$|The park is {{the most}} visited during {{the spring and summer}} months, when it is open between 8:00 and 19:00 (7:00pm) local time. In autumn and winter, it closes at 17:00 (5:00pm). Admission at the {{entrance}} must be paid. Camping, lighting fires, or setting up overnight shelters are strictly forbidden within the limits of the national park {{in order to protect the}} surrounding ecosystem. The park can be reached from the city center of Kuşadası via several dolmuş (share taxis) <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> shuttle the route to the closest town of Güzelçamlı. Recently, there have also been ferry boat services operating back and forth between Kuşadası and Güzelçamlı, in turn providing easier access to the park for visitors.

5|$|The series follows Blythe Baxter, a 12 Year {{old girl}} {{living with her}} air pilot father, Roger. Forced to move out from her {{suburban}} hometown following her father's promotion, she moves into an apartment located in a crowded city. Their complex is located above the eponymous Littlest Pet Shop—a pet store that {{also serves as a}} day camp for numerous pets—where Blythe works as a fashion designer. Her adventure begins when she discovers that she alone can miraculously understand and talk to the pets <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> stay at the shop, in addition to most other animals on the planet. As she and the pets spend time together, they find the pet shop jeopardized by larger pet store managed by Fisher Biskit and his snooty twin daughters, Whittany and Brittany Biskit. To avoid being dispersed, the pets convince Blythe to remain an employee.|$|E
5|$|With Streltsov in the team, ZiL {{topped the}} factory league after winning all 11 matches. Although {{he was not}} allowed to play for Torpedo, Streltsov {{attended}} matches at his old club throughout the season. In October 1964, Khrushchev was replaced as the Communist Party's First Secretary by Leonid Brezhnev, who shortly after taking office received a letter signed by tens of thousands of people, including heroes of Socialist Labour and national and regional Supreme Soviet members, requesting the reversal of Streltsov's professional ban. Some party members were wary of a potential comeback, fearing that Streltsov's inclusion in a Torpedo squad <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> travelled to Western Europe could lead to an international incident, but Brezhnev repealed the ban, arguing that as a free man Streltsov should be able to use his trained profession. He was cleared to return to Torpedo before the 1965 season.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E

5|$|Woodriff's {{resistance}} had {{an important}} indirect effect on Allemand's cruise. In drawing the squadron southwards, Woodriff had pulled {{them out of the}} line travelled by the Illustrious convoy. In the aftermath of the engagement, it took two days to repair the battered Calcutta and in that time the convoy had safely passed Allemand's former position without sighting the French force. With his object frustrated, Allemand completed the repairs to Calcutta and crewed her with men drawn {{from the rest of the}} squadron, adding the ship to his force. Aware that news of his presence would rapidly spread, Allemand subsequently turned southwards, sailing from the North Atlantic to the coast of North Africa to avoid pursuing British forces. There Allemand anchored for a time at the Spanish island of Tenerife, where he was able to repair and resupply his squadron before embarking on a lengthy cruise against the British convoys <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> crossed the region.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers {{have strong}} bills for {{drilling}} and drumming on trees, and long sticky tongues for extracting food. Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper {{and stronger than}} the bills of piculets and wrynecks; however, their morphology is very similar. The bill's chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds <b>that</b> <b>regularly</b> use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks will forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. The long sticky tongues, which possess bristles, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. It {{has been reported that}} the tongue was used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.|$|E
