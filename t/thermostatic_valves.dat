5000|$|These systems {{depend on}} the proper {{operation}} of thermostatic air-venting valves located on radiators throughout the heated area. When {{the system is not}} in use, these valves are open to the atmosphere, and radiators and pipes contain air. When a heating cycle begins, the boiler produces steam, which expands and displaces the air in the system. The air exits the system through the air-venting valves on the radiators and on the steam pipes themselves. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> close when they become hot; in the most common kind, the vapor pressure of a small amount of alcohol in the valve exerts the force to actuate the valve and prevent steam from leaving the radiator. When the valve cools, air enters the system to replace the condensing steam.|$|E

Computer simulations in IDA ICE 4 are used and case studies are performed {{in order to find}} the possible savings. Conventional control with outdoor sensors only and equivalent temperature control without weather forecast are the two reference systems for comparison. The differences in result when having functioning and non-functioning thermostatic radiator valves are also investigated. The construction of weather forecast control is described in more general terms in the theory part and the self-constructed weather forecast control implemented in IDA is furthermore described in detail. The building simulated in IDA is a multi-family dwelling constructed in three floors with a concrete frame, built in the early 1970 ’s. The simulations are performed using the most weather exposed apartment in the building. Both the simulation in IDA and the case studies indicate that weather forecast control can save 15 kWhheat/(m 2 ∙year). Implementing weather forecast control in a conventional system regulated by outdoor air temperature control and with no <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> functioning saves almost the same amount of energy as if new <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> would have been installed, according to the results from IDA. Calculating the total net savings shows that installing new <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> is somewhat better than weather forecast control. The net savings per year when installing new <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> and using weather forecast control is 331 SEK and 290 SEK respectively in the apartment simulated. Installing weather forecast control in a conventionally controlled building with all <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> functioning is not economically feasible when using the self-constructed equivalent temperature in IDA...|$|E

The analysis focuses on a specific lot of 4 buildings, representative of the whole district hospital. For those structures, sustainable energy savings actions are investigated.

This paper aims at presenting an investigation methodology, useful for designers and other stakeholders involved in hospital energy refurbishments, based on an integrated approach which combines dynamic energy performance simulations and experimental campaigns. In order to measure all the simulations' missing input parameters, a suitable experimental analysis, including measurements of temperature, humidity, flow rate and density of construction materials, is performed.

40|$|The thesis Local {{district}} heating systems {{deals with a}} new concept for {{district heating}}. The district heating system is arranged as one main system {{and a number of}} local systems. The production plants and the main distribution lines belong to the main system. The local systems distribute heat power from the main lines through the local networks to the buildings and via substations further to individual rooms. The main network and the local networks operate with different pressures and if suitable with different temperatures. The design of the local systems from the main lines to the room radiator, is the main topic of the thesis. The new concept is based on a comfortable room temperature in every room. Pleasant room temperatures are reached with a thermostatic valve on each radiator. Good working conditions for the <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> are created by a controllable jet pump in the substation and a low radiator flow. The jet pump replaces one heat exchanger, the centrifugal pump and the control valve of a conventional substation of today. The jet pump and the pressure separator, which connects the local network to the main network, allow the low return temperatures from the radiator circuits to enter the main network unaffected. The directly connected radiator circuits are made possible by limiting the maximum pressure and temperature to 6 bars and 95 °C respectively. Simulations show that the system is robust and comparatively insensitive to deviations from estimated design data. The <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves</b> and their interaction with the jet pump will automatically adjust the operation to the new conditions. Measurements at Trollhättan Energi AB confirm this behaviour. Altogether the study shows that the new concept will give lower return temperatures, reduced heat losses and increased comfort (closer to preferred values of room temperature). Costs are illustrated with quantities which can be related to investment costs (design values), and to operational costs (quantities of long duration) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{assignment}} {{includes an}} examination of Hotel Inlandia in Norsjö on behalf of Norsjö municipality to find the parts that are old, inefficient and bad and then develop proposals for improvements to reduce energy consumption, costs and renewal of some parts. The examined parts are: The heat source The heating system, radiators Windows Ventilation Water flows in showers and tapsAn examination of the windows and calculations of heat loss through these {{has been done to}} determine how much the heating demand can be reduced by changing to new windows with lower heat transfer coefficient, U-value. An offer has been developed for new windows in use to compare with the old and by changing to new windows the actual heat demand can be reduced by approximately 33, 8 MWh per year and to understand how much it is, it can be compared with the energy consumption of an average Swedish villa. The yearly energy consumption of an Swedish villa is 25 MWh. Calculations were made on showers- and faucets heads to see how much savings could be made by replacing old high-flow nozzles to new water saving nozzles. By changing the old shower heads that emit about 19 liters of water per minute for new efficient that emit about 6 liters per minute, the water heating costs will be reduced from 3800 kronor to 1194 kronor. This applies if two people in a room shower for 10 minutes each for a whole year. If guests live in all the 26 rooms during a year, these costs will be reduced by totally 65 984 Swedish Crowns. By replacing the faucet nozzles, the costs for hot water will be reduced by totally 22 cents for every minute that a tap flushes water. The payback period for a new faucet nozzle that cost 100 Swedish crowns will be 7, 6 hours flushing of hot water.

40|$|Abstract-Thermal comfort {{requires}} constant {{indoor air}} temperature during the day. In summer, the {{outside air temperature}} usually exceeds the inside temperature and a heat flux from the ambient to {{the interior of the}} building occurs. In winter a heating system for building is needed to compensates the heat loss and maintains comfortable temperature. In this paper a neural network (NN) controller for achieving the constant indoor temperature, using a geothermal space heating system, is proposed. The geothermal space heating system is designed for three buildings (i. e. school, home & emergency hospital) in a remote area located in the Eastern Desert utilizing the heat resource of Umm Huweitat well (sample no 69 on the Red Sea approximately 20 km north of the city of Safaga.) as a case study.

40|$|Abstract:- District heating {{companies}} from Europe had an annual turnover (2005) of 19. 5 billion Euro and supplies heat {{to more than}} 100 million people. District heating contributes to higher energy efficiency, greater security of supply and lower carbon dioxide emissions. There {{is a need to}} strengthen the competitiveness of this technology. Important differences between Eastern and Western district heating systems exist not only regarding the level of modern equipment, but also in the conception of design and operating. In most Western European countries, the entire district heating system is demand driven, using control equipment at four independent levels: two at the customer and two managed by the district heating operator. Each building usually has separately regulated systems for supplying heat to the radiators (space heating), to the domestic hot water system and to the ventilation system. The main advantage of this concept is that customers establish the space heat demands by means of <b>thermostatic</b> <b>valves,</b> at the first level of the heat demand control, without the risk that the District Heating Company delivers more or less heat than necessary. In most Eastern European countries, the mentality is different: the District Heating Company evaluates the quantity of heat for each building and delivers it through a distribution network to substations. A number of 20 - 30 buildings, usually blocks of flats, are connected to the substation and must share the quantity of hea...|$|E
