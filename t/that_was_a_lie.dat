60|$|When he {{had given}} me all the {{satisfaction}} I could desire, I gave him and his two companions each of them a gun, with powder and ball sufficient, advising them to fire upon them as they lay sleeping. The Captain modestly said, that he was sorry to kill them; though, on the other hand, to let these villains escape, who were the authors of his misery, might be the ruin of us all. Well, said he, do as you think fit; and so accordingly I fired, killed one of the Captain's chief enemies and wounding the other; who eagerly called for assistance, but the Captain who had reserved his piece, coming up to him, Sirrah, said he, 'tis too late to call for assistance, you should rather cry to God to pardon your villany; and so knocked him down with the stock of his gun: three others were also slightly wounded, who at my approach cried out for mercy. This the Captain granted upon condition that they would swear {{to be true to}} him in recovering the ship, which they solemnly did; However I obliged the Captain to keep them bound. After which I sent Friday and the Captain's mate to secure the boat and bring away the oars and sails; when, at their return, three men coming back, and seeing their late distressed Captain, now their conqueror, submitted to be bound also. And then it was, that having more liberty, I related the adventures of my whole life, which he heard with a serious and wonderful attention. After this, I carried him and his two companions into my little fortified castle, shewed them all my conveniences, and refreshed them with such provisions as I could afford. When this was over, we began to consider about regaining the ship: he said, that there were twenty-six hands on board, who knowing their lives were forfeited by the law, for conspiracy and mutiny, were so very hardened, that it would be dangerous for our small company to attack them. This was a reasonable inference indeed; but something we must resolve on, and immediately, put in execution: we, therefore heaved the boat upon the beach so high that she could not shoot off at high water mark, and broke a hole in her not easily to be stopped; so that all the signals they gave for the boat to come on board were in vain. This obliged them to send another boat ashore, with ten men armed, whose faces the Captain plainly descried, the boatswain being the chief officer; but he said there were three honest lads among them, who were forced into the conspiracy. Hereupon I gave him fresh courage (for I had perceived he was in concern): In the mean while securing our prisoners, except two, whom we took to our assistance, we thought ourselves able enough to adventure a battle. When the sailors landed, and beheld their boat in that condition, they not only hallooed, but fired for their companions to hear, yet they received no answer. This struck them with horror and amazement, thinking their companions were murdered, they made as if they would return to the ship. I could perceive the Captain's countenance change at this, till of a sudden three men were ordered to look after the boat, while the other seven leapt on shore in order to search for their companions; and, indeed, they came to the brow of the hill, near my ancient castle, from whence they could see to a great distance in the woods, and there shooting and hallooing till tired and weary, they at length seated themselves under a spreading tree. My opinion was, that nothing could be done till night, when I might use some artifice to get them all out of the boat; but of a sudden they started up, and made to the sea-side; hereupon I ordered Friday and the Captain's mate to go over the creek, and halloo as loud as they could, and so decoying them into the woods, come round to me again. And this, indeed, had good effect; for they followed the noise, till coming westward to the creek, they called for their boat to carry them over, and taking one of the men out of her, left two to look after her, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on shore. Hereupon immediately the Captain and our party passing the creek, out of their sight, we surprised them both, by the Captain's knocking down one, and ordering the other in surrender upon pain of death, and who being the honestest of them all, sincerely joined with us. By this time it was pretty late; when the rest returning to there boat, which they found aground in the creek, the tide out, and the men gone, they ran about wringing their hands, crying it was an enchanted island, and that they should be all murdered by spirits or devils. My men would willingly have fallen upon them, but I would not agree to hazard any of our party. But to be more certain, Friday & the Captain crawled upon their hands & feet, as near as possible; and when the boatswain approached in sight, so eager was the Captain, that he fired and killed him on the spot; Friday wounded the next man, and a third ran away. Hereupon I advanced with, my whole army: and, it being dark, I ordered the man we had surprised in the boat, to call them by their names, and to parley with them. Accordingly he called out aloud, Tom Smith, Tom Smith! He answered, Who's that? Robinson! answered the other. For God's sake Tom, surrender immediately, or you're all dead men. Who must we surrender to? says Smith. To our captain and fifty men here, who have taken me prisoner, wounded Will Frye, and killed the boatswain. Shall we have quarter then? said he. Hereupon the Captain calls out, You Smith, you know my voice, surrender immediately, and you shall all have your lives granted, except Will Atkins. Hereupon Atkins cries out, What have I done Captain, more than the rest, who have been as bad as me? But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lie,</b> for he was the person that laid hold of him, and bound him. However, he was ordered to submit to the governor's mercy, for such was I called. And so, laying down their arms, we bound them all, and seized on their boat.|$|E
