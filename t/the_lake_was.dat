5|$|In {{its early}} years, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> used for boating, canoeing, curling, and ice skating. By 1899, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> used {{by up to}} 3,000 skaters on weekdays and 10,000 on weekends. The ice-skating house, shared with the golf course, was added in 1902. By 1935, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> used by {{approximately}} 20,000 skaters daily.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> first {{discovered}} by the German Antarctic Expedition of 1938–39. After that, several expeditions have studied the lake's characteristics. The first reconnaissance study of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> carried out by N. G. Kosenko and D. D. Kolobov in early 1969, followed by more studies by Russian and German scientists, namely by W. D. Hermichen et al. (1985), E. Kaup et al. (1988) and A. Loopmann et al. (1988).|$|E
5|$|Fairly Lake {{is located}} within the town of Wolseley. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> created because the CPR dammed up Wolf Creek to provide water for steam locomotives. Grenfell Regional Park is located west of Grenfell.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{a locally}} popular fishing spot. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> mesotrophic.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} <b>the</b> Stracha River basin. <b>The</b> small <b>lake</b> has {{an area of}} 0.61 km ². The {{greatest}} depth of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> 19.7 m, with a maximum width of 0.52 km. The volume of water in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> 4.84 million m ³. The coastline of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> measures 3.74 km, and the water catchment area of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> 4.4 km ².|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{polymictic}} {{with a round}} {{shape and}} a depth which does not have substantial difference. <b>The</b> <b>lake's</b> area <b>is</b> 670,8 ha, the length is 3,9 km, has a width of 2,5 km, and the depth to 2.6 metres. In the Northern part of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> located <b>the</b> island Ostrów Wielki with an area of 21 ha. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> mainly surrounded by forests (about 95%, the rest 5% are fields and pastures). The shore of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> a swamp, and is not easily accessible. The surface of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> covered with vegetation from the water. The main inflow of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> river Rybnica, which carries water from <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> Brzozolasek. <b>The</b> outflow of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> also by <b>the</b> river Rybnica in the South which flows the water to <b>the</b> nearby <b>lake</b> Pogubie Małe. From the Western side of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>the</b> river Zimna flows in.|$|R
5|$|Harveys Lake {{is named}} after Benjamin Harvey, {{a member of the}} Sons of Liberty and among the first {{settlers}} of the Wyoming Valley. Harvey inadvertently discovered the lake in 1781, while returning home after being held as a prisoner of war in Fort Niagara. The first resident in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> Matthew Scouten, who arrived in the early 1790s, but the first settlers were the Worthingtons, who arrived in 1806. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> first surveyed by Christopher Hurlbert in 1794, and the first person of European descent to explore the lake by canoe was Andrew Bennett, in 1800.|$|E
5|$|Lake Harriet was {{donated to}} the city by William S. King in 1885 and the first bandshell on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> built in 1888. The current bandshell, built in 1985, is the fifth one in its location.|$|E
5|$|The park's first bathhouse {{was opened}} in 1911. Swimming in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> allowed until 1973, {{when the city}} opened a pool in the park.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> {{eastern end}} of the Town of Clifton, but {{a small part of}} the east side of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> Town of Piercefield and {{a small part of the}} west side of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> Town of Fine. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> entirely in <b>the</b> south part of Saint Lawrence County, New York.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{a popular}} {{destination}} for cottagers and fishermen alike. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> easily accessible by car with two main roads leading from Highway 41: Hughes Landing Road, {{which has a}} public use boat ramp, and Jacques Bay Road. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{also one of the}} few in the area with an abundance of crown land, so boat traffic on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> usually fairly low.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} tourist and picnic spot in <b>the</b> region. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> famous {{for a variety}} of fish in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and birds in the locale. It is also notable for the scenic sun rise and sun set views near <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by tea plantations where visitors can buy tea products.|$|R
5|$|While {{having no}} {{indigenous}} fish population, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> stocked from 1888 to 1941 {{with a variety}} of fish. Several species have formed self-sustaining populations.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> created, archaeological {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out that showed evidence of occupation since Neolithic times and included Roman artefacts. The lake is an important site for wildlife and has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA). It is a national centre for birdwatching, with over 260 species recorded. The lake has indigenous and migrant water birds throughout the year, and two nature trails have been created. The flora and fauna provide habitats for some less common plants and insects.|$|E
5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} the subject of {{scientific}} studies since the late 1940s, when C. B. Reif conducted limnological studies on it. By the 1960s, Harveys Lake began to develop environmental problems. It was the subject of a number of studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies indicated that <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> eutrophic. Algae blooms caused it to be closed to swimming in 1981 and 1990. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed a phosphorus TMDL for the lake in 2002.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{formed by}} <b>the</b> disbandment of the Antietam Creek. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> stocked {{annually}} with trout.|$|R
50|$|The western {{third of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> in Lee Township; {{the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> in Maisonville Township.|$|R
50|$|Surrounding <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> small {{community}} of Tollgate. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> privately owned but a campground is nearby.|$|R
5|$|In 1984, {{during the}} Antarctic summer when {{phytoplankton}} bloom was apparent, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> studied, {{along with several}} others in the Vestfold Hills area to assess the reduced sulfuric gases by gas chromatography. The gases were trapped in a solid adsorbent – a molecular sieve with 5 Å pores (80–100 mesh) – and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) were detected. The most apparent RSCs were dimethyl sulfide (DMS), carbonyl sulfide and hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, a {{real estate}} {{developer}} dammed an unnamed stream located to the west and south of Sussex Borough and created Lake Neepaulin. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> the center of a planned private lakeside residential community. The lake's name is an amalgamation of the names of the original developer's children. In 2014, Wantage Township acquired the lake from the former non-profit management organization and has opened designated public areas to township residents for recreation. In acquiring the property, the municipality assumed responsibility for repayment of a $1.2 million dam restoration loan from the NJDEP.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca depended on {{a reduction in}} air temperature over the Altiplano {{and an increase in}} precipitation, which may have been caused by shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and increased easterly winds. It was originally supposed that glacial melting might have filled Lake Tauca, but the quantity of water would not have been sufficient to fill the whole lake. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by glacial advance, noticeable at Cerro Azanaques and Tunupa. Elsewhere in South America, water levels and glaciers also expanded during the Lake Tauca phase.|$|E
50|$|Particularly the {{southeast}} of the wetland is covered with reeds. There are agricultural land and meadows in close surroundings of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> <b>The</b> fauna of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> composed of diverse bird species. An island of size 0.15 ha in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> nesting area of velvet duck. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> so a waterfowl habitat of national importance, however, not under protection. The trout in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> consumed as a food and also as a medicine. Observed wildlife {{in the area around}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> bird species eagle, hawk, partridge, wild duck, seagull, quail, woodcock and the mammals hare, fox, wolf.|$|R
2500|$|Access to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{limited to}} {{developed}} marinas {{because most of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by steep sandstone walls: ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{also known}} as similar lakes, dual lakes, replica lakes, and [...] "where <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> same".|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{deep enough}} for the {{development}} of planktonic diatoms, including the dominant Cyclotella choctawatcheeana. Other diatoms noted in Lake Tauca are the benthic Denticula subtilis, the epiphytic Achnanthes brevipes, Cocconeis placentula and Rhopalodia gibberula, the planktonic Cyclotella striata and the tychoplanktonic Fragilaria atomus, Fragilaria construens and Fragilaria pinnata. Epithemia has also been found.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> {{known to}} French explorers as Lac des Prairies. Thomas Spence chose {{the name to}} refer to a new {{republic}} he proposed for the area south of the lake. Métis leader Louis Riel also chose the name, and it was accepted in Ottawa under the Manitoba Act of 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{neighbouring}} Russell {{family of}} Aden were concerned their land would be flooded when <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> built, and their animosity was fully demonstrated when a bridge {{had to be}} jointly constructed by the two landowners over the River Ugie. It was wide enough for carriages on the Pitfour side but too narrow on the Russell's half.|$|E
5000|$|Buffalo Lake: {{the extreme}} {{western edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> in Murray Township; most of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> in Dovray Township ...|$|R
50|$|The area {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> uninhabited {{and protected}} as Kronotsky Nature Reserve, {{a component of}} the Volcanoes of Kamchatka World Heritage Site. The first Russians to reach <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> members of F.P. Ryabushinsky's Kamchatka expedition of 1908; the islands in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>are</b> named after them.|$|R
50|$|The main inflow and outflow {{of water}} from <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> river Tera. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> a {{widening}} of the Tera.|$|R
5|$|Vespasian {{started his}} own {{redevelopment}} of the site around AD70 to 72, possibly funding the construction with booty seized after the Roman victory in the First Jewish-Roman War in AD70. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> in-filled and the site designated as the location for the Flavian Amphitheatre. Reverting the private use by Nero to a more popular social purpose of a colosseum raised Vespasian's popularity. Gladiatorial schools (ludi) and other support buildings were later constructed within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea, much {{of which had been}} torn down.|$|E
5|$|A hunter named Robinson, whose {{cabin was}} at the lake's {{northern}} end about 1800, was the first recorded inhabitant. He gave the lake its earliest known name: Robinson's Lake. However, {{for most of the}} 19th century <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> known as Long Pond, because of its elongated shape. From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon. The stage operated until 1851; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1908, when the modern Pennsylvania Route 487 was built. Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches the lake from the south, then passes to the east of the lake instead.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{developed}} at the shores of Lake Cahuilla. These include Anodonta californiensis and possibly Pisidium casertanum. Anodonta shells are sometimes found within their own tunnels. They were probably used by inhabitants as a food source or to make shell beads. Gastropods identified include Amnicola longinqua, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma trivolvis, Physella ampullacea, Physella humerosa and Tryonia protea. These taxa were relatively abundant at {{the shores of the}} lake. Ostracods include Cypridopsis vidua, Cyprinotus torosa and Limnocythere ceriotuberosa. Sponges have been identified in fossil deposits as well. One mammal found in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>was</b> the muskrat, Ondatra zibethicus.|$|E
50|$|The {{main river}} feeding <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Nam Pung, which {{originates}} in the Phu Phan Mountains south of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> <b>The</b> outflow of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Huai Nam Khan to the southeast, which {{flows into the}} Mekong. The average depth of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> 2-10 meters, however during dry season <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> shrinks as some shallow areas become dry.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> mainly {{used for}} fish breeding; bathing is {{prohibited}} {{due to the}} small size. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> plagued by algae. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> can <b>be</b> reached by Streetcar Line 6 from Innsbruck or on foot from Lans.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> {{shallow and}} weedy, {{which makes it}} well suited for warm-water game fish. Fishing tournaments are held every year on <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Fish found in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>are</b> mostly smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, yellow perch, white perch, redbreast sunfish, pumpkinseed sunfish, crappie, and brown trout; later in <b>the</b> season <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>is</b> also home to pickerel.|$|R
