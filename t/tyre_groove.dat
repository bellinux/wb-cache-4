50|$|The 2009 season saw the re-introduction of slick <b>tyres</b> {{replacing}} the <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> used from 1998 to 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The 1998 season {{brought about}} two {{significant}} technical changes to reduce cornering speeds and aid overtaking. The {{first was the}} reduction of the cars' track, from 2 m to 1.8 m, making them much narrower than in 1997; a previous reduction in track occurred in , when the cars were reduced from 2.15 m to 2 m. The second was the introduction of <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> to replace slicks: the front <b>tyres</b> had three <b>grooves,</b> with four on the rear <b>tyres.</b> <b>Grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> would remain in Formula One until the reintroduction of slicks in [...] For 1998, both McLaren and Benetton switched from Goodyear to Bridgestone tyres, as the Japanese manufacturer expanded to work with six of the eleven teams in their second year competing in the sport. This would result in the two teams who became principal championship protagonists working with different tyre manufacturers. The two top teams from 1997, Williams and Ferrari, opted to retain Goodyear tyres.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} process of a tyre usually involves {{a combination of}} simulation and testing techniques focused on characterizing acoustic/aerodynamic and vibrational phenomena. One of the acoustic phenomenon of interest is the absorption of the tyre, which affects the sound radiated. This properties is mainly related to local resonant effects, which can be changed by modifying the geometry of the tyre tread. A procedure is presented to determine the attenuation achieved due {{to a change in}} tyre tread configuration. The acoustic transfer path is measured from sound produced at one side of the tyre pavement contact area to the other. A miniature microphone and a small monopole with a known output have been developed to allow measurements inside the <b>tyre</b> <b>grooves.</b> <b>Tyre</b> sections with a circumferential groove only, as well as sections with additional side branches, have been evaluated...|$|R
5000|$|The sport's sole tyre supplier, Bridgestone, {{provided}} two specifications of <b>grooved</b> dry <b>tyres</b> for the race, designated Soft (also {{referred to}} as the [...] "prime" [...] tyre) and Super Soft (also {{referred to as}} the [...] "option" [...] tyre). The Super Soft compound was distinguished by a white stripe in one of the <b>tyre's</b> <b>grooves.</b> As was the case for all of the 2008 Grands Prix, the rules stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre {{during the course of the}} race, and each driver was limited to seven sets of dry tyres for the weekend.|$|R
50|$|Slick tyres are not {{suitable}} for use on common road vehicles, which {{must be able to}} operate in all weather conditions. They are used in auto racing where competitors can choose different tyres based on the weather conditions and can often change tyres during a race. Slick tyres provide far more traction than <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> on dry roads, due to their greater contact area but typically have far less traction than <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> under wet conditions. Wet roads severely diminish the traction because of aquaplaning due to water trapped between the tyre contact area and the road surface. <b>Grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> are designed to remove water from the contact area through the grooves, thereby maintaining traction even in wet conditions.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} notable {{for being the}} only season that GP2 used <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> like F1 cars rather than slicks.|$|R
50|$|The chassis is a steel {{space frame}} {{monocoque}} using square seamless steel tubes. The chassis frame design {{is very similar}} to the Formula LGB Swift frame but longer by 100 mm to improve straightline stability. <b>Tyres</b> are <b>grooved</b> racing slicks supplied by JK Tyres' motorsports division.|$|R

5000|$|Goodyear, who had {{supplied}} Williams, Ferrari, Jordan, Sauber and Tyrrell throughout 1998, left Formula One {{at the end}} of the season, leaving Bridgestone as {{the only}} <b>tyre</b> supplier. The <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> introduced in 1998 now had four grooves on all tyres; the front tyres previously had three. Wheels also were required to be tethered to the chassis in order to prevent them flying off in a crash, a feature which remains in place as of [...]|$|R
5000|$|... 2007 : Tuned {{mass damper}} system banned, rev limit of 19,000 rpm introduced, rear wing {{structure}} strengthened to prevent flexing, increased strength required from rear crash structure, single tyre supplier (Bridgestone) after withdrawal of Michelin, revised tyre regulations mean drivers must use both hard and soft compound tyre {{during the course}} of race (soft compound tyres are identified by a white stripe in one of the front <b>tyre</b> <b>grooves),</b> engine development frozen until the end of 2008 to cut costs, further restrictions to regulations means no teams may run a 3rd car on Friday, both sessions on Friday extended to 90 minutes in length, engine changes on first day of practice no longer subject to grid place penalty, pit lane restrictions during any period the safety car is on the track, annual testing limited to 30,000 km to reduce costs.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> were {{introduced}} with three grooves {{in the front}} <b>tyres</b> and four <b>grooves</b> in the rear tyres. Between [...] and , regulations required the tyres to feature a minimum of four grooves in them, {{with the intention of}} slowing the cars down (a slick tyre, with no indentations, is best in dry conditions). They could be no wider than 355 mm at the front and 380 mm at the rear, and the maximum diameter was 660 mm, or 670 mm for wet tyres. Slick tyres were reintroduced at the beginning of , along with aerodynamic changes intended to shift the balance towards mechanical grip in an attempt to increase overtaking.|$|R
50|$|When the 1998 season {{got under}} way four months later {{it became clear that}} Newey had adapted to the rule changes for 1998 best. With the cars now {{narrower}} and running on <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres,</b> the MP4/13 was the car to beat.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{front axle}} and {{steering}} had been re-designed to reduce [...] "bump-steer"and its radiator capacity increased. <b>Grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> were now supplied at the rear. The banjo back axle {{was no longer}} welded but built up from three pieces and its springs were now slung below it.|$|R
50|$|At the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix the <b>tyres</b> had the <b>grooves</b> painted green, {{as part of}} a {{promotion}} by the FIA to reduce the impact of motoring on the environment, called Make Cars Green. The softer of the two types of tyre still had the second innermost groove painted white, as per normal.|$|R
50|$|The chassis is a steel {{spaceframe}} monocoque {{with fire}} retardant composite GRP panels. The design {{is on the}} heavier side, mainly for structural and safety reasons. The steel tubes are of square section and the tyres are supplied by JK <b>Tyres</b> in a <b>grooved</b> slick pattern.The Formula Swift rides on aluminium wheels and both front and rear tyres are 185/60.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{the last}} season for the Honda team before they pulled out of F1 later in December due to the global {{economic}} crisis. Then, Ross Brawn bought the team and renamed it to Brawn GP in February [...] using the Mercedes-Benz engines. This was also the last Formula One season to race with <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres,</b> used since , before slick tyres returned to Formula One in [...]|$|R
50|$|The Ferrari F399 was the {{car with}} which the Ferrari team competed in the 1999 Formula One season. The F399 was almost {{identical}} to the previous season's F300 model, with small detail changes (new front wing, wheel tethers, waisted sidepods, an improved exhaust system {{and the use of}} Bridgestone <b>tyres</b> with four <b>grooves</b> instead of three). It was initially driven by Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine, Mika Salo then substituting for the German when he broke his leg at Silverstone.|$|R
5000|$|The Grand Prix was contested by twelve {{teams with}} two drivers each. The teams (also known as constructors) were Red Bull, Mercedes, McLaren, Ferrari, Renault, Williams, Force India, Sauber, Toro Rosso, Lotus, Hispania and Virgin. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought four different tyre types to the race: two dry compounds (soft [...] "options" [...] and hard [...] "primes) and wet-weather compounds (intermediates and full wet). [...] The Soft compound was distinguished by a green stripe on the tyre's side-walls with the Wet compound tyre identified by a green {{line at the}} bottom of the <b>tyre's</b> central <b>groove.</b> As was the case for all of the 2010 Grands Prix, the rules stipulated that all cars should use both types of tyre during the course of the race unless the driver used any one of two wet-weather compounds. Each driver was limited to eleven sets of dry tyres for the weekend. The circuit organisers installed a new combination kerb on the turn nine apex and artificial grass along with kerbs were extended downstream on the exits of the second and twelfth turns.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the deaths}} of Senna and Ratzenberger, the FIA has used safety {{as a reason to}} impose rule changes that otherwise, under the Concorde Agreement, would have had to be agreed upon by all the teams — most notably the changes {{introduced}} for 1998. This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> to reduce mechanical grip. There were to be four grooves on the front (three in the first year) and rear that ran through the entire circumference of the tyre. The objective was to reduce cornering speeds and to produce racing similar to rainy conditions by enforcing a smaller contact patch between tyre and track. This, according to the FIA, was to promote driver skill and provide a better spectacle.Results have been mixed as the lack of mechanical grip has resulted in the more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic grip — pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, which in turn has resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.|$|R
5000|$|The F1600 is an {{entry-level}} single seater {{modeled after}} the popular Formula Ford. In spite of the small powerplant, its lightweight construction allows for high performance. In v1.1 slicks were removed as a setup option for this car, and only <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> can be fitted: according to Stefano Casillo, the car has too little power to be fun when driven on slicks. As of April 2010, {{this is the only}} car available to demo (unlicensed) users. Casillo had once expressed the will to replace the F1600 with another entry-level single seater with downforce, which would have been easier to drive. However, a recently published interview shows Casillo has apparently changed his mind on the subject.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of various factors affecting {{the severity of}} runway debris lofting mechanisms was investigated by performing numerical simulations and drop weight impact experiments to assess {{the likelihood of a}} stone impact. Geometrical characterisation of stones collected from airfields led to a generic model of a tyre rolling over stones of various shape with different overlaps, orientations, and densities. In numerical simulations of a 0. 4 m diameter aircraft tyre rolling at 70 m/s, a 10 mm diameter spherical stone was lofted at a maximum vertical speed of 35 m/s. For equivalent mass prolate spheroid stones, the loft speeds were 11 to 34 % lower depending on the stone orientation. Objects with flat surfaces exhibited different lofting mechanisms and lower angular velocities. The conditions most conducive to stone lofting were very stiff, small diameter, sharp cornered tyres rolling on ground with a high friction coefficient over spherical stones such that just under half the stone diameter was covered by the tyre. The stone loft speed was approximately proportional to the square root of the tyre tread stiffness. Finally, <b>tyre</b> tread <b>grooves</b> could throw stones upwards at the tyre-ground separation speed, which was 17 m/s for the conditions mentioned earlier...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{completely}} slick tyres are outlawed on most roads due {{to their}} inability to handle wet pavement, the [...] "cheater slick" [...] became a popular item in the hot rod world in the 1960s; a typical slick type tyre, but engraved with the absolute minimal amount of tread grooves required to satisfy legal requirements. Since then, however, tyre development has progressed greatly, so that today's hot rod street cars typically use wide, <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> which perform better than the slicks of the past; while the cheater slicks available today, both for nostalgic appearance of street cars and for competition use in classes where DOT approved street tyres are required, have followed their own line of development, diverging from true slick tyre construction to become a distinct tyre design in themselves.|$|R
50|$|Rain tyres are cut or moulded with {{patterned}} grooves or tread in them. This {{allows the}} tyre to quickly displace the water between {{the ground and}} the rubber on the tyre. If this water is not displaced, the car will experience an effect known as hydroplaning as the rubber will not be in contact with the ground. These grooves do not help the car grip contrary to popular belief, however if these grooves are too shallow, the grip will be impaired in wet conditions as the rubber {{will not be able to}} make good contact with the ground. The patterns are designed to displace water as quickly as possible to the edges of the tyre or into specially cut channels in the centre of the <b>tyre.</b> Not all <b>groove</b> patterns are the same. Optimal patterns depend on the car and the conditions. The grooves are also designed to generate heat when lateral forces are applied to the tyre.|$|R
25|$|Further, from 1995 {{designs were}} {{required}} {{to be drawn from}} a reference plane (template), and strict limitations were enforced as to the minimum and maximum tolerances for aspects of the vehicle such as the size of the cockpit opening (an idea well known in Champ Car for a decade) and of aerodynamic devices, commonly called wings. Further, maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.5 litres to 3 litres. Further changes were mandated as the FIA continued to try to curb the increase in speeds of Formula One cars as the years progressed. These changes included the increase in size of the cockpit opening (to ensure driver egress was easy and to minimise possible side head impacts), introducing <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> (to reduce cornering speeds by reducing grip) and narrower bodywork (this would complicate cooling and also reduce cornering speed), raising and reducing wing sizes and elements (cutting aerodynamic downforce, thus reducing cornering speed), and introducing comprehensive checks on stiffness tolerances and measurements to ensure cars conformed completely with the regulations (for example, weight tests on wings and bodywork to ensure that they maintained integrity and did not flex to give an aerodynamic advantage in a straight line).|$|R
2500|$|Throughout the race, drivers {{may make}} pit stops to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, {{they could also}} refuel). Different teams and drivers employ {{different}} pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over {{the course of a}} race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds.

500|$|After {{the deaths}} of drivers Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, {{worldwide}} media attention focused on the charismatic triple-world champion Senna, rather than Ratzenberger, a virtual unknown driving for the minor Simtek team. Mosley {{did not go to}} Senna's funeral, but attended that of Ratzenberger. In a press conference 10years later Mosley said, [...] "I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his." [...] In the aftermath of the deaths, {{and a number of other}} serious accidents, Mosley announced the formation of the Advisory Expert Group chaired by Professor Sid Watkins, to research and improve safety in motor racing. Watkins, who learned of his new role by hearing Mosley announce it on the radio, has called it a [...] "novel and revolutionary approach". The resulting changes included reducing the capacity and power of engines, the use of <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> to reduce cornering speeds, the introduction of the HANS device to protect drivers' necks in accidents, circuit re-design and greatly increased requirements for crash testing of chassis. Mosley was criticised for some of the very rapid changes announced in the immediate aftermath of the deaths at the San Marino race.|$|R
50|$|The Benetton B197 had a lacklustre {{opening to}} the 1997 season at Melbourne but the team and Berger bounced back at the 1997 Brazilian Grand Prix, with Berger {{finishing}} second having overtaken Mika Häkkinen and Michael Schumacher. Berger then scored Benetton's final Grand Prix victory {{at the age of}} 37, again at Hockenheim, coming back after a 3 race layoff following illness and {{the death of his father}} in an aeroplane crash. As well as the victory, Berger also claimed pole position and fastest lap during the 1997 German Grand Prix. He announced his decision to leave Benetton at the end of the season during the same weekend. He eventually retired at the end of the season, his final race seeing him finish a very close fourth in Jerez only seconds behind the victor Mika Häkkinen. In his final season as a Formula One driver, Berger and Alesi out-qualified each other 7 times each with the Austrian missing three races due to illness. Rumours of a Ferrari return for 1998 were false. Sauber offered Berger a drive for 1998, but the Austrian turned down the offer for a number of reasons, not least because of the new regulations for <b>grooved</b> <b>tyres</b> which the Austrian did not find inspiring.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, Mosley {{agreed with}} Balestre that the Frenchman would stand down as {{president}} of the FIA in Mosley's favour, in return for the new role of President of the FIA Senate, to be created after Mosley's election. As well as motorsport, the FIA's remit includes the interests of motorists worldwide, an area in which Mosley wanted to involve himself: [...] "That is what really interested me: F1 you maybe save one life every five years, whereas in road safety you are talking about thousands of lives". A challenge to Mosley's election by Jeffrey Rose, chairman of the British Royal Automobile Club, was withdrawn {{when it became clear that}} the majority of voters were already committed to Mosley. The FISA was then merged into the FIA as its sporting arm.

Mosley was criticised for some of the very rapid changes announced in the immediate aftermath of the deaths at the San Marino race. In 1995, a deal was signed between Ecclestone and the FIA that passed all of the commercial rights to Formula One to him for 15 years, on the condition that they would return to the FIA at the end of that period. Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new digital television technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said [...] "My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long." [...] The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15 years, An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission. Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams. They refused to sign the 1997 Concorde Agreement without increased financial returns and threatened to make a complaint under European Union competition rules. The European Commission was already investigating the FIA’s agreement with Ecclestone in what Lovell calls a [...] "highly personal and bitter battle between Max Mosley and commissioner Karel van Miert".|$|R
