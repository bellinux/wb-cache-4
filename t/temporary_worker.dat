5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains an attractive <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> to take her place while she is on maternity leave, and enlists Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) support when she tries to show that Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) finds her replacement attractive.

While Derek is at work, he greets <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), who, believing Derek was flirting with her, {{attempts}} to seduce him throughout the film. Derek repeatedly rejects her, but Lisa continues to pursue him, making sexual advances on him at the Christmas party {{and at one point}} she follows him to his car in the parking garage and attempts to seduce him with revealing lingerie and fishnet stockings but Derek refuses again and forces her out of his car. Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows him into his hotel room. He confronts Lisa again the following day, and hours later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide by drug overdose, and calls for medical help.|$|E

However, the shift from permanent to <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> began long before. This paper empirically explores links between the shift from permanent to <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> in the Japanese manufacturing sector and economic globalization, using industry-level data. We find that outsourcing is positively correlated with the replacement of permanent <b>workers</b> with <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> in domestic production. In addition, we find that industries losing world share of value added tend to decrease the employment of permanent workers. Industries with higher exports or imports are aggressive in using <b>temporary</b> <b>workers,</b> which suggests the role of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> as an employment buffer...|$|R
40|$|In Canada, <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> {{account for}} 14 per cent {{of jobs in}} the non-farm {{business}} sector, are present in a range of industries, and account for 40 per cent of the total job reallocation. Yet most models of job reallocation abstract from <b>temporary</b> <b>workers.</b> This paper evaluates the importance of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> in job reallocation in a multi-sector model with costly labour adjustment and <b>temporary</b> <b>workers.</b> The calibrated model captures some features of job reallocation in Canada. The paper shows that the adjustment cost parameters for permanent workers are underestimated if <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> are ignored. It also shows that when a shock occurs where permanent workers bear the brunt of reallocation (e. g. the 2005 - 2008 commodity price boom and the appreciation of the Canadian dollar), aggregate adjustment costs are underestimated if <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> are not accounted for.

We find that plants tend to hire <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> when their output can be expected to fall, a result consistent with the notion that firms use <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> to reduce costs associated with dismissing permanent employees. In addition, we find that plants whose future output levels are subject to greater uncertainty tend to use more <b>temporary</b> <b>workers.</b> We also examine the effects of wage and benefit levels for permanent workers, unionization rates, turnover rates, seasonal factors, and plant size and age on the use of temporary workers; based on our results, we discuss various views of why firms use <b>temporary</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>workers,</b> output fluctuations...|$|R
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a <b>temporary</b> <b>worker</b> Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) so {{that she}} can take her place when she goes on {{maternity}} leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between the use of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> and the adoption of new forms of work organisation (NFWO) in production. This study aims to understand to what extent these two forms of human resources flexibility are synergic or mutually exclusive. In order to answer this main goal, we discuss different levels of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> adoption in relation to different levels of use of NFWO, the level of integration of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> within the overall production organisation and the joint and synergistic use of NFWO and temporary work. Evidence drawn from seven case studies in manufacturing plants in northern Italy is provided. Results highlight that, according to the characteristics of the production process, <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> and NFWO are not mutually exclusive, that <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> can be integrated with other workers in the shop floor, and that NFWO can also be adopted for <b>temporary</b> <b>workers.</b> In addition, NFWO has been proven to be a key enabler to integrate <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> within the organisation, thus showing an important synergistic effect between the two human resource flexibility practices...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to offer}} a {{typology}} of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers,</b> based on their motives for accepting their work arrangement, which includes voluntary, involuntary and stepping-stone motives, and relate this typology to various individual and work-related variables. Design/methodology/approach – Latent class analysis of 645 European workers was used to construct a typology of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers.</b> Variation of individual and work-related variables between types of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> was analyzed using ANOVA. Findings – The analyses {{suggest that there are}} three types of workers: involuntary <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> highlight the involuntary motive and the stepping-stone motive; the stepping-stone type stresses the stepping-stone motive only, and the non-involuntary group disagrees with all three motives. Moreover, the groups differed significantly on important work-related variables such as occupational position, tenure, employability, and work-involvement. However, differences in individual variables were limited. Research limitations/implications – The research puts forward a more complex typology of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers</b> than is usually suggested. Moreover, the study shows a non-involuntary group for which temporary employment can become a trap, and hence these workers should be targeted by future policy and interventions. Originality/value – The research offers a typology of <b>temporary</b> <b>workers,</b> which is founded on motivation theory, and existing research on motives for accepting temporary employment.

500|$|The Office employs an {{ensemble}} cast. Many characters portrayed by The Office cast {{are based on}} the British version of the show. While these characters normally have the same attitude and perceptions as their British counterparts, the roles have been redesigned to better fit the American show. The show is known for its generally large cast size, with many of its actors and actresses known particularly for their improvisational work. Steve Carell stars as Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch. Loosely based on David Brent, Gervais' character in the British version, Scott is a well-intentioned man whose attempts at humor, while seemingly innocent to himself, often offend and annoy his peers and employees, and in some situations lead to reprimanding from his superiors. Rainn Wilson portrays Dwight Schrute, who, based upon Gareth Keenan, is a salesman and the Assistant to the Regional Manager, a fictional title created by Michael. John Krasinski portrays Jim Halpert, a salesman and, in later seasons, co-manager who is often known for his wittiness and his hijinks on Schrute (often accompanied by Pam Beesly). Halpert is based upon Tim Canterbury, and is known to have feelings for Pam, the receptionist. Pam, played by Jenna Fischer, is based on Dawn Tinsley. [...] She is shy, but in many cases a cohort with Jim in his pranks on Dwight. B. J. Novak portrays Ryan Howard, who for the first two seasons is a <b>temporary</b> <b>worker,</b> but is promoted to sales representative in the third season. He later ascends to the position of Vice President, North East Region and Director of New Media until his treachery was exposed for corporate fraud and he was fired.

After inquiring who this mysterious Tom is, Phyllis tells Michael that he worked in accounting several years ago and committed suicide.
