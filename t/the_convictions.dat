5|$|Brzeczek {{forwarded}} {{the letter}} to State's Attorney Daley. Daley never replied, and charges were never brought against any officers.

5|$|National Security Advisor John Poindexter {{was convicted}} of five counts of conspiracy, {{obstruction}} of justice, perjury, defrauding the government, and the alteration and destruction of evidence.

5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> were ultimately overturned.|$|E

5|$|During a BBC Newsnight {{discussion}} of the case, Lord Scarman, a former Law Lord, said <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> ought to be overturned. Gareth Peirce obtained another psychologist's report about Raghip and, supported by Raghip's MP Michael Portillo, asked the Home Secretary to review the case. She also submitted an application to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the way Raghip had been interviewed breached the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 1990 Home Secretary Kenneth Baker referred Raghip's case back to the Court of Appeal.|$|E
5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.|$|E

His Lordship said: [...] "The court cannot be sure the confessions are reliable. It follows that <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> is unsafe. <b>The</b> <b>conviction</b> is quashed." ...|$|R
5|$|In 2001–03, three Bosnian Serb {{officials}} were tried by the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia for war crimes committed after the capture of Bosanski Šamac.

The three were found guilty, and <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> upheld in the appeals process. Simić was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while Tadić and Zarić received prison terms of eight and six years respectively.|$|E
5|$|In an {{incident}} {{for which he}} would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given {{to a group of}} Waffen-SS soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E
5|$|Oliver North and John Poindexter {{were indicted}} on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, {{was found guilty}} by a jury of three felony counts. <b>The</b> <b>convictions</b> were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran–Contra Scandal.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June, {{seven of}} the {{defendants}} were sentenced to life imprisonment, four to fifteen years in prison, {{two to five years}} and one to two years. After they protested loudly when the sentence was read, they were forcibly removed from the court. Amnesty International concluded that an appeal session on 6 September had heard no evidence to support charges. The military appeal court hearing on 28 September took a few minutes before the court upheld all <b>the</b> <b>convictions.</b> In November, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry asked for a retrial in civilian courts, because they were convicted in military courts.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{appointed}} Landis {{a federal}} judge in 1905. Landis received national attention in 1907 when he fined Standard Oil of Indiana more than $29million for violating federal laws forbidding rebates on railroad freight tariffs. Though Landis was reversed on appeal, he was seen as a judge determined to rein in big business. During and after World War I, Landis presided over several high-profile trials of draft resisters and others whom he saw as opposing the war effort. He imposed heavy sentences on those who were convicted; some of <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> were reversed on appeal, and other sentences were commuted.|$|E
5|$|Rakočević, Sabolović, Radojčić and {{two other}} former KOS agents were tried in Belgrade in 1993. The five were charged with {{instigation}} of terrorism and other crimes, but all were acquitted. Radojčić was arrested again in Zagreb in late 1993. The second Trial of Radojčić and eight other suspects charged in connection with Operations Labrador and Opera, held in Zagreb, ended with the acquittal of Radojčić and Ratomir Mažibrada, who were in custody, and <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> of the other defendants who were all tried in absentia.|$|E

5000|$|R v Paul Chambers (appealed to the High Court as Chambers v Director of Public Prosecutions), {{popularly known}} as the Twitter Joke Trial, was a United Kingdom legal case centred on <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> of a man under the Communications Act 2003 for posting a Twitter joke about {{destroying}} an airport, a message which police regarded as [...] "menacing". <b>The</b> <b>conviction</b> was widely condemned as a miscarriage of justice, and was appealed three times, <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> being quashed {{as a result of}} the third appeal.|$|R

5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose was three months, and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped <b>the</b> <b>convictions.</b> A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E
5|$|According to the prosecution's theory, {{the assassin}} shot Goebel from the {{secretary}} of state's office {{on the first floor}} of a building next to the state capitol. However, much of the testimony against the accused men was conflicting, and some of it was later proven to be perjured. Most of the state's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats. The appellate courts, however, were largely Republican, and <b>the</b> <b>convictions</b> returned by the lower courts were often overturned, with the cases being remanded for new trials. Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900, January 1902, and April 1903; his final appeal failed, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Powers was also convicted three times—in July 1900, October 1901, and August 1903; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in a hung jury. In 1908, Powers and Howard were pardoned by Republican governor Augustus E. Willson. Months later, Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment. Despite the pardon, Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928. Youtsey, the only defendant not to appeal his sentence, was paroled in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black.|$|E
50|$|Bevel's {{attorney}} {{requested that}} the Court of Appeals of Virginia abate <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> (which would have cleared Bevel's name) {{on account of his}} death. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether there was good cause not to abate <b>the</b> <b>conviction.</b> <b>The</b> trial court found that abating <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> would deny <b>the</b> victim the closure that she sought and denied the motion to abate. The Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment. Bevel's attorney appealed the denial of the abatement motion to the Supreme Court of Virginia. In an opinion issued November 4, 2011, the Supreme Court held that abatement of criminal convictions was not available in Virginia under the circumstances of Bevel's case. Because the executor of Bevel's estate had not sought to prosecute the appeal, the Court affirmed <b>the</b> <b>conviction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Exoneration {{occurs when}} <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> {{for a crime}} is reversed, either through {{demonstration}} of innocence, a flaw in <b>the</b> <b>conviction,</b> or otherwise. Attempts to exonerate convicts are particularly controversial in death penalty cases, especially where new evidence is put forth after the execution has taken place.|$|R
50|$|On appeal, the Quebec Court of Appeal {{ruled that}} there were errors in the trial judge's {{instructions}} to the jury with respect to Cinous' claim of self-defence, and ordered <b>the</b> <b>conviction</b> overturned and a new trial.
