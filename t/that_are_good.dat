5|$|The nuclei {{of several}} hafnium {{isotopes}} can each absorb multiple neutrons. This makes hafnium a good material {{for use in}} the control rods for nuclear reactors. Its neutron-capture cross-section is about 600 times that of zirconium. (Other elements <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>good</b> neutron-absorbers for control rods are cadmium and boron.) Excellent mechanical properties and exceptional corrosion-resistance properties allow its use in the harsh environment of pressurized water reactors. The German research reactor FRM II uses hafnium as a neutron absorber. It is also common in military reactors, particularity in US naval reactors, but seldom found in civilian ones, the first core of the Shippingport Atomic Power Station (a conversion of a naval reactor) being a notable exception.|$|E

Those <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>good</b> jumpers usually are primarily adapted for speed, and execute moving jumps by simply swimming {{to the surface}} at a high velocity.

25|$|The MRL mouse is {{a strain}} of mouse that {{exhibits}} remarkable regenerative abilities for a mammal. By comparing the differential gene expression of scarless healing MRL mice and a poorly-healing C57BL/6 mouse strain, 36 genes have been identified <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>good</b> candidates for studying how the healing process differs in MRL mice and other mice. Study of the regenerative process in these animals is aimed at discovering how to duplicate them in humans, such as deactivation of the p21 gene.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>good</b> representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E

2500|$|Utilitarianism is {{typically}} taken {{to assess the}} rightness or wrongness of an action by considering just {{the consequences of that}} action. Bentham very carefully distinguishes motive from intention and says that motives are not in themselves good or bad but can be referred to as such on account of their tendency to produce pleasure or pain. He adds that, [...] "from every kind of motive, may proceed actions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>good,</b> others that are bad, and others that are indifferent." [...] Mill makes a similar point and explicitly says that [...] "motive {{has nothing to do with}} the morality of the action, though much with the worth of the agent. He who saves a fellow creature from drowning does what is morally right, whether his motive be duty, or the hope of being paid for his trouble." ...|$|E
