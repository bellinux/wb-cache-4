50|$|The Association {{was founded}} as the National Printing Equipment Association in 1933 in {{response}} to the U.S. government’s call for industries to organize to develop codes of fair practice to promote economic recovery during the Great Depression. The 26 charter member companies included manufacturers of printing presses, bindery equipment, <b>typesetting</b> <b>machinery</b> and specialty equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The old Firestone Building at {{the corner}} of East Genesee and South State streets in Syracuse was {{purchased}} to house both newspapers. Hearst paid $150,000 for the building which was described as [...] "a large and admirably adapted building {{in the heart of the}} Syracuse business district." [...] He also spent an additional $150,000 on the purchase and installation of machinery, presses, <b>typesetting</b> <b>machinery</b> and remodeling the building to make it a [...] "thoroughly modern and a completely equipped newspaper publishing plant." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{point was}} defined as 1/12 of a pica {{consisting}} of 1/6 of an inch truncated to thousandths of an inch (1/12 of 0.166 inches) in the USA in 1886 and was quickly adopted by Britain and its colonies;. This number has been approximated in various ways depending on the technology, prejudices, and information available to engineers involved {{in the production of}} <b>typesetting</b> <b>machinery</b> since then. Common approximations in use are 1/72.27 inch (now equal to 0.3514598 mm) and simply 1/72 of an inch. Other typographic points are used in other countries.|$|E
5000|$|A related {{characteristic}} of cam-operated chuckers {{is that they}} are fading into history faster than most other non-CNC machine tool classes. This is because the few companies that have them tend to be forced to continually adapt to the latest state of the art (which today is all CNC) in order to compete and thus survive. Cam-op chuckers may end up in scrap yards more easily than other types of non-CNC machine tools. Unlike with [...] "Grandpa's South Bend lathe" [...] or [...] "Dad's old Bridgeport knee mill", virtually no one can afford to keep and use them for sentimental reasons alone. As has happened with most nondigital commercial <b>typesetting</b> <b>machinery</b> (such as old Linotype machines), it seems likely that within a few decades the only examples of these machines still extant will be a few museum pieces and a few obscure pockets of abandoned inventory. This is not because they are [...] "primitive" [...] by any means—in fact, they are mechanical marvels with ingenious design and high build quality. The change simply reflects the fact that CNC and CAD/CAM have become so advanced and flexible that {{it will be hard to}} compete with them.|$|E
5000|$|When {{high-speed}} rotary presses became available, {{together with}} <b>typesetting</b> <b>machinery,</b> it became {{possible to have}} press runs {{in the hundreds of}} thousands, with frequent updates throughout the day. By 1912 there were 4000 newspapers, printing 5 to 6,000,000,000 copies of the year. New technology made illustrations more feasible, and photographs began appearing. Advertising was now an important feature. Nevertheless, all newspapers focused on their own city, and there was no national newspaper of the sort that flourished in Britain, nor chains owned by one company such as those becoming common in the United States. All the political parties relied heavily on their own newspapers to inform and rally their supporters. For example, there were 870 papers in 1912 pitched to conservative readers, 580 aimed at liberal elements, 480 aimed at the Roman Catholics of the Centre party, and 90 affiliated with the Socialist party. [...] The first German newspaper aimed at a mass audience was the Berliner Morgenpost, Founded in 1898 by publisher Hermann Ullstein. It focused on local news, with very thorough coverage of its home city, ranging from the palaces to the tenements, along with lists of sporting events, streetcar schedules and shopping tips. By 1900 it reached 200,000 subscribers. A rival appeared in 1904, the BZ am Mittag, with a flair for the spectacular and sensational in city life, especially fires, crime and criminals.|$|E
