5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm.

This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E

5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify exactly how many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many}} times it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
5|$|The classic {{point in}} polygon test from {{computational}} geometry applies the above ideas. To {{determine if a}} point lies within a polygon, one casts a ray from infinity to the point and counts <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> the ray crosses the edge of polygon. The crossing number is even {{if and only if}} the point is outside the polygon. This algorithm works because if the ray never crosses the polygon, then its crossing number is zero, which is even, and the point is outside. Every time the ray does cross the polygon, the crossing number alternates between even and odd, and the point at its tip alternates between outside and inside.|$|E
5|$|The playoff {{structure}} {{used from}} 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some because of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> {{it failed to}} match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) {{the team with the}} second-best win-loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with {{the best record in the}} other conference, but only the third-best in the league, would advance to the championship game.|$|E

5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, multiplied by <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> {{that the letter}} appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels {{so long as they}} have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|Director Mitsuo Fukuda {{stated that}} {{initially}} {{the story of}} Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> Kira cried in Gundam SEED {{by the time the}} book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a set number of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which determine <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> a character can use magical attacks; strength, {{the power of a}} character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E
