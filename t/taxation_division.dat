40|$|This paper uses a {{model of}} {{endogenous}} theft and endogenous network division of labour to formalise {{some of the main}} principles of the economics of the state and to explore related issues why new constitutional rules emerge and evolve. First, we develop a two good consumer-producer model with endogenous specialization and endogenous stealing. Following this we introduce a Sovereign's decision to collect tax and to allocate tax revenue between her consumption and enforcement of property rights into the model. Finally, we use this framework to examine trade-offs between the positive effects of third party property rights protection, and the negative effects of <b>taxation,</b> on the <b>division</b> of labour. We illustrate our results using the growth of the states' system in Western Europe...|$|R
