40|$|At CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland, a new modern {{particle}} accelerator called the LHC, Large Hadron Collider, is being projected. One {{of the four}} large detectors of the LHC, ALICE, consists of many sub-detectors. Temperature stability in ALICE is of great importance for the experiments performed here.   In the ALICE sub-detector TPC, Time Projection Chamber, {{there is a great}} risk for thermal instability.   This will cause false data in the experiments, and therefore it is imperative {{to come to terms with}} the problem. One suggested solution is to install a water-cooled <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> around the TPC detector. The task of this thesis work was to design the new <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> and to evaluate its thermal abilities by computer simulations. Then, this chosen screen was to be simulated together with the TPC and its drift gas and the results studied. It was also desirable to see what would happen in case of parts of the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> malfunctioning.   Several different designs of the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> have been made and analysed, and the most efficient model has been selected. The chosen model succeeded in keeping a fairly homogenous temperature level and also had good cooling abilities. All simulations were made using the computer software STAR-CD. The next phase of the project involved modelling the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> around the TPC field cage containing drift gas of a certain temperature.   The results of the simulations show that the performance of the cooling <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> is unsatisfactory. Although the screen itself seems to work efficiently, it does not succeed in keeping the TPC at an acceptable temperature level. The screen temperature rises more than the desired maximum of 0. 5 K. The scenario with parts of the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> malfunctioning resulted in temperature peaks of + 2 K, which is unacceptable.  The conclusions drawn are therefore that the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> must be allowed to be thicker or a new solution must be found. The idea of a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> is a good one, but the limitations in the design of the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> must be redefined if the cooling problem is to be solved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{commercial}} greenhouse {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective cultivation methods with a yield per cultivated area up to 10 times more than free land cultivation but the use of fossil fuels in this production field is very high. The objectives of this paper are to modeling and experimental evaluation of heat and mass transfer functions in an innovative solar greenhouse with <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> For this propose, a semi-solar greenhouse was designed and constructed at the North-West of Iran in Azerbaijan Province (38 ° 10 ′N and 46 ° 18 ′E with elevation of 1364 m above the sea level). The inside environment factors include inside air temperature below screen (Ta), inside air temperature above screen (Tas), crop temperature (Tc), inside soil temperature (Ts), cover temperature (Tri) and <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> temperature (Tsc) were collected as the experimental data samples. The dynamic heat and mass transfer model used to estimate the temperature in six different points of the semi-solar greenhouse with initial values and consider the crop evapotranspiration. The results showed that dynamic model can predict the inside temperatures in four different points (Ta, Tc, Tri, Ts) with MAPE, RMSE and EF about 5 – 7 %, 1 – 2 °C and 80 – 91 % for greenhouse without <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> and about 3 – 7 %, 0. 6 – 1. 8 °C and 89 – 96 % for six different points of greenhouse with <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> (Ta, Tc, Tri, Ts, Tas, Tsc), respectively. The results of using <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> at night (12 h) in autumn showed that this method can decrease the use of fossil fuels up to 58 % and so decrease the final cost and air pollution. This movable insulation caused about 15 °C difference between outside and inside air temperature and also made about 6 °C difference between Ta and Tas. The experimental results showed that inside <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> can decrease the crop temperature fluctuation at night...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} {{the influence of a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> on: the greenhouse microclimate, energy savings and crop transpiration. Measurements were carried out during winter in a glasshouse cultivated with a rose crop and equipped with an aluminized <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> Air temperature and humidity were recorded at 0. 3 m, 0. 8 m and 1. 8 m high inside the greenhouse. Net radiation over and under the thermal screen; and under the rose crop, leaf temperature and crop transpiration were simultaneously monitored. The results indicated that the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> induced a more homogeneous microclimate, and increased air temperature and canopy temperature by about 2. 5 °C and 3 °C respectively. Canopy net radiation was increased while transpiration was similar in both cases, showing cyclic fluctuations that appeared to be due to internal physiological control processes rather than to response to microclimatic variables. The air vapour pressure deficit VPD in {{the lower part of the}} canopy was similar in both cases, as well as the canopy to air VPD and the dew-point temperature. These results suggest that the use of a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> brings several advantages, such as a more homogeneous greenhouse microclimate, a reduction in heat consumption and a significant increase in canopy temperature in the lower part of the crop, but does not improve the humidity conditions...|$|E

40|$|Although thermal screens {{were already}} {{introduced}} {{more than twenty}} years ago in Western European glasshouse horticulture, growers were discouraged to install them in their glasshouse, since they were not able to quantify the crop's behaviour under a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> Nowadays, crop monitoring techniques have become commercially available, which might aid growers to support their decision to adapt their climate control set points once a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> is installed. In this study, leaf temperature, stem diameter and sap flow measurements were performed on glasshouse tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Clothilde') grown inside two compartments in Beitem, Belgium during spring 2008. In one compartment, a movable and semi-transparent <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> was used during the night. Differences in leaf temperature between the two compartments were observed, which were mainly caused by differences in air temperature, although differences in radiative energy losses also had {{to be taken into account}} in the upper canopy layer in the case of cold nights. Based on these results, it is advised to include leaf temperature measurements in research concerning the effect of the use of thermal screens. Additionally, a reduced water uptake was observed in the morning when the screen was still closed, whereas during the evening hours no difference in water uptake could be revealed. However, when the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> was closed in the evening, stem diameter measurements indicated that the internal water storage pools were restored more quickly under the screen. It is, however, acknowledged that these effects were only observed on sunny days. Consequently, in addition to leaf temperature measurements, sap flow and stem diameter measurements can provide growers and researchers useful feedback from the crop itself, when <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> application strategies are to be evaluated. As a general conclusion, it was stated that these crop monitoring techniques are imperative when novel techniques are to be introduced in glasshouse horticulture in a sustainable way...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study was to design and test a system capable of dehumidifying air in a {{greenhouse}} when a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> is in use. Dehumidification is required to reduce the risk of fungal diseases and prevent physiological disorders. The most common procedure used to remove moisture from a greenhouse fitted with a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> is to open slightly the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> This causes an exchange between the relatively dry air above the screen and the humid air below the screen. However, this procedure is difficult to control and it can cause horizontal temperature differences in the greenhouse, which negatively effect crop production. In the dehumidification system proposed here, outside air is exchanged at low level with greenhouse air. This ventilation with cool dry outside air is mechanically controlled using an air distribution system. The dry air is injected near the greenhouse floor thereby forcing humid air to pass through the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> The excess air in the greenhouse then flows out through leaks in the cover. The airflow required by the system throughout the year, being dependent on the evaporation of the crop and the outside conditions, was determined using a greenhouse-climate simulation model. The model was validated using climate data from the commercial greenhouse where the system was installed. The dimensions of the system were calculated from the results of the model and a control strategy was suggested. The model calculations showed that using outside air for vapour removal is more energy efficient than using air from above the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> The distribution of climate in the greenhouse using the conventional and proposed methods of vapour removal was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The system was tested in a commercial greenhouse and compared to a conventional system at the same location. The performance of the system, as determined by the dynamic simulation model, proved to be efficient and the climate proved to be more homogenous, as was predicted by the CFD calculation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to dimension a system capable of removing water vapour mainly generated by evaporation of the crop when a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> is applied. The humid greenhouse air is replaced by cold dry outside air using an air distribution system. The dry air is injected above the greenhouse floor thereby forcing humid air to pass through the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> The excess air in the greenhouse will flow away though leaks in the cover. The common procedure to remove moisture from the greenhouse where a <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> is applied is by slightly opening the screen. This results in an air exchange of relatively dry air from above the screen and the humid air below the screen. This procedure is difficult to control and causes horizontal temperature differences in the greenhouse. By mechanically controlling the exchange of the greenhouse air and outside air these problems can be resolved. The airflow through the system needed over the year resulting from the evaporation of the crop and the outside conditions is determined using a greenhouse simulation model KASPRO. Based on this result the dimensions of the system are calculated and a control strategy is suggested. The KASPRO calculations also showed that using outside air for vapour removal is more energy-efficient as using the air above the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> The greenhouse climate resulting from using the conventional method of vapour removal as well as with the forced ventilation is investigated using CFD. The three dimensional CFD calculations show that the climate using the forced ventilation system is much more homogenous and the control is more efficient compared to the conventional method of vapour removal. The system proves to be economical since investment costs are low (expected to be around 3 EURO/m 2 maximum) and it ensures a proper well-controlled climate under the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> resulting in a higher use of the screen through the year. The system is currently being tested in practise at a Dutch commercial tomato grower...|$|E

Titanium clad MgB 2 conductor is used to afford a bending power greater than 5 T. m at 10 K. A specific cryogenic design is needed to cool down this 10 m long and 12. 8 m in diameter magnet.

40|$|Greenhouse microclimate, energy savings, {{and crop}} {{transpiration}} were investigated during winter in a glass-covered greenhouse cultivated with a rose crop and {{equipped with an}} aluminized <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> Air temperature and humidity profiles were recorded at 0. 3, 0. 8, and 1. 8 m heights inside the greenhouse. Net radiation over and under the rose crop, heating pipe temperature, canopy temperature at 0. 3 and 0. 8 m, and transpiration rate were simultaneously measured and recorded. When compared to unscreened conditions, {{it was found that}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> provided a more homogeneous microclimate and increased the average air temperature and canopy temperature at 0. 8 m by about 2. 5 °C and 3. 0 °C, respectively. The latter result was attributed to the observed increase (about 100 %) in the net radiation absorbed by the canopy, along with reflection of long-wave radiation by the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen.</b> Higher canopy-to-air vapor pressure deficits (+ 0. 3 kPa) were observed in the lower layer (bent shoots) under screened conditions. Canopy transpiration rate was of the same order of magnitude in both cases. Energy savings due to the screen was estimated to be about 15 %. The body of results underlines that the basic effect of the studied screen on crop behavior was the doubling of the net radiation absorbed by the canopy, with positive consequences on both air and canopy temperature, and therefore on growth, development, and sanitary conditions of the rose plants...|$|E

40|$|The CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) {{laboratory}} {{is currently}} building the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Four international collaborations have designed (and are now constructing) detectors able {{to exploit the}} physics potential of this collider. Among them is the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), a general purpose detector optimized for the search of Higgs boson and for physics beyond the Standard Model of fundamental interactions between elementary particles. This thesis presents, in particular, the design, construction, commissioning and test of the control system for a screen that provides a thermal separation between the Tracker and ECAL (Electromagnetic CALorimeter) detector of CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid experiment). Chapter 1 introduces the new challenges posed by these installations and deals, more in detail, with the Tracker detector of CMS. The size of current experiments for high energy physics is {{comparable to that of}} a small industrial plant: therefore, the techniques used for controls and regulations, although highly customized, must adopt Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) hardare and software. The âﾜslow controlâ systems for the experiments at CERN make extensive use of PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) to provide safety levels (namely interlocks), regulations, remote control of high and low voltages distributions, as well as archiving and trending facilities. The system described in this thesis must follow the same philosophy and, at the same time, comply with international engineering standards. While the interlocks applications belong straightforwardly to the category of DES (Discrete Event System), and are therefore treated with a Finite State Machine approach, other controls are more strictly related to the regulation problem. Chapter 2 will focus on various aspects of modern process control and on the tools used to design the control system for the thermal screen: the principles upon which the controller is designed and tuned, and the model validated, including the Multiple Input-Multiple Output (MIMO) problematics are explained. The <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> itself, the constraints and the basis of its functioning are described in Chapter 3, where the thermodynamical design is discussed as well. For the LHC experiments, the aim of a control system is also to provide a well defined SIL (Safety Interlock Level) to keep the system in a safe condition; yet, in this case, it is necessary to regulate the temperature of the system within certain values and respect the constraints arising from the specific needs of the above mentioned subsystems. The most natural choice for a PLC-based controller is a PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) controller. This kind of controller is widely used in many industrial process, from batch production in the pharmaceutics or automotive field to chemical plants, distillation columns and, in general, wherever a reliable and robust control is needed. In order to design and tune PID controllers, many techniques are in use; the approach followed in this thesis is that of black-box modeling: the system is modeled in the time domain, a transfer function is inferred and a controller is designed. Then, a system identification procedure allows for a more thorough study and validation of the model, and for the controller tuning. Project of the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> control including system modeling, controller design and MIMO implementation issues are entirely covered in Chapter 4. A systems engineering methodology has been followed all along to adequately manage and document every phase of the project, complying with time and budget constraints. A risk analysis has been performed, using Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) and Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP), to understand the level of protection assured by the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> and its control components. Tests planned and then performed to validate the model and for quality assurance purposes are described in Chapter 5. A climatic chamber has been designed and built at CERN, where the real operating conditions of the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> are simulated. Detailed test procedures have been defined, following IEEE standards, in order to completely check every single <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> panel. This installation allows for a comparison of different controller tuning approaches, including IAE minimization, Skogestad tuning rules, Internal Model Control (IMC), and a technique based upon the MatLab Optimization toolbox. This installation is also used for system identification purposes and for the acceptance tests of every <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> panel (allowing for both electrical and hydraulic checks). Also, tests have been performed on the West Hall CERN experimental area, where a full control system has been set up, for interlock high- and low- voltage lines.

40|$|This paper reexamines the {{physical}} roles of trapped and passing electrons in electron Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) solitary waves, {{also called the}} BGK phase space electron holes (EH). It is shown that the charge density variation {{in the vicinity of}} the solitary potential is a net balance of the negative charge from trapped electrons and positive charge due to the decrease of the passing electron density. A BGK EH consists of electron density enhancements as well as a density depletion, instead of only the density depletion as previously thought. The shielding of the positive core is not a <b>thermal</b> <b>screening</b> by the ambient plasma, but achieved by trapped electrons oscillating inside the potential energy trough. The total charge of a BGK EH is therefore zero. Two separated EHs do not interact and the concept of negative mass is not needed. These features are independent of the strength of the nonlinearity. BGK EHs do not require <b>thermal</b> <b>screening,</b> and their size is thus not restricted to be greater than the Debye length λ_D. Our analysis predicts that BGK EHs smaller than λ_D can exist. A width(δ) -amplitude(ψ) relation of an inequality form is obtained for BGK EHs in general. For empty-centered EHs with potential amplitude ≫ 1, we show that the width-amplitude relation of the form δ∝√(ψ) is common to bell-shaped potentials.

For final validation of the industrial design with respect to heat inleaks between large surfaces at different temperatures, a full-scale test cryostat has been constructed. The facility reproduces the same pattern of temperature levels as the LHC dipole cryostat, avoiding the heat inleaks from local components like supports and feedthroughs and carefully minimizing fringe effects due to the truncated geometry of the facility with respect to the LHC cryostats serial layout. Thermal loads to the actively cooled radiation screen, operated between 50 K and 65 K, are measured by enthalpy difference along its length. At 1. 9 K, the loads are obtained from the temperature difference across a superfluid helium exchanger. On the beam screen, the electrical power needed to stabilize the temperature at 20 K yields a direct reading of the heat losses. Precise in-situ calibration is achieved by subcooling the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen,</b> thereby zeroing radiative heat loads.

When vapour pressure deficit was below 1. 9 g/m 3, outside air was blown under the canopy with an air distribution system for dehumidification. If necessary, this outside air was first heated to greenhouse temperature to prevent an inhomogeneous temperature distribution. The reference greenhouse, controlled at the same humidity set point, used a combination of slightly opening the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> followed by slightly opening the vents to carry off moisture. Eventually, at a vapour pressure deficit of 1. 5 g/m 3 the temperature of the heating pipe was risen to lower the humidity.

As an example, the algorithm was applied to two locations with different climatic and economic conditions, Almeria and The Netherlands. Due to the warm climate with high radiation levels in Almeria, a greenhouse with a relatively large specific ventilation area (20 % compared to 14 % for Dutch conditions), seasonal whitewash and a low-capacity direct air heater (50 W m- 2 compared to 200 W m- 2 for Dutch conditions) was selected. In contrast, for the relatively cold climate with low radiation levels of the Netherlands, a 100 % aluminium <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> and no whitewash would give the best result.

The processed thermal signatures are then compared and discussed with ground-based geophysical data to delineate the timeline of unrest episodes {{coupled with the}} onset and duration of thermal anomalies. We focused our attention on the transition from phreatic–phreatomagmatic to strombolian eruptive styles. The final results contribute to unravel {{the relationships between the}} upper part of the magma body and the hydrothermal system which modulate the changes of the crater lake.|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho propôs avaliar a influência das malhas de sombreamento (termorrefletora) instaladas externa e internamente em ambiente protegido coberto com polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), cultivado com gérbera, na radiação solar global (Qg) e nos parâmetros da planta: crescimento, desenvolvimento e qualidade da gérbera. O experimento foi conduzido em dois ciclos no ano de 2004, na ESALQ/USP, em Piracicaba, SP, em ambiente protegido, dividido em dois módulos de produção. Os ambientes foram diferenciados um do outro pela instalação da malha termorrefletora (50 %) : malha externa (ambiente 1 - A 1) e malha interna (ambiente 2 - A 2). Nesses ambientes, os resultados dos dois ciclos mostraram alteração na Qg; nos ambientes A 1 e A 2 as Qg foram respectivamente 33, 6 e 21, 7 (1 º ciclo) e 27, 2 e 17, 9 % (2 º ciclo) em relação à observada externamente. Considerando-se os dois ciclos conclui-se que os resultados indicaram que não houve diferenças na qualidade das plantas nos dois ambientes, mas, analisando-se separadamente os dois ciclos da cultura, o A 1 (malha externa) foi o que mais favoreceu a qualidade das plantas de gérbera e somente as gérberas presentes no A 1 (malha externa) atenderam às exigências mercadológicas, quanto aos números de botões florais. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of low density polyethylene (PEBD) as a greenhouse cover in association with thermal shading screen installed in two different positions (outside and inside), cultivated with gerbera, on solar radiation (Qg), as well as on the growth and quality of gerbera plants. The experiment was carried out during two crop cycles in 2004, at ESALQ/USP, in Piracicaba, State of São Paulo, Brasil. A greenhouse was sub-divided into two parts and covered with PEBD differing from each other by the position of the thermal shading screen (50 %), witch was installed inside (at 3 m height) and outside (covering the plastic cover). The environment with the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> outside was named A 1 and the other one with the <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> inside was named A 2. The results from the two crop cycles showed that the microclimate was changed by the covers of the greenhouses. Qg inside for A 1 and A 2 were respectively 33. 6 and 21. 7 (first cycle), and 27. 2 and 17. 9 % (second cycle) of the values measured outside. Considering the two crop cycles, the results showed that there were no differences in plant quality in both environments. However, A 1 was the most favorable environment for plant quality when considering the two crop cycles, separately the results separately. Also, only gerberas from A 1 showed themselves to have marketable characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study conducted to determine the environmental burdens associated with cut flowers and pot plant greenhouse cultivation. The goal of this research is to provide an objective environmental analysis of greenhouse ornamental production and point out technical and operational solutions {{in order to reduce the}} environmental burdens produced by cultivation. In order to define the environmental friendly strategy in the area of the U. E., a research has been carried out within project “Ecoflower Terlizzi” (LIFE 04 ENV/IT/ 000480) based on ISO standardisation guidelines, with the participation of Italian ornamental growers. Twenty-two farms of the greenhouse districts of Terlizzi, near Bari in the southern Italian region of Apulia, were chosen in order to analyse the environmental sustainability of soil and soil-less production. The data gathered within project concerned greenhouse typology (structure and covering), equipments (heating, electric, irrigation, etc.) crops (rose, daisy flower, chrysanthemum, carnation, lily, cyclamen, etc.), consumption of water, fertilisers, pesticides, substrates, nutrient solutions, energy consumed for the cultivation and the running of solution distribution systems. The results, based on CML 2001 interpretation method (Guinée et al., 2001), show that plastic covering materials instead of glass, the use of <b>thermal</b> <b>screen</b> for energy saving, an optimization of structures, equipments and agronomical management can reduce environmental burden of ornamental cultivation mainly generated by fuel, pesticide and fertilizer emissions...|$|E
40|$|In a {{reaction}} to the demand of horticulturists and manufacturers for an assesment of the impact of innovative measures that intend to save energy, we quantified the heat and vapour fluxes of a typical Dutch greenhouse to test the impact of these measures on the inside temperature, humidity and the insulation value of the building. We did so by developing a steady state model based on the relevant heat- and vapour balances. Effects that are notably included are condensation and the interdependence of the plant temperature, plant transpiration, radiation and humidity. The model seems to compare well to measurements, although error limits have to be established before definite claims can be made. To showcase the functionality of the model, we tested the impact of changing the coverage fraction of a mobile insulation <b>thermal</b> <b>screen,</b> installed just below the glass roof. The results show that, at night, with a screen coverage of up to 84 %, the insulation value will increase 19 % without increasing the relative humidity. Full screen coverage leads to an additional 32 % increase in the insulation value of the greenhouse, but this comes at the cost of a 6 % increase in relative humidity, increasing the risk of condensation on the plant. The model in its current form presents numerous opportunities for testing the impact of perturbations in the existing Dutch greenhouse design, material properties and heating regimes and it can easily be adapted to test the impact of new ones...|$|E
40|$|Peroxyacids are {{commonly}} used in chemical processing, synthesis and bleaching. Recently, they have been demonstrated to be very versatile for the epoxidation of unsaturated oil, aiming at the synthesis of polyepoxide (plasticizer, resins and adhesives). These processes are characterized by high yields and selectivity. However, due to their hazard and instability, the peroxy reactants are often obtained from the corresponding organic acid in situ by combination with hydrogen peroxide, {{in the presence of}} a mineral (sulphuric or phosphoric) acid as catalyst. In this paper, the kinetic of decomposition of the peroxyacetic acid in water phase have been studied by using simple <b>thermal</b> <b>screening</b> calorimetry, with or without the catalyst...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} a {{considerable}} decrease during the last decade, energy consumption in greenhouse cultivation remains high. More sustainable greenhouse horticulture can be realised by developing new greenhouse and cultivation concepts. Recently, we developed the Next Generation Greenhouse Cultivation system, with which energy consumption in tomato can be reduced by 40 % while maintaining production and quality. This concept {{is based on the}} use of <b>thermal</b> <b>screens</b> combined with control of a high humidity level, maximizing the integration capacity of the crop, improved CO 2 efficiency by reducing ventilation, and greenhouse cooling combined with a heat pump and aquifer. We adapted this concept for Gerbera cultivation and tested it in three consecutive years of experimentation. This resulted in a reduction of energy consumption by 42 - 50 % compared to that of commercial growers, while maintaining production levels. Energy reduction was realised by using <b>thermal</b> <b>screens</b> combined with forced ventilation and an adaptation of the lighting strategy. By using forced ventilation, the use of a fixed minimum pipe temperature can be abandoned, which is normally used to control humidity. In order to prevent low root temperatures, local heating was applied beneath the pots. The use of assimilation lighting was optimised based on the daily light integral required for the growth of Gerbera. This resulted in reducing the amount of assimilation lighting. By shortening the day length to 10. 5 hours from October until January the number of flowers increased, albeit with a lower fresh weight. Recommendations for practical application for the use of screens, forced ventilation and optimal lighting strategies are given...|$|R
