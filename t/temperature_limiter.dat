40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{detailed}} {{model of a}} gas turbine for a {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) plant. The prime mover is endowed with several controls: first of all, a speed control which can be either droop type or isochronous type according to the status of connection to the distribution grid. An acceleration limiter and an exhaust gases <b>temperature</b> <b>limiter</b> intervene to cut the fuel request, respectively, in case of an excessive rotor acceleration and of a too high temperature of the exhaust gases. A further control regulates inlet guide vanes (IGV) {{in order to keep the}} exhaust temperature almost constant. This is important in a cogeneration plant where the heat recovery from the exhaust gases is used to satisfy the demand of the thermal load. Some validation simulations on a model of cogeneration plant connected to a MV distribution grid are carried out and commente...|$|E
40|$|There {{is always}} some risk of {{incident}} {{associated with the}} combustion of solid fuels in automatically stoked boilers or stoves. These incidents are of essentially three types: smoke from the burner back into the boiler room (or {{back into the living}} room from pellet stoves), gas explosions in the combustion chamber and back burning in the stoker. There can be a number of reasons for these problems, and in many cases such incidents have not been investigated. The Swedish Building Regulations stipulate that firing equipment shall have adequate safety against fire. They also recommend that stokers/burners should have at least two independent safety systems against back burning. The objective of this project has been to analyse such incidents and to test safety systems for pellet and wood chip burners, in order better to understand how they work. It has also included evaluation of the“fireguard” water sprinkler system. The results from the tests with pellet burners showed that the burners that were tested provided relatively good protection against back burning. However, it was found that it was very important how and where the systems (<b>temperature</b> <b>limiter,</b> water sprinkler etc.) were fitted on the burners in order to ensure correct and effective operation of the safety system. One of the key question was also where to position electronic equipment on the burners in order to ensure that it is not exposed to temperatures higher than those for which it is designed. Over the years, there have been major problems with back burning in older designs of wood chip burners using old technology. The chip burner used in this project was of modern type. The test with simulated back burning showed that the water sprinkler stopped the fire. However, for greater safety the water sprinklers should have included two separate water container. The test with the pellets stove showed that the temperature sensor was of crucial importance for safety against back burning in the stove. Back burn occurred in one of the tests, but only after all the stove’s safety systems had been rendered inoperable. The “Fireguard” water sprinkler system performed well in our tests. However, the position of the temperature sensors, and the integrity of their thermal contact, was of crucial importance for how quickly the sprinklers responded. Another water sprinkler (Syr) showed itself to be very slow to respond when its sensor were in poor thermal contact with the surface of the fuel feed chute. Experience from the tests in this project has shown that it is relatively difficult to simulate back burning in boilers and pellet stoves, despite setting up very favourable conditions for such back burning. Although modern burners and pellet stoves are equipped with all the safety systems that can be expected, several incidents still happen every year. This means that continued analysis of incidents and development of safety systems is essential. The results from this project will be included when SP’s P-marking rules for pellet burners, pellet stoves and chip wood burners are next reviewe...|$|E
25|$|A {{thermistor}} {{is a type}} of resistor whose {{resistance is}} dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current <b>limiter,</b> <b>temperature</b> sensors (Negative Temperature Coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (Positive Temperature Coefficient or PTC type typically).|$|R

40|$|The {{change in}} the {{temperature}} distribution was investigated for different target materials by inserting a Ta/W twin limiter into TEXTOR edge plasmas. Depending upon the limiter material and the limiter location, {{the position of the}} maximum <b>temperature</b> on the <b>limiter</b> surface changed. A three-dimensional heat transfer calculation taking the radiation loss from the surface into account was conducted to find out the factors governing the heat flux onto the test limiter. The result for the Ta test limiter shows that the experimentally observed temperature asymmetry in the toroidal direction can be explained if the plasma heat flux decreases exponentially from the last closed flux surface with the e-folding length of the ion drift side about 50 % longer than that of the electron drift side. The intensity of D-beta light around the ion drift side of the limiter was larger than that at the electron drift side by about 30 %, corresponding with a larger particle flux to the ion drift side.

40|$|Elevated chip <b>temperatures</b> {{are true}} <b>limiters</b> to the {{scalability}} of computing systems. Excessive runtime thermal variations com-promise {{the performance and}} reliability of integrated circuits. To address these thermal issues, state-of-the-art chips have integrated thermal sensors that monitor temperatures at a few selected die lo-cations. These temperature measurements are then used by ther-mal management techniques to appropriately manage chip perfor-mance. Thermal sensors and their support circuitry incur design overheads, die area, and manufacturing costs. In this paper, we pro-pose a new direction for full thermal characterization of integrated circuits based on spectral Fourier analysis techniques. Application of these techniques to temperature sensing {{is based on the}} observa-tion that die temperature is simply a space-varying signal, and that space-varying signals are treated identically to time-varying signals in signal analysis. We utilize Nyquist-Shannon sampling theory to devise methods that can almost fully reconstruct the thermal status of an integrated circuit during runtime using a minimal number of thermal sensors. We propose methods that can handle uniform and non-uniform thermal sensor placements. We develop an extensive experimental setup and demonstrate the effectiveness of our meth-ods by thermally characterizing a 16 -core processor. Our method produces full thermal characterization with an average absolute er-ror of 0. 6 % using a limited number of sensors...|$|R
40|$|In the TEXTOR tokamak, {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} simultaneously determine the molecular, atomic and total particle flux of deuterium {{in front of a}} graphite <b>limiter,</b> the <b>temperature</b> of which can be controlled independently of the plasma conditions. With rising <b>limiter</b> <b>temperatures,</b> T-TL, but constant plasma conditions an increase in Balmer emission and a decrease in Fulcher-band emission were observed. This variation is associated with a change in the type of released species: molecules dominate at low temperatures (550 K = 1100 K the direct atomic release starts to become important. The total number of deuterons remains constant for all temperatures. Since not all molecules dissociate into two potentially radiating atoms, it is necessary {{to take into account the}} ratio of atoms to molecules when deducing the total particle flux from the Balmer emission. We present a spectroscopic method which allows the determination of the atomic, molecular and total deuterium particle flux and which also gives effective conversion factors, (S/XB) (eff), to deduce the total deuterium flux from Balmer-alpha emission alone. Analysis of the spectroscopic data of both species can be performed to determine the rotational and vibrational populations for the molecules by means of Fulcher-alpha spectroscopy, and the penetration depth and energy for the atoms using Balmer spectroscopy. This further analysis gives additional information about the release mechanism, showing that both species, atoms and molecules, are released predominantly as thermalized particles...|$|R
