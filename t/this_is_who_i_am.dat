Particularly for Iron Fist, we wanted to close that chapter the Hand’s story". On the decision to kill off Alexandra, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> presented as the show's main villain, in the sixth episode, Ramirez said that it was something unexpected to give the audience a [...] "jolt" [...] rather than play into assumptions, and came from the idea that they had really wanted to focus on Elektra's story and her relationship with Alexandra. He elaborated that [...] "it’s organic in the writing of Elektra, because Elektra has been told by many people in her life what she is, whether it was Stick or Matt, it had been them telling her who she is… So when she kills Alexandra, it’s really her saying, “People need to stop telling me <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>who</b> <b>I</b> am.” And I think there’s something particularly interesting about that idea." [...] He said that similar thoughts were behind Elektra's murder of Stick in the series, and said that the theme of [...] "rejecting the identity that the world is trying to put upon you, and having to embrace the identity you want" [...] is one that applies to the four Defenders as well.|$|R
