5|$|In 1901 Risley was {{appointed}} Director of Ethnography. There had been proposals for a wide-ranging {{survey of the}} subject– which Risley had himself discussed <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> article, The Study of Ethnology in India– but {{the implementation of the}} project had been hampered by economic circumstances related principally to a series of famines, including that of 1899–1900.|$|E
5|$|Wild {{initially}} {{estimated that}} they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because <b>this,</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> view, was defeatist. This policy led to sharp disagreements with Thomas Orde-Lees. Orde-Lees was not a popular man, and his presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1960–61 season, there was little {{indication}} of <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> first five innings for the summer, Harvey hit 135 against Queensland, 80 and 63 for an Australian XI against the touring West Indies, 229 against Queensland and 109 for New South Wales against the Caribbean team. However, his form tapered away during the thrilling 1960–61 home series against the West Indies (which included the first tie in Test history). Harvey was ineffective apart from a score of 85 in the second innings of the Third Test, which Australia lost. He then missed the Fourth Test due to injury. He struggled in the Tests, scoring only 143 runs at 17.88, but prospered against the Caribbean tourists in the tour matches, scoring 326 runs at 81.50. Overall, he totalled 849 runs at 56.60 for the season.|$|E

5|$|French {{astronomer}} Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated ten {{stars with}} the Bayer designations Alpha through to Iota in 1756. A star in neighbouring Indus that Lacaille had labelled Nu Indi {{turned out to}} be in Microscopium, so Gould renamed it Nu Microscopii. Francis Baily considered Gamma and Epsilon Microscopii to belong to the neighbouring constellation Piscis Austrinus, but subsequent cartographers did not follow <b>this.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> 1725 Catalogus Britannicus, John Flamsteed labelled the stars 1, 2, 3 and 4 Piscis Austrini, which became Gamma Microscopii, HR 8076, HR 8110 and Epsilon Microscopii respectively. Within the constellation's borders, there are 43 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2013, Production I.G. {{president}} Mitsuhisa Ishikawa said at Anime Expo that {{production on}} a second season had begun. The second season, titled Psycho-Pass 2, began airing in October 2014; the film was released in January 2015. Before the debut broadcast of the second season, the first seasoncondensed into 11 one-hour episodes began airing in July 2014. The fourth episode was cancelled due to similarities with a real life murder. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani apologized for <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Twitter account. Nevertheless, Funimation streamed the episode. A Blu-ray box set was announced with a scheduled release on October 15, 2014. This set contains both the original first season broadcast and the edited one-hour rerun episodes.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore-based Indian Movie News {{stated in}} 1957 that when Ganesan heard of Vasan's {{attempt to make}} a film {{adaptation}} on Kattabomman, he personally requested that he abandon the project; Vasan assented, and lent Ganesan important research materials on Kattabomman. Film historian Randor Guy contradicted <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> 1997 book Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema by stating that writers like Kothamangalam Subbu and Veppathur Kittoo were employed by Vasan to conduct extensive research on Kattabomman's life, but the only eligible choice to portray Kattabomman was Ganesan, who by then had become popular after Parasakthi (1952). Guy noted that Ganesan was hesitant to take up the role under Vasan's direction as he was earlier rejected by him for the role of a bodyguard in Chandralekha (1948), leading to Vasan dropping the project. But later on, Ganesan acted in Irumbu Thirai (1960), which was produced and directed by Vasan, and Motor Sundaram Pillai (1966), which was produced by him.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} 20 head coaches for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). The Raiders {{franchise}} {{was founded in}} Oakland, California in 1959 and became the eighth member of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960 {{as a replacement for}} the Minnesota Vikings, who had moved to the NFL. The Raiders joined the NFL in 1970, after the AFL–NFL merger. They played in Los Angeles between 1982 and 1995, before returning to Oakland. As {{of the end of the}} 2015 season, the Raiders have played 852 games in a total of 56 seasons in the AFL and NFL. In those games, two coaches have won the Super Bowl with the team: John Madden in 1976 and Tom Flores in 1980 and 1983. One coach, John Rauch in 1966, won the AFL Championship. Three other coaches, Art Shell, Jon Gruden and Bill Callahan, have also taken the Raiders to the playoffs. Callahan led the Raiders to the Super Bowl. He did <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first year as head coach of the team.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{also has}} another YouTube account going by the {{username}} JumbaFund, which donated {{all of its}} earnings to a charity that viewers suggested. Wu donated over 5,000 dollars to a charity in Kenya, which later built a school after him, {{to build a new}} school in a span of 5 months from all of the profits he made through JumbaFund. He recently cited that he would now donate all earnings from this point on to Kenya in order to help finish and pay off the costs of the new secondary school being built there. Wu mentions <b>this</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> video and always records himself donating all the profits to the charity in order to show the viewers that his JumbaFund charity is not used for anything but to donate to the needy.|$|E

25|$|During the Mannerist period, architects {{experimented with}} using {{architectural}} forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony {{gave way to}} freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was Michelangelo (1475–1564), who frequently used the giant order in his architecture, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom {{to the top of}} a façade.
