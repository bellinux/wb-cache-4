5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects {{three to five times}} more children with epilepsy <b>than</b> <b>children</b> without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly <b>than</b> <b>children</b> without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was misunderstood, punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse <b>than</b> <b>children</b> who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{sales of}} Hardy Boys books began to drop. The Stratemeyer Syndicate {{conducted}} a survey, which {{revealed that the}} decline in sales {{was due to the}} perceived high cost of the books and to competition from television. As a result, the Syndicate approved an hour-long pilot for a new Hardy Boys television show. The pilot, based on The Mystery of the Chinese Junk, was aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) on September 8, 1967 and starred Tim Matthieson (later Matheson) as Joe Hardy and Rick Gates as Frank. Both actors were twenty at the time of production and portrayed the Hardy Boys as young adults rather <b>than</b> <b>children,</b> as they had been in the Mickey Mouse Club serials. The show did poorly, however, and the series was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely <b>than</b> <b>children</b> to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders <b>than</b> <b>children</b> from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|While {{individuals}} with tics are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods of time, doing so {{often results in}} tension or mental exhaustion. People with Tourette's may seek a secluded spot to release their symptoms, or {{there may be a}} marked increase in tics after a period of suppression at school or at work. Some people with Tourette's may not be aware of the premonitory urge. Children may be less aware of the premonitory urge associated with tics than are adults, but their awareness tends to increase with maturity. They may have tics for several years before becoming aware of premonitory urges. Children may suppress tics while in the doctor's office, so they may need to be observed while they are not aware they are being watched. The ability to suppress tics varies among individuals, and may be more developed in adults <b>than</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} {{and success of}} Fritz the Cat, several {{animated}} films meant for adults rather <b>than</b> <b>children</b> enjoyed success. Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert Crumb, was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for former The Mothers of Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under the title Cheap! Had the film been released under this title, as director Mick Garris notes, the title would have been Roger Corman's Cheap! However, Roger Corman observed the title as a shot at his production techniques, and asked that the title be changed. The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created {{almost all of the}} animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation work to the Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was also promoted as Dirty Duck, although the title on the film itself reads Down and Dirty Duck.|$|E
5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier <b>than</b> <b>children</b> from disadvantaged households.|$|E
5|$|During Memphis's 1873 {{yellow fever}} {{epidemic}}, he—along with other Memphis rabbis and leading Jews—remained {{in the city}} rather than fleeing. During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost twice the number typically buried there in a whole year. When another yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, {{and for a time}} the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel. Beth El Emeth was affected more severely <b>than</b> <b>Children</b> of Israel by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of yellow fever in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to Children of Israel, though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.|$|E

5|$|ETS, whose {{prestige}} {{enhanced the}} credibility of its findings, conducted two landmark summative evaluations in 1970 and 1971, demonstrating that Sesame Street had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies illustrated the early educational effects of Sesame Street, and have been cited in other studies {{of the effects of}} television on young children. ETS reported that the children who watched the show most learned the most, and achieved better results in letter-recognition skills. Three-year-olds who watched regularly scored higher than five-year-olds who did not; children from low-income households who were regular viewers scored higher <b>than</b> <b>children</b> from higher-income households who watched the show less frequently. Similar results occurred in children from non-English-speaking homes. Although adult supervision was not required for children to learn using the material presented, children who watched and discussed the program with their parents gained more skills than those who did not. Children viewing the show in an informal home setting learned as much as children who watched it at school under a teacher's supervision. Regular viewers adjusted better to the school environment than non-viewers. They also had a more positive attitude toward school and better peer relations than non-viewers.|$|E

5000|$|The Court of Appeals, in {{an opinion}} {{authored}} by Judge Thorne, affirmed the trial court's denial of mother's claim for retroactive child support {{prior to the}} filing of a paternity action. The mother had sought an award from the father for retroactive child support dating {{to the time of}} their separation which was {{a few months after the}} birth of the minor child. The mother presented evidence to the trial court of child support worksheets and verification of income earned by the parties during the time for which she sought support. At trial, the issue of estoppel or laches was raised and the trial court was presented evidence by mother's consul that the sums sought were for reimbursement rather <b>than</b> <b>child</b> support. The trial court ruled that the mother was seeking reimbursement rather <b>than</b> <b>child</b> support and since she could not demonstrate either an agreement or unmet needs on the part of the child the trial court denied her claim. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's ruling and refused to hear a new issue on appeal not raised in trial court. Additionally, the Court noted that the mother invited the error by agreeing she was seeking reimbursement rather <b>than</b> <b>child</b> support. http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/appopin/lachance020311.pdf ...|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{research}} done, it is {{concluded that}} children exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and also have a more accurate syntax <b>than</b> <b>children</b> raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them. With motherese, the mother talks to the child and responds back to the child, {{whether it be a}} babble the child made or a short sentence. While doing this, the adult prompts the child to continue communicating, which may help a child develop language sooner <b>than</b> <b>children</b> raised in environments where communication is not fostered.|$|E

Other research confirms the fact that second generation groups tend to have higher levels of academic achievement than first generation groups.|$|E
