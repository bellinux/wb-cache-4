50|$|There {{exists a}} higher rate of relapse, shorter periods of abstinence, and higher {{responsiveness}} to drug-related cues in women as compared to men. One study suggests that the ovarian hormones, estradiol and progesterone, that exist in females at fluctuating levels throughout the menstrual cycle (or estrous cycle in rodents), {{play a significant role in}} drug-primed relapse. There is a marked increase in progesterone levels and a decrease in estradiol levels during the luteal phase. Anxiety, irritability, and depression, three symptoms of both withdrawal and the human menstrual cycle, are most severe in the luteal phase. Symptoms of withdrawal not associated with the cycle, such as hunger, are also enhanced during the luteal phase, which suggests the role of estradiol and progesterone in enhancing symptoms above the naturally occurring level of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms of craving also increase during the luteal phase in humans (it is important to note that the opposite result occurs in female subjects with cocaine addiction suggesting that cyclic changes may be specific for different drugs of abuse). Further, the drug-primed response is reduced during the luteal phase suggesting a time in the cycle during which the urge to continue use may be reduced. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>implicate</b> a cyclic, hormone-based timing for quitting a drug of abuse and preparing for magnified symptoms of withdrawal or susceptibility to relapse.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the regional synchronization of brain in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). Methods. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from twenty-one patients with JME and twenty-two healthy subjects. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used to analyze the spontaneous activity in whole brain. Two-sample t-test was performed to detect the ReHo difference between two groups. Correlations between the ReHo values and features of seizures were calculated further. Key Findings. Compared with healthy controls, patients showed significantly increased ReHo in bilateral thalami and motor-related cortex regions and a substantial reduction of ReHo in cerebellum and occipitoparietal lobe.

40|$|The {{selective}} estrogen receptor (ER) modulator tamoxifen (TAM) {{has become}} the standard therapy {{for the treatment of}} ER+ breast cancer patients. Despite the obvious benefits of TAM, a proportion of patients acquire resistance to treatment, and this is a significant clinical problem. Consequently, the identification of possible mechanisms involved in TAM-resistance should help the development of new therapeutic targets. In this study, we present in vitro data using a panel of different breast cancer cell lines and demonstrate the modulatory effect of TAM on cellular proliferation and expression of Hedgehog signaling components, including the terminal effector of the pathway, the transcription factor GLI 1. A variable pattern of expression following TAM administration was observed, reflecting the distinctive properties of the ER+ and ER− cell lines analyzed. Remarkably, the TAM-induced increase in the proliferation of the ER+ ZR- 75 - 1 and BT 474 cells parallels a sustained upregulation of GLI 1 expression and its translocation to the nucleus. <b>These</b> <b>findings,</b> <b>implicating</b> a TAM-GLI 1 signaling cross-talk, could ultimately be exploited not only as a means for novel prognostication markers but also in efforts to effectively target breast cancer subtypes...|$|R

40|$|The {{pandemic}} of lipid-related disease necessitates {{a determination}} of how cholesterol and other lipids are transported and stored within cells. The first step in this determination is {{the identification of the}} genes involved in these transport and storage processes. Using genome-wide screens, we identified 56 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genes involved in sterol-lipid biosynthesis, intracellular trafficking, and/or neutral-lipid storage. Direct biochemical and cytological examination of mutant cells revealed an unanticipated link between secretory protein glycosylation and triacylglycerol (TAG) /steryl ester (SE) synthesis for the storage of lipids. Together with the analysis of other deletion mutants, these results suggested at least two distinct events for the biogenesis of lipid storage particles: a step affecting neutral-lipid synthesis, generating the lipid core of storage particles, and another step for particle assembly. In addition to the lipid storage mutants, we identified mutations that affect the localization of unesterified sterols, which are normally concentrated in the plasma membrane. <b>These</b> <b>findings</b> <b>implicated</b> phospholipase C and the protein phosphatase Ptc 1 p in the regulation of sterol distribution within cells.

40|$|Kindlins are {{a protein}} family that regulates cell–matrix interactions. Although kindlin- 2 {{is known to}} be {{essential}} for the early developmental processes, its role in the homeostasis of adult tissues has remained elusive. In this study, we used new domain-specific antibodies and small interfering RNA technology to uncover physiological functions of kindlin- 2 in human dermal fibroblasts in vitro and in adult skin in situ. In primary dermal fibroblasts, kindlin- 2 is essential for the integrin clustering and activation, and it regulates cell adhesion and directed migration by guiding formation and maturation of focal adhesions (FAs) and organization of the cytoskeleton. These functions are linked to the transmission of mechanical cues between cells and their microenvironment, typically in processes wherein fibroblasts differentiate to myofibroblasts under mechanical tension.
