5|$|Haydn {{conceived}} of {{what became the}} Opus 50 set {{in a letter to}} the publishing house Artaria in 1784, although he <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> project on hold for the Paris symphonies and The Seven Last Words of Christ. He started work in 1787, composing the first two quartets in February. In April, Haydn received a letter from King Frederick William II of Prussia, praising Haydn for the copies of the Paris symphonies that he had sent. The letter enclosed a golden ring. Haydn sought to return the favour by dedicating the Opus 50 set to the King, and Artaria acceded to Haydn's request to do so.|$|E
5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies {{in the trunk of}} his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half, and within 13 seconds they had scored {{to lead the}} match 3–0. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher kicked {{the ball into the}} Bayern half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who {{controlled}} the ball with his right foot and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ball into the Bayern goal with his left foot. Bayern reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamidžić scored. He headed the ball into the Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match to reduce the deficit to two goals. Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. Bayern replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|The Ethiopian government's {{unwillingness to}} deal with the 1984–85 famine {{provoked}} universal condemnation by the international community. Even many supporters of the Ethiopian regime opposed its policy of withholding food shipments to rebel areas.

25|$|Later in 921, Zhu Zhen's cousin Zhu Youneng (朱友能) the Prince of Hui, who {{was then}} the prefect of Chen Prefecture (陳州, in modern Zhoukou, Henan), rebelled and headed for Daliang.

25|$|But once again, the Chiefs {{defense had}} {{no ability to}} stop the Colts. Manning led them on a 10-play, 81-yard drive that ended with James' 1-yard {{touchdown}} run with 10:38 left in the game. The Chiefs responded with a touchdown of their own, but it took too long. By the time Holmes finished the 17-play, 76-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run, only 4:16 remained in the game. The Colts <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> game away by running the clock down to eight seconds on their ensuing drive.|$|E
25|$|The first {{grand jury}} {{to examine the}} case retired without indicting Hill. Robinson then urged Briscoe to {{pressure}} the District Attorney to order an exhumation, then fired the lawyer when he refused, after which he retained the services of the law firm Vinson and Elkins. District Attorney Carol Vance <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> case before a second grand jury {{to see if they}} would order an exhumation. When they did, Hill hired his own lawyer, Don Fullenweider, who asked his partner, respected defense attorney Richard Haynes, to represent the doctor.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the château was {{acquired}} by a Japanese woman and her Marseillais-born French-American husband illegally using {{the name of her}} family's company Nippon Sangyo, as a commercial asset. The couple sold all the furniture and left the building abandoned. They were sued by the company later. Occupied by squatters, the château underwent various degradations. In 1994, an attempt to remove the joinery and a chimneypiece was thwarted by the police. The owner <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> property up for sale, and it was bought by a French investor who carefully restored it.|$|E

25|$|After Robinson Hill's death, Hill married Ann Kurth in June 1969, but {{divorced}} Kurth {{less than}} a year later, shortly before he was indicted for the murder of Robinson Hill. Following Hill's marriage to Kurth, Ash Robinson accused his former son-in-law of poisoning his daughter, and petitioned the District Attorney to launch a murder investigation. A grand jury began hearing evidence in the summer of 1969, and retired without indicting Hill. District Attorney Carol Vance <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> case before a second grand jury, which ordered an exhumation of the body.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} {{the last ice}} block, the crew put the ship in autopilot and went to hibernate with the passengers, leaving the ship's maintenance to robots. Except {{for a brief period}} of activity to start deceleration, the crew slept for most of the trip, awaking one year before reaching Eden. The plan was to continue deceleration while consuming the last of the ice shell, and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> ship in orbit around the planet, delivering the passengers down by gliders that would be retrieved by hooks to be reused.|$|E
25|$|The spacecraft's manufacturer, Orbital Sciences Corporation, appealed NASA's decision, {{offering}} {{to build the}} spacecraft at cost, forgoing any profit {{in order to gain}} experience in a new market field. NASA <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> cancellation under review, and on March 27, 2006, it was announced that the mission would not be cancelled after all. In the last week of September 2006, the Dawn mission's instrument payload integration reached full functionality. Although originally projected to cost US$373 million, cost overruns inflated the final cost of the mission to US$446 million in 2007. Christopher T.

Marie Campbell suggested the explanation {{for the presence of}} the DNA inside the lid was that both had been drinking from the bottle, <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> cap back on. She also said that the odds against the DNA in the plastic sombrero lid coming from anyone but Bayne were 9.6 million to one.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, {{while he}} was still leading Chinese forces in Shanxi, Japanese {{soldiers}} who had joined the Communists and were serving under Lin's command presented Lin with a Japanese uniform and katana, which they had captured in battle. Lin <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> uniform and katana on, jumped onto a horse, and rode away from the army. While riding, Lin was spotted alone by a sharpshooter in Yan's army. The soldier was surprised to see a Japanese officer riding a horse in the desolate hills alone. He took aim at Lin and severely injured him. The bullet grazed Lin's head, penetrating deep enough to leave a permanent impression on his skull. After being shot in the head, Lin fell from his horse and injured his back.|$|E

25|$|Belle, however, is not {{oblivious}} to her peers' views of her.

25|$|Three {{plays into}} the final quarter, New England fumbled another punt return, this one lost by Roland James, and Miami took over on the Patriots 10-yard line. This time, they took {{advantage}} of their scoring opportunity with Marino's 10-yard touchdown pass to Tony Nathan on the next play, cutting their deficit to 24–14. Things looked even more promising for the Dolphins when they forced a punt {{and drove to the}} New England 38-yard line. But then Carter fumbled the ball and defensive end Julius Adams pick it up for the Patriots fourth fumble recovery of the day. New England <b>then</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> game away with a 9-play drive, featuring a 14-yard run by Tony Collins and a 13-yard carry by James.
