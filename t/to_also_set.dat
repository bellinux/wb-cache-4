50|$|Dr John Gamgee, Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at the Dick Veterinary College, Edinburgh invited other {{veterinary}} {{academics and}} veterinarians from Europe {{to a meeting}} at Hamburg, Germany in July 1863. This later {{became known as the}} World Veterinary Congress and was attended by 103 veterinarians from ten countries. The objective of the meeting was to coordinate the response to rinderpest and other epizootic diseases. At the sixth such congress in Budapest, Hungary in 1906, a permanent committee was set up to provide an organisational link between the congresses, and at the sixteenth congress in Madrid, Spain, in 1959, it was determined to form the World Veterinary Association (WVA). At the same congress, a decision was taken <b>to</b> <b>also</b> <b>set</b> up the International Association of Small Animal Specialists, for organisations representing small animal practitioners, and this had its first meeting two years later in London. By the twenty-fifth congress in Yokohama, Japan, in 1995, there were over ten thousand participants representing 82 countries.|$|E
50|$|Natural units {{began in}} 1881, when George Johnstone Stoney, noting that {{electric}} charge is quantized, derived units of length, time, and mass, now named Stoney units in his honor, by normalizing G, c, and the electron charge, e, to 1. In 1898, Max Planck discovered that action is quantized, and published the {{result in a}} paper presented to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in May 1899. At {{the end of the}} paper, Planck introduced, as a consequence of his discovery, the base units later named in his honor. The Planck units are based on the quantum of action, now usually known as Planck's constant. Planck called the constant b in his paper, though h is now common. Planck underlined the universality of the new unit system, writing:Planck considered only the units based on the universal constants G, ħ, c, and kB to arrive at natural units for length, time, mass, and temperature. Planck did not adopt any electromagnetic units. However, since the non-rationalized gravitational constant, G, is set to 1, a natural extension of Planck units to a unit of electric charge is <b>to</b> <b>also</b> <b>set</b> the non-rationalized Coulomb constant, ke, to 1 as well. Another convention is to use the elementary charge as the basic unit of electric charge in Planck system. Such system is convenient for black hole physics. The two conventions for unit charge differ by a factor of the square root of the fine-structure constant. Planck's paper also gave numerical values for the base units that were close to modern values.|$|E
40|$|As India stands {{poised on}} the edge of {{significant}} growth in coal power, it is critical not only to consider and implement technologies that meet the near-term needs of the country but <b>to</b> <b>also</b> <b>set</b> the coal-based power sector on a path that would allow it to better respond to future challenges. A well-thought-out and robust technology policy based on empirical data and analysis can greatly facilitate and further energy technology innovation processes in India. This requires a strategic analysis of emerging technologies in relation to the needs, challenges, and constraints particular to India. This paper aims to contribute to such a planning process by assessing coal-power technology options in the Indian context, and by providing preliminary policy conclusions...|$|E

40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a {{signaling}} protocol used for establishing and maintaining communication sessions involving {{two or more}} participants. SIP was initially designed for voice over IP and multimedia conferencing, and then was extended to support other services such as instant messaging and presence management. Today, SIP is also adopted {{to be used with}} 3 G wireless networks, thus it becomes an integral protocol for ubiquitous environment. SIP has various methods that support a variety of applications such as subscribing to a service, notification of an event, status update, and location and presence services. However, when it comes to security, the use of wireless and mobile communication technologies and the pervasive nature of this environment introduce higher risks to security than that of the old simple environment. In this paper, we introduce new architecture that implements a new type of access control called usage access control (UCON) to control the access to the SIP-based communication at preconnection, during connection, and postconnection. This will enable prescribers of SIP services to control who can identify their locations to approve or disapprove their subsequent connections, and <b>to</b> <b>also</b> <b>set</b> some parameters to determine whether a certain communication can continue or should terminate...|$|E
