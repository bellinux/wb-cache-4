5|$|As a team, the Australians {{were greeted}} by record crowds and gate {{receipts}} across the country, even when wet weather curtailed the matches. The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times, in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Lord's, the Third <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Old Trafford, and the Fourth <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist put the {{disappointment}} of India {{behind him in}} the First <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Edgbaston, scoring 152 from only 143 balls. The allowed Australia to reach 576 in only 545 minutes, and set up an innings victory that {{set the tone for}} the series. Gilchrist then added 90 in the eight-wicket win in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Lord's, before turning the tide in the Third <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Trent Bridge. Australia slumped to 7/105 in reply to the hosts' 185, but Gilchrist's 54 took the tourists to 190 before a seven-wicket win resulted in the retention of the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|He then scored 73 run out, {{his only}} fifty in the Tests, as Australia made 491 and ceded a 136-run {{lead in the}} third <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Old Trafford. However, they held on for a draw. Woodfull made a duck in the fourth <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley, but another Bradman triple century put them in control before rain {{shortened}} the match; England still needed 155 runs to make Australia bat again with only four wickets in hand when the match ended. The draw meant that the series was at 1–1 heading into the final <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> The Oval, which would be timeless.|$|E

5|$|A {{decline in}} the West Indies batting line-up coupled {{by the loss of}} Greenidge ensured this series would be a closer contest.

5|$|After adding 48 in Australia's first {{innings of}} 411, Brown scored 133 {{in the second}} innings of the First <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Nottingham after the {{tourists}} were forced to follow-on, helping Bradman (144 not out) to save the Test.

5|$|After {{the first}} four Tests, Australia led the series 3–0, having won all but the Third Test, which was rain-affected. They had taken an {{unlikely}} win in the Fourth <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley, scoring 404/3 in their second innings, the highest ever score in a successful Test runchase.|$|E
5|$|Alimuddin also toured West Indies {{as a part}} of Pakistan cricket team in 1957–58. He was not {{successful}} in the series and his highest score remained 41 runs which he made in the fourth <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> the Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana. In 1962, under the captaincy of Javed Burki, Pakistan visited England where they played a five Test match series. In the fifth <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley, a low scoring match for Pakistan, Alimuddin's scores of 50 and 60 made him the team's highest scorer of the match. In the fifth Test of the home series against England in 1962, he scored his career best 109 runs at the National Stadium. He played his last match against England in Trent Bridge, Nottingham in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Australia fell to {{successive}} defeats in {{the opening}} two Tests, Bradman making two ducks in his four innings, {{and it seemed that}} the captaincy was affecting his form. The selectors made another four changes to the team for the Third <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley. Middle-order batsman Neil Harvey {{replaced}} the injured opener Sid Barnes, who had collapsed while fielding during the Third Test after being hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot. Australia declined to replace Barnes with the reserve opener Bill Brown, instead opting to use vice-captain Lindsay Hassett as a makeshift opener rather than in his customary position in the middle-order. Harvey had scored an unbeaten 73 and a 95 in the recent tour matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire respectively. Ron Saggers replaced first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test, and he exacerbated the injury during the match against Middlesex. Former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised the Australians for opting to use only one spinner, pointing out that he and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith, a left-arm wrist spinner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited a further instance of an Ashes <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> the same venue in 1934 in which he and Clarrie Grimmett had significant success for Australia. He wanted {{at least one of}} the two leg spinners, Colin McCool or Doug Ring, to have played alongside off spinner Ian Johnson, the only specialist spinner to have played in the three preceding Tests.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} line-up for the Second <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Lord's. Brown managed only 24 and 32 {{in the middle}} order as Australia won by 409 runs. Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, he had totalled 123 runs at 24.60 in his five innings in the middle-order. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who was noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that although Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Lord's in 1938, Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection.|$|E
5|$|Australia's next {{assignment}} was a home series against Zimbabwe in October 2003. Australian opener Matthew Hayden scored the then highest Test score of 380 in the First <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> the Western Australia Cricket Association Ground (WACA). Australia swept the series 2–0, after comfortably winning the Second <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) in Sydney. They then drew a four-Test series {{at home against}} India in December and January. The Fourth Test was captain Steve Waugh's last, and it was played at his home ground the SCG. Australia won the following VB one-day series that included India and Zimbabwe.|$|E

40|$|While {{several studies}} have {{examined}} the abiotic effects of altitude (low ambient temperatures and hypoxia) on the aerobic performance of small mammals, few have explored the effects of development and maturation at different altitudes on aerobic performance as adults. We examined the basal metabolism and aerobic performance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) under four different developmental and testing regimes: (1) reared (gestation through weaning) and <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> high altitude; (2) reared and <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> low altitude; (3) reared at low altitude and <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> high altitude after acclimation; and (4) reared at low altitude and tested in hypoxia without acclimation. We found that mice that developed and were <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> low altitudes had a higher aerobic capacity (both aerobic performance and basal metabolic rate) than those that developed, or were acclimated as adults, at high altitudes. In addition, we found that mice that developed at high altitude did not have a higher aerobic capacity than those that developed at low altitude and were acclimated to high altitude as adults. Both groups <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> high altitudes had higher hematocrits (% red blood cells) and hemoglobin than mice <b>tested</b> <b>at</b> low altitudes. Surprisingly, mice acclimated to low altitudes and given an instantaneous exposure to hypoxia did not suffer a depression in aerobic performance...|$|R

5|$|Bradman scored 138 in {{the first}} innings of the First <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Trent Bridge, laying the {{foundation}} for Australia's 509, which set up a lead of 344 and eventual victory. In the Fourth <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Headingley, he scored an unbeaten 173 on a deteriorating pitch on the final day, combining in a triple-century partnership with Arthur Morris as Australia scored 3/404 in the second innings to win by seven wickets. This set a world record for the highest ever successful run-chase in Test history. The tour was Bradman's international farewell, and when needing only four runs for a Test career average of exactly 100, he bowed out with a second ball duck in the Fifth <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> The Oval, bowled by an Eric Hollies googly. Australia nevertheless won the Test to complete a 40 series win, and Bradman ended the series with 508 runs at 72.57, with two centuries. Only Morriswith three centuriesscored more runs in the five Tests. Bradman's Test average for the series was the third-highest among the Australians, behind that of Sid Barnes and Morris.|$|E
5|$|Despite this form, his Test {{campaign}} started poorly with an ineffective 1/130 in the drawn First <b>Test</b> <b>at</b> Edgbaston.
