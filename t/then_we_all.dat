500|$|The band's lead singer/guitarist Patrick Stump {{stated that}} the band had not planned to cover the song. [...] "Basically, I just started playing the riff in sound-check one day, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> started playing it, and then we started playing it live, and then we figured we'd record {{it and put it}} out with our live DVD." [...] Bassist Pete Wentz added that the band had not {{originally}} intended for the song to be released as a single either. [...] "'Beat It' seemed like a song that would be cool and that we could do our own take on", he said. Having spent time deciding on a guitarist for the song, Wentz eventually called John Mayer to add the guitar solo. [...] "We were trying to think about who is a contemporary guitar guy who's going to go down as a legend", Wentz later noted.|$|E
500|$|The album {{contains}} three secret tracks placed {{onto the}} twelfth track after silence {{that follows the}} track's primary song [...] "(The Return of) The Electric Horseman". The first of these is called [...] "Vladimir" [...] which, according to Fanning is about a transvestite. The second song is called [...] "SS" [...] which refers to Australian cricket bat manufacturer Stuart Surridge, which is often known by those initials. The song refers {{in part to the}} bat itself, though mostly to cricket in general, with lyrics [...] "Then we'll race like jets for the fading moon; <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> fall down", which refers to running for the opposite crease following striking the ball, and then diving to the ground to secure the run. The third and final secret track is called [...] "Come Away" [...] which also appeared as a B-side for the single of [...] "Pick You Up". In a first for the group, it had the guitarist Darren Middleton as lead vocalist, while a spoken sound sample {{at the end of the}} song is the bass guitarist John Collins' voice.|$|E
2500|$|Foreman has 12 children, five {{sons and}} seven daughters. His five sons are George Jr., George III ("Monk"), George IV ("Big Wheel"), George V ("Red"), and George VI ("Little Joey"). On his [...] website, Foreman explains, [...] "I named all my sons George Edward Foreman {{so they would}} always have {{something}} in common. I say to them, [...] "If one of us goes up, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!" [...] As with his father, George III has pursued a career in boxing and entrepreneurship. George IV appeared on the second season of American Grit, where he placed seventh.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Bell's {{programming}} {{gave the}} song its [...] "militaristic mode", which further conveys {{the sense of}} mission expressed in the lyrics. Björk had recorded the vocals, bass line and chord structure of [...] "Hunter" [...] before Bell met her in Spain; he recorded the beats in one take after she had explained to him how she wanted them to sound like. In an interview with Sweater, Björk said: [...] "It amazes me that people still can't grasp that live element of it." [...] Regarding {{the beat of the}} song, engineer Markus Dravs stated it [...] "is very much a Mark Bell beat interpretation of her. The idea of it being a Boleric beat was hers, but we tried different versions and I think it was Mark in the end {{who came up with the}} idea of just doing it on a 909. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> had a go on the filtering and played around with the decay of each individual drum." ...|$|E

60|$|And by {{this time}} we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe, {{demolished}} one of them, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> got aboard the other {{and set out to}} go round by sea for North Inlet.|$|E

60|$|But, <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> are <b>all</b> of us {{like the}} servant for {{the matter of}} that; I, too, have {{travelled}} with an angel many a day, I dare say, and never knew it.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> {{looked at}} one another. We were a pretty pale lot, and I believe that Rectus and I, who were all right, felt almost as badly as the four other boys, who were all wrong.|$|E
