5|$|After {{the lineup}} stabilized, the band {{released}} {{a number of}} platinum-selling albums, including Rust in Peace (1990) and Countdown to Extinction (1992). These albums, along with touring worldwide, helped bring public recognition to Megadeth. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without bassist Ellefson, who had taken legal action against Mustaine. Ellefson settled with Mustaine out of court and rejoined <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> 2010. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since mid-2005.|$|E

5|$|Another radical leader, Communist {{spokesman}} and one-time {{leader of}} American {{forces in the}} Spanish Civil War Harry Haywood, was born in 1898 in South Omaha as Haywood Hall to parents who were former slaves. In 1913 his father was beaten by a white gang at the South Omaha meatpacking plant where he worked, forcing the family {{to move from the}} city. The African Blood Brotherhood, started in Omaha, contributed to radicalizing Haywood when he joined it <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> Chicago, where his family had moved in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with one of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFocusing on {{material}} kinetic characteristic in horizontal pipe and vertical pipe of pneumatic conveyor, motion differential equation of <b>the</b> particle <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> pipe is established and solved by introduced into Matlab. By analyzing the resistance coefficient of <b>the</b> particle <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> different pipes and speed characteristic curves in different initial conditions, the speed characteristic of <b>the</b> particle <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> accelerating {{section of the}} pipe in pneumatic conveyor is obtained. The result shows that (1) resistance coefficient affects ultimate constant velocity of <b>the</b> particle <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> pipe, (2) different initial conditions affect acceleration (deceleration) motion time of <b>the</b> particle <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> pipe and (3) the power consumed in vertical pipe is larger than that in horizontal pipe when <b>the</b> particle <b>groups</b> are <b>in</b> accelerating section...|$|R

5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, who joined <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album {{was recorded in}} the spring of 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing as the band had a good relationship with him {{and did not want to}} go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E
5|$|Bruce became {{frustrated}} with the backstage politics of the wrestling business and began searching for another career. Back on the streets, Bruce, Utsler and Utsler's brother, John performed hip hop music at local night clubs, using the stage names ViolentJ, 2Dope, and John Kickjazz, {{under the name of}} their gang, Inner City Posse. Seeing a need for a manager, Bruce's brother Robert recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the Psychopathic Records record label with <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> 1991. Later that year the group released the self-produced EP entitled Dog Beats.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Genesis were {{suffering}} from press attention being exclusively directed towards frontman Gabriel {{at the expense}} of the rest of the band, a notable factor that ultimately led to Gabriel leaving <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> 1975. They took an extended break in 1974 following the Selling England by the Pound tour; Collins joined a side project, Brand X, while Rutherford worked with former Genesis guitarist Anthony Phillips.|$|E

After meeting chiropractor James Stoxen in Chicago, Field improved his health to the point {{that he was able to}} continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements.|$|E
