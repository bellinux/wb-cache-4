40|$|ABSTRACT: Impact {{driving of piles}} is {{a complex}} process which depends on the {{interaction}} of the stress wave progressing down <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> and on <b>the</b> dynamic soil resistance along the shaft and at <b>the</b> toe. <b>Pile</b> driving vibrations can adversely affect adjacent structures, and the intensity of ground vibrations depends on the dynamic resistance along <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> rather than on the energy applied to <b>the</b> <b>pile.</b> <b>The</b> viscous damping factor, Jc, is one of the fundamental parameters when <b>the</b> static <b>pile</b> resistance is determined from dynamic tests. Theoretical analyses and field observations show that the Jc-factor is not solely a soil parameter, but a function of <b>the</b> ratio of <b>pile</b> impedance and soil impedance at <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> toe. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> toe damping factor for an open-toe pipe pile would be different when no plug develops in <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> and when <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> toe is fully plugged. Moreover, the mentioned aspect needs to be considered when the results of a test pile of one pile type are applied to a construction pile of a different type. Viscous damping along <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> shaft and at <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> toe is <b>the</b> source of ground vibrations. The vibration magnitude is governed by the interactive nature of dynamic pile-soil resistance, which {{is a function of the}} ratio between <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> impedance and <b>the</b> soil impedance for P-waves. It is shown that the vibration transmission efficacy and the dynamic resistance are inversely linearly proportional to <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> impedance, and that energy transmission efficacy correctly reflects the vibration emission from <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> t...|$|R

25|$|Many {{difficulties}} {{occurred in}} driving <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> which considerably retarded {{the progress of}} the work, and, among others, the peculiar effect of ebb and flow during this operation is worthy of note. At flood-tide the sand became so hard as almost totally to resist the utmost efforts of driving, while at ebb the sand was quite loose, and allowed of doing so with facility. It was therefore found necessary to abandon the driving on many occasions during high water. The difference between high and low water is 11 feet 6 inches. Another difficulty arose from the quicksands beneath the foundations. Although <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> were driven to the rock bottom, the water forced its way up, baffling the attempts to fill in between them; this, however, was remedied by using a concrete made of broken stone and Roman cement, which was continually thrown in until the bottom was found to be secure.|$|E

40|$|Five pile {{tests have}} been performed, {{at the west}} coast of Mexico, in order to {{evaluate}} their <b>pile</b> bearing capacity. <b>The</b> Kentledge system (a test pile loaded in between two tension piles) has been used to execute <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> tests. <b>The</b> soil stratigraphy has been surveyed with standard penetration tests, cone penetration tests and borings, and consists of a ten to twelve meter soft clayey soil on top of a hard clay layer. Three identical pile tests have been performed on bored piles with a pile diameter of 0. 6 m and a pile length of 30 m. In addition, two identical pile tests have been performed on driven piles with a squared cross section of 0. 5 m × 0. 5 m and a pile length of about 21 m. The aims of these tests were, first to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> bearing capacity for both the bored and <b>the</b> driven <b>pile</b> types, in order to decide which pile type will be used finally, for the foundation of a factory; and second, to study the influence of <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> installation process on <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> bearing capacity of both <b>pile</b> types.
