5|$|Between 26 December and 7 January, Admiral Scheer rendezvoused {{with the}} supply ships Nordmark and Eurofeld, the {{auxiliary}} cruiser , and the prizes Duquesa and Storstad. The raiders transferred some 600 prisoners to Storstad while they refueled from Nordmark and Eurofeld. Between 18 and 20 January Admiral Scheer captured three Allied merchant ships totalling , including the Norwegian oil tanker Sandefjord.

5|$|The {{terrestrial}} Argonemertes dendyi is {{a native}} of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel in the Azores, in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube cave at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Another terrestrial genus, Geonemertes, is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in <b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha</b> in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and in the Azores.|$|E

5|$|A 1993 review {{estimated}} that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, {{with a minimum of}} 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands. They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, <b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha,</b> and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt was}} made to collect a {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final {{attempt was made}} during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on <b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha.</b> The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then able to use the skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Jamestown is {{the capital}} of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and <b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha,</b> located on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is also the {{historic}} main settlement of the island and is on its north-western coast. It is the island's only port and the centre of the island's road and communications network. It was founded when colonists from the English East India Company settled on the island in 1659 and was briefly occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1673 before being recaptured. Many of the buildings built by the East India Company in the 1700s survive and give the town its distinctive Georgian flavour.|$|E

2500|$|There are 80 {{families}} on the island. <b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha's</b> isolation {{has led to}} development of an unusual, patois-like dialect of English described by the writer Simon Winchester as [...] "a sonorous amalgam of Home Counties lockjaw and 19th century idiom, Afrikaans slang and Italian." [...] Bill Bryson documents some examples of the island's dialect in his book, The Mother Tongue.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha's</b> {{residents}} managed {{their own}} affairs without any written laws. The inhabitants {{have been described}} as moral, religious, hospitable to strangers, well-mannered and industrious, healthy and long-lived. They lack intoxicating liquors and were said to commit no crimes. , there have been no divorces. They were daring sailors, and in small canvas boats of their own building voyage to Nightingale and Inaccessible islands. They knit garments from the wool of their sheep, are good carpenters, and make serviceable carts.|$|R
5|$|Several {{conservation}} {{measures have been}} undertaken or proposed to protect this species. Inaccessible Island was once suggested as a site for agriculture for Tristan Islanders, which would have reduced habitat and risked the introduction of invasive species. However the island was declared a nature reserve by the <b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha</b> Island Council in 1994. Access to the island is restricted now, although Tristan Islanders are still permitted to visit the island to collect firewood and guano. Introduced New Zealand flax {{has been removed from}} the island, and the island now has a management plan. Other suggestions for securing this species' future include increased education on biosecurity for the local community, and potentially setting up a captive population. It has also been suggested that backup populations be established on other secure islands, for example Nightingale Island, in case predators reached Inaccessible Island, but this may have negative impacts on the endemic invertebrate faunas of these islands.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail has a tiny global range with {{a single}} population. Though still common within its tiny range, with around 5,600 adult birds in the world, the species is {{considered}} to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach Inaccessible Island. Insular rails, particularly flightless species, are vulnerable to extinction. House mice, feral cats and brown rats, all of which would be a serious threat to this species, are not present on the island, nor have they ever been, but are present on nearby <b>Tristan</b> <b>da</b> <b>Cunha,</b> and could reach the islands via fishing vessels or other boats visiting the island (mice have been found on boats visiting the neighbouring Nightingale Island). Because of this vulnerability, this species is rated as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Fires of tussock grass, which were recorded in 1872 and 1909, are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails, but have not occurred since. In the 1950s they were highly sought after for scientific collections, but permits to do so were rarely granted.|$|E
