25|$|Saturday, {{on the eve}} of the game, NFL {{commissioner}} Pete Rozelle called Jim Kensil and Don Weiss, {{the executive}} directors of the NFL, for an update on the weather conditions. It is suspected that they informed him that Sunday's game time temperature of about 5° was playable. Rozelle, who in June 1966 had seen to it that the AFL-NFL Championship game would always be in a warm weather city, inquired if the game could be postponed until Monday. Predictions held Monday would be even colder than Sunday and the game was not postponed. Little did <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cold front would be far colder and would arrive much sooner than expected. The Packers, who had for years eschewed late-season home games because of the cold winters, would play host to the Cowboys in a game that would mark the coldest New Year's Eve in the history of Green Bay and the coldest title game in the history of the NFL, a record that still stands.|$|E
500|$|The episode's action {{revolves}} around the practical joke involving the cake and, in particular, viewers' attempts to guess what has caused injury, as <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> paramedic will be coming. Both Angela and the alcoholic Carol are [...] "ticking time-bomb". Angela is the central character, and {{is similar to a}} more anxious version of Sue Brockman, Skinner's character from Outnumbered. She is stressed and obsessive-compulsive, but aspirational, fastidious, and dutiful. The comedy critic Bruce Dessau compared Ashbourne's characterisation of Carol to Elizabeth Taylor's characterisation in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; as the episode progresses, Carol becomes increasingly abusive. Commentators variously described Pat as [...] "appalling", [...] "tiresome", an [...] "irritating tit" [...] and [...] "an insufferable booby". For Chris Bennion, writing in The Independent, Pat's character is more complex: [...] "Behind Pat's cheesy jokes and schoolboy tomfoolery lies a desperately sad and dignified man, standing by and caring for a wife whose love for him has long gone." [...] Pat and Carol, for Pemberton and Shearsmith, have a more honest relationship than Jim and Angela, despite the problems in their relationship.|$|E

[...] Despite his praise of Ryan, Bowles says he plans on voting for President Obama in November.|$|E

2500|$|If a film or {{television}} director staged a similar fictional scene, {{the audience will}} be predisposed to consider it less [...] "real". <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scenario is being filtered through the film maker's sensibilities and the outcome will reflect the director's motives. Hence, the lighting, makeup, costumes, acting methods, cutting, and soundtrack music selection are understood to be combined to inform the audience about the film maker's intentions.|$|E
2500|$|Escalating loan {{defaults}} {{became a}} particularly important concern, undermining {{the hope that}} the cooperatives would become self-reliant and develop into strong institutions. [...] Dr. Khan reported that influential local people had secured management positions in the cooperatives. [...] "They are powerful and well informed. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old sanctions (certificates, notices, pressure by officers) are now dead, and they can repudiate their obligations with impunity." [...] In addition, the new government annulled loans issued by its pre-independence predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|Ali was mourned globally, and {{a family}} {{spokesman}} said the family [...] "certainly believes that Muhammad was {{a citizen of the}} world … and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world grieves with him." [...] Politicians such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Cameron and more paid tribute to Ali. Ali also received numerous tributes from the world of sports including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, the Miami Marlins, LeBron James, Steph Curry and more. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer stated, [...] "Muhammad Ali belongs to the world. But he only has one hometown." ...|$|E

2500|$|Society today {{revolves}} around technology {{and by the}} constant need for the newest and most high-tech products we are contributing to mass amount of e-waste. Since {{the invention of the}} iPhone, cell phones have become the top source of e-waste products because they are not made to last more than two years. Electrical waste contains hazardous but also valuable and scarce materials. Up to 60 elements can be found in complex electronics. As of [...] 2013, Apple has sold over 796 million iDevices (iPod, iPhone, iPad). Cell phone companies make cell phones that are not made to last so that the consumer will purchase new phones. Companies give these products such short life spans because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> consumer will want a new product and will buy it if they make it. In the United States, an estimated 70% of heavy metals in landfills comes from discarded electronics.|$|E
2500|$|The ICA armed {{itself with}} Mauser rifles bought from Germany by the Irish Volunteers and smuggled into Ireland at Howth in July 1914. This {{organisation}} {{was one of}} the first to offer equal membership to both men and women and trained them both in the use of weapons. The army's headquarters was the ITGWU union building, Liberty Hall and membership was almost entirely Dublin based. However, Connolly also set up branches in Tralee and Killarney in County Kerry. [...] Tom Clarke called a meeting of all the separatist groups in Dublin on 9 September 1914 to assist a German invasion of Ireland, and prevent the police disarming the volunteers. [...] An intellectual dispute broke out within the ranks of the ICA between Liam O'Briain, and the ICA's military commander, Michael Mallin. [...] he thought that the former's plan for an integrated movement was totally unrealistic. [...] O'Briain wanted to pursue a strategy without the Dublin brigade being [...] "cooped up in the city". [...] Yet Mallin told him that the whole strategy was au contraire was to focus on the central objective on and around Dublin Castle. [...] Little did <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Castle and barracks behind possessed no more than a skeleton garrison, and could have been taken by a token force.|$|E

2500|$|In 1885, {{after his}} return to America, Judge set about to revitalize the Movement in the United States. The real {{beginning}} {{of the work of}} Theosophy in the United States began in 1886, when Judge established The Path, an independent Theosophical magazine. Until this time, not much had been accomplished in the way of growth of the Society in America. [...] Mr. Judge addressed the common man in homely language and with simple reason. The Path showed that he had found himself and was now cultivating the area of his greatest usefulness, as a writer. His natural interest in the welfare of others affected everything he did, so that his articles and Theosophical talks are cast in the idiom of the common man.In his first editorial, he wrote: [...] "It is not thought that utopia can be established in a day...Certainly, if we all say that it is useless...nothing will ever be done. A beginning must be made and it has been made by the Theosophical society...Riches are accumulating {{in the hands of the}} few while the poor are ground harder every day as they increase in number...All this points unerringly to a vital error somewhere...What is wanted is true knowledge of the spiritual condition of man, his aim, and destiny...those who must begin the reform are those who are so fortunate as to be placed in the world where they can see and think out the problems all are endeavouring to solve, even if <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> great day may not come until after their death." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Orthodox Jews {{who seek}} to {{reconcile}} discrepancies between science and the creation myths in the Bible, the notion that science and the Bible should even be reconciled through traditional scientific means is questioned. To these groups, science is as true as the Torah and if {{there seems to be}} a problem, epistemological limits are to blame for apparently irreconcilable points. They point to discrepancies between what is expected and what actually is to demonstrate that things are not always as they appear. They note that even the root word for [...] "world" [...] in the Hebrew language—עולם (Olam)—means hidden—נעלם (Neh-Eh-Lahm). Just as they know from the Torah that God created man and trees and the light on its way from the stars in their observed state, so too can <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world was created in its over the six days of Creation that reflects progression to its currently-observed state, with the understanding that physical ways to verify this may eventually be identified. This knowledge has been advanced by Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb, former philosophy professor at Johns Hopkins University. Also, relatively old Kabbalistic sources from well before the scientifically apparent age of the universe was first determined are in close concord with modern scientific estimates of the age of the universe, according to Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, and based on Sefer Temunah, an early kabbalistic work attributed to the first-century Tanna Nehunya ben HaKanah. Many kabbalists accepted the teachings of the Sefer HaTemunah, including the medieval Jewish scholar Nahmanides, his close student Isaac ben Samuel of Acre, and David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra. Other parallels are derived, among other sources, from Nahmanides, who expounds that there was a Neanderthal-like species with which Adam mated (he did this long before Neanderthals had even been discovered scientifically). Reform Judaism does not take the Torah as a literal text, but rather as a symbolic or open-ended work.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} on 24 July 1908, Goltz denied the charge often made in the West that the Ottoman {{authorities}} had oppressed the Christian population of Macedonia and were committing systematic human rights abuses. Goltz wrote: [...] "Nevertheless, what the Westerners write about the Turkish government is not honest. Most of the time, {{it is the case}} that those Greeks, Bulgarians, and Serbs, who have had terrible experiences at the hands of their very own nationals, ask for Turkish protection. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Turks are filled with generosity and compassion. They forgot and forgive. For being compassionate to the weak is part of their national traditions and they are proud of it." [...] Goltz denied the charge of widespread human rights abuses against the Christians, writing: [...] "Now, the Ottoman administration there is much better than it is thought. The Ottoman governors there, either generals or civilian employees, are young, healthy and knowledgeable men. If they are left to themselves, they can protect the peace perfectly well." [...] Anyhow, Goltz wrote the Europeans [...] "never think about the real owners of the country, the Turks, who constitute the majority in Macedonia … Ottoman staff officers, since 1887, under my direction, have prepared the maps of the Ottoman Balkans and we have found many Turkish villages, which have not been shown in other maps, besides Slav and Greek ones. Turks, in short, have a great right to be in Macedonia. Goltz advised his protégés in the Committee of Union and Progress: [...] "Be powerful so you will not be subject to injustice." [...] In 1910, Goltz advised Pertev to create a para-military youth organization that would serve to [...] "inspire a patriotic and soldierly spirit in youth, to fill them with joy at the fame and greatness of Turkey, {{and at the same time}} to give them a healthy physical education, which prepares them for the military profession." [...] Goltz further added that the purpose of education of youth was [...] "the formation of the patriotic sense, love of the fatherland, soldierly virtues and the toughening of the body, less so the technical preparation of the growing generation." ...|$|E
