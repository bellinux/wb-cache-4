5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> {{the emperor}} penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure {{of up to}} 40 {{times that of the}} surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma. The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E

5|$|Temperatures are {{relatively}} cold for its latitude due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> Malvinas Current {{and the high}} altitude. For example, in Tierra del Fuego temperatures are colder than at equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since they {{are influenced by the}} cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes.|$|E
5|$|The Winter Olympics {{returned}} to Lake Placid, New York in 1980. Twelve teams {{participated in the}} tournament, including Canada {{for the first time}} since 1968.

The Americans, coached by Herb Brooks and consisting mainly of college students, tied Sweden and scored an upset win over Czechoslovakia in the preliminary round. They advanced to the medal round along with Sweden, Finland and the Soviet Union.|$|E

Returned to his own world, A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that {{the system was}} indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E

5|$|By October 1906, {{many in the}} U.S. government, {{including}} Secretary of State Elihu Root, {{were worried}} that war could break out in the Pacific between the United States and Japan. However, the Aleutian Islands {{were believed to be}} of little strategic importance to the United States, and were ignored by a number of pre-war strategies formulated by the U.S. armed forces, including the Naval War Board's 1896 plan, which would have brought only a few scout ships to the Islands. In 1911, the Naval War Board considered three options through which Japan could mount an invasion of the United States, one of which involved an attack on the Aleutian Islands. However, this option was discarded by the Board owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> climate of the islands.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a mild and humid climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E

5|$|In {{the central}} Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, {{relatively}} unbranched stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper Whanganui River. On old trees, the leaves {{tend to be}} relatively broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that tī manu is adapted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by lava, volcanic ash, and pumice. Trees of the tī manu type are also found in northern Taranaki, the King Country and the Bay of Plenty lowlands.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been high up in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned}} about the world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment to bringing the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> weather. All {{work was}} then done at Salt Wells.

Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects {{in the form of}} cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks. The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site, so different methods were required. Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks.|$|E
