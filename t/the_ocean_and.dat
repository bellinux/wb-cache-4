For many years we focused {{research and policy}} on anthropogenic impacts to <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> coasts. Recently we have started {{to think about how}} the health of <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> affects us. In response to <b>the</b> <b>Oceans</b> <b>and</b> Human Health Act of 2004, a NOAA initiative was created to explore the “One Health” of <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> coasts. <b>The</b> Center of Excellence in <b>Oceans</b> <b>and</b> Human Health at Hollings Marine Laboratory (HML) is one of three Centers dedicated to understanding the connections and forecasting changes in <b>ocean</b> <b>and</b> coastal health and human health. The Center at HML is developing new tools and approaches, including sentinel habitats and sentinel species, to evaluate linkages between ecological process and human health and wellbeing. The results provide environmental and public health managers, policy-makers and communities forecasts and assessments to improve ecosystem-based management that protects health and mitigates risks for <b>the</b> <b>oceans,</b> coasts <b>and</b> people.

5|$|In Puerto Vallarta, about 100mi (164km) {{southeast}} of the landfall location, the storm surge resulted in an estimated damage total of US$5million, primarily to hotels.

5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump.

5|$|Marine mammals are aquatic mammals {{that rely}} on <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>and</b> other marine {{ecosystems}} for their existence.

30|$|Since long, {{processes}} in the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere have been inferred from observed fluctuations in the geomagnetic field. Electric currents excited by dynamical {{processes in}} these regions cast magnetic fields reaching land and satellite magnetic observatories. But these magnetic fluctuations also induce electric currents in <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> Earth, and so the observed magnetic fields are due {{to a combination of}} the primary and induced electric currents. Accurate inference of the {{processes in the}} upper atmosphere and magnetosphere therefore depends on accurate knowledge of the conductivity distribution in <b>the</b> <b>oceans</b> <b>and</b> mantle.|$|R
