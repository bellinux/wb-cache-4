25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>question</b> is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E
25|$|As to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>question</b> — that {{of singing}} roles that, {{according}} to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not}} to be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{disagreement}} in {{the literature}} regarding whether vos Savant's formulation of the problem, as presented in Parade magazine, is asking {{the first or second}} question, and whether this difference is significant (Rosenhouse 2009). Behrends (2008) concludes that [...] "One must consider the matter with care to see that both analyses are correct"; {{which is not to say}} that they are the same. One analysis for one question, another analysis for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>question.</b> Several discussants of the paper by (Morgan et al. 1991), whose contributions were published alongside the original paper, strongly criticized the authors for altering vos Savant's wording and misinterpreting her intention (Rosenhouse 2009). One discussant (William Bell) considered it a matter of taste whether or not one explicitly mentions that (under the standard conditions), which door is opened by the host is independent of whether or not one should want to switch.|$|E
2500|$|The Australian {{referendum}} of 27 May 1967, {{called by}} the Holt Government, approved two amendments to the Australian constitution relating to Indigenous Australians. [...] Technically it was {{a vote on the}} Constitution Alteration (Aboriginals) 1967, which became law on 10 August 1967 following the results of the referendum. The amendments were overwhelmingly endorsed, winning 90.77% of votes cast and carrying in all six states. These amendments altered sections 51(xxvi), and 127, having the immediate effect of including Aboriginal Australians in determinations of population, and also empowered the Federal Parliament to legislate specifically for this racial group. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>question</b> put in the referendum, to allow the number of seats in the House of Representatives to be increased without increasing the number of senators, was rejected. [...] It received majority support in only one state – New South Wales – and received about 40.25% [...] "yes" [...] votes nationwide.|$|E
