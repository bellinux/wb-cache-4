Under the rules of the social pacts, until 2009, Irish companies could claim inability to pay, though the unions frequently fiercely contested such claims, especially where unions had no access to company financial data. New Irish legislation for collective agreements regulating the minimum wage in some sectors like cleaning, catering or construction sets out a detailed process by which individual firms can seek <b>temporary</b> <b>derogation</b> on grounds of inability to pay. These exemptions can last from 3 to 24  months and, in order to avoid abuse, employers cannot quality for exemption twice.|$|E
40|$|Two-speed' Europe {{means the}} {{development}} of closer cooperation among some Member States, pursuing objectives that are common to all EU Member States, as they are actually and precisely the objectives aimed at by the EU treaties. The {{idea is that the}} members of a smaller group would be both able and willing to go ahead immediately, while this would not be possible for all. The other Members States, each of them travelling at its own speed, would follow later. The differentiation between Member States would be temporary. In the past, transition periods and <b>temporary</b> <b>derogations,</b> frequently provided by accession treaties for new EU Member States, have been examples of such a concept. These periods have sometimes been quite long, but the derogations have been limited in time, at least in principle. BSc/BAEuropean and international business law LL...|$|R

As part of the transition to EU food law, new border inspection posts will be established in the new member states to check on and approve imports from third counties. This USDA briefing highlights how many establishments (over 700) in the new member states will require <b>temporary</b> <b>derogations</b> from EU food laws (for consumption only in the new territories of the EU and not for free circulation in the EU).

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>temporary</b> <b>derogations,</b> that are automatically discontinued {{after the end of}} the transitional period, the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification is permanent and its discontinuation is conditional only on the positive assessment of benchmarks fulfillment in the regular reports issued by the Commission. This is similar to the permanent derogations on Eurozone and Schengen Area for new member states (formulated in accession treaties), whose discontinuation is also conditional the on fulfillment of benchmarks (like the convergence criteria) and similarly assessed in regular progress reports. According to the treaties the new member states are obliged to fulfill the benchmarks for discontinuation of both these permanent derogations and the CVMs, but some of them deliberately delay these processes. The CVM is thus different from the Enhanced co-operation mechanism, where generally all EU members are free to opt-in at any time into an already established Enhanced co-operation initiative, without preconditions.|$|R
40|$|In 2004, the European Union (EU) {{implemented}} a pet movement policy (referred to {{here as the}} EUPMP) under EU regulation 998 / 2003. The United Kingdom (UK) was granted a <b>temporary</b> <b>derogation</b> from the policy until December 2011 and instead has in place its own Pet Movement Policy (Pet Travel Scheme (PETS)). A quantitative risk assessment (QRA) was developed to estimate the risk of rabies introduction to the UK under both schemes to quantify {{any change in the}} risk of rabies introduction should the UK harmonize with the EU policy. Assuming 100 % compliance with the regulations, moving to the EUPMP was predicted to increase the annual risk of rabies introduction to the UK by approximately 60 -fold, from 7. 79 × 10 (- 5) (5. 90 × 10 (- 5), 1. 06 × 10 (- 4)) under the current scheme to 4. 79 × 10 (- 3) (4. 05 × 10 (- 3), 5. 65 × 10 (- 3)) under the EUPMP. This corresponds to a decrease from 13, 272 (9, 408, 16, 940) to 211 (177, 247) years between rabies introductions. The risks associated with both the schemes were predicted to increase when less than 100 % compliance was assumed, with the current scheme of PETS and quarantine being shown to be particularly sensitive to noncompliance. The results of this risk assessment, along with other evidence, formed a scientific evidence base to inform policy decision with respect to companion animal movement...|$|E
40|$|This article aims {{to provide}} an {{analytical}} framework for the legal design of experimental legislation {{in the field of}} technology and governance. The article focuses on ‘legally disruptive experiments’, either as concretizations of factual or legal acts. The relations between such experiments and various basic types of (non) experimental legislative arrangements are mapped. The scope for experimenting is defined in terms of legal liberty and ability space, on the basis of normative positions within either rules of conduct or rules of power. A distinction is suggested between three scopes of permissiveness to (i. e., as freedom, full and partial permissiveness), and five types of permissive norms (i. e., mere silence, eloquent silence, with toleration, with rights, and with enabling rights) – all of which are potentially relevant to experimentation. Departing from the idea of legal disruption, the article goes on to focus on exceptional permissiveness to experiment by <b>temporary</b> <b>derogation.</b> Such exceptions can be arranged through limiting an obligatory legal norm upon a ‘subset’ scope of application, defined by operative facts or by legal acts. The use of these mechanisms can lead to two possible groups of exceptional, derogative regimes for experimentation (‘Permissiveness v. Obligations’ and ‘Permissiveness v. Permissiveness’), encompassing five arrangements (in short: legislative permissiveness over obligations; unlegislated permissiveness over obligations; strong silent permissiveness over weak silent permissiveness; legislated permissiveness over unlegislated permissiveness; broad over narrow permissiveness), each of which can come (as regulatory holidays or sunset clauses) with combinations of no, some or many reservations and facilitations...|$|E
40|$|Differentiated {{integration}} {{in the area of}} EU industrial policy is the result of one or more of five factors: differences in ideology among Member States, domestic political circumstances, capacity (level of economic development), national economic structures, and technical preferences. There is a considerable degree of ‘capitalist diversity’ in the EU (Wilks, 1996). Even among the ‘Original Six’ Member States there are important differences in approach to economic regulation, even if they all embrace the EU system (Gerber, 2000). Ideological difference may contribute to differentiation in that Member States where economic liberalism holds more sway in government circles will pursue different policies than those pursued by Member States where interventionist solutions to industrial problems are more acceptable. Different levels of economic development have repeatedly been used as a justification for temporary derogations for poorer Member States in the implementation of EU legislation. Justifications stemming from ideology, economic development and structures can result in differentiated participation in EU-led or other European R&D projects. Technical preference has been a cited reason for delays in certain national programmes of sector-based market liberalisation. In several areas these five factors overlap, and assessing their relative importance is difficult. Differentiated {{integration in}} industrial policy areas is largely ‘soft’ and unofficial and comes in three forms: varying national participation in EU and other European projects; the discretion permitted in the implementation of EU legislation; and varying levels of compliance with EU legislation. Legally entrenched, multi-speed differentiation is present principally in terms of <b>temporary</b> <b>derogation</b> on a limited range of EU legislation. The explicit legal sanction of more permanent differentiation in industrial policy areas is rare. This chapter presents one recent legislative development that effectively entrenches differentiation in energy markets and potentially undermines market integration in this sector...|$|E

Comment: ACP producers will need to stay abreast of these developments, if exports to the EU are not to face restrictions based on residue levels.

40|$|From the introduction]. The European Union (EU) agreed at the European Council {{meeting in}} Copenhague on 13 December 2002 to admit 10 new members from Central Europe and the Mediterranean who meet the {{political}} and economic criteria for membership: stable democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law. As full market economies they will implement all the EU’s common rules and policies. After membership in accordance with the Athens Treaty and Act of Accession signed on April 16, 2003, the new member states of the EU will participate actively in the Acquis Communautaire regulating all areas of the Community action in accordance with the solutions and adaptations negotiated with the new member states {{on the basis of the}} principle of a wholesale taking over of the acquis but subject to transitional measures and <b>temporary</b> <b>derogations</b> as in earlier accession acts (Boos and Forman, 1995) (Granell, 1995). Development has not been a contentious issue in the accession negotiation process and for this reason the subject has not received a lot of attention, even if with this evolution the new members accept the process of change from being a recipient of development assistance into being a international donor. The main reason of this limited interest in the topic is the fact that Development co-operation of the accession countries have been practically negligible until now. The new member states represent about 25 % of the EU population, about 5 % of the EU income (about 11 % in purchasing power parity terms) but only 0, 43 % of the Aid flows from the EU to developing countries. Formal negotiations on the chapter related to development cooperation (Chapter 26 – External Relations) have been closed with no exceptions agreed, therefore the new candidates will apply the relevant Community acquis and enforce the legal and institutional framework of the “Development cooperation Acquis” as an integral part of the EU’s external policies from the very first day of membership...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the current}} VAT system {{defined in the}} Sixth VAT Directive, Member States are {{required}} to have a single VAT rate of at least 15 % and may have a maximum of two reduced VAT rates set no lower than 5 %. Annex H of the 6 Directive outlines {{the list of the}} goods and services to which reduced rates could apply. However, this basic structure which applies to all Member States is complicated by the numerous individual <b>temporary</b> <b>derogations</b> granted to particular Member States. Most of these specific rates (zero rate, super reduced rates, parking rate and so on) are to be found under the title XVI Transitional provisions Article 28 of the 6 Directive and most have been granted until the entry into force of the "definitive system" of VAT based on taxation in the Member State of origin. The aim {{of this paper is to}} shed some light on the application of the current VAT system to both VAT bases and rates among Member States. For the VAT bases, our indicators demonstrate the share of the base to which a specific VAT rate applies relative to the whole taxable base. For the VAT rates, focusing on the statutory standard VAT rate is not satisfactory. To take into account the existence of different VAT rates, we compute implicit VAT rates. These implicit VAT rates give an indication on the VAT burden. Our analysis shows that the standard VAT rate is far from applicable to the whole taxable base. In the year 2000, on average for the EU- 15, 69 % of the VAT taxable transactions value was taxed at the standard VAT rate. Moreover for some Member States, only around half of the taxable transactions were actually taxed at the standard VAT rate. Therefore, non-standard VAT rates are not the exception as they should be. Taking into account all VAT rates in force gives us an implicit VAT rate that is up to 30 % lower than the standard rate in force in the Member States. In the year 2000, the EU- 15 average for the statutory standard VAT rate was 19. 4 % with a minimum (compulsory) of 15 % and a maximum of 25 %. In contrast, the implicit VAT rate for the EU- 15 was 15. 9 % with a larger volatility. VAT, European Union, Taxation, effective tax rates...|$|R
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{was asked}} to deliver a {{scientific}} statement on the increase of risk for public health related to a possible <b>temporary</b> <b>derogation</b> from the maximum level (tML) of deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisins (FUMO) and zearalenone (ZON) in maize and maize products. EFSA relied on occurrence data reflecting levels of these mycotoxins in the 2013 maize harvest. Depending on the mycotoxin, mean levels estimated considering tMLs were increased by a factor comprised between 7. 6 and 27 % in maize and maize milling fractions, and up to 99 % in some processed maize-based products, compared to levels estimated considering current ML. Chronic exposure levels estimated across the population groups – representing different age classes and countries – were increased by a factor up to 17 % for fumonisins, 20 % for deoxynivalenol and 83 % for zearalenone. The tolerable daily intake (TDI) for zearalenone set by EFSA at 0. 25 µg/kg body weight (b. w.) per day, and the group provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of 1 and 2 µg/kg b. w. per day set by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) for deoxynivalenol and fumonisins, were used as chronic health based guidance values (HBGV). For all three mycotoxins these values were exceeded {{in at least one}} age group when considering the current ML, reflecting a health concern. When considering the tMLs, percentages of consumers in the age groups with the highest exposures exceeding chronic HBGVs increased from 9. 2 to 9. 8 % for zearalenone, from 47 to 48 % for fumonisins and from 52 to 54 % for deoxynivalenol. Acute exposure scenarios resulted in exceedance of the group acute reference dose (ARfD) of 8 µg/kg b. w. established by JECFA for DON, with up to 1. 2 % of the consumption days above the group ARfD with the current ML, and up to 8. 1 % with the tML. This assessment, mainly based on French data, may lack representativeness for the European situation...|$|E
40|$|The European Union (EU) was the frontrunner for the {{establishment}} of the world’s first multinational emissions trading scheme (ETS). Committed to combating climate change, the EU sought to overcome the multilateral paralysis within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to mitigate aviation emissions. Unsuccessful in pushing for a global market-based measure (MBM) within the organisation, the EU was ready for take-off to include the sector in the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). The geographical scope, however, including all flights from and to Europe in their entire trajectory, caused frictions with the international community about sovereignty issues. Ultimately, Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard announced a ‘stop-the-clock’ for international flights, a <b>temporary</b> <b>derogation</b> until the 2013 ICAO Assembly in order to find a global agreement. The ’stop-the-clock’ initiative provides ample opportunity to analyse EU leadership in curbing aviation emissions based on an analytical framework specifying different types of leadership. Its shows the global challenge to the EU’s claim of structural leadership on various levels in and beyond ICAO. The paper aims to analyse to what extent the EU is a global leader in mitigating aviation emissions and to identify the kind of EU leadership according to a threefold analytical framework. In addition, it will factor in the 'stop-the-clock' initiative and to what extent it altered the perception of EU leadership in the field. The paper comes to the conclusion that EU leadership in mitigating aviation emissions is not stalling. On the contrary, the EU, by pursuing the extension of the EU ETS, has put aviation emissions on everybody’s radar – and thus showed idea-based leadership. Proving the scheme’s feasibility further underlined EU leadership, in the form of directional leadership. The 'stop-the-clock' decision, however, already indicated what was later on confirmed in the 38 th ICAO Assembly: Unilateral structural leadership of the EU in the field of aviation emissions is not credible at the moment...|$|E
