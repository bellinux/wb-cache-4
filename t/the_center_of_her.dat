A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending {{to her feet and}} neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E

As the series progresses, several additional characters and their histories are introduced and focused upon.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the medical}} {{treatment}} {{she had received}} in San Francisco, Kahlo's health problems continued throughout the 1940s. Due to her spinal problems, she wore twenty-eight separate supportive corsets, varying from steel and leather to plaster, between 1940 and 1954. She also experienced pain in her legs, while the infection on her hand had become chronic, and she also underwent treatment for syphilis. In addition, {{the death of her}} father in April 1941 plunged her into a depression. Her ill health made her increasingly confined to La Casa Azul, which became <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> world. She enjoyed taking care of the house and its garden, and was kept company by friends, servants, and various pets, including spider monkeys, Xoloitzcuintlis, and parrots.|$|E
50|$|Raet {{was also}} {{considered}} a wife of Montu, and she formed a triad {{with him and}} Harpocrates in Karnak and Medamud. Her feast day was in the fourth month of the reaping season. <b>The</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cult were at Medamud, El-Tod, and Thebes. A demotic manual from the Roman period with hymns to Raet has survived in fragments.|$|R
2500|$|As the United States women's {{suffrage}} {{movement was}} developing {{in the early}} 1900s, Glasgow marched in the English suffrage parades {{in the spring of}} 1909. Later she spoke at the first suffrage meeting in Virginia. Glasgow felt that the movement came [...] "at the wrong moment" [...] for her, and her participation and interest waned. [...] Glasgow did not at first make women’s roles her major theme, and she was slow to place heroines rather than heroes at <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stories. [...] Her later works, however, have heroines who display many of the attributes of women involved in the political movement.|$|R

[...] As the parent of an adult, she {{experiences}} new freedoms, respects Guy's choices, and consciously stops making her son <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life. [...] She creates new friendships with her roommates and native Africans, both male and female.

500|$|Following Beyoncé's work on [...] "1+1" [...] is like {{a journey}} to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> craft, a {{stripping}} away of every distraction until all that's left is her voice. Without it, [...] "1+1" [...] would be a muted ballad: Its simple guitar line and stardust-sprinkled strings serve no purpose other than to evoke a sense of familiar romantic intimacy, and then to elegantly step aside while Beyoncé delivers {{one of her most}} wonderfully impassioned performances ever. [...] "1+1" [...] possesses that slightly scary intensity that has been R's worst-kept secret weapon since Whitney Houston's [...] "I Have Nothing", but it also demonstrates perfectly how Beyoncé stands apart from every other big-chested diva getting her Whitney on. She lets the song sing through her with a clarity that is never clinical, a strength that never sabotages, and an expressiveness that is precisely as sentimental as its subject matter requires. Beyoncé is R's field marshal, demanding of her listeners and herself an absolute fidelity to the music's emotional possibilities, with a perfectly modulated vehemence that is as captivating as it is tyrannical.|$|E
500|$|Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine {{noted that}} in the video, [...] "Gaga fully embraces the monstrous {{as a part of}} her." [...] Moralde further {{explained}} that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as [...] "Mother Monster", but never to the visceral, fully embodied extent that she does in the video. [...] "The things that are monstrous, the things that are different—for Gaga, {{those are the things that}} are beautiful," [...] he concluded. Gina Serpe from E! Online criticized it for being a [...] "Madonna rip-off", while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film, Metropolis. Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism. According to her, with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass, by portraying images borrowed from fine art, cinema and cool subcultures. Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner, instead of a conventional-looking male or female consort. Powers further added that [...] "Gaga has found a way to place female empowerment at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy's girl or a 'boy toy'." [...] Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga's usage of shock-imagery, which she still found [...] "strange". The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities, not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna, but to Greek and Roman mythology, surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.|$|E

2500|$|Berry's seventh novel {{presents}} a concise vision of Port William's [...] "membership." [...] The story encompasses Hannah's life, including the Great Depression, World War II, the postwar industrialization of agriculture, {{the flight of}} youth to urban employment, and the consequent remoteness of grandchildren. The tale is told {{in the voice of}} an old woman twice widowed, who has experienced much loss yet has never been defeated. Somehow, lying at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> strength is the [...] "membership"—the fact that people care for each other and, even in absence, hold each other in a kind of presence. All in all, Hannah Coulter embodies many of the themes of Berry's Port William saga.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{she added}} {{sociology}} and Christian education to her teaching load. President Wiley, who appreciated good talent and Olive Winchester, made her {{vice president of}} the College in 1922, and the following year she was appointed academic dean as well, holding both positions simultaneously until her resignation in 1935. ... A history of Northwest's first quarter-century summarized her administrative role in a sentence: [...] "She contributed very much {{to the development of the}} right attitude toward scholastic standards, as vice-president and dean of the college had much to do with the internal organization of the institution." ... At <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> legacy stood the undeniable fact that she was a pivotal figure in the transition of Northwest Nazarene College from a sagebrush academy to a sound academic institution." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} {{sessions}} of Sojourner's speech, she utilized {{a story from}} the Bible to help strengthen her argument for equal rights for women. She ended her argument by accusing men of being self-centered, saying, [...] "man is so selfish that he has got women's rights and his own too, and yet he won't give women their rights. He keeps them all to himself." [...] For the final session of Sojourner's speech, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> attention was mainly on women's right to vote. Sojourner told her audience that she owned her own house, as did other women, and must therefore pay taxes. Nevertheless, they were still unable to vote because they were women. Black women who were enslaved were made to do hard manual work, such as building roads. Sojourner argues that if these women were able to perform such tasks, then they {{should be allowed to}} vote because surely voting is easier than building roads.|$|E
60|$|The queen {{fixed her}} gaze upon a plump young maiden. Her victim {{tried to turn}} away, hiding {{her face in her}} hands and {{kneeling}} behind a woman; but the reptile, with unblinking eyes, stared on with such fixity that I could have sworn her vision penetrated the woman, and the girl's arms to reach at last <b>the</b> very <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brain.|$|R

2500|$|From 1871 to 1911, {{the site}} of the rose garden was part of the city's Agricultural Park. The rose garden area was then used for horse, camel, dog, and later {{automobile}} racing; it also reportedly housed the city's longest bar and [...] "one of its most stylish brothels." [...] In 1914, the city announced plans to construct a wildflower garden at the park, but the rose garden was not built until 1927 with the planting of 15,000 bushes of more than 100 varieties. When the garden was announced, the Los Angeles Times applauded the project: [...] "No more fitting tribute could be paid to the spirit of Southern California than to erect in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> largest city the greatest rose garden in the world." [...] During the Great Depression, the lack of funding threatened the closure of the rose garden, then described as [...] "the largest rose garden in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, the total US ground forces in Vietnam were {{increased}} to 82,000 or by 150 percent. That same month, Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective, and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse. Gen. Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82,000 to 175,000. After consulting with his principals, Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce {{at a press conference}} an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request. Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices—between sending Americans to die in Vietnam and giving in to the communists. If he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached. He continued to insist that his decision [...] "did not imply any change in policy whatsoever". Of his desire to veil the decision, Johnson jested privately, [...] "If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and she has it in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> forehead, you don't keep her in the living room". By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{women were}} thought to be able to {{eliminate}} the danger from destructive weather. This was the case with Stana Tomić, a healer from Jarmenovci in the municipality of Topola. Her fellow villagers held her in high esteem and claimed that she saved Jarmenovci from hail many times. At the sight of hail clouds, she would place the dining table at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> house, before putting on it a piece of bread, salt, and the lighted candle that had been used during the celebration of the slava. She would then go out into the yard and shout: [...] "ORadomir, hanged man, lead the kolo around. Turn those white cattle back there, do not let them come here. Here is a bigger prodigy: a girl of seven years old bore a child, wrapped it in silken diapers, bound it with a silken ribbon. Do not let harm come to our vineyards, do not let harm come to our fruitful fields." [...] In 1956, when this was recorded, Stana had been protecting Jarmenovci in this way for thirty years. In the regions of Takovo and Užice, people claimed that some villages had never been ravaged by hail, because in each of them there was a woman that prevented it.|$|E

60|$|If {{there was}} any one thing in her uniformly self-denied life {{that had been a}} {{personal}} ambition and a personal desire, it had been that her son should have a college education.

From the left shoulder depended a leopard's tail, while her feet were shod with sturdy little sandals. The knife was her only weapon. Its blade was of iron, the grip was wound with hide and protected by a guard of three out-bowing strips of flat iron, and upon the top of the hilt was a knob of gold.|$|E

There's something queer about that. I don't understand why my mother should have taken that table down to the city with her, but she did. It was just an old, battered-up walnut stand, and yet she seemed to think the world of it. She put it in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> room in the city just as she used to have it in our old home. Oh, how I hated that room! There was something uncanny about it.
