5|$|NOTE: Opinion {{is divided}} {{about the size}} of an ala turma, between 30 and 32 men. 30 {{was the size of a}} turma in the Republican cavalry and in the cohors equitata of the Principate auxilia. Against this is a {{statement}} by Arrian that an ala was 512 strong. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> an ala turma 32 men strong.|$|E
5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked {{that he was}} glad he abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of a ramp connecting the IND Fulton Street Line with the Fulton Street Elevated on Liberty Avenue. Six stations on the elevated would have their platforms extended to accommodate 10-car trains. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> possible the demolition of the BMT Fulton Street Line between Grant Avenue and Rockaway Avenue and the demolition of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line.|$|E

5|$|ASL is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{cited as the}} third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population requiring an interpreter in court. Although <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it {{does not imply that}} it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since speakers of other languages may also speak English.|$|E
5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it much more difficult to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the genus Tarbosaurus redundant. Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, {{are considered to be}} at least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Oslo City Council {{decided to}} build a four-line metro to the new suburbs {{to the east of}} the city center. The plans would lead to the system opening in 1966, after the {{conversion}} of the Østensjø and the Lambertseter Line of the Oslo Tramway to metro standard, and supplemented with the new Furuset and Grorud Line. The system would feature higher and longer platforms, allowing step-free access to six-car trains, automatic train protection and third rail power supply. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the metro incompatible with the existing tramways.|$|E
5|$|In January 2017, it was {{announced}} that Beyoncé would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> Beyoncé only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999. It was later announced on February 23, 2017 that Beyoncé would {{no longer be able to}} perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she will instead headline the 2018 festival. Upon the announcement of Beyoncé's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.|$|E

To put this in perspective, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it larger than all but four of the asteroids, after 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 4 Vesta, and 10 Hygiea. In spite of its relatively large size, however, lightcurve studies suggest that Hi'iaka is not a gravitationally collapsed spheroid; they further suggest that Hi'iaka is not tidally locked and has a rotation period of about 9.8 hours.|$|E
5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Gorgosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} weighing {{more than}} two metric tons as an adult; dozens of large, sharp teeth lined its jaws, while its two-fingered forelimbs were comparatively small. Gorgosaurus was most closely related to Albertosaurus, and more distantly related to the larger Tyrannosaurus. Gorgosaurus and Albertosaurus are extremely similar, distinguished mainly by subtle differences in the teeth and skull bones. Some experts consider G. libratus to be a species of Albertosaurus; <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of that genus.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} caused $26.5million in damages, with $11.5million to property and $15million to crops, with the storm's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the storm the most costly of {{the hurricane}} season. Despite the hurricane's wide swath of damage and strong intensity, only eight people were killed. The low number of fatalities is attributable to the extensive evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as warnings provided by the Weather Bureau.|$|E

The issue of Israel (570-600) weighed 1.5grams and was 17mm in diameter. The Roman solidus of Maurice Tiberius was 4.36-4.47grams. A majority of these coins were found in South Arabia and not Aksum. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an AU Unit.|$|E
5|$|The next {{mention of}} Qatna after the Story of Sinuhe comes from Mari in the 18th century BC, {{during the reign}} of Išḫi-Addu of Qatna. However, a tablet found in Tuttul, dating to the early reign of the Mariote king Yahdun-Lim in the late 19th century BC, {{mentions}} a king named Amut-piʾel, who is most probably the father of Išḫi-Addu; <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him the first known king of Qatna. Also {{during the reign of}} Yahdun-Lim, the kingdom of Yamhad in Aleppo and its king Sumu-Epuh enter the historical record through the texts of Mari.|$|E
5|$|These speculations {{cannot be}} proven without doubt {{but as a}} governor, Odaenathus {{would have been the}} highest {{authority}} in the province and above any legionary commander and provincial officials; <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him the commander of the Roman forces in the province. Whatever the case may be, starting from 258, Odaenathus strengthened his position and extended his political influence in the region. By 260, Odaenathus held the rank, credibility and power to pacify the Roman east following the Battle of Edessa.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes are {{not very}} {{uncommon}} {{in the state of}} Connecticut, but tornadoes of this power are rare. Though tornadoes have only been officially rated on the Fujita scale since 1950, this tornado has been estimated to be of F4-intensity on the scale. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it one of only three tornadoes of this intensity to ever affect the state, as of 2008. Thirty-four people were killed by the tornadothirty-one more than the second-deadliest Connecticut tornadoand 70 others injured.|$|E
5|$|With Irvine, Nomura {{tried to}} strike a balance between not overshadowing Squall and not {{becoming}} too unattractive. He gave Irvine a handsome appearance, but a casual personality, hoping that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him less attractive than Squall. Keeping with this idea, Nomura gave him goggles; however, this idea was abandoned in favor of an American cowboy-like appearance to set him apart from other goggle-wearing characters in the Final Fantasy series.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister group relationship between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E
