5|$|As the war progressed and Germany's lighter <b>tanks</b> were {{replaced}} by the Panzer III, Panzer IV and heavier <b>tanks,</b> such as the Panther, the T-26 was gradually replaced through attrition by the vastly superior T-34.

One of the battalion positions at {{the eastern side of}} the road bridge was overrun, and had to be recaptured with a counter-attack. Another attack two hours later was in danger of capturing the bridge, so Brigadier Bellamy ordered it blown up. German infantry attempted to infiltrate the brigade's positions throughout the night. At 05:30 German armour was detected approaching and the brigade called in close air support from RAF Typhoon fighter bombers, which destroyed several <b>tanks.</b> The main road bridge, held by 1st RUR, was attacked at 07:00 by infantry and two <b>tanks.</b> The attack failed when the <b>tanks</b> were destroyed by the division's anti-tank guns.

5|$|At night, a Syrian {{expeditionary force}} {{attempted}} to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first.

The Syrians pierced the Israeli defense, but their infantry was at some distance behind the <b>tanks.</b> The Israelis knocked out four Syrian <b>tanks</b> and four armored cars with 20mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements. The surviving Syrian <b>tanks</b> withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, the Syrians halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable <b>tanks</b> that the Israelis managed to repair.|$|E
5|$|At the conference, {{in light}} of the little {{information}} available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 <b>tanks</b> on Monday October 8, of which 530 <b>tanks</b> would be distributed among three divisions: 200 <b>tanks</b> under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian <b>tanks</b> at 400, when there were in fact 800 <b>tanks</b> across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan's 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon's 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, most commanders thought enemy <b>tanks</b> should be met by <b>tanks</b> with {{superior}} specifications. This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France. Many means of destroying <b>tanks,</b> including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other <b>tanks</b> were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World WarI.|$|E
5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral <b>tanks</b> were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the <b>tanks</b> to counter her rolling motion.
