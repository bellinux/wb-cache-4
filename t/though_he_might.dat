25|$|For {{a couple}} of years in the late 1940s, Tremlett looked as <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be the answer to some of England's post-war cricketing woes. A tall, curly-haired all-rounder, Tremlett had a whippy fast-medium bowling action that moved the ball off the pitch and was a pugnacious {{right-handed}} batsman, strong at driving.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstance}} of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary {{arrived at}} the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep to his house. He did so, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have escaped; and though he perceived {{the state of the}} true religion to be desperate. He knew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.|$|E

[...] He also told Kass that [...] "it would have been a very interesting trial." ...|$|R
25|$|Against Bradman's Invincibles in 1948, Compton was England's {{standout}} {{performer in}} a losing cause. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he scored 184 {{in the second}} innings after Australia had established a first innings lead of 344, and it looked as <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> save the match for England until he lost his balance to a short-pitched ball from Miller and hit his wicket. In the Third Test at Old Trafford, Compton scored an unbeaten 145 in the first innings, when no other batsman made more than 37. He had scored only four runs when, while facing a bumper barrage from Ray Lindwall, he edged the ball onto his forehead. Compton was forced off {{the ground with a}} cut head, given two stitches, and ordered to rest despite wanting to return to the crease. He eventually came back out when England was teetering at 119 for 5 and enabled the team to reach 363. This was the only match that England did not lose, and if so much time had not been lost to the weather they might have won it. In the series he made 562 runs at 62.44, against fierce fast bowling from Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston.|$|E
500|$|On 19 March Reich was {{transferred}} to the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary and examined again. This time it was decided that he was mentally competent and that his personality seemed intact, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> become psychotic when stressed. A few days later, on his 60th birthday, he wrote to his son, Peter, then 13: ...|$|E
500|$|While he {{occasionally}} scripted certain pages or scenes, more frequently he did not, and often wrote dialogue only after having drawn the artwork. [...] Brown did not plan out the stories, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have certain ideas prepared. [...] Some ideas he found carried him {{for up to}} two to three issues of Yummy Fur. [...] Brown used of flashback scenes different perspectives to alter the story to his needs—for example, when Brown revisited the scene of Josie's murder, he placed Ed behind a bush, linking the two characters' fates. [...] When he had originally done the murder scene, he says he did not [...] "know that Ed was over in the bushes a couple feet away".|$|E

500|$|Montcalm {{was taken}} aback to learn of the British deployment, and his {{response}} has been regarded as precipitate. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville's column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe's force directly. [...] Had he waited, the British would have been entirely cut off—they {{had nowhere to go}} but back down the Foulon, and would have been under fire the entire way. To an artillery officer named Montbelliard, Montcalm explained his decision thus: [...] "We cannot avoid action; the enemy is entrenching, he already has two pieces of cannon. If we give him time to establish himself, we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have." ...|$|E
500|$|Arthur's unpopularity in life {{carried over}} into his {{assessment}} by historians, and his reputation after leaving office disappeared. [...] By 1935, historian George F. Howe said that Arthur had achieved [...] "an obscurity in strange contrast to his significant part in American history." [...] By 1975, however, Thomas C. Reeves would write that Arthur's [...] "appointments, if unspectacular, were unusually sound; the corruption and scandal that dominated business and politics of the period did not tarnish his administration." [...] As 2004 biographer Zachary Karabell wrote, although Arthur was [...] "physically stretched and emotionally strained, he strove {{to do what was}} right for the country." [...] Indeed, Howe had earlier surmised, [...] "Arthur adopted [...] for his own political behavior but subject to three restraints: he remained to everyone a man of his word; he kept scrupulously free from corrupt graft; he maintained a personal dignity, affable and genial <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be. These restraints... distinguished him sharply from the stereotype politician." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this, {{shortly after}} the British race McLaren's {{experienced}} team manager Teddy Mayer decided not to continue with Villeneuve for the following year. His explanation was that Villeneuve [...] "was looking as <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be a bit expensive" [...] and that Patrick Tambay, the team's eventual choice for 1978, was showing similar promise. Villeneuve was left with no solid options for 1978, although Canadian Walter Wolf, for whom Villeneuve had driven in Can-Am racing, considered giving him a drive at Wolf Racing. Rumours circulated that Villeneuve {{was one of several}} drivers in whom Ferrari's team was interested, and in August 1977 he flew to Italy to meet Enzo Ferrari, who was immediately reminded of the pre-war European champion Tazio Nuvolari: [...] "When they presented me with this 'piccolo Canadese' (little Canadian), this minuscule bundle of nerves, I immediately recognised in him the physique of Nuvolari and said to myself, let's give him a try." [...] Ferrari was satisfied with Villeneuve's promise after a session at Ferrari's Fiorano test track, despite the Canadian making many mistakes and setting relatively slow times, and Villeneuve signed to drive for Ferrari in the last two races of the 1977 season and the 1978 season. Villeneuve later remarked that: [...] "If someone said to me that you can have three wishes, my first would have been to get into racing, my second to be in Formula 1, my third to drive for Ferrari..." ...|$|E

60|$|And he {{realized}} all this without malice or hatred. To kill was {{the law of}} the wild world he knew. Few were his primitive pleasures, but the greatest of these was to hunt and kill, and so he accorded to others the right to cherish the same desires as <b>he,</b> even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> himself <b>might</b> be the object of their hunt.|$|R

2500|$|Morales {{began work}} on his [...] "indigenous autonomy" [...] policy, which he {{launched}} in the eastern lowlands department on August 3, 2009. Bolivia was the first nation {{in the history of}} South America to affirm the right of indigenous people to self-government. Speaking in Santa Cruz Department, the President called it [...] "a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement", saying that, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> make errors, he would [...] "never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people." [...] A vote on further autonomy for jurisdictions took place in December 2009, {{at the same time as}} general elections to office. The issue divided the country.|$|E
2500|$|When the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League {{started to}} operate in 1946, López stayed with Magallanes for the rest oh his career and also managed the team in part of that season. He batted a paltry [...]216 average and three homers in 28 games, while his 23 RBIs ranked him fourth in the new circuit despite missing {{significant}} playing time due to recurrent injuries. He also realized that his pitching arm was gone, and <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> come back {{for a couple of}} games, he could never again pitch effectively at all, giving up three earned runs on four hits and five walks, while striking one in his final three innings of work. Interestingly, López became the first player to pinch-hit a home run in VPBL history in that season, when he belted his blast off Vargas' ace pitcher Roy Welmaker.|$|E

25|$|Kenneth Day was {{a popular}} student athlete and the roommate of Cyril Wilcox, whose suicide {{triggered}} {{the creation of the}} Court. He admitted to sexual relations with men and was expelled. <b>Though</b> told <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be considered for readmission, his repeated requests were denied. He married in April 1926 and moved to New York, where he worked as a head bank teller. He had two daughters, was widowed late in life, and married twice more.|$|R

Besides, he had implicit faith in his daughter's judgment. So {{he held out his hand}} without hesitation.|$|R
