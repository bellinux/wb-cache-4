5000|$|At {{the same}} time, {{even at the}} Bezalel - a school of art founded by a {{sculptor}} - sculpture was considered a lesser art, and the studies there concentrated {{on the art of}} painting and the crafts of graphic and design. Even in the [...] "New Bezalel", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place. While it is true that a department of sculpture was set up in the new school, it closed a year later, because it was viewed as a <b>tool</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>students</b> learn three-dimensional design and not as an independent department. In its place a department of pottery opened and flourished. There were exhibitions by individual sculptors during these years both in the Bezalel Museum and in the Tel Aviv Museum, but these were exceptions and were not indicative of the general attitude toward three-dimensional art. An ambiguous attitude toward sculpture by the artistic establishment could be felt, in various incarnations, well into the 1960s.|$|E
