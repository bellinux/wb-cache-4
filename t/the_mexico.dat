5|$|During the 2008–09 Superliga Femenina season Domínguez {{was still}} enjoying playing for L'Estartit. She {{revealed}} {{it was her}} ultimate dream to coach <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> women's national team. She had started coaching L'Estartit's youth teams the previous season. Difficulties with her visa and commitments with <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> national team eventually reduced Domínguez's playing time with UE L'Estartit. In {{the first half of}} the 2011–12 Superliga Femenina season she appeared four times. In April 2012 UE L'Estartit admitted defeat in their attempts to bring her back to Spain.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas City Royals {{purchased}} López's {{contract in}} August 1974, {{shortly after he}} led <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> City Reds to the Mexican League World Series title in four straight games. The Royals also purchased the contracts of Mexican League players Orlando Cepeda and 16-year-old Germán Barranca in the same month. The Royals planned to use López in the September pennant race and throughout the next season.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} exceeding 4in (100mm) {{caused many}} rivers to swell. An unspecified island {{was separated from}} <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> mainland after the bridge connecting the two was washed away, stranding dozens of families. In El Salvador, significant flooding killed four people. Gusts peaked at 58mph (85km/h) at an automated weather station in Puerto Madero, Chiapas. Across the affected regions, these winds caused damage limited to house roofs and trees. Barbara caused severe crop damage totaling to 200 million pesos (2007 MXN; $55 million). About a hundred residents were forced to evacuate after the storm destroyed a dozen palm huts in Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 {{they played}} at minimum five unofficial games {{of which the}} returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign {{on the shoulders of}} their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on August 6. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 16 after crossing Central America. Cloudiness and convection gradually increased along the wave axis and organized into a distinct area of disturbed weather on August 20 while located a short distance south of Manzanillo, Mexico. It slowly became better organized as it moved northwestward in an area favorable for continued development. With light vertical wind shear and warm water temperatures, the convection concentrated around a developing low-level circulation, and on August 22 it organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine-E while it was located about 115miles (185km) west of <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> mainland or about 220miles (345km) southeast of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. With an anticyclone located over the southwestern United States and a ridge extending southward into northwestern Mexico, the National Hurricane Center initially predicted the depression to track generally west-northwestward out to sea and reach peak winds of 50mph (85km/h).|$|E
5|$|As candidate, the {{proposals}} of Mancera included to continue Ebrard's policies, {{an increase of}} 13.000 to 20.000 safety cameras, a reduction of car travel time, the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> City Metro , {{a review of the}} issue of solid waste, the minibuses will be removed from the streets, 18 water purification plants, a Green Plan, the replacement of garbage trucks to separate organic and inorganic waste, among others. On July 1, 2012, exit polls noted that Mancera was the presumed winner of the election, with a margin of 59.5–64.5%, and had approximately 40% more votes than the second-place candidate, Paredes. On July 7, 2012, the Federal District Electoral Institute (IEDF) announced Mancera as Head of Government-elect, endorsing him with a certificate; which he received on October 8, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the ratio}} of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a {{television}} station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require {{that there must be}} eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market).Though the E. W. Scripps Company owns KGTV and KZSD-LP, they are not considered a duopoly under the FCC's legal definition as common ownership between full-power and low-power television stations in the same market is permitted regardless to the number of stations licensed to the area. As a whole, <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns both XHAS-TV and XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XHUAA-TV and XHWT-TV along with being the license holder for XETV-TV, which was formerly managed by California-based subsidiary Bay City Television).|$|E

5|$|Edward Norton {{flew out}} to Austin and met Malick, {{who had been}} {{impressed}} by the actor's screen test for Primal Fear. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming A Time to Kill to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the latter flew up from <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> set of Romeo + Juliet to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport. Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer {{only to find out}} that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in Saving Private Ryan and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg's film instead. Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time contraints. Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke's scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{during the}} season was {{relatively}} minimal. In early June, Tropical Storm Barbara moved ashore just northwest of the Mexico–Guatemala border, causing $55 million (2007 USD) in damage and 4 deaths. In late July, Cosme passed south of the island of Hawaii as a weakening tropical depression; light rain and increased surf resulted. A few days later, Dalila passed offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico, killing 11 and causing minimal damage. Hurricane Flossie followed a similar track to Cosme in mid-August, producing gusty winds and light precipitation in Hawaii. Hurricane Henriette in early September produced torrential rainfall in southwestern Mexico, killing 6 and causing $25 million in damage. Baja California received moderate rains from Hurricane Ivo in mid-September, though no damage nor fatalities were reported. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Kiko passed just offshore the coastline of southwestern Mexico. Though no deaths were reported on <b>the</b> <b>Mexico</b> mainland, the storm capsized a ship with 30 people on board, 15 of whom were recovered dead, and 9 of whom were reported missing. Overall, the season ended with $80 million in damage and 49 deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Operation California {{began using}} the name Operation USA because it better {{described}} the effort and intent of the organization to represent the entire American people. In 1989 Operation USA facilitated operations on children in Vietnam who had cleft palates by a Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, Dr Stanley Frileck. Medical aid and rebuilding effort was delivered to Mexico in 1990, by OPUSA. In 1991 OPUSA delivered aid to Bangladesh. OpUSA delivered aid to war torn Somali's in 1993. In 1994 OpUSA provided earthquake relief. In 1995 the organization provided aid to Hurricane Mitch survivors in Honduras and Nicaragua. In 1999 OpUSA supplied aid to storm victims in Mexico. In 2003 OpUSA delivered aid to Iraq War victims in the Persian Gulf.
