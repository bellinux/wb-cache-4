40|$|The SHC {{proteins}} {{have been}} implicated in insulin receptor (IR) signaling. In this study, we used the sensitive two-hybrid assay of protein-protein interaction to demonstrate that SHC interacts directly with <b>the</b> <b>IR.</b> <b>The</b> interaction is mediated by SHC amino acids 1 to 238 and is therefore independent of the Src homology 2 domain. The interaction is dependent upon <b>IR</b> autophosphorylation, since <b>the</b> interaction is eliminated by mutation of <b>the</b> <b>IR</b> ATP-binding site. In addition, mutational analysis of the Asn-Pro-Glu-Tyr (NPEY) motif within the juxtamembrane domain of <b>the</b> <b>IR</b> showed <b>the</b> importance of the Asn, Pro, and Tyr residues to both SHC and IR substrate 1 (IRS- 1) binding.
