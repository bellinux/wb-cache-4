5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> is a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} the first violins stating <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> over a string and wind accompaniment. This theme consists of two eight-measure phrases, each repeated: the first phrase modulates from C minor to the dominant, G minor; the second phrase modulates back to C minor. The soloist does not play any part in the statement of <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> entering only in Variation I. Here, the piano ornaments <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> over an austere string accompaniment.|$|E
5|$|The {{music is}} also very similar to <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|E
50|$|Measures 1-21 {{introduce}} <b>the</b> first <b>theme.</b> Subsequently, <b>the</b> second <b>theme</b> initiates {{a developmental}} exposition in which <b>the</b> two <b>themes</b> are frequently juxtaposed. The impression one gets from the collective development of <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> {{is one of}} simultaneous unity and duality: <b>the</b> two <b>themes</b> act as one, but are in opposition to each other.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> and its broken seventh chord (G-B-D-F) which {{characterize}} {{this movement}} is stated {{first as a}} major seventh in the two first passages of the first section A with a discreet accompaniment. To finish this section, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> arpeggiates a dominant seventh. In the second A section, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> first repeats the major seventh before developing into a minor seventh with a minor third in the second passage (G-B-D-F).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> tune to Neighbours was {{composed}} by Tony Hatch whose then wife, Jackie Trent, wrote the lyrics. Since 1985, {{there have been}} eight versions of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> tune. Barry Crocker performed the song until 1992. The song has been voted the world's most recognised television theme song and the lyrics were quoted by John Smith, then British Shadow Chancellor, in a House of Commons debate on Government economic policy. From 2007, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> tune to Neighbours was sung by Sandra de Jong. In February 2013, Network Ten and FremantleMedia announced that they were searching across Australia and the United Kingdom for a singer to record {{a new version of}} <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> tune. The competition resulted in a tie and the new theme was sung as a duet by Daniel Boys and Stephanie Angelini. That version of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> tune began airing from 15 April 2013. A new retro-inspired theme tune sung by Garth Ploog debuted on 5 January 2015 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations.|$|E

5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes on <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E

25|$|Each film, and {{particularly}} the first one, starts with an overture: a series of statements of <b>the</b> principal <b>themes</b> of <b>the</b> feature, which extended from the opening credits till after the individual title of the film. The prologue to the first film, for instance, features the History of <b>the</b> One Ring <b>theme,</b> Lothlórien <b>theme,</b> <b>The</b> Mordor accompaniments, Sauron's <b>theme,</b> <b>the</b> Servants of Sauron <b>theme,</b> <b>the</b> Fall of Men, Aragorn's <b>theme</b> and <b>the</b> Shire <b>theme</b> and variations {{and at some point}} was to feature <b>the</b> second-age Gondor <b>theme</b> and <b>the</b> Power of Mordor as well. The main Lord of <b>the</b> Rings <b>theme</b> appears on <b>the</b> main title, while <b>the</b> main <b>theme</b> of each individual episode appears on the second title. Shore used the first film to introduce <b>the</b> principle <b>themes,</b> <b>the</b> second film to add more <b>themes</b> and <b>the</b> third film to create conflict and cross-overs between <b>the</b> existing <b>themes</b> and bring them to a resolution, creating in <b>the</b> process new <b>themes</b> for <b>the</b> Forth Age.|$|R

5|$|Mihardja {{later wrote}} that he {{intended}} the novel {{to deal with the}} question of the existence of God. Mahayana et al. agree, noting that <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> of faith– a theme unknown in modern Indonesian literature at the time– is found throughout the novel. Maier notes that the psychological concepts of guilt, fear, and remorse drive the novel. Teeuw describes the work as taking up the classic theme of modernity versus tradition in a new, more worldly manner. Balfas writes that this approach to <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> was soon followed by other writers.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{movement}} {{opens with}} <b>the</b> main <b>theme,</b> {{which consists of}} two contrasting parts—the first is strong in character {{and the second is}} more lyrical. The transition to the relative major has elements of the head of <b>the</b> main <b>theme.</b> <b>The</b> secondary <b>theme</b> contrasts <b>the</b> main <b>theme</b> by being very subtle in nature, and has a dance-like rhythm. The exposition concludes with a strong codetta. The development is primarily built around the head of <b>the</b> main <b>theme,</b> which is thoroughly developed. The recapitulation omits the head of <b>the</b> main <b>theme,</b> and <b>the</b> secondary <b>theme</b> is recapitulated in C major, thus ending the movement in a major key.|$|R
