40|$|Factors {{affecting}} catecholamine {{levels in}} vitro were studied using the modified high pressure liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection. Differential centrifugation showed that platelet-rich plasma contained significantly higher catecholamine levels than platelet-poor plasma. Serum samples {{had significantly higher}} catecholamine levels than plasma. Plasma or serum samples clotted with glass beads had significantly higher catecholamine levels than those without. Therefore, consistent results can only be obtained when catecholamine samples are spun at the same speed, either plasma or serum can be used, but not both in a single study. Post-dated blood for transfusion was used to study stability of catecholamines, and showed that catecholamines are stable. Hence, the collection of blood samples for catecholamine measurements was modified. Blood samples were collected in Vacutainer tubes containing lithium heparin without antioxidants and not pre-cooled, samples were spun at the convenient time. This was welcomed by the clinicians {{who did not have}} to interrupt clinical assessment to care for blood samples as with the former method. The three clinical studies showed no significant differences in catecholamine levels in patients undergoing laryngoscopy with and without tracheal intubation, whether or not the patients were beta blocked or had received topical <b>tracheal</b> <b>analgesia.</b> The mean catecholamine levels were within the normal range. No relationships between baseline catecholamine levels and the baseline blood pressures or heart rate nor between the changes in catecholamine levels from the baseline and the corresponding changes in blood pressures or heart rate. The Injury Severity Score in minor injured patients had no relationship with plasma catecholamine levels, and no significant rise in noradrenaline levels when the ISS< 30 and adrenaline levels when the ISS< 17. The studies suggest that catecholamine levels are of no value in assessing the severity of minor injuries, or changes in blood pressures or heart rate during anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{measure the}} change in the minimum {{alveolar}} concentration of isoflurane (EtISO) associated with epidural nalbuphine and the postoperative analgesic requirements in dogs after ovariohysterectomy. METHODS: Twenty four healthy female dogs were randomly assigned to receive saline or nalbuphine at 0. 3 or 0. 6 mg/kg (n= 8 for each group) administered via lumbosacral epidural catheter introduced cranially into the epidural canal. Changes in heart and respiratory rates and arterial blood pressure during surgery were recorded along with the corresponding EtISO. Immediately after <b>tracheal</b> extubation, <b>analgesia,</b> sedation, heart rate, respiratory rate, and arterial blood pressure were measured at predetermined intervals and every 60 min thereafter until the first rescue analgesic. RESULTS: A significant decrease in EtISO was associated with epidural nalbuphine at 0. 3 mg/kg (26. 3 %) and 0. 6 mg/kg (38. 4 %) but not with saline in ovariohysterectomized dogs. In the postoperative period, VAS and Colorado analgesic scores were lower for the dogs that received the higher nalbuphine dose, which only required supplemental analgesia 10 h following its administration, compared with dogs that received the lower dose. CONCLUSION: Epidural nalbuphine significantly reduces the intra-operative isoflurane requirement and provides prolonged postoperative analgesia after ovariohysterectomy in dogs...|$|R
