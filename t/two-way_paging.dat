40|$|This chapter {{analyses}} {{the parameters}} influencing initial design of communication systems, for new mines and upgrading existing systems. Paragraph 5. 2 outlines those variables {{that must be}} taken into account during the design stages of a new wired phone system. Recommended features, general requirements, and how they can be implemented are treated in this section. Paragraph 5. 3 describes ways of improving or extending the range of trolley carrier phone systems and pager phone systems already installed in the mine. 5. 2 New Phone System Design The task of designing an adequate communication, control, and monitoring system for an underground mine must be addressed on a system basis. In addition to insuring that effective voice communication is established, any new system should take into account present and future requirements of remote control and monitoring functions. Chapter 4 illustrated the drastic savings in response time that can be realized when remote control and monitoring are integrated into the overall communication system. The importance of including control and monitoring in the overall design plan for any system cannot be overemphasized. Because each mine is unique, and thus usually has its own special operating characteristics and communication requirements, there is no such thing as "the one best system" to meet the requirements of all mines. The optimum communication, control, and monitoring system for a mine must be one that has been tailored to meet the special requirements of that particular mine. Factors that must be considered during system design include- a. Type of mine and mining methods (low- or high-seam coal, deep hardrock mine, stope caving, longwall, room and pillar, etc.). b. Maximum number of working sections. c. Expected mine growth rate and eventual maximum size. d. Haulage methods (tracked trolley, diesel, belt, etc.). e. Underground power distribution system (dc, ac, or both). f. Features desired (<b>two-way</b> radio <b>paging,</b> private line capability for emergency use, etc.). g. Redundant or backup systems for use during outages of the normal system. Although no two mines are alike, the following items have been established as the main characteristics desired for any underground communication system: 1. Multiple Communication Paths to Outside [...] the objective here is to give all telephones a second method of communicating with the surface. 2. Audible Emergency Signaling [...] the communication system provides the main means of alerting miners during emergencies. The system should include means to broadcast distinct audible signals for emergency signaling. Initiation of these signals should probably be controlled from. a central outside point, such as a surface control room. 3. Emergency Override [...] provisions should be included to permit any conversation to be overridden with emergency communication. 4. Selective Area Page [...] as mines grow larger it is apparent that the entire telephone system paging mode need not be activated each time a call is initiated. When the general area of...|$|R

5000|$|ReFLEX is a {{wireless}} protocol developed by Motorola, used for <b>two-way</b> <b>paging,</b> messaging, and low-bandwidth data. It {{is based on}} the FLEX one-way paging protocol, adding capabilities for multiple forward channels, multiple return channels, and roaming. It originally came in two variants, ReFLEX25 and ReFLEX50. ReFLEX50 was originally developed to support a messaging service launched by MTEL in the mid 1990s, while ReFLEX25 was developed several years later to provide an upgrade path for traditional one-way paging carriers. [...] The 50 and 25 signified 50 KHz and 25KHz channel spacing, although in reality both variants supported flexible channel configurations. The two variants were unified into a single protocol with version 2.7, which was released simply as ReFLEX 2.7. Devices compliant with ReFLEX 2.7 are backwards compatible with both ReFLEX25 and ReFLEX50 networks, with several new features to improve roaming, performance, and interoperability between different networks. ReFLEX systems support forward channel speeds of 1600, 3200, and 6400 bits per second, and return channel speeds of 800, 1600, 6400, and 9600 bits per second. Like FLEX, ReFLEX is synchronous, based on 1.875 second frames and 4-level FSK modulation.|$|E

40|$|The US {{government}} {{recently sold}} spectrum rights using an innovative auction design, the simultaneous ascending auction, invented by economic theorists. The auction outcomes were broadly {{consistent with the}} expectations of the theorists. The auction form should have many other applications. March 21, 1998 Just as the Nobel committee was recognizing game theory's role in economics by awarding the 1994 prize to John Nash, John Harsanyi, and Reinhard Selten, game theory was being put to its biggest use ever. Billions of dollars worth of spectrum licenses were being sold by the US government, using a novel auction form designed by economic theorists. Suddenly, game theory became news. William Safire in the New York Times called it "the greatest auction in history. " The Economist remarked, "When government auctioneers need worldly advice, where can they turn? To mathematical economists, of course... As for the firms that want {{to get their hands on}} a sliver of the airwaves, their best bet is to go out first and hire themselves a good game theorist. " Fortune said it was the "most dramatic example of game theory's new power... It was a triumph, not only for the FCC and the taxpayers, but also for game theory (and game theorists). " Forbes said, "Game theory, long an intellectual pastime, came into its own as a business tool. " The Wall Street Journal said, "Game theory is hot.

40|$|True {{autonomy}} is the Holy Grail of spacecraft mission operations. The goal {{of launching}} a satellite and letting it manage itself throughout its useful {{life is a}} worthy one. With true autonomy, the cost of mission operations would {{be reduced to a}} negligible amount. Under full autonomy, any problems (no matter the severity or type) that may arise with the spacecraft would be handled without any human intervention via some combination of smart sensors, on-board intelligence, and/or smart automated ground system. Until the day that complete autonomy is practical and affordable to deploy, incremental steps of deploying ever-increasing levels of automation (computerization of once manual tasks) on the ground and on the spacecraft are gradually decreasing the cost of mission operations. For example, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA-GSFC) has been flying spacecraft with low cost operations for several years. NASA-GSFC's SMEX (Small Explorer) and MIDEX (Middle Explorer) missions have effectively deployed significant amounts of automation to enable the missions to fly predominately in 'light-out' mode. Under light-out operations the ground system is run without human intervention. Various tools perform many of the tasks previously performed by the human operators. One of the major issues in reducing human staff in favor of automation is the perceived increased in risk of losing data, or even losing a spacecraft, because of anomalous conditions that may occur when there is no one in the control center. When things go wrong, missions deploying advanced automation need to be sure that anomalous conditions are detected and that key personal are notified in a timely manner so that on-call team members can react to those conditions. To ensure {{the health and safety of}} its lights-out missions, NASA-GSFC's Advanced Automation and Autonomy branch (Code 588) developed the Spacecraft Emergency Response System (SERS). The SERS is a Web-based collaborative environment that enables secure distributed fault and resource management. The SERS incorporates the use of intelligent agents, threaded discussions, workflow, database connectivity, and links to a variety of communications devices (e. g., <b>two-way</b> <b>paging,</b> PDA's, and Internet phones) via commercial gateways. When the SERS detects a problem, it notifies on-call team members, who then can remotely take any necessary actions to resolve the anomalies. The SERS goes well beyond a simple ' 911 ' system that sends out an error code to everyone with a pager. Instead, SERS' software agents send detailed data (i. e., notifications) to the most appropriate team members based on the type and severity of the anomaly and the skills of the on-call team members. The SERS also allows the team members to respond to the notifications from their wireless devices. This unique capability ensures rapid response since the team members no longer have to go to a PC or the control center for every anomalous event. Most importantly, the SERS enables safe experimentation with various techniques for increasing levels of automation, leading to robust autonomy. For the MIDEX missions at NASA GSFC, the SERS is used to provide 'human-in-the-loop' automation. During lights-out operations, as greater control is given to the MIDEX automated systems, the SERS can be configured to page remote personnel and keep them informed regarding actions taking place in the control center. Remote off-duty operators can even be given the option of enabling or inhibiting a specific automated response in near real time via their two-way pagers. The SERS facilitates insertion of new technology to increase automation, while maintaining the safety and security of mission resources. This paper will focus on SERS' overall functionality and how SERS has been designed to handle the monitoring and emergency response for missions with varying levels of automation. The paper will also convey some of the key lessons learned from SERS' deployment across of variety of missions, highlighting this incremental approach to achieving 'robust autonomy'...|$|E
