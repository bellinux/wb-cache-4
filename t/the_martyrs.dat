5|$|Every year on July 25, Puerto Rican Nationalists and {{independence}} activists gather atop Cerro Maravilla to honor Carlos Soto and Arnaldo Dario, {{as well as}} to defend and celebrate the Puerto Rican independence ideology. It is usually organized by the family of the victims, former members of nationalist groups, and by the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The mountain has also been christened by them as “El Cerro de los Mártires” (The Mountain of <b>the</b> <b>Martyrs).</b>|$|E
5|$|Located to {{the right}} of the cathedral's sacristy is the side chapel of Our Lord's Passion. Given by J.J. Braga, a parishioner from Portugal, it was rededicated to the Chinese Martyrs after the 1997–2002 renovation. The chapel was chosen out of the four to commemorate the then-newly canonised saints because it was the most thematically similar, in that <b>the</b> <b>martyrs</b> gave up their lives for the faith, emulating Jesus' {{sacrifice}} to save mankind. New stained glass windows were installed depicting the saints.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius {{notes that}} this event marked the {{beginning}} of a temporary respite from persecution. Although the precise dating of this respite is not specifically noted by Eusebius, the text of <b>the</b> <b>Martyrs</b> records no Palestinian martyrs between July 25, 308 and November 13, 309. The political climate probably impinged on persecutory policy here: This was the period of the conference of Carnuntum, which met in November 308. Maximinus probably spent the next few months in discussion with Galerius over his role in the imperial government, and did not have the time to deal with the Christians.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} England, Baker {{declined}} re-enlistment into the British Marines {{and returned to}} civilian life. Within six months he received an appointment from the Navy Board to act as civilian superintendent of convicts aboard the transport vessel Surprize, which departed for New South Wales in early 1794. A British loyalist, Baker took an immediate dislike to four of the convicts under his watch, sentenced for political offences and collectively known as Scottish Martyrs. Late in the voyage he advised Surprizes captain Patrick Campbell that <b>the</b> <b>Martyrs</b> planned to mutiny and seize the vessel. Acting on Baker's word, Campbell had {{three of the four}} confined until Surprize reached Sydney Cove.|$|E

5|$|The condor {{on top of}} {{the shield}} {{stretches}} his wings to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. The condor also represents the idea that it will always be ready to attack any enemy. The shield is flanked by four national flags. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic. The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of <b>the</b> <b>martyrs</b> of the fight for independence and liberty. The Fasces below the shield represents the republican dignity. The final design of the coat of arms was completed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|After 1555, {{the initial}} {{reconciling}} {{tone of the}} regime began to harden. The medieval heresy laws were restored. The Marian Persecutions of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. This resulted in the Queen becoming known as Bloody Mary, due {{to the influence of}} John Foxe, one of the Protestants who fled Marian England. Foxe's Book of Martyrs recorded the executions in such detail that it became Mary's epitaph; Convocation subsequently ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land. In fact, while those who were executed after the revolts of 1536, and the St David's Down rebellion of 1549, and the unknown number of monks who died for refusing to submit, may not have been tried for heresy, they certainly exceeded that number by some amount. Even so, the heroism of some of <b>the</b> <b>martyrs</b> was an example to those who witnessed them, so that in some places it was the burnings that set people against the regime.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} author to discuss Philip the Arab and Christianity is Eusebius, {{who served as}} bishop of Caesarea in Roman Palestine from ca. 314 to his death in 339. Eusebius' major work is the Historia Ecclesiastica, written in several editions dating from ca. 300 to 325. The Historia is not an attempt at a full history of the Church in the classical style, but rather a collection of facts addressing six topics in Christian history from the Apostolic times to the late 3rd century: (1) lists of bishops of major sees; (2) Christian teachers and their writings; (3) heresies; (4) the tribulations of the Jews; (5) the persecutions of Christians by pagan authorities; and (6) <b>the</b> <b>martyrs.</b> His Vita Constantini, written between Constantine's death in 337 and Eusebius' own death in 339, {{is a combination of}} eulogistic encomium and continuation of the Historia (the two separate documents were combined and distributed by Eusebius' successor in the see of Caesarea, Acacius).|$|E

50|$|Videos {{typically}} {{include the}} name of the insurgent group, a religious message or passage from the Qur’an, a sermon from a notable extremist figurehead or song, followed by the message content. Insurgents firing mortars, exploding IED’s, or other military actions are usually masked, whereas martyrdom videos must show the face of <b>the</b> <b>martyr.</b> Each martyr has different reasons and motivations for their particular attack which are represented in their personal message to family, community, and world. Often, if the attack is not a lone wolf operation, <b>the</b> <b>martyr</b> will appear with a notable extremist. The main objective of the video is to present the intentions of <b>the</b> <b>martyr.</b> <b>The</b> quality and depth of the video will depend on the resources and network of <b>the</b> <b>martyr.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following protests {{during the}} {{movement}} in which 105 people {{lost their lives in}} clashes with the police, Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 May 1960. Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat. Maharashtra State with Bombay as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them. As a memorial to <b>the</b> <b>martyrs</b> of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, Flora Fountain was renamed as Hutatma Chowk (Martyr's Square), and a memorial was erected. The following decades saw massive expansion of the city and its suburbs. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed. The Bombay Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) was established on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Bombay metropolitan region. In August 1979, a sister township of New Bombay was founded by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across the Thane and Raigad districts to help the dispersal and control of Bombay's population. The textile industry in Bombay largely disappeared after the widespread 1982 Great Bombay Textile Strike, in which nearly 250,000 workers in more than 50 textile mills went on strike. Mumbai's defunct cotton mills have since become the focus of intense redevelopment.|$|E
25|$|The first {{document}} {{mentioning the}} cult of <b>the</b> <b>martyrs</b> is a 1543 letter by Bishop Paweł Holszański. He described a monument – a column with a cross – that survived a major city fire that destroyed Vilnius Cathedral and Bishops' Palace in July 1530. He also attributed full recovery of severely ill Jan Andruszewicz, future Bishop of Kiev, to the intercession of <b>the</b> <b>martyrs.</b> Inspired by these events, in 1543, Holszański built a Gothic Chapel of the Holy Cross where <b>the</b> <b>martyrs</b> were allegedly buried. Two years later, Andruszewicz wrote a hymn to <b>the</b> <b>martyrs</b> which closely echoes information in the Bychowiec Chronicle. It was carved into a marble plaque and hung in the chapel. The hymn was also published in Annales Minorum by Luke Wadding. The chapel was restored in 1598 and eventually it grew into the Church of the Holy Cross.|$|E
