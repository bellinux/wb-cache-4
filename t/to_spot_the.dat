5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of shells and eliminated {{the problem of the}} ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Lion {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised the pointing and firing {{of the guns}} {{under the command of}} the director positioned on the foremast. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers controlled by the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy as it was easier <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells as each turret fired individually.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight {{made it possible for}} him <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position for an attack.|$|E

5|$|Navigator {{training}} was historically interwoven with culture and ritual. Great discretion {{had to be}} shown in candidate selection so that the knowledge preserved through oral tradition would have the greatest chance of survival. A master navigator's rank was equal or superior to a village chief's rank. Prudent navigation relies on no single technique but instead synthesizes position from multiple inputs. Underway, this constant synthesis makes it easy <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> navigator by being the one with red eyes from sleep deprivation.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of shells and eliminated {{the problem of the}} ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. An additional inch of armour was added {{to the top of the}} magazines and turret roofs after the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Princess Royal {{received}} a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire-control under the gunnery officer who now fired the guns. To align their {{guns on the}} target, the turret crewmen had to follow pointers whose position was transmitted from the director. This greatly increased accuracy as {{it was easier for}} the director <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of shells and eliminated the shell spread caused by the ship's roll as the turrets fired individually.|$|E

5|$|Providing {{cover for}} the Central Task Force, Furiouss {{aircraft}} neutralised the airfields at La Senia and Tafraoui, both near Oran, Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained {{for the rest of}} the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the Allied invasion of Sicily; Furiouss role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> British ships and make a report then shoot it down. She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{are caught}} by Eurasian sparrowhawks in the {{breeding}} range, and by Eleonora's falcons on migration. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take eggs and young, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. Domestic cats {{are the most}} important predator, possibly killing up to 10% of blackcaps. Blackcaps are occasionally hosts of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The level of parasitism is low because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected. Blackcaps have evolved adaptations which make it difficult for the parasitic species to succeed, despite the cuckoo's tendency to lay eggs which resemble those of their host. Blackcaps are good at spotting alien eggs, and their own eggs are very alike within a clutch, making it easier <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> intruder. There is, however, considerable variation between different clutches, making it harder for the cuckoo to convincingly mimic a blackcap egg. The open habitat and cup nest of the warbler make it a potential target for the cuckoo; it may have experienced much higher levels of parasitism in the past, and countermeasures would have spread rapidly once they evolved.|$|E
5|$|The first raids {{came as a}} {{surprise}} and were met by ineffective responses. On the first raid a Beaufighter from 604 Squadron shot down a single bomber, while the next three raids resulted in no kills, and the next a single kill again. But as the pattern of the attacks grew more obvious—short attacks against smaller coastal cities—the defense responded. Four bombers were shot down on the night of 3/4 May, two more on 7/8th, one on 18th, two on the 23rd. The Luftwaffe changed their tactics as well; their bombers would approach at low altitude, climb <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> target, and then dive again after releasing their bombs. This meant that interceptions with the Mk. IV were possible only during the bomb run.|$|E

5|$|The {{great white}} shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are {{approximately}} the same size {{which is similar to}} some mackerel sharks. A great white displays countershading, by having a white underside and a grey dorsal area (sometimes in a brown or blue shade) that gives an overall mottled appearance. The coloration makes it difficult for prey <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> shark because it breaks up the shark's outline when seen from the side. From above, the darker shade blends with the sea and from below it exposes a minimal silhouette against the sunlight. Great white sharks, like many other sharks, have rows of serrated teeth behind the main ones, ready to replace any that break off. When the shark bites, it shakes its head side-to-side, helping the teeth saw off large chunks of flesh.|$|E
5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come to a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E

25|$|Another {{solution}} was the Blue Streak missile project, although this was running into continued delays.

25|$|At daybreak on Tuesday, August 19, 1919, Captain Matlack {{once again}} crossed the border, this time leading Troops C and K, 8th Cavalry, {{in pursuit of}} Renteria and his gang.

25|$|The RPG {{still remains}} a potent threat to armored vehicles, {{especially}} in situations such as urban warfare or jungle warfare, {{where they are}} favored by guerrillas. They are most effective when used in restricted terrain as the availability of cover and concealment can {{make it difficult for}} the intended target <b>to</b> <b>spot</b> <b>the</b> RPG operator. Note that this concealment is often preferably outdoors, because firing an RPG within an enclosed area may create a dangerous backblast.|$|E
