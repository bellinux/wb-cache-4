40|$|Owing to the {{increased}} volume of laboratory services and the shortage of skilled medical microbiologists who presently spend up to 30 % {{of their time in}} clerical matters, pragmatic applications of electronic sorting techniques and computers should be considered to alleviate this problem. Moreover, surveillance of the hospital community, with particular reference to changing patterns of microbial resistance and the distribution of potentially infectious pathogens, requires detailed information which can be readily supplied by electronic sorting analysis. Mark-sense and prescored Port-A-Punch IBM cards were used to: (i) analyze antibiotic susceptibility data; (ii) tabulate <b>total</b> <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> according to conditions set down by the American Society for Clinical Pathologists; and (iii) to prepare a bacteriological report on the surveillance of hospital infections. After proper sorting and analysis, the cards also serve as a convenient reference file in the laboratory for pertinent information recorded by either blackening the appropriate areas (mark-sense style) or pushing out the preperforated rectangular holes with a simple inexpensive board and stylus (Port-A-Punch). No one scheme can fulfill the requirements of all laboratories or purposes, but ideas contained herein might serve as starting points for the design of similar systems in other laboratories...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a strain measurement technique suitable for elevated-temperature tensile and creep testing of foil-gage metals, using a modified commonly available mechanical extensometer {{in conjunction with}} a displacement transducer. The extensometer was modified by attaching to it a counterbalance (to reduce the effect of the extensometer weight on the <b>total</b> maximum <b>test</b> <b>load)</b> and by incorporating a conical tip/flat-edge design (to minimize induced stresses in the specimen resulting from extensometer attachment). Creep tests were performed on 0. 102 -mm-thick specimens of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at temperatures of 427 and 538 C, at nominal applied stresses of 310. 3 and 172. 4 MPa, respectively.

To limit {{the influence of}} environmental variables on the damage accumulation process, the low cycle trapezoidal fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> were chosen since the time duration of these tests is relatively short [18, 19]. The cyclic load levels for the trapezoidal fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>tests</b> were determined based on the short-term ramp <b>loading</b> <b>test</b> data.

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} panels {{have been}} used by the bridge construction industry in the state of Texas for many years to increase construction speed and improve safety and economy. At expansion joints, cast-in-place concrete is used and requires temporary formwork and slows construction. In a previous TxDOT project (0 - 4418), a fullscale bridge deck was constructed that included precast panels at a 0 o skew. The results indicated that the precast panel system provided adequate strength and reduced construction costs compared with the traditional cast-inplace details at the expansion joint. In this investigation (TxDOT Project 0 - 5367) two areas not covered in Project 0 - 4418 were studied: fatigue performance of bridge decks using precast panels at the expansion joints and the use of precast panels at skewed expansion joints. Fatigue response of precast panels under loading at the expansion joint in 0 o skew bridges was excellent. Skewed precast panels at expansion joints were tested under static and fatigue loads. Two skew angles were tested: 30 o and 45 o. Six specimens were constructed and subjected to a <b>total</b> of eleven <b>tests.</b> <b>Loads</b> were applied at midspan of the skewed end of each specimen, and some specimens were also loaded at joint between trapezoidal (skewed) panels and an adjacent rectangular panel.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare two methods of blade <b>test</b> <b>loading</b> and show how they are applied in an actual blade test. Strength and load-based methods were {{examined}} to determine the <b>test</b> <b>load</b> for an Atlantic Orient Corporation (AOC) 15 / 50 wind turbine blade for fatigue and static testing. Fatigue load-based analysis was performed using measured field <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> extrapolated for extreme rare events and scaled to thirty-year spectra. An accelerated constant amplitude fatigue test that gives equivalent damage at critical locations was developed using Miner`s Rule and the material S-N curves. Test load factors were applied to adjust the <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> for uncertainties, and differences between the test and operating environment. Similar analyses were carried, out for the strength-based fatigue test using the strength of the blade and the material properties to determine the load level and number of constant amplitude cycles to failure. Static tests were also developed using load and strength criteria. The resulting <b>test</b> <b>loads</b> were compared and contrasted.

40|$|Proof pile <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are an {{important}} means to cope with uncertainties {{in the design and}} construction of pile foundations. In this paper, a systematic method to incorporate the results of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> not conducted to failure into the design of pile foundations is developed. In addition, illustrative acceptance criteria for driven piles based on proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are proposed for use in a reliability-based design. Finally, modifications to conventional proof test procedures are studied so that the value derived from proof tests can be maximized. Whether or not a proof test is conducted to failure, its results can be used to update the probability distribution of the pile capacity using the method proposed in this paper. Hence, contributions of the proof test can be included in foundation design in a logical manner by considering several <b>load</b> <b>test</b> parameters such as the number of <b>tests,</b> the <b>test</b> <b>load,</b> the factor of safety, and test results. This adds value to proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and warrants improvements in the procedures for acceptance of pile foundations using proof <b>load</b> <b>tests.</b> A larger <b>test</b> <b>load</b> for proof <b>tests,</b> say 1. 5 times the predicted pile capacity, is recommended since it will yield more information about the capacity statistics and thus allow for more economical designs...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{rehabilitation}} {{is regularly}} undertaken to diagnose and repair a building during its service life; this practice ensures that buildings operate under {{safe and reliable}} conditions. Engineers generally rely on existing drawings, site investigation findings, and engineering judgement to assess the serviceability and ultimate capacity of a structure. Another approach to evaluating an existing structure is {{through the use of}} a structural <b>load</b> <b>test.</b> Under the authority of the American Concrete Institute (ACI), there are two structural <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> code provisions that exist: ACI 437. 2 - 13 and Chapter 27 of ACI 318 - 14. Although both provisions provide requirements and guidelines for <b>load</b> <b>testing,</b> there are distinct differences in the <b>test</b> <b>load</b> magnitudes, loading protocols, and acceptance criteria. The primary purpose of this research was to develop an understanding of reliability-based <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> safety concepts in the context of the current provisions of ACI 437. 2 - 13 and ACI 318 Chapter 27. Based on these findings, enhanced, diagnostic insight into the assessment of the outcomes of structural <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> was obtained.

A type {{of such a}} field test is a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the proof <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and to evaluate during the <b>test</b> that the <b>load</b> does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> a series of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands.
