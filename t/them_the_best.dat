25|$|Richmond {{had been}} made the capital since it was {{believed}} to be less exposed to attack than Williamsburg, but in January 1781, British forces under the renegade former American general, Benedict Arnold, sailed up the James River and captured Richmond with little opposition as Henry joined the other legislators and Governor Jefferson in fleeing to Charlottesville. Although Arnold soon withdrew to Portsmouth, in February, troops under Lord Cornwallis entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had for the most part been fought out of state, would have many of its final moves played in Virginia. With Washington's army near New York, Henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend the state, and in March helped draft an angry remonstrance from the House of Delegates to Congress, demanding help. Nevertheless, in May, British forces under Colonel Banastre Tarleton raided Charlottesville, nearly capturing the Virginia government, which fled to Staunton. There is a story that Henry fled with other prominent leaders, and sought refuge at the home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing Charlottesville.

The game's large number of acts in each level (five, compared to previous entries having two or three) and simple boss fights was also noted. Mean Machines Sega felt that enemies were almost missing entirely, opining that [...] "without them, this is just not half the game it could have been".

500|$|The {{producers}} did {{not endorse}} some fans' readings, {{according to a}} study on the subject: [...] "Not content to allow Shippers to perceive what they wish, Carter has consistently reassured NoRomos [...] that theirs is the preferred reading. This allows him the plausible deniability to credit the show's success to his original plan even though many watched in anticipation of a romance, thanks, in part, to his strategic polysemy. He can deny that these fans had reason to do so, however, since he has repeatedly stated that a romance was not and would never be." [...] The Scully-obsessed writer in Carter's 1999 episode [...] "Milagro" [...] was read by some as his alter ego, realizing that by this point [...] "she has fallen for Mulder despite his authorial intent". The writers sometimes paid tribute to the more visible fans by naming minor characters after <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> <b>best</b> example is Leyla Harrison.

Orlando praised the scenes between Megan and Curtis, calling them [...] "great" [...] and saying, [...] "Nothing makes you a part of the team like falling for a well-meaning office prank". On the Megan and Bud scenes she said that Megan was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] but called her attempts at consoling Bud [...] "clumsy", adding; [...] "Neither completely trusts the other but their growing professional respect has the potential to also become a personal friendship".

She hoped that Peter and Megan's relationship will be explored further and wanted to know [...] "just how these two became partners".
