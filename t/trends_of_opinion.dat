50|$|It is {{initially}} tempting to regard immediate, dynamic, and final interpretants as forming a temporal succession {{in an actual}} process of semiosis, especially since their conceptions refer to beginning, midstages, and end of a semiotic process. But instead their distinctions from each other are modal or categorial. The immediate interpretant is a quality of impression which a sign is fitted to produce, a special potentiality. The dynamic interpretant is an actuality. The final interpretant {{is a kind of}} norm or necessity unaffected by actual <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> or interpretation. One does not actually obtain a final interpretant per se; instead one may successfully coincide with it. Peirce, a fallibilist, holds that one has no guarantees that one has done so, but only compelling reasons, sometimes very compelling, to think so and, in practical matters, must sometimes act with complete confidence of having done so. (Peirce said that it is often better in practical matters to rely on instinct, sentiment, and tradition, than on theoretical inquiry.) In any case, insofar as truth is the final interpretant of a pursuit of truth, one believes, in effect, that one coincides with a final interpretant of some question about what is true, whenever and to whatever extent that one believes that one reaches a truth.|$|E
5000|$|Peirce {{said that}} a conception's meaning {{consists}} in [...] "all general modes of rational conduct" [...] implied by [...] "acceptance" [...] of the conception—that is, {{if one were to}} accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent of actual <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to [...] "vulgar" [...] pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification to test the truth of putative knowledge.|$|E

This article offers an issue-based perspective and explores <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> polarization in Germany. Public opinion polarization is conceptualized and measured as alignment of attitudes.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the construction and}} presentation of nationhood and national identity in the contemporaneous Chronica Maiora of Thomas Walsingham (covering 1376 - 1420, written c. 1381 - 1420). Taking as its premise the continued vitality and importance of late medieval English Latin-language texts {{in the construction of}} English nationhood, this thesis aims to partially redress the imbalance in modern scholarship of the period toward English-language texts and the resulting neglect of Latin-language works. This thesis argues for the existence of a vibrant and complex form of national identity and sentiment within Walsingham’s chronicle, informed by both contemporary <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and various scholarly and historiographical traditions. In this Walsingham can be located within a wide-ranging, clerical-monastic, Latinate discourse of late medieval Englishness which has been relatively neglected by modern scholarship. 	Specifically this thesis examines a number of key issues surrounding Walsingham’s construction of nationhood and English national identity. First the definitions of nationhood found in the Chronica are analysed, seeking to unpick Walsingham’s underlying beliefs and assumptions regarding what constituted a national community. Second Walsingham’s presentation and stereotyping of national groups is examined, in particular the setting-up of ‘Others’ and the significance of the idea of ancient Rome within Walsingham’s construction and glorification of England. Third the treatment of foreigners or ‘aliens’ in the Chronica is discussed, particularly the way in which Walsingham used such individuals as a vehicle with which to reflect upon and critique the English themselves. Throughout the thesis too the ambiguous but important place of the French within Walsingham’s vision of Englishness is examined in depth. In Walsingham’s text the French were not simply an enemy or a straightforward Other but were presented in rather integral but variable or even conflicted ways, reflective of the variable political and cultural position the French occupied for the English in this period. ...|$|E
40|$|Statement of the Problem. [...] This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine whether or not}} there is any relationship between knowledge of intergroup relations and certain mental traits. Definition of Terms. [...] In order to preclude ambiguity or misunderstanding, certain terms used in the study are defined in the paragraphs immediately below. The term 2 ̆ 2 intergroup relations 2 ̆ 2 as used in this study 2 ̆ 2 is defined as including race relations, interoreedal problems, immigrant cultures, rural urban contacts, and socioeconomic (or class) differences. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Stereotyping 2 ̆ 2 is used in a narrow sense to refer to 2 ̆ 2 tendencies toward positive or negative rating of personality traits as applied to members of certain groups as such. 2 ̆ 2 The term 2 ̆ 2 attitudes 2 ̆ 2 is used in accordance with the concept employed in the design o:f 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 An Opinionaire in Intergroup Relations 2 ̆ 2 in which they are referred to as ideas, viewpoints, opinions, and beliefs concerning a number of current issues in intergroup relations affecting four minority groups [...] Jews, Negroes, foreign born, and lower class people. 2 ̆ 2 Intelligence 2 ̆ 2 is used in the study as that which is measured by the 2 ̆ 2 New California Short-Form Test of 2 ̆ 7 Mental Maturity, Advanced 2 ̆ 747 S-Form, 2 ̆ 2 namely, 2 ̆ 2 the maturity of 2 ̆ 7 spatial relationships; of logical reasoning; of mathematical reasoning; and of useful concepts or vocabulary. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Personality adjustment 2 ̆ 2 is considered in the light of the implications of 2 ̆ 7 the factors measured by the 2 ̆ 2 California Test of 2 ̆ 7 Personality 2 ̆ 2; namely, a balance between self 2 ̆ 7 adjustment based on feelings of 2 ̆ 7 personal security and social adjustment based on feelings of social security. Purpose of the Study. [...] The purpose of 2 ̆ 7 this study was to answer the following questions: 1. What is the relationship, if any, between knowledge of 2 ̆ 7 intergroup relations and attitudes toward Jews, Negroes, foreign born, and lower class people, separately and combined 2. What is the relationship, if any, between knowledge of 2 ̆ 7 intergroup relations and similarity of attitudes toward Negroes and Jews? 3. What is the relationship, if 2 ̆ 7 any, between knowledge of 2 ̆ 7 intergroup relations and divergence of 2 ̆ 7 opinions concerning Negroes? 4. What is the relationship, if any, between knowledge of 2 ̆ 7 intergroup relations and the indication of definite <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> concerning Jews? 5. What is the relationship, if any, between knowledge of intergroup relations and definite opinions concerning foreign born? 6.

What is the relationship, if any, between knowledge of intergroup relations and intelligence? a. What is the relationship, if any, between knowledge of intergroup relations and religious values? 9. What is the relationship, if any, between knowledge and intergroup relations and personality adjustment? 10. What is the relationship, if any, between the. factors that are statistically significantly related to knowledge of intergroup relations? 11. What is the effect, if any, of partialed out factors on relationships existing between knowledge of intergroup relations and associated variables? 12. To what extent, if any is the variability of knowledge of intergroup relations affected by eliminating the influence of the variability of certain combinations of variables? 13. To what extent is the total degree of relationship between knowledge of intergroup relations and other variables increased by the addition of another variable? 14. What are the total and relative contributions of the independent variables to knowledge of intergroup relations? Collection of Data. [...] A consideration of the methods and tools of collecting data resulted in the selection of seven tests: (1) 2 ̆ 2 An Opinionaire in Intergroup Relations, 2 ̆ 2 (2) 2 ̆ 2 What People Are Like, 2 ̆ 2 (3) 2 ̆ 2 Experience With Negroes: Community Contacts, 2 ̆ 2 (4) 2 ̆ 2 A Test of Knowledge of Intergroup Relations, 2 ̆ 2 (5) 2 ̆ 2 A Study of Values, fl (6) 2 ̆ 2 New California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity, Advanced “ 47 S-Form,”(7) 2 ̆ 2 California Test of Personality – Adult Series. A copy of each of these tests will be found in the Appendix. The first four tests were designed for the College Study in Intergroup Relations. 2 ̆ 2 A Test of Knowledge of Intergroup Relations 2 ̆ 2 was chosen as the basic test. It consists of one hundred questions which relate to five major areas and five types of knowledge. The areas represented a. re race relations, intercreedal problems, immigrant cultures, rural-urban contacts, and socioeconomic (class) differences. The types of knowledge represented are concepts and definitions, present status, history and trends, current problems, and proposed solutions. This test is still in the experimental stage with the reliability and validity not fully established. However, 2 ̆ 2 they are estimated to be good 11 and the test is recommended as being 2 ̆ 2 basically sound. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 An Opinionaire 2 ̆ 7 in Intergroup Relations 2 ̆ 2 is a forty-item attitude scale which is made up of four subscales pertaining to reactions toward Jews, Negroes, foreign born, and lower class people. The reliability and validity of this test have been satisfactorily established 2 ̆ 2 for all mass-comparative uses. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 What People Are Liken was used to determine stereotypic tendencies as indicated by responses to fourteen questions concerning nine groups of people. These groups are: graduate students, Jews, Negroes, Catholics, Protestants, Mexicans, Polish, lower class, and rural dwellers. Like the basic test, this test is also in an experimental stage, but it is thought to be basically sound. 2 ̆ 2 “ Experiences With Negroes: Community Contacts 2 ̆ 2 is an experience inventory consisting of twenty-six items which relate to various contacts with Negroes in the community. The reliability and validity of this test have been satisfactorily established for college classes. The 2 ̆ 2 New California Short-Form Test of Mental Maturity and the 2 ̆ 2 California Test of 2 ̆ 7 Personality” are both recognized as reliable and valid in their particular fields.

It gives information about the age, sex, birthplace, religious preference, occupational goal, major field, and other facts which would a. id in understanding something of the background of the subjects. Each student was assigned a number to be used on the 2 ̆ 2 Personal Data Sheet 2 ̆ 2 and all the tests in lieu of their names. It was felt that this would eliminate some of the reticence which might accompany the answers to some of the questions. Sixty students were selected at random from a list of graduate students enrolled in the School of Education of Atlanta University. These students were contacted by mail and asked to be subjects for the study. Fifty-one responded and took all the tests required. Of this number thirty [...] two were in-service teachers taking part-time work in the university, one a secretary taking part-time work, and eighteen were full-time students. The group included thirty women and twenty-one men ranging in age from twenty-two to sixty-three. The mean age was 3. 53 and the median age 30. 88. The birthplaces of these subjects include eleven states in the United States, among which were Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida., Virginia, Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Texas, and Ohio, and one province in Canada - Ontario. The religious preferences of the group numbered forty-seven Protestants, three Catholics and one agnostic. Other information concerning the subjects is summarized in the Appendix. The tests were administered over a. period of one month. Two groups assemblies were held, the first on November 23 at which time three tests were given and the 2 ̆ 2 Personal Data Sheets 2 ̆ 2 filled out, the second on December 3 at which time the last four tests were administered. The tests had to be administered to some individually because of inability to meet with the group. In all cases the directions for taking the tests were read by the examiner and the directions as given in the manuals were followed.

40|$|A {{prevailing}} <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> {{in construction}} management research {{revolves around the}} importance of instilling a positive partnering culture {{in order to improve}} overall project performance.

Despite this trend, no systematic empirical work has so far been undertaken to objectively operationalize or test the real effects of culture. This study aims to fill this research gap. Grounded in the social identity framework, this study proposes an alternative approach for operationalizing and examining culture's effects using data derived from 398 local and foreign senior managers from construction firms in Hong Kong. Results suggest that the relationships between culture and individual behaviours are far more complex than alluded to by simple normative generalizations.

This paper describes a novel digitised splinting process using 3 D printing in an attempt to overcome these issues. The output of the investigation was the creation of a specialised computer-aided design software workflow to support 3 D printing, developed specifically for splinting practitioners in the UK, to enable them to design splints themselves for each individual patient. Method: A small-scale feasibility study was done, based on the current splinting process. A thorough literature review and physical engagement in current splinting practice was performed, highlighting key requirements for successful splint fabrication. Key requirements were then replicated in a virtual software environment. Opportunities for integrating new, novel features were explored. The key requirements were then refined into a specialised software workflow to replicate the splinting process. The specialised software was then evaluated by 10 practitioners. User trials of the software were performed, followed by semi-structured interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed and then coded to establish similar <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinions,</b> and areas for future research. No patients or vulnerable participants were involved in the study. Results: All participants were able to use and navigate around the software prototype with relative ease. Strengths included potential simplicity in modelling more complex splints, but several areas for future research are identified, including cost analysis and materials development. Discussion: The digitised splinting process shows promise for the benefit of both practitioners and their patients, provided that future research and investment can overcome current limitations...|$|R

Affiliated to the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC), the POPC was established in 2003, as the first poll center in Egypt responsible for studying <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> Egyptian public <b>opinion</b> towards different internal social, political and economic affairs. Such trends are forwarded to decision makers to use them in the preparation of different plans and policies. The POPC also measures public opinion preferences in order to understand priority issues {{and put them on the}} priority list of decision makers.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the motivation behind the historical shift from private to public systems of justice, Athens {{is presented as}} a fruitful case study. This paper contrasts a <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> historical <b>opinion</b> that presents the drive to centralize the functions of justice as prompted and performed for public interests. We support a current hypothesis that the centralization of prisons in classical Athens was a causal mechanism to forcing the broader transition of justice. After state sponsored prisons, the incentive structures in the production of justice radically changed. Customary institutions, before state prisons, had developed competitive restraints to control abuses of power. With state prisons, Athenian rulers faced lower relative costs of expanding state size. The traditional evolved norms were displaced by new constructed policies. The new incentive environment promoted justice towards full state involvement. Each policy can be recognized as a strategic response to promote particular political interests. Dissecting the broad transition of justice into a series of individually motivated policy actions in no way suggests a guiding motivation in line with the public welfare...|$|R

Online forums, news reports and blogs, are containing large volume <b>of</b> public <b>opinion</b> information. Rapid growth of network arouses much attention on public opinion, it is important to analyse the public opinion in time and understands the <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> their <b>opinion</b> correctly. Approach: The sentiment analysis and text mining are important key elements for forecasting the hotspots in online forums. Most of the traditional text mining work on static data sets, while the online hotspot forecasts works on the web information dynamically and timely. The earlier work on text information processing focuses in the factual domain rather than opinion domain. Due to the semi structured or unstructured characteristics <b>of</b> online public <b>opinion,</b> we introduce traditional Vector Space Model (VSM) to express them and then use K-means to perform hotspot detection, then we use J 48 classifier to perform hotspot forecast. Results: The experimentation is conducted by Rapid Miner tool and performance of proposed method J 48 is compared with other method, such as Naive Bayes. The consistency between K-means and J 48 is validated using three metrics. They are accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: The experiment helps to identify that K-means and J 48 together to predict forums hotspot. The results that have been obtained using J 48 present a noticeable consistency with the results achieved by K-means clustering...|$|R
40|$|Audit {{report is}} the primary means of {{communication}} for auditors. To reduce the phenomenon of agency conflict, auditors work as agents for shareholders and report to them after reviewing the financial statements. In last 15 years, Australia has witnessed some major changes in Australian economy which have affected Australian business and its auditors’ opinions. This paper examines the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> audit <b>opinions</b> issued to Australian listed companies during this period. In total, 20, 473 audit opinions were sited over the 15 -year period, i. e., from 1996 to 2010. This research found that over the period, unqualified report {{was the most common}} type of audit reports issued in Australia with an average of 96. 4 %. The average rate at which the Big 4 audit firms issue unqualified reports is 88 % compared with 76 % issued by the non-Big 4 firms. It is also evidenced that the rate at which modified reports were issued during and after global financial crisis (GFC) (2007 - 2009) has increased across all industries, while the most noticeable increase occurred in the financial services, materials, and industrial sectors...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 2 ̆ 7 s speech 2 ̆ 2 A World Split Apart 2 ̆ 2 : The Harvard Address was Western decline, and his criticisms of Western values and {{institutions}} provoked an intellectual backlash against him. Solzhenitsyn was, in consequence, ultimately {{dismissed as a}} viable thinker in the West. This thesis takes as its first aim the critical examination of both the early and later responses to the Harvard Address to determine the patterns and <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> American <b>opinions</b> and evaluations <b>of</b> Solzhenitsyn and his thought at that time. Second, this thesis argues that generally the efforts of Solzhenitsyn 2 ̆ 7 s American critics to understand and contextualise him and the Harvard Address were unsatisfactory, {{as they approached the}} problem of Solzhenitsyn from a Western perspective and therefore inappropriately based their evaluations of him on current Western political and social ideals. Finally, this thesis is intended to contribute to the ongoing <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> recontextualising Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the 1990 s by asserting that Solzhenitsyn is first and foremost a Christian, and that his personal Christianity forms an essential component of his thought.

On April 23, just {{a little over two}} weeks before the election, the SWS released a poll, and the headline of the SWS report by itself was historically significant: [...] "SWS April 10-17, 2004 Survey: Roco Depleted, Voters Go To GMA and Undecided". The report's first line gives away the game: [...] "Raul Roco's sudden departure for abroad cost him almost half of his voting strength, allowing Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to gain a slim lead ..."

40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the parameters of}} European political consciousness, i. e. European research field of political consciousness in qualitative and quantitative terms, which may be based on different indicators. The issue of emergence and development of European political consciousness becomes topical because firstly, its formation as the subjective dimension of European integration policy is not a spontaneous process and, secondly, European integration is carried out {{not only from the}} top but from the bottom, requiring deliberate interference of the public with the process; the public possesses the formed European political consciousness. Since the latter is a specific mental construct, the author offers to apply the triad «criteria ­ parameters – indicators». The characteristic that makes it possible to evaluate certain processes or phenomena in the system of Europeanness / Europeanism and specifies the quality system <b>of</b> views and <b>opinions,</b> which are realized in European behavior, is considered to be the criterion of European political consciousness. The European political consciousness parameters are seen to include the relevant historical memory, <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> public <b>opinion</b> and awareness regarding the European Union and position of its members in the European integration process, including the assessment of the existence and development of the EU; knowledge and views on the main EU institutions, assessing the importance of the main institutions of the EU and trust in them; a positive vision {{for the future of the}} European Union etc. The author considers the performance and objective characteristics and dimensions, including positive correlation of national and European levels of identity (European identity) and European behavior to be the indicatiors of European political awareness. On the basis of these indicators the control of the condition and <b>trends</b> <b>of</b> European political consciousness development will be carried out...|$|R

It examines to what extent, and in what contexts, judges utilize social science in reaching and bolstering their rulings. The Article delves into three areas of law that are typically not grouped together—integration, gay rights, and capital punishment—to see {{the similarities and differences}} in the use of empirical findings. Analyzing the language in judicial opinions from family courts, district courts, circuit courts, and the United States Supreme Court enabled the emergence <b>of</b> <b>trends.</b> The <b>opinions</b> revealed that inconsistency in the use of social science may stem from how a given issue is framed, the tide <b>of</b> public <b>opinion</b> on an issue, and whether social science in that realm is settled. Application of these principles to the gay rights context suggests that if the Supreme Court were to hear a case on gay marriage, a national consensus on the issue would be more outcome determinative than settled social science...|$|R
