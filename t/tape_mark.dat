50|$|In the ANSI X3.27-1969 {{magnetic}} tape standard, {{the end of}} file was indicated by a <b>tape</b> <b>mark,</b> which consisted of a gap of approximately 3.5 inches of tape followed by a single byte containing the character 13 (hex) for nine-track tapes and 17 (octal) for seven-track tapes. The end-of-tape, commonly abbreviated as EOT, was indicated by two tape marks. This was the standard used, for example, on IBM 360. The reflective strip {{that was used to}} announce impending physical end of tape was also called an EOT marker.|$|E
50|$|Tape {{has quite}} a long latency for random accesses since the deck must wind an average of one-third the tape length {{to move from one}} {{arbitrary}} data block to another. Most tape systems attempt to alleviate the intrinsic long latency, either using indexing, where a separate lookup table (tape directory) is maintained which gives the physical tape location for a given data block number (a must for serpentine drives), or by marking blocks with a <b>tape</b> <b>mark</b> that can be detected while winding the tape at high speed.|$|E
50|$|Early {{half-inch}} tape {{had seven}} parallel tracks of data {{along the length}} of the tape allowing, six-bit characters plus one bit of parity written across the tape. This was known as seven-track tape. With the introduction of the IBM System 360 mainframe, nine-track tapes were introduced to support the new 8-bit characters that it used. Effective recording density increased over time. Common seven-track densities started at 200, then 556, and finally 800 cpi and nine-track tapes had densities of 800 (using NRZI), 1600 (using PE), and 6250 cpi (using GCR). This translates into about 5 MB to 140 MB per standard length (2400ft) reel of tape. End of file was designated by a <b>tape</b> <b>mark</b> and end of tape by two tape marks. The physical beginning and end of usable tape was indicated by reflective adhesive strips of aluminum foil.|$|E

You can't teach a child social skills. They have to learn them themselves." [...] Mr. Cotswald, affected by his son's speech, agrees to let Rebecca and Mark regularly attend public school; Rebecca and Kyle then share a kiss.

5000|$|Shortly {{after moving}} into McMoon's, {{a group of}} {{students}} from the NASA Astrobiology Academy was recruited to remove all the tapes from the boxes, and put the tapes in order. Each tape takes about an hour to run on the tape drive, and holds one high-resolution image and one medium-resolution image. When archived in the early 1970s, each reel of tape was labeled, wrapped in a clear plastic bag, and enclosed in a mu-metal tin, and sealed with yellow plastic tape. Additional labels have been placed {{on the outside of the}} tape container. Each tape is labeled with a code that usually consists of two letters and two numbers, for example: MT_19, WT_45, and GT_46. One of the Astrobiology Academy students realized that the first letter indicated which ground station recorded the data on the tape in that container: [...] "M" [...] indicates that the tape was recorded in Madrid, Spain; [...] "W" [...] indicates that the tape was recorded in Woomera, Australia; and [...] "G" [...] indicates that the tape was recorded in Goldstone, California. This guess was confirmed when the team listened to the audio track at the beginning of a few of the tapes, wherein the operator of the ground station recites information about the tape and the recording. On <b>tapes</b> <b>marked</b> with an [...] "M", the operator has a distinctly Spanish accent. On <b>tapes</b> <b>marked</b> with a [...] "W", the operator has a distinctly Australian accent. On <b>tapes</b> <b>marked</b> with a [...] "G" [...] the operator speaks with an American accent. Sometimes audio track captures an operator at one tracking station talking to an operator at another tracking station. Each tape's opening audio includes the date that the tape was recorded in both local and Universal Time.|$|R
