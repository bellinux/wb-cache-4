Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) from the Almadraba areas of the Gulf of Cádiz, prawns from Sanlúcar de Barrameda (known as langostino de Sanlúcar), and deepwater rose shrimp (...) from Huelva are all highly prized. Fishing for the <b>transparent</b> <b>goby</b> or chanquete (Aphia minuta), a once-popular small fish from Málaga, is now banned because the techniques used to catch them trap too many immature fish of other species.|$|E
50|$|Aphia minuta, the <b>transparent</b> <b>goby,</b> is {{a species}} of the goby native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean {{where it can be}} found from Trondheim, Norway to Morocco. It is also found in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. It is a pelagic species, inhabiting inshore waters and estuaries. It can be found at depths of from the surface to 97 m, though it is usually found at 5 to 80 m, over sandy and muddy bottoms and also in {{eelgrass}} beds. This species can reach a length of 7.9 cm TL. It is an important species to local commercial fisheries. It is currently the only known member of its genus.|$|E
40|$|Around 45 % 01 the lishing Ileet {{based on}} the island 01 Majorca (northwestern Mediterranean) engages in three {{seasonal}} lisheries directed at the <b>transparent</b> <b>goby,</b> Aphia minuta (Irom December to March), lobster, Palinurus elephas (Irom March to August), and dolphinlish, Coryphaena hippurus (Irom August to December). In 1991 - 92, the boats engaging in the lobster lishery amounted to 32 % 01 the total number 01 boats and were based around the entire island; 13 % 01 the total number 01 boats engaged in the <b>transparent</b> <b>goby</b> lishery and were based mainly in the vicinity 01 the bays; and 12 % 01 the total number 01 boats engaged in the lishery lor dolphinlish and pilotfish (Naucrates ductor), the main by-catch species in that lishery. The number 01 units allocated to each 01 these lisheries remained relatively constant over the period 1982 - 1992, although the number 01 units operating in the lobster lishery exhibited a certain tendency to increase. The gears used are boat seines in the <b>transparent</b> <b>goby</b> lishery, trammel nets in the lobster lishery, and purse seines in the dolphinlish lishery.

40|$|A {{management}} {{plan for the}} boat seines, called sonsera, used in Catalonia to target sand eels (Gymanammodytes cicerelus and G. semisquamatus) and <b>transparent</b> <b>gobies</b> was drawn up in accordance with European Union rules. A Sand Eel Co-Management Committee was formally created with the specific mission of ensuring a sustainable fishery. The Committee is composed of public administrations, fishermen’s associations, researchers and NGOs. The process has two phases: first, a comprehensive study of the fishery and subsequent advice {{for the establishment of}} a {{management plan}} and, second, the implementation and monitoring of the management plan. The study of the fishery included the analysis of the ecosystem impacts of the fishery (mainly stock status, impact on sensitive habitats and by-catch) and was carried out in the wider context of an adaptive co-management process to respond to the requirements of an ecosystem approach to fisheries...|$|R

40|$|The feeding {{ecology of}} the <b>transparent</b> <b>goby</b> Aphia minuta was {{examined}} in spring (May 2003) in the coastal waters off Comacchio, in the northwestern Adriatic Sea. Stomach content analysis indicated A. minuta to be a planktivorous species, feeding exclusively on pelagic invertebrates. The diet composition was dominated by the calanoid copepods Acartia clausi and Temora longicornis, followed in decreasing order of importance by other copepods (especially calanoids and Oncaea spp.) and larvae of decapods, polychaetes and bivalves. A. minuta exhibited a generalistic feeding strategy with a relatively broad niche width. Abundant taxa in the environment, such as A. clausi and T. longicornis, were seldom selected, whereas rare taxa, such as larvae of polychaetes and decapods, were highly selected. According to the observed ontogenetic shift in diet, small-size individuals relied preferentially on juvenile T. longicornis and Oncaea spp., whereas large-sized specimens consumed preferably A. clausi and calanoids. The positive relationship found between prey and fish size may help to mitigate the intraspecific competition for food resources...|$|E

40|$|The <b>transparent</b> <b>goby</b> Aphia minuta (Risso, 1810) {{is one of}} {{the main}} target species of the {{small-scale}} fishery of the island Majorca. Otolith microstructure and length-frequency analysis were used to study the age and growth of this species during the 1982 / 1983 and 1992 / 1993 fishing seasons. Daily periodicity of increment formation was determined by experiments with marked otoliths in individuals maintained in captivity. The length range of the catches during the 11 yr period was between 12 and 49 mm, with a main distribution (89 %) between 24 and 40 mm. Otolith age-readings indicate that the population exploited in the commercial fishery consists of seven age-groups (2 to 8 mo old), with a very high proportion of individuals (95 %) between 3 and 6 mo old. Population growth-curves revealed no differences between males and females. The growth parameters for the whole population are: asymptotic length, L(x) 53. 69 mm; growth coefficient, K - 2. 23 yr- 1; theoretical age at length zero, t 0 = - 0. 005 yr. Those individuals of A. minuta caught in Majorca during the winter period reached a maximum age of 7 or 8 mo. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Publicación online disponible en: [URL] {{aspects of}} the <b>transparent</b> <b>goby</b> Aphia minuta (n= 2977, 14 - 45 mm total length (TL)) were studied in Majorcan waters, western Mediterranean, during the fishing season (December to April) from 1985 to 1993. Male:female sex ratio was 1 : 1. Size at first {{maturity}} was 38 mm TL for females and 34 mm TL for males. Oocyte size-frequency distribution indicated that A. minuta is a single spawner. Fecundity of A. minuta ranged from 935 to 2648 oocytes. The breeding season extended from December to April with a peak in March. After a single reproduction at 5 - 6 months of age, most of the specimens disappeared from the fishing areas. Recruitment to the fishing area occurred in late December and early January (14 - 24 mm TL, age 2 - 3 months). On the other hand, the hatch date back-calculated from the age in days and the date of capture of individuals of A. minuta during the fishing season, indicated a spawning peak in autumn (September-October), {{six months after the}} peak of observed spawning. Schools of A. minuta were detected by acoustic methods, during the fishing season (winter-spring) in fishing areas (5 - 40 m depth), principally inside bays, and {{during the rest of the}} year (summer and autumn) in deeper areas (40 - 90 m), outside bays, with water temperatures between 13 and 16 ºC and a high seasonal productivity in each depth range. Therefore, we propose that A. minuta has two annual cohorts in the western Mediterranean, corresponding to two main spawning in spring and autumn, respectively. Life history pattern indicated that we only know the winter cohort resulting from the autumn spawning. Meanwhile the summer cohort (spring spawning) grows and reproduces in deeper areas not being targeted by the fishery. Indirect validation is provided from information from other areas.

Among Actinopterygii (mean tm ± SD = 2. 20 ± 1. 43 y, n = 215), tm ranged from 0. 3 y, for the common goby Pomatoschistus microps, to 12 y, for dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, while among Elasmobranchii (mean tm ± SD = 5. 94 ± 2. 47 y, n = 20), tm ranged between 2. 7 y, for brown ray Raja miraletus, and 12 y for picked dogfish Squalus acanthias. Overall, the tmax ranged between 1 y, for <b>transparent</b> <b>goby</b> Aphia minuta, and 70 y, for wreckfish Polyprion americanus. The mean tmax of Actinopterygii (tmax ± SD = 10. 14 ± 9. 42 y) was {{lower than that of}} Elasmobranchii (tmax ± SD = 14. 05 ± 8. 47 y). The tm exhibited a strong positive linear relation with tmax for both Actinopterygii (logtm = 0. 58 ´ logtmax – 0. 25, r 2 = 0. 51, P < 0. 001) and Elasmobranchii (logtm = 0. 67 ´ logtmax – 0. 006, r 2 = 0. 51, P = 0. 007). The mean tm/tmax did not differ significantly with sex within Actinopterygii (ANOVA: F = 0. 27, P = 0. 60, n = 90; females: mean ± SD = 0. 276 ± 0. 143; males: mean ± SD = 0. 265 ± 0. 138) and Elasmobranchii (ANOVA: F = 1. 44, P = 0. 25, n = 10; females: mean ± SD = 0. 499 ± 0. 166; males: mean ± SD = 0. 418 ± 0. 133).
