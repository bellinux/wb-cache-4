Concerned about the stability of the ice at Four Seasons, the city also commissioned a study of both rinks. The study concluded that both rinks needed $1.5 million in repairs and upgrades. But this study was not acted on. [...] The city's management of the facility had also not gone smoothly. Nearly 20 groups which used the facility frequently (hockey teams, exhibitors, rodeo promoters, etc.), but relations between the groups were very poor and various groups accused city managers of playing politics in order to favor one group over another. In June 2001, city managers held an extraordinary day-long meeting of the arena's users in an attempt mediate these differences. This meeting led to a major proposal to upgrade the arena. In August 2001, the various user groups proposed that the city spend $99,000 to purchase a new floor covering for the main ice rink that would reduce <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> for transformation of the main arena to just four hours.

Instead, city managers said the most urgent needs at Four Seasons involved wooded dashers (waist-high walls) around the rink, a new cover for the ice (to keep it cold when not in use), portable bleachers to expand seating, upgrading and replacement of power lines and poles, a new scoreboard, and improvements to make the facility comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the tradeoff between finished-goods inventory and advance demand information for {{a model of}} a single-stage make-to-stock supplier who uses an order-base-stock replenishment policy to meet customer orders that arrive a fixed demand lead-time in advance of their due-dates. We show that if the replenishment orders arrive in the order that they are placed, then the tradeoff between the optimal order-base-stock level and <b>the</b> demand <b>lead-time</b> is "exhaustive", {{in the sense that the}} optimal order-base-stock level drops all the way to zero if <b>the</b> demand <b>lead-time</b> is sufficiently long. We then provide a sufficient condition under which this tradeoff is linear. We verify that this condition is satisfied for the case where the supply process is modeled as an M/M/ 1 queue.

40|$|In today’s {{competitive}} business environment, quick {{service with}} minimal waiting time {{is an important}} factor for customers when choosing a service. Many service organizations guarantee a uniform lead-time to all customers in order to gain competitive advantages in the market.

We present a mathematical model and a solution method for determining <b>the</b> optimal quoted <b>lead-time</b> and capacity level for a profit-maximizing firm with time-varying and <b>lead-time</b> sensitive demand. <b>The</b> firm incurs convex capacity costs and pays lateness penalties whenever <b>the</b> actual <b>lead-time</b> exceeds <b>the</b> quoted <b>lead-time.</b> A few studies have been conducted on the relationship between uniform lead-time, capacity, demand, and overall profitability.

40|$|Order {{crossover}} ” occurs whenever replenishment orders do {{not arrive}} in the se-quence {{in which they were}} placed. When order crossover is possible, Robinson et al. (2001) showed that its effect can be correctly taken into account by setting inventory levels using the inventory shortfall rather than <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> demand. For convenience, a heuristic base-stock level can be found by assuming that the shortfall is Normally distributed. This calculation, however, depends on the variance of the number of orders outstanding, which is cumbersome to compute and requires more information than may be available in practice. This paper makes the Normal approximation to the shortfall distribution tractable by computing bounds on the variance of the number of orders outstanding. Specifically, we show that the variance of the number of orders outstand-ing is bounded above by the minimum of <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> mean, <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> variance, and the standard deviation of the lead time divided by 3. This easily-computed upper bound can be used in Normal approximations of the shortfall distribution to take order crossover into account, and so will improve significantly upon policies set according to <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> demand distribution. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of the efforts aimed at {{reducing}} <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> variability in a quality-adjusted stochastic inventory model. We assume that each lot contains a random number of defective units. More specifically, a logarithmic investment function is used that allows investment to be made to reduce lead-time variability. Explicit results for the optimal values of decision variables as well as optimal value of the variance of lead-time are obtained. A series of numerical exercises is presented to demonstrate the use of the models developed in this paper. Initially <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> variance reduction model (LTVR) is compared to the quality-adjusted model (QA) for different values of initial lead-time over uniformly distributed lead-time intervals from one to seven weeks. In all cases where investment is warranted, investment in lead-time reduction results in reduced lot sizes, variances, and total inventory costs. Further, both the reduction in lot-size and lead-time variance increase as <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> interval increases. Similar results are obtained when lead-time follows a truncated normal distribution. The impact of proportion of defective items was also examined for the uniform case resulting in the finding that the total inventory related costs of investing in lead-time variance reduction decrease significantly as the proportion defective decreases. Finally, the results of sensitivity analysis relating to proportion defective, interest rate, and setup cost show <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> variance reduction model to be quite robust and representative of practice...|$|E

Relative survival ratios (RSRs) can be useful for evaluating the impact of changes in cancer care on the prognosis of cancer patients or for comparing the prognosis for different subgroups of patients, but their use is problematic for cancer sites where screening has been introduced due to the potential of lead-time bias. Lead-time is survival time that is added to a patient’s survival time because of an earlier diagnosis irrespective of a possibly postponed time of death. In the presence of screening it is difficult to disentangle how much of an observed improvement in survival is real and how much is due to lead-time bias. Even so, RSRs are often presented for breast cancer, a site where screening has led to early diagnosis, with the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> bias is small. We describe a simulation-based framework for studying <b>the</b> <b>lead-time</b> bias due to mammography screening on RSRs of breast cancer based on a natural history model developed in a Swedish setting.
