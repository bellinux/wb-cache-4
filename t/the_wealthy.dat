Interurban rail lines, and increasingly automobiles, meant that <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> {{no longer had to}} live so close to their businesses, and many chose to live in what had previously been summer homes in the county's east end. The lifestyle that created Old Louisville was effectively obsolete.|$|E
