5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less <b>than</b> <b>perfect</b> at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E

There are several annals used by H.J. de Graaf in his histories such as Babad Sangkala and Babad Momana which contain list of events and dates in Javanese calendar (A.J., Anno Javanicus), but besides de Graaf’s questionable practice of simply adding 78 to Javanese years to obtain corresponding Christian years, the agreement between Javanese sources themselves is less <b>than</b> <b>perfect.</b>|$|E
25|$|Race in {{medicine}} {{is used as}} an approximation for more specific genetic and environmental risk factors. Race is thus partly a surrogate for environmental factors such as differences in socioeconomic status that are known to affect health. It is also an imperfect surrogate for ancestral geographic regions and differences in gene frequencies between different ancestral populations and thus differences in genes that can affect health. This can give an approximation of probability for disease or for preferred treatment, although the approximation is less <b>than</b> <b>perfect.</b>|$|E
25|$|An entirely {{different}} form of perfectionism has arisen {{in response to}} rapid technological change.

Skeptics assert that rather <b>than</b> <b>perfect</b> goodness, it would be only the appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by persuasion technology and probably brute force of violent technological escalation, which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them.|$|E

However, the screening test itself is less <b>than</b> <b>perfect.</b> While the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone level is easy to measure and sensitive (rarely missing real cases), the test has a poorer specificity.

This is a higher rate of false positives than the screening tests for many other congenital metabolic diseases.|$|E
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but {{the downside is that}} the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%, with the result that round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less <b>than</b> <b>perfect.</b>|$|E

He was just 2–7 after 9 bouts where he competed with only the titled ranks of san'yaku wrestlers. His last six matches were against wrestlers from the maegashira ranks and there Baruto managed to hold his ground. He was promoted to sekiwake rank for the Kyushu Basho in November, as the west sekiwake Toyonoshima could not hold his position after a 6–9 finish in the Aki Basho, thus leaving an opening for the position. He came through with a winning record in his sekiwake debut.|$|E

25|$|The Riesling grape, {{grown on}} 59.7% of the region's {{cultivated}} vineyard surface in 2008, {{is widely considered}} the most prestigious and highest quality wine grape of the Mosel but it cannot be planted on every vineyard site due to difficulties the grape has in ripening in particularly cool climates. Factors such as altitude, aspect and sunlight exposure can have a pronounced effect not only one the resulting quality of the wine but also whether the Riesling grape will even ripen at all. A positive characteristic of the Riesling grape is that despite less <b>than</b> <b>perfect</b> ripeness it can still create a wine of finesse and elegance that would escape most other grape varieties.|$|E
25|$|Taste {{opens with}} Lady Pentweazel who {{believes}} that the works of art, the Venus de' Medici and the Mary de Medici, are sisters in the Medici family. Two other collectors, Novice and Lord Dupe, claim {{to be able to}} determine the age and value of coins and medals by tasting them while Puff, an auctioneer, convinces them and Sir Positive Bubble that broken china and statuary are worth far more <b>than</b> <b>perfect</b> pieces. Lord Dupe follows this advice by purchasing a canvas with the paint scraped off. The foibles of ignorant art collectors and predatory dealers were presented by Foote in this high burlesque comedy. In order for an audience to appreciate high burlesque, they must understand the standards of true taste before they can recognize the conflict between those standards and the characters. The audience that saw the premier of Taste evidently did not understand this conflict as the play was not successful and only played five performances.|$|E
25|$|Greek pottery also {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the daily life of prostitutes. Their representation can generally be grouped into four categories: banquet scenes, sexual activities, toilet scenes and scenes depicting maltreatment. In the toilet scenes the prostitute frequently has a less <b>than</b> <b>perfect</b> body; sagging breasts, rolls of flesh, etc. There is a kylix showing a prostitute urinating into a chamber pot. In the representation of sexual acts, {{the presence of a}} prostitute is often indicated by a purse, which underscores the financial nature of the relationship. The position most frequently shown is the leapfrog—or sodomy; these two positions being difficult to visually distinguish. The woman is frequently folded in two with her hands flat on the ground. Sodomy was considered degrading for an adult and it seems that the leapfrog position (as opposed to the missionary position) was considered less gratifying for the woman. Finally, a number of vases represent scenes of abuse, where the prostitute is threatened with a stick or sandal, and forced to perform acts considered by the Greeks to be degrading: fellatio, sodomy or sex with two partners.|$|E

500|$|The first {{generation}} of Zenbooks was announced on October11,2011, one day before release, although they were first demonstrated at Computex 2011 in May that year. Two models were released in 2011 to positive reviews: the 11inch UX21E and the 13inch UX31E, also frequently known as the UX21 and UX31 respectively. The design of the UX21 drew comparisons to the Macbook Air and it was regarded as an [...] "excellent rival" [...] by CNET reviewer Andrew Hoyle. Other aspects of the laptops that reviewers liked were the Bang and Olufsen speakers, fast boot times due to Asus' BIOS design and the speed of general tasks within the operating system resulting from the SSD and Sandy Bridge processors. However, the screens drew criticism for their poor contrast ratio, colour accuracy and less <b>than</b> <b>perfect</b> viewing angle, although they were praised for their brightness and the sharpness of the UX31's screen. Reviewers also noted the shallow key-press of the metal keyboard and lack of backlighting, a feature that Asus {{did not have time}} to implement before shipping.|$|E

A Blu-ray edition followed in May. This home release received mixed reviews. Franck Tabouring of DVD Verdict was highly complimentary toward the film and the digital transfer, considering its visuals clean and sharp and the audio (particularly the music) [...] "a pleasure to listen to". Thomas Spurlin, writing for DVD Talk, rated the release as [...] "Highly Recommended", focusing on the [...] "unexpected powerhouse" [...] of the film's quality. Another writer for the website, Jeremy Mathews, advised readers to [...] "Skip It", finding the DVD an apt presentation of the source material—which he considered to [...] "reduce itself to clumsy, mug-filled attempts at broad comedy and awkward, repetitive tear-jerker scenes". [...] Both DVD Talk reviews agreed that the audio and visual quality were less <b>than</b> <b>perfect,</b> and that the DVD's extra contents were poor; Mathews described the interview as the director answering [...] "dull questions in a dull manner".|$|E

He left the Waters in 1932 to attend the Naval Postgraduate School, which was then located at Annapolis. In 1934, he was offered an opportunity to complete his studies in Paris, although he had not studied French at the Academy. He enrolled in French at the University of Nancy in July. Immersing in the language, Mumma and his family spoke French only. He studied marine engineering at the L'École Nationale Supérieure de Maritime in Paris. Instead of just becoming a maritime engineer, he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction. Before leaving Europe, he was informed that he had been selected for promotion to lieutenant, but he still had to pass the examinations. He reported to his next ship, which was the cruiser , as assistant engineer, at Long Beach, California, where he took his examinations, and was promoted on 29 June 1936. After less than a year, he was sent to the new destroyer [...] on the request of its skipper, Commander Hewlett Thebaud.|$|E
