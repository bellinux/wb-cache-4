25|$|On September 17, 2012, a {{man from}} the Republic of Kiribati was rescued after being at sea for 105 days. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that a shark swam around the boat and took it off in a direction. He {{followed}} it and as he followed it with his eyes he looked up and there was the stern of a purse seiner with a bunch of crewmen with binoculars looking at him.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, a man {{claimed to}} have frequented the Barrowland Ballroom with the suspect and {{confirmed}} that he knew the killer. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that {{he grew up with}} the killer in Cranhill in the east end of Glasgow. Apparently he had read an article in the Evening Times five years previously and suddenly realised that his friend was Bible John. The alleged suspect was traced living in the Netherlands, married to a Dutch woman. Nothing more was ever heard from the man or the reputed suspect.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 in Sabaki Village, Malindi District, Kenya, a male {{farm manager}} was {{reportedly}} attacked after stepping on a 13-ft python, the exact species {{of which was}} not determined. After an hour's struggle, he was reportedly dragged up a tree, but then rescued by police and villagers after {{he was able to}} call for help on his mobile phone. The snake was reportedly captured by police, but had escaped and disappeared by the next day. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he bit the snake's tail while he was being attacked and was injured on his lower lip because the tip of the tail was sharp.|$|E

25|$|The police {{initially}} {{identified the}} 18-year-old brother-in-law of Chérif Kouachi, a French Muslim student of North African descent and unknown nationality, {{as a third}} suspect in the shooting, accused of driving the getaway car. He was {{believed to have been}} living in Charleville-Mézières, about 200km northeast of Paris near the border with Belgium. He turned himself in at a Charleville-Mézières police station early in the morning on 8 January 2015. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he was in class {{at the time of the}} shooting, and that he rarely saw Chérif Kouachi. Many of his classmates said that he was at school in Charleville-Mézières during the attack. After holding him for about 50 hours, police said that he was not being charged at that time.|$|E
25|$|Police {{arrested a}} suspect that closely matched the {{description}} on Sunday. The suspect had gloves that Mrs. Harmon {{identified as the}} same gloves worn by her attacker. The man was also wearing blue clothes and khakis. The pocket knife the 33 year-old was carrying, though, had a blade much shorter than five inches. This man was also clean shaven. After investigating the suspect, officers {{did not believe the}} man was the Phantom. According to the man's story about bumming around the country, he could not have been in Texarkana during the slaying of Virgil Starks. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that he left Pine Bluff {{in the latter part of}} April and went to Colorado. Officers said that they were going to thoroughly check his story. They kept him in jail for three weeks so his beard would grow back, which would allow Mrs. Harmon to positively identify him as her attacker.|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E

2500|$|Huncke hitchhiked to New York City in 1939. He {{was dropped}} off at 103rd and Broadway, {{and he asked}} the driver how to find 42nd Street.

Ingrid Loyau-Kennett, a cub scout leader from Cornwall, disembarked from a passing bus with the {{intention}} of rendering first aid, after she saw what she thought was a road accident. On discovering that the victim was dead she engaged one of the assailants in conversation. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he was responsible for killing the man on the ground – a British soldier who the attacker claimed had [...] "killed Muslims in Iraq and in Afghanistan".|$|E
2500|$|By October 2002, Van {{had been}} out of a job for four months and {{sustaining}} expenses which included interest on the loan and personal living costs, all totaling A$580 a month.

2500|$|In 1825, {{when he was}} nine, Bosco had {{the first}} of a series of dreams which would play an {{influential}} role in his outlook and work. This first dream [...] "left a profound impression on him for the rest of his life", according to his own memoirs. Bosco apparently saw a multitude of very poor boys who play and blaspheme, and a man, who [...] "appeared, nobly attired, with a manly and imposing bearing". <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> to him: [...] "You will have to win these friends of yours not with blows, but with gentleness and kindness.

2500|$|Elliott {{asked the}} man if he killed Betty Jo Booker, he replied [...] "no". He then {{asked him if he}} knew who did; <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> [...] "no". On {{the night of the murder}} of Booker and Martin, it was {{revealed}} that the suspect spent some time with a friend, dropped him off at home, then pulled over to the side of North Park road to urinate. He then visited his paramour, but after the plans did not work out, he went home and then to bed. Sheriff Presley and his officers then checked the details of the man's story and cleared him as a suspect. He lied during the polygraph test because of the love affair he was having with a married woman.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{a lawyer}} named Robert Tarbox (who, in August 1975, was disbarred by the California Supreme Court {{for failure to}} pay some clients) {{said that in the}} early 1970s a {{merchant}} mariner walked into his office and confessed to him that he was the Zodiac Killer. The seemingly lucid seaman (whose name Tarbox would not reveal due to confidentiality) described his crimes briefly but persuasively enough to convince Tarbox. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> he was trying to stop himself from his [...] "opportunistic" [...] murder spree but never returned to see Tarbox again. Tarbox took out a full-page ad in the Vallejo Times-Herald that he claimed would clear the name of Arthur Leigh Allen as a killer, his only reason for revealing the story thirty years after the fact. Robert Graysmith, {{the author of several books}} on Zodiac, said Tarbox's story was [...] "entirely plausible".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} music rehearsal, {{or rather the}} first time the music was played over to us by Sullivan at the piano we arrived at Dick Dauntless's [...] "Parlez vous" [...] song. [...] After playing it over Sullivan said [...] "That's your song, Lely." [...] Gilbert {{happened}} to be seated next to me, and I said quite innocently [...] "It sounds as though a hornpipe should follow." [...] Gilbert grunted. [...] Nothing more was said or thought [...] at least by me [...] about the matter. [...] A few days later at rehearsal Gilbert, without any preamble, said [...] "Lely, can you dance a hornpipe?" [...] I was rather taken aback, as I had quite forgotten having spoken about one. [...] So, trying to be funny I suppose, I said [...] "Well, Mr. Gilbert, as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>said</b> when asked if he could play the fiddle, I've never tried so I don't know." [...] Gilbert answered quite seriously [...] "How soon can you know?" [...] and I said equally seriously [...] "To-morrow".|$|E
