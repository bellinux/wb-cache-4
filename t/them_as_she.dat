5|$|As {{the video}} begins, Aguilera is chatting {{with a group}} of women. When Aguilera leaves the conversation, a black man {{suddenly}} grabs her buttocks, making Aguilera stop and causing an argument between <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> continues to sing, the nearby women in the neighborhood join her, while the male residents join the man and form their respective sides in the street. They perform their own hip hop dance skills against each other. At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her high heels. The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
5|$|At S.H.I.E.L.D. base, the {{infected}} May starts seeing ghoulish images {{around her and}} begins attacking her fellow agents. She is subdued by the agency’s new director, Jeffrey Mace, a super-strong Inhuman who has her sent to a secret facility for treatment. He refuses to give this location to Phil Coulson, the former director who had stepped down {{with the hope that}} a new powered director could help calm human-Inhuman relations. With Mace planning to announce S.H.I.E.L.D. to the world as a legitimate agency, he has had Coulson helping him with public relations. Mack asks Johnson to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. with <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was an agent and friend of theirs before leaving to become Quake. She refuses, and instead joins with Reyes in a partnership—he believes Momentum and the ghosts are connected to him.|$|E

5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E

Barton, along with several other women, personally provided clothing, food, and supplies for the sick and wounded soldiers. She learned how to store and distribute medical supplies and offered emotional support to the soldiers by keeping their spirits high. She would read books to them, write letters to their families for them, talk to them, and support them.|$|E
25|$|On 24 August 1939 Our Chalet {{was full}} of Guides from all over Europe. A group of Guides set out for nearby Kandersteg, but the clouds of war {{compelled}} Falk to recall <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was responsible for their safe return. An all-out effort managed to return the Guides by 4pm, despite significant protests. Falk's concerns were shown to be well-founded when World War II broke out eight days later. Our Chalet's staff quickly set upon the often difficult task of returning guests/ tourists to their home countries.|$|E
25|$|In August 1918, Pickford's {{contract}} expired and, when refusing Zukor's {{terms for}} a renewal, she was offered $250,000 {{to leave the}} motion picture business. She declined, and went to First National Pictures, which agreed to her terms. In 1919, Pickford, along with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks, formed the independent film production company United Artists. Through United Artists, Pickford continued to produce and perform in her own movies; she could also distribute <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> chose. In 1920, Pickford's film Pollyanna grossed around $1,100,000. The following year, Pickford's film Little Lord Fauntleroy was also a success, and in 1923, Rosita grossed over $1,000,000 as well. During this period, she also made Little Annie Rooney (1925), another film in which Pickford played a child, Sparrows (1926), which blended the Dickensian with newly minted German expressionist style, and My Best Girl (1927), a romantic comedy featuring her future husband Buddy Rogers.|$|E

25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

500|$|Gestation {{lasts for}} two to three months, {{following}} which a litter of one to four kittens is born. Births take place in secluded areas, for example in dense vegetation or burrows abandoned by aardvarks and porcupines. Blind at birth, newborn weigh nearly [...] and have soft, woolly hair (greyer than in adults) and unclear markings. The eyes open after nine to thirteen days. Weaning begins after a month of birth; the mother brings small kills to her kittens and calls out to <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> approaches the [...] "den". A mother with young kittens rests for a notably lesser time and has to spend almost twice the time and energy for hunting than do other servals. If disturbed, the mother will shift her kittens one by one to a more secure place. Kittens eventually start accompanying their mother to hunts. At around six months, they acquire their permanent canines and begin to hunt themselves; they leave their mother at about 12 months of age. They may reach sexual maturity from 12 to 25 months of age. Life expectancy is about 10 years in the wild, and up to 20 years in captivity.|$|E

Mark's younger brother, Tyler (Travis Burns), gets {{a job at the}} garage and he moves in with Mark. In an effort to bring down Dimato, Mark rejoins the police force, but has to start back as a constable. After assuring Naomi that he does not have feelings for Paige, they declare themselves an official couple. Mark learns Matt has been accepting bribes from Dimato and Brennan agrees not to tell anyone if Matt takes long-service leave and gives him a statement about Dimato's operations. Matt dies after being involved in a hit-and-run and Brennan attacks Dimato when he turns up to Matt's wake. He uses Matt's information to set up a police sting to catch the thief stealing cars for Dimato. The police follow a stolen car back to Dimato and Brennan arrests him. Brennan and Naomi's relationship suffers when she becomes Paul's executive assistant. Brennan asks Lauren if he can expose Matt's corruption to put Dimato in prison, which causes her son, Bailey (Calen Mackenzie), to lash out at him. Naomi breaks up with Mark and he learns that she has feelings for Paul. Her mother Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) tries to reunite <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> disapproves of Paul, while Paul decides to help Mark win Naomi back. He succeeds, but she discovers that Paul has been helping Mark out with their dates and ends their relationship.|$|E
500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] {{in the previous}} fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' first Hamburg {{residency}} {{took place}} in 1960, with Lennon writing frequent and passionate letters back home to Powell. After returning home, Lennon's aunt and legal guardian, Mimi Smith, threw a hand-mirror at him for {{spending a lot of}} money on a suede coat for Powell. Smith later referred to her as [...] "a gangster's moll", and was often unpleasant towards her. The Beatles went to Hamburg for a second time in 1961, and both Powell and Dot Rhone (Paul McCartney's girlfriend at the time), visited them two weeks later, during the Easter holidays. They had to stay up all night because of the long sets, both taking Preludin to stay awake, which the group was also taking. Lennon and Powell stayed with Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, at her mother's house. After the trip to Hamburg, Powell's mother Lillian said Powell's cousin and husband were emigrating to Canada with their new-born baby, and that she, Lillian, would be going with them while they studied to become teachers. Powell waited until Lennon came back from Hamburg before she asked Smith—who had taken in lodgers before at 251 Menlove Avenue—if she would rent a room to her. Smith rented out the box-room above the front door (which had been Lennon's bedroom), but insisted she also do chores around the house. To pay the rent, she took a job at a Woolworths store in Liverpool, after her student grant had run out. In the same year, when Lennon was 21 years old, he received £100 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). from his aunt Mater who lived in Edinburgh, and went to Paris with McCartney. Powell could not accompany <b>them</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was studying for her final exams.|$|E
