5|$|In Mexico, {{effects were}} mostly related to rainfall; up to 16inches (400mm) fell in some areas. When Fay flooded {{areas such as}} Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, 100families were {{evacuated}} from their homes, and 120people were stranded in hotels. It is reported that in that town, 10trees fell causing little or no damage. Also, the Rio Grande flooded its banks to 3.3meters (10ft) above flood stage. It is reported that 300families were not able <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> for several weeks {{as a result of}} the flooding.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Visscher surrendered {{control of}} the military to Glan. Not long afterwards, news reached him that Yonko had not joined the insurgents but had been robbed, spending the night at his son's grave in Peterongan in depression. This revitalised Visscher, who retook command of the military on 4 May and ordered everyone <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> Several days afterwards, four regents– Suradiningrat from Tuban, Martapura from Grobogan, Suradimenggala from Kaliwungu, and Awangga from Kendal– arrived at Semarang, reporting that the 6,000 promised troops were on their way.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm moved ashore, high winds {{prevented}} disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas. By February18, CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions. The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10,000people. High winds halted locust-control operations, while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions. In {{the area of the}} cyclone's first landfall, most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside. Overall, about 25,845people became homeless due to the cyclone, although most were able <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> after a few days after they were repaired. In the months {{after the storm}}'s passage, the European Commission allocated €200,000 ($287,000USD) to CARE France for the storm victims.|$|E

Before releasing Joe, Santa Anna ordered that the surviving members of the Mexican Army parade in a grand review, in the hopes that Joe and Dickinson would deliver a warning to the remainder of the Texian forces that his army was unbeatable.|$|E
5|$|The local Red Cross {{offices in}} Port Vila and Luganville {{prepared}} general relief supplies before the storm's arrival, including tents, tool kits, and first aid units. By {{four days after}} the cyclone's passage, the main wharf in Port Vila was re-opened and the two sunken boats were removed. Additionally, the evacuees were allowed <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> and communications between the various islands were restored. The Red Cross distributed various relief supplies to the affected citizens, including candles, matches, water, and blankets. By about two weeks after the storm, about 30,000household relief packages were distributed. The Vanuatu government allocated VT25million (2004VUV, $236,000 2004USD) for the affected citizens. Overall, the cyclone severely affected the daily lives of the Vanuatu citizens. On Tanna island, the cyclone's passage produced a malaria outbreak.|$|E
5|$|After {{disembarking}} in Sydney, {{the troops}} received {{three weeks of}} leave during which time they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The 9th Division then carried out welcome home marches across Australia, with the 2/15th {{taking part in the}} march through Brisbane. After this, the division was transported to Kairi on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland where it was converted to the jungle establishment and began training for operations against the Japanese. The reorganisation saw the battalion establishment drop to around 800 men, and the loss of many vehicles and heavy equipment. Lieutenant Colonel Colin Henry Grace was appointed to command the battalion in May 1943 and would do so {{for the rest of the}} war. Amphibious training was carried out at Trinity Beach, near Cairns, with the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment in July 1943.|$|E

5|$|By 20 December, {{arrangements}} for the delivery of emergency food and water supplies were made and expected to reach Carnarvon later that day. Supplies were also sent to outlying Aboriginal communities affected by the floods. After evacuating on 20 December, residents were allowed <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> two days later in Carnarvon. However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from local agencies. Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented {{at least some of}} the floods by following through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though {{isolated}} roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> the water level of the river continued to fall. Due to this fact, the opening of Fairbanks' Tanana Valley Fair—scheduled for August 1—was not delayed. Despite the falling water level in the Tanana, the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers. This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3:30 a.m. on August 1. They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5:30 a.m. on August 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{convince}} other slaves in Texas to support the Mexican government over the Texian rebellion, Santa Anna spared Travis' slave, Joe. The day after the battle, he interviewed each noncombatant individually. Impressed with Susanna Dickinson, Santa Anna offered to adopt her infant daughter Angelina and have the child educated in Mexico City. Dickinson refused the offer, which was not extended to Juana Navarro Alsbury although her son was of similar age. Each woman was given a blanket and two silver pesos. Alsbury and the other Tejano women were allowed <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> in Béxar; Dickinson, her daughter and Joe were sent to Gonzales, escorted by Ben.

5|$|In {{response}} to the revolt, the Aćimović administration encouraged 545 or 546 prominent and influential Serbs to sign the Appeal to the Serbian Nation, {{which was published in}} the German-authorised Belgrade daily newspaper Novo vreme on 13 and 14 August. Those that signed included three Serbian Orthodox bishops, four archpriests, and at least 81 professors from the University of Belgrade, although according to the historian Stevan K. Pavlowitch, many of the signatories were placed under pressure to sign, and Professor Jozo Tomasevich notes that many of those who signed it were known for their leftist views. The appeal called upon the Serbian population to help the authorities in every way in their struggle against the communist rebels, and called for loyalty to the Nazis, condemning the Partisan-led resistance as unpatriotic. The Serbian Bar Association unanimously supported the Appeal. The Aćimović administration also appealed for rebels <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> and announced bounties for the killing of rebels and their leaders. Aćimović also gave orders that the wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held, and the Germans burned their houses and imposed curfews.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{recommended}} the citizens on Smith Island to evacuate {{on the day}} prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the Eastern shore of Maryland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in Calvert, St. Mary's, and Charles counties, and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in Howard County. Officials recommended residents in flood areas of Baltimore County to evacuate, and some {{in the city of}} Baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend or family member, with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. Most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel. Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000people evacuate the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, as well.|$|E
