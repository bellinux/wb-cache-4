His 2014 paper, An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of p-values, contributed to the p-value debate, and to the discussion of reproducibility in science. This paper has been followed by others whuch have explored tha basis of inductive inference, and which have investigated in more depth the alternatives to using p values. [...] The hazards of reliance on p-values was emphasised in {{by pointing out that}} even observation of p = 0.001 was not necessarily strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

5000|$|The term false {{discovery}} {{rate and}} false positive risk are used synonymously by Colquhoun (2014) and Colquhoun (2017). They are both {{defined as the}} FDR {{at the start of}} this article. They are quite different from the Type 1 error rate. Confusion of these two ideas, the error of the transposed conditional, has caused much mischief. Because of the ambiguity of notation in this field, it's essential to look at the definition in every paper. The hazards of reliance on p-values was emphasized in [...] by pointing out that even observation of p = 0.001 was not necessarily strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

As a consequence, it has been recommended the every p value should be accompanied by the prior probability of there being a real effect that it would be necessary to assume in order to achieve a false positive risk of 5%. For example, if we observe p= 0.05 in a single experiment, we would have to be 87% certain that there as a real effect before the experiment was done to achieve a false positive risk of 5%.|$|E

The alloy undergoes first order martensitic phase transition (MPT) around 200 K and also shows large conventional magnetocaloric effect (MCE) (Δ S ∼ - 21 J/kg-K for magnetic field (H) changing from 0 - 50 kOe) around the transition in ambient condition. Application of external hydrostatic pressure (P) results a shift in MPT towards the lower temperature and a clear decrease in the saturation moment of the alloy at 5 K. The peak value of MCE is also found to decrease with increasing external P (∼ 18 J/kg-K decrease in Δ S has been observed for P = 12. 5 kbar).

40|$|The focal {{mechanism}} of the Hindu Kush earthquake of January 28, 1964 (focal depth; 207 km, magnitude; 6. 1, after USCGS) is discussed by using body waves. On {{the basis of the}} experimental as well as theoretical result on the phase shift of the reflected waves in the case of two-dimensional model simulating the earth by Shimamura and Sato (1965), attention is given {{to the use of the}} reflected phases for the focal mechanism study in this paper. The most probable solutions of the mechanism are numerically determined by using both the real polarization angles (ε) and the apparent polarization angles (γ), respectively, where the angle (γ) is obtained from the horizontal surface motion. The difference of the two solutions is found to be much less than the standard deviation of the solution. It is concluded that the earthquake can be explained by the double couple hypothesis since <b>the</b> <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> <b>P</b> and pP waves are sufficiently satisfied by the most probable solution determined from the S wave data alone by assuming the hypothesis.

By scrutinizing high-frequency signals, we detect ~ 5 times as many aftershocks in the first 200 s as in the Japan Meteorological Agency catalogue. After correcting for the changing completeness level immediately after the mainshock, the aftershock rate shows a crossover from a slower decay with an Omori's law exponent p = 0. 58 ± 0. 08 between 20 and 900 s after the mainshock, to a faster decay with p = 0. 92 ± 0. 04 after 900 s. The foreshock seismicity rate follows an inverse Omori's law with p = 0. 73 ± 0. 07 from several tens of days up to several hundred seconds before the mainshock. The seismicity rate in the 200 s immediately before the mainshock appears steady with p = 0. 36 ± 0. 45.

The shortest-lived component (similar to 1 ps) arises from water relaxation around the excited flavin. The 9 -ps component originates from the intramolecular complex between flavin and adenine, whereas the nanosecond decay is attributed to the unstacked form of FAD. The spectra of the three forms are derived from global analysis of decay curves at different emission wavelengths and time regimes using a triple exponential function. It is assumed that the amplitude belonging to the nanosecond fluorescence component reflects the steady-state fluorescence spectrum. Fluorescence anisotropy to its maximum value of 0. 4 is instantaneously created. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The cross-correlation analysis shows that, in the unsaturated region with a uniform flux boundary, the dominant correlation between P and Ks is negative and mainly occurs around <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> location <b>of</b> <b>P.</b> A relatively high P value is located in a relatively low Ks zone, while a relatively low P value is located in a relatively high Ks zone.

In situations in which these assumptions are not satisfied, a nonparametric multiplier bootstrap approach may be used.

40|$|Main {{purpose of}} the work is to {{evaluate}} the peculiarities of nursing of surgical site infection in cardiosurgery. Methods. The questionnaire, interview, documentary and statistical analysis. The questionnaire was made by themselves, sustaining literature and foreign research analysis. Objectives. During the study was made two grups of object. One was 40 nurses working in Clinics of Medical University of Kaunas in section of cardio or common surgery. The second grup were the patients who had wound infection and were healed and examined at Clinics of Cardio surgery of Medical University of Kaunas. Results. During the study were forthcoming that both of section nurses do the function of technic nursing. The contact with the patient and teahcing is not popular. The cardio surgery nurses has these prioritires: pain control, the isoliation of the patient. The nurses from the common surgery has these prioritires: monitoring <b>of</b> fever and <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common patients condition. During the study the patient pointed the demand of knowledge (about prevention of infection (66, 6 %), the ways of infection spread (46, 6 %)). Only about 40 precentage of the patient would like to go to the training. The results of study also showed that about 33, 3 precentage of patient dont use any means of prevention and dont know the reasons of it. Conclusions. There was found that statistical diferences of the nursing action are: <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common patients condition (p < 0, 01), <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simptoms (<b>p</b> < 0, 001), the isoliation <b>of</b> the patient (<b>p</b> < 0, 01), the secondary illnesses (p < 0, 05), fever (p < 0, 01). There was forthcoming the meaning statistical contact of patients knowledge and suspense. There was made two recommendations about the care dimensions of postoperative wound infection...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported the scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging under buffer of the heme monooxygenase cytochrome P 450 (cam) from Pseudomonas putida [Faraday Discuss. 116 (2000) 1]. We describe here the adsorption and STM imaging under buffer of complexes of a mutant <b>of</b> cytochrome <b>P</b> 450 (cam), K 344 C, and wild-type putidaredoxin (Pdx) on gold(111). The images of Pdx {{on its own}} on gold(111) are not uniform, presumably due to multiple orientations of protein adsorption {{because of the presence}} of five or more cysteines on the protein surface. STM imaging of a 1 : 1 mixture <b>of</b> <b>P</b> 450 (cam) -K 344 C/Pdx showed a regular array of pairs of different-sized proteins 20 - 25 A apart arranged in rows across the gold(111) surface which we attribute to the P 450 (cam) /Pdx complex. The images of the pairs are more regular than those of Pdx on its own, probably as a result of complex formation with P 450 (cam) partly overcoming the heterogeneity of Pdx adsorption. As far as we are aware this is the first report of STM imaging of a protein/protein complex, and <b>the</b> first direct <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>P</b> 450 (cam) /Pdx complex formation which is a key step in the catalytic cycle <b>of</b> <b>P</b> 450 (cam) catalysis. The redox centers of the two proteins are ca. 20 A apart, too far for rapid intracomplex electron transfer. Whether the observed complex is competent for electron transfer or physiologically relevant is not known, and further work is in progress to elucidate the protein-protein interaction...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pandanus conoideus Lam. (buah merah) is a {{well-known}} advantageous herbal from Papua, contains active substances that can increase Natural Killer proliferation in the human body. According to <b>the</b> <b>observation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>P.</b> conoideus’ inventor on the native of Papua who consumed P. conoideus in the certain period of time, they became stronger and able to survive from disease. As we know, Papua is one of severe endemic area of malaria. For this reason, the researcher tries to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>P.</b> conoideus Lam pretreatment on parasitemia degree of Plasmodium berghei-infected Swiss mice. Method: This was an experimental study using post test-only control group design with 14 female mice, 25 - 30 grams, 8 - 12 weeks, randomized into 2 groups. Both groups were given standard dietary for a week. At days 8 th, group I (K) was infected by Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Group II (P) was given Pandanus conoideus oil for five days (days 8 th until days 12 th), At days 13 th, it was infected by P. berghei ANKA, then continued giving P. conoideus oil from days 14 th until days 18 th. Some peripheral-blood samples of group I were taken from mice’s tail for making preparat at days 9 th until days 13 th, and for group II, at days 14 th until days 18 th. Parasitemia degree was examined by {{counting the number of}} parasitized erythrocytes per 1000 cells and analyzed using Saphiro-Wilk and independent t-test. Results: The mean of parasitemia degree of group I is 31, 74 ± 11, 03 and group II is 13, 36 ± 5, 17. Parasitemia degree of group II is lower than group I. There was a significant difference of parasitemia degree between group I and group II, analyzed by independent t-test at says 1 st, 3 rd, and all days of experiment, but not significant at days 5 th of experiment. Conclusions: The administration of Pandanus conoideus Lam, before Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection, may reduce the parasitemia degree of Swiss mice. Key words: Pandanus conoideus Lam., parasitemia degree, Plasmodium berghei ANKA. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{many areas}} of application, the data are of {{functional}} nature, such as (one-dimensional) spectral data and two- or three-dimensional imaging data. It is often of interest to test for the significance of some set of factors in <b>the</b> functional <b>observations</b> (e. g.,test for the mean differences between two groups). Testing hypotheses point-by-point (voxel-by-voxel in neuroimaging studies) results in a severe multiple-comparisons problem {{as the number of}} measurements made per observation is typically much larger than <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> ("large <b>p,</b> small n"). Thus solutions to this problem should take into account the spatial correlation structure inherent in the data. Popular approaches in such a setting include the general Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) approach and the permutation test, but these rely on strong parametric and exchangeability assumptions. In situations in which these assumptions are not satisfied, a nonparametric multiplier bootstrap approach may be used. Motivated by this problem, we present general results for multiplier bootstraps for sums of independent but not identically distributed processes. We also consider the application of these results to an imaging setting and provide sufficient conditions that will ensure asymptotic control of the familywise error rate. 62 F 40 Functional central limit theorem Multiplier bootstrap Multiple-hypothesis testing Functional data...|$|R
40|$|Background: Reduction of {{postoperative}} {{nausea and}} vomiting (PONV) {{continues to be}} a major challenge in perioperative care in spite of introduction of newer antiemetics with better efficacy and safety profiles. Therefore, we evaluated the additive effect of oral midazolam and clonidine for PONV prophylaxis in granisetron premedicated patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Materials and Methods: In a prospective, randomized fashion, 120 selected cases were randomized into three groups: I, II or III to receive a tablet of midazolam (15 mg, n = 36), clonidine (150 mcg, n = 40), or glucose as placebo (5 g, n = 44) orally, 1 h before anesthesia. Occurrence of PONV along with need for rescue antiemetic during the first postoperative day was compared between groups as a primary outcome. Results: Episodes of PONV reduced significantly in Group II (15 %) as compared to group I and III (22. 2 %, 59 %) at various time points during <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 002). Need for rescue antiemetic was significantly lower in group I (13. 88 %) and II (5 %) as compared to group III (52. 27 %, P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Oral clonidine is better adjuvant for PONV prophylaxis, as compared to midazolam, in granisetron premedicated patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy...|$|R
