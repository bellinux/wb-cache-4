5|$|<b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution. However, if the object of the statute is itself illegitimate, a classification may be invalid even if it satisfies the test. Hence, the test is only applicable if the object of the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E

25|$|The {{representation}} of the colors in the image is converted from RGB to , consisting of one luma component (Y'), representing brightness, and two chroma components, (CB and CR), representing color. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> sometimes skipped.|$|E
25|$|Following thymus entry, {{progenitors}} proliferate {{to generate}} the ETP population. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> following by the generation of DN2 thymocytes which migrate from the cortico-medullary junction toward the thymus capsule. DN3 thymocytes are generated at the subcapsular zone.|$|E
30|$|There {{was general}} {{confusion}} regarding what this involved. Change: <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> relabeled the ‘International Harmonization Step’ and requested only {{a description of}} the planned methodology and rationale.|$|R

25|$|Implement the {{function}} f as a quantum transform. To achieve this, Shor used repeated squaring for his modular exponentiation transformation. It {{is important to}} note that <b>this</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> more difficult to implement than the quantum Fourier transform, in that it requires ancillary qubits and substantially more gates to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|In {{integrated}} circuit design, physical design {{is a step}} in the standard design cycle which follows after the circuit design. At this step, circuit representations of the components (devices and interconnects) of the design are converted into geometric representations of shapes which, when manufactured in the corresponding layers of materials, will ensure the required functioning of the components. This geometric representation is called {{integrated circuit}} layout. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> usually split into several sub-steps, which include both design and verification and validation of the layout.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> the enzymatic {{transfer}} of a phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP by phosphoglycerate kinase, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. At this step, glycolysis {{has reached the}} break-even point: 2 molecules of ATP were consumed, and 2 new molecules have now been synthesized. This step, {{one of the two}} substrate-level phosphorylation steps, requires ADP; thus, when the cell has plenty of ATP (and little ADP), this reaction does not occur. Because ATP decays relatively quickly when it is not metabolized, this is an important regulatory point in the glycolytic pathway.|$|E
30|$|Stage I - (Linear {{modeling}}): Similar to {{the linear}} modeling phase, ARIMA(1, 0, 0) is designed and the residuals of <b>this</b> <b>step</b> <b>are</b> {{used in the}} next step.|$|R
30|$|It {{is chosen}} in this {{contribution}} {{to separate the}} medium- and short-term chlorination problems. Two iterative steps’ optimization methodology is then proposed. In the first step: medium term, it is proposed to optimize booster stations number and locations in DWN. It <b>is</b> suitable that <b>this</b> <b>step</b> <b>be</b> ensured when there are tangible network structure modifications (pipes’ length, pipes’ connections, or valves’ status) or an important consumption deviation is observed, due to variation of consumers’ number or class. It <b>is</b> recommended that <b>this</b> <b>step</b> <b>be</b> performed if a fundamental hydraulic behaviour is recorded.|$|R

25|$|Here {{the program}} calculates an optimal {{alignment}} of initial regions {{as a combination}} of compatible regions with maximal score. This optimal alignment of initial regions can be rapidly calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The resulting score initn is used to rank the library sequences.This joining process increases sensitivity but decreases selectivity. A carefully calculated cut-off value is thus used to control where <b>this</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> implemented, a value that is approximately one standard deviation above the average score expected from unrelated sequences in the library. A 200-residue query sequence with kmer 2 uses a value 28.|$|E
25|$|The {{balls are}} then hard ground. They are {{ground in the}} same type of machine as used before, but either an {{abrasive}} is introduced into coolant or the rotating plate is replaced with a very hard fine-grain grinding wheel. This step can get the balls within ±. If the balls need more precision then they are lapped, again in {{the same type of}} machine. However, this time the rill plates are made of a softer material, usually cast iron, less pressure is applied, the plate is rotated slowly. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> what gives bearing balls their shiny appearance and can bring the balls between grades 10 and 48.|$|E
25|$|The push {{pushes the}} palm {{backward}} {{through the water}} underneath the body {{at the beginning and}} {{at the side of the}} body at the end of the push. The swimmer only pushes the arms 1/3 of the way to the hips, making it easier to enter into the recovery and making the recovery shorter and making the breathing window shorter. The movement increases speed throughout the pull-push phase until the hand is the fastest at the end of the push. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> called the release and is crucial for the recovery. The speed at the end of the push is used to help with the recovery.|$|E

50|$|The last layer steps OLL and PLL involve first {{orienting}} {{the last}} layer pieces, then permuting {{them into their}} correct positions. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>was</b> proposed by Hans Dockhorn and Anneke Treep.|$|R
25|$|The simplex {{algorithm}} {{applied to}} the Phase I problem must terminate with a minimum value for the new objective function since, being the sum of nonnegative variables, its value is bounded below by 0. If the minimum is 0 then the artificial variables can be eliminated from the resulting canonical tableau producing a canonical tableau equivalent to the original problem. The simplex algorithm can then be applied to find the solution; <b>this</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> called PhaseII. If the minimum is positive {{then there is no}} feasible solution for the Phase I problem where the artificial variables are all zero. This implies that the feasible region for the original problem is empty, and so the original problem has no solution.|$|E
25|$|In 1686, 40 {{years after}} Mogila's death, the Ottomans, {{acting on the}} behalf of the regent of Russia Sophia Alekseyevna, {{pressured}} the Patriarch of Constantinople into transferring the Orthodox Church of Kiev and all Rus' from the jurisdiction of Constantinople to the Patriarch of Moscow, established a century prior to that. The legality of <b>this</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> occasionally questioned to this day along {{with the fact that}} the transfer was accompanied by graft and bribery, which in church affairs amounts to an ecclesiastical crime. The transfer itself, however, led to the significant Ukrainian domination of the Russian Orthodox Church, which continued well into the 18th century, Feofan Prokopovich, Epifany Slavinetsky, Stephen Yavorsky and Demetrius of Rostov being among the most notable representatives of this trend.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{chip design}} process begins with {{system-level}} design and microarchitecture planning. Within IC design companies, management and often analytics will draft {{a proposal for}} a design team to start the design of a new chip to fit into an industry segment. Upper-level designers will meet at this stage to decide how the chip will operate functionally. <b>This</b> <b>step</b> <b>is</b> where an IC's functionality and design are decided. IC designers will map out the functional requirements, verification testbenches, and testing methodologies for the whole project, and will then turn the preliminary design into a system-level specification that can be simulated with simple models using languages like C++ and MATLAB and emulation tools. For pure and new designs, the system design stage is where an Instruction set and operation is planned out, and in most chips existing instruction sets are modified for newer functionality. Design at this stage is often statements such as encodes in the MP3 format or implements IEEE floating-point arithmetic. At later stages in the design process, each of these innocent looking statements expands to hundreds of pages of textual documentation.|$|E
