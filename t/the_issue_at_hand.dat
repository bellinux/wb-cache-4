5|$|There is some {{authority}} {{to the effect that}} a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> to be an academic question or one that is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992), proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since {{there was no evidence that}} any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of his {{research}} he travelled over Finland and the greater part of his own country; and from 1828 to 1830 he undertook, in company with Georg Adolf Erman and with the co-operation of Russia, a government-funded mission to Western Siberia. A narrative of the expedition soon appeared (Reise-Erinnerungen aus Siberien, 1854; Souvenirs d’un voyage en Sibérie, 1857); but the chief work was not issued until 1863 (Resultate magnetischer Beobachtungen). He did not conclude on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> but his work was later completed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. Shortly after the return of the mission, in 1833 Hansteen moved with his family into the observatory, which was created from drawings by the architect Christian Heinrich Grosch. A magnetic observatory was added in 1839.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{was also}} {{referred}} to the House of Lords case of R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union (1995). Their Lordships held that the Home Secretary only had a duty to keep {{the implementation of a}} statutory scheme under active consideration until and unless Parliament decided to repeal the statute. The Singapore Court of Appeal distinguished ex parte Fire Brigades Union from <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> on two grounds. First, the word shall in Article 49(1) indicated that the Prime Minister is under a duty to call an election to fill the vacancy, as opposed to the word may which appeared in the statute in ex parte Fire Brigades Union. Secondly, the Prime Minister's discretion under Article 49(1) is not solely and largely dictated by policy considerations, unlike the Home Secretary's discretion in ex parte Fire Brigades Union. Rather, in deciding when to call a by-election, the Prime Minister must bear in mind the equally important consideration of the interests {{of the people of the}} constituency in which a vacancy has arisen.|$|E

Lili Bosse, the mayor of Beverly Hills at the time, welcomed the resolution and added {{that she had made}} a [...] "personal decision" [...] not to return to the hotel until the situation had been solved. The decision was lauded by Rabbi Laura Geller of Temple Emanuel, where Bosse is a congregant. By then the Jewish Journal reported that [...] "more than $2 million worth of events have been canceled at the Beverly Hills Hotel by dozens of groups." [...] Dorchester Collection Chief Executive Officer Christopher Cowdray then responded to the controversy by asking the public to consider <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> in a broader perspective, citing the fact that many brands are backed by foreign investors. Sharia law exists alongside other normative systems and has been adopted by many other Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia which has major investments in the American hospitality industry, including the Four Seasons and Fairmont hotel chains. Adweek declared that [...] "the bad press and protests have tarnished the glamorous image of the Beverly Hills Hotel, {{one of the most famous}} hotels in the world" [...] and added that [...] "such extreme brand damage will be difficult to repair".|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 26, the Erie Railroad sent a {{statement}} out from Pavonia Terminal in Jersey City, New Jersey to disregard the order from the previous day. The new sign came down instantly and the conductors continued to call the station Turner once again. Old time locals felt the name Turner had more value to them and shouldn't be touched. A self-appointed committee run by the priest proposed a meeting on Saturday, June 4, 1910 at nearby Gillette Hall to protest the name change. The priest also offered that if the name was to remain Turner's, he would contribute $500 towards {{the construction of a}} new station. The post office also said they would remain named Turner even if the signage on the Erie Railroad station went back to the Harriman name. Sometime during the night between June 1 and June 2, the Erie Railroad took the station depot sign for Turner down once again and re-attached the Harriman sign to the station depot. Local resolutions were sent to the Erie showing citizens' displeasure at changing the signage once again. The order from the Erie stated that beginning on July 15, the station name would remain [...] "Harriman" [...] permanently. Father McAran returned to his outrage and continued to go to the press and give interviews on <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> To wrap the issue up, a sign in the front of the local church proclaiming [...] "LONG LIVE TURNER" [...] was destroyed. This hurt the enthusiasm of locals, who suggested renaming the local Arden station near the Harriman estate instead.|$|E

2500|$|One {{rule that}} applies very {{specifically}} to forensic evidence {{is that the}} courts ban inflammatory or repulsive information or photographs.

[...] Extreme caution must be used when choosing any photographs of entomological evidence to share with a jury. [...] This rule was put into place in order to avoid outraged jurors.

2500|$|As {{with other}} {{parliamentary}} {{procedures in the}} House, members of opposition parties must place questions through the Speaker, addressing them only indirectly to the minister responsible for <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> When asking questions, members address the Speaker as [...] "Mr. Speaker" [...] or [...] "Madam Speaker" [...] ("Monsieur le président" [...] or [...] "Madame la présidente" [...] in French). There is no obligation for the minister {{referred to in the}} question to actually respond, and often the minister's parliamentary secretary or a fellow cabinet member will rise to answer the question. This is particularly true when the minister addressed is not actually present in the House during Question Period, and arguably occurs most often when the Prime Minister is addressed on a specific issue for which one of his ministers has more information.|$|E
