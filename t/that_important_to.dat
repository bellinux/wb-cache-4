"Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't <b>that</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paranoid was {{originally}} titled War Pigs, but {{the record company}} allegedly changed it {{out of fear of}} a backlash from supporters of the ongoing Vietnam War. Additionally, the band's label felt the title track was more marketable as a single. Ozzy Osbourne states in I Am Ozzy that the name change {{had nothing to do with}} the Vietnam War, and was entirely due to the record company deciding the album would be easier to sell if it was named after the single, which had already had significant success by the time the album was released, reaching number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. It was too late, however, to alter the artwork. Joe Smith, who was executive vice-president at Warner Bros. from 1970 to 1972, told Classic Albums that the rest of Warner Bros. didn't want anything to do with them: [...] "We were in the midst of the war ourselves in this country and what their reasoning was not <b>that</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> me. [...] I knew we weren't going to call it 'War Pigs'." [...] Regarding the song [...] "Paranoid", Smith recalls, [...] "It was on an acetate. I remember playing it and turning the sound way up and shaking the whole building... I said 'I think that's the breakthrough album. I don't understand it but that 'Paranoid' sounds like a great title for an album and a great title for a single. [...] "That album title had nothing to do with the sleeve," [...] Osbourne explained to Phil Alexander in 1998. [...] "What the fuck does a bloke dressed as a pig with a sword in his hand got to do with being paranoid, I don't know, but they decided to change the album title without changing the artwork." ...|$|E

50|$|Instead, {{they are}} at Runestone, a major castle in the Vale. Even so, Spence explained, they didn't make a {{separate}} animation for Runestone, because it would only appear in that one episode and wasn't <b>that</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the storyline as a whole, so it didn't justify the time and expense in creating an entirely new animation. Therefore, the Eyrie appears in that title sequence to represent the Vale as a whole, {{because it is the}} capital.|$|E

5000|$|I {{decided that}} the more higher tones there are in harmony, {{it would turn out}} to be more radiant, sharper and more brilliant. But it was {{necessary}} to organize the notes giving them a logical arrangement. Therefore, I took the usual thirteenth-chord, which is arranged in thirds. But it is not <b>that</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> accumulate high tones. To make it shining, conveying the idea of light, a greater number of tones had to be raised in the chord. And, therefore, I raise the tones: At first I take the shining major third, then I also raise the fifth, and the eleventh—thus forming my chord—which is raised completely and, therefore, really shining.|$|E
50|$|Faith was <b>that</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Buddhism, {{that the}} Buddha gave a {{directive}} {{on how to}} develop faith after his death (paranibbāna). He suggested to go and pay respect to four places, that is, {{the place where he}} was born, the place where he had first attained enlightenment, the place where he had given his first formal teaching, and finally, the place where he was to attain paranibbāna. Indeed, to dispel any doubt about the usefulness of such pilgrimage, the Buddha stated that he accepted in advance all gifts presented to the cetiyas, stūpas and places of pilgrimage. Such offerings and pilgrimage were therefore just as fruitful after he died, as when he was still alive.|$|E

"In {{the fifteenth}} century, Gutenberg {{came along and}} turned books into mass {{produced}} commodities, and eventually {{it was no longer}} all <b>that</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> remember what the printed page could remember for you". As books became easier to consult, it became less relevant to commit them to memory. It is argued that modern day society has almost completely replaced internal memory with external memory. [...] "The externalization of memory not only changed how people think; it also led to a profound shift in the very notion {{of what it means to}} be intelligent. Internal memory became devalued. Erudition evolved from possessing information internally to knowing how and where to find it in the labyrinthine world of external memory." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, in the present, Samuel Sullivan is worried for his dying friend Arnold, who has the ability to manipulate space-time like Hiro, and intends to have Hiro replace him. When Samuel wonders where he could be, Lydia reveals that Hiro had loved Charlie before she died, correctly deducing Hiro must have gone back in time to save her.
