5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man {{demands that}} Fassl kill Fain, beating him {{up when he}} doesn't comply. As she tends to Fassl, Fain first sees <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man in his place. While staking out Fain's house, the agents see <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man flee. Doggett pursues <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man while Reyes finds Fain alive. In the pursuit, Reyes falls through into a sewer, where she finds the remains of <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man's victims. After a {{struggle}} with <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man who is holding Doggett at knife point, Reyes shoots. <b>The</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man falls {{into the water and}} Doggett goes after him, only to pull up Fassl, much to his confusion. Reyes tries to remind him that it does not matter as long as the case is solved.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus, {{commonly}} known as the woolly milkcap or <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> milkcap, is a large agaric fungus. A common and widely distributed species, it is found in North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It was first described scientifically by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774 as an Agaricus, and later transferred to the genus Lactarius in 1821 by Samuel Frederick Gray. A variety, L.torminosus var. nordmanensis, is known from the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. L.torminosus officially became the type species of Lactarius in 2011 after molecular studies prompted the taxonomic reshuffling of species between several Russulaceae genera.|$|E
5|$|Scully tells Doggett {{that while}} the DNA test disproves Fassl's culpability, it implicates a {{possible}} blood relative; Fassl, however, is an only child. Reyes proposes that the murders are being conducted by an entity rather than a person. Meanwhile, Fassl approaches Assistant District Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to {{be sent back to}} prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man. After hearing of Kaylor's disappearance, Reyes theorizes that Fassl's piety and his unwillingness to acknowledge his darker half has given him the unwanted ability to physically change into another, more violent person.|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to <b>the</b> Bornean <b>bearded</b> pig (Sus barbatus), and in fact was once thought to be a {{subspecies}} (i.e., S. b. philippensis) like <b>the</b> Palawan <b>bearded</b> pig (S. b. ahoenobarbus). <b>The</b> Palawan <b>bearded</b> pig is now also frequently classified not as a subspecies, but as a separate Philippine endemic pig species, S. ahoenobarbus.|$|R

5|$|Skinner remembers having seen, on {{numerous}} occasions, a bearded man {{who showed up}} suspiciously and who is actually running the scheme. He saves Skinner and sacrifices {{one of his own}} men. The case is closed and Skinner is, once again, aggravated with the agents, ordering them to report exclusively to Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). <b>The</b> <b>bearded</b> man was actually Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.|$|E
5|$|Stela 8 is a well-preserved {{monument}} on {{the south}} side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche' people.|$|E

After being released, he stays in a room belonging to his lawyer, Jana Fain, where he clutches a Rosary beads and prays frantically. When <b>the</b> <b>Bearded</b> Man appears, Fassl begs for the man not to hurt her. While Fain is unharmed, Fassl learns that the housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, has gone missing. Fassl finds her body, cleans up the blood, and dismembers her remains to cover up what has happened.|$|E

5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disadvantages}} of national division were becoming increasingly apparent in various {{segments of the}} society, some of the Piast dukes began to make serious efforts aimed at the reunification of the Polish state. Important among the earlier attempts were {{the activities of the}} Silesian dukes Henry I <b>the</b> <b>Bearded,</b> his son Henry II the Pious, who was killed in 1241 while fighting the Mongols at the Battle of Legnica, and Henry IV Probus. In 1295, Przemysł II of Greater Poland became the first Piast duke crowned as King of Poland since Bolesław II, but he ruled over only a part of the territory of Poland (including Gdańsk Pomerania from 1294) and was assassinated soon after his coronation. A more extensive unification of Polish lands was accomplished by a foreign ruler, Václav II of Bohemia of the Přemyslid dynasty, who married Przemysł's daughter Richeza and became King of Poland in 1300. Václav's heavy-handed policies soon caused him to lose whatever support he had earlier in his reign; he died in 1305.|$|E
5|$|Count Herbert II of Maine died in 1062, and William, who had betrothed {{his eldest}} son Robert to Herbert's sister Margaret, claimed the county through his son. Local nobles {{resisted}} the claim, but William invaded and by 1064 had secured control of the area. William appointed a Norman to the bishopric of Le Mans in 1065. He also allowed his son Robert Curthose to do homage to the new Count of Anjou, Geoffrey <b>the</b> <b>Bearded.</b> William's western border was thus secured, but his border with Brittany remained insecure. In 1064 William invaded Brittany in a campaign that remains obscure in its details. Its effect, though, was to destabilise Brittany, forcing the duke, Conan II, to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion. Conan's death in 1066 further secured William's borders in Normandy. William also benefited from his campaign in Brittany by securing the support of some Breton nobles {{who went on to}} support the invasion of England in 1066.|$|E

5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela that was found inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil dilation. When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although <b>the</b> <b>bearded</b> seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, dilation varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E
