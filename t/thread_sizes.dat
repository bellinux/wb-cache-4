2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard <b>thread</b> <b>sizes,</b> so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The 3-wire method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E
50|$|Maudslay's {{invention}} about 1800 of a metal lathe to cut metal {{enabled the}} manufacture of standard screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b> Standard screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> allowed interchangeable parts {{and the development of}} mass production.|$|E
5000|$|MJTs {{can also}} be {{engineered}} to specifications for almost any application. There are few size limitations, {{and they can be}} used with extremely large <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> (as high as 32" [...] thread diameter). [...] They {{can also be}} used effectively in high temperature applications, given proper materials are used. Overall, the unique properties of MJTs created by the use of jackbolts can simplify complicated applications, especially for large <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|E

50|$|Mini-UHF {{connectors}} are miniaturized {{versions of}} UHF connectors, designed primarily {{for use in}} bag-type mobile phones and similar applications where size is an important consideration. Introduced in the 1970s, Mini-UHF has a 3/8-24 <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> and operates up to 2.5 GHz.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{characteristic}} diameters of threads: major diameter, minor diameter, and pitch diameter: Industry standards specify minimum (min) and maximum (max) limits {{for each of}} these, for all recognized <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b> The minimum limits for external (or bolt, in ISO terminology), and the maximum limits for internal (nut), <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> are there to ensure that threads do not strip at the tensile strength limits for the parent material. The minimum limits for internal, and maximum limits for external, threads are there {{to ensure that the}} threads fit together.|$|E
50|$|Additional product {{standards}} identify preferred <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> for {{screws and}} nuts, {{as well as}} corresponding bolt head and nut sizes, to facilitate compatibility between spanners (wrenches) and other tools.|$|E
5000|$|Sometime between 1912 and 1916, the Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) {{created an}} [...] "SAE series" [...] of screw <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> {{reflecting}} parentage from earlier USS and ASME standards.|$|E
40|$|To reduce {{structure}} {{weight by}} using Al-Li alloy {{as a substitute}} for conventional aluminum alloy, thread-connection strength of a 1420 forging was investigated through tensile tests, as a function of <b>thread</b> <b>size,</b> <b>thread</b> depth and orientation of the female screw samples. The main results are as follows: (1) Failure loads of M 4 type of screw samples are quite scattered, no matter how many circles of threads were involved. (2) Repeatable failure loads were detected for samples with M 5 to M 10 type of screws. (3) A linear increment of connection-strength with increasing thread circles was detected for a given type of screw samples, and the bigger the <b>thread</b> <b>size,</b> the greater the increasing rate. (4) Higher strength was detected for samples cut along longitudinal direction of the forging than for samples along its radial direction. Discussions and suggestions were given based on the above results...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{non-significant}} part numbering system, part {{numbers are}} assigned {{in some other}} fashion, such as sequentially or arbitrarily. For example, a screw may have the part number [...] "1002", which may not tell the user anything about its <b>thread</b> <b>size,</b> length of shank, or drive type.|$|R
5000|$|Metric hexagon bolts, {{screws and}} nuts are specified, for example, in British Standard BS 4190 (general purpose screws) and BS 3692 (precision screws).

50|$|For softer more pliable plastics, {{hexagonal}} or square inserts {{with deep}} and wide grooves allow the plastic to flow and adhere. The process allows large product manufacture i.e. fuel tanks, boats etc., so the torque inserts {{may be of}} large <b>thread</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The E26 and E27 {{are usually}} interchangeable, {{as are the}} E39 and E40, because {{there is only a}} 1 mm {{difference}} in thread outside diameter. E11 and E12 are not interchangeable.

50|$|The screws {{used in the}} Flexowriter were unique, having large flat {{heads with}} a very narrow {{screwdriver}} slot and a unique <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> and pitch. This {{may have been a}} conscious decision. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC threads appear to fit some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless set-screws require fluted Bristol keys, which are not commonly available in Great Britain.|$|R
50|$|Spark plugs are {{specified}} by <b>size,</b> either <b>thread</b> or nut (often {{referred to as}} Euro), sealing type (taper or crush washer), and spark gap. Common <b>thread</b> (nut) <b>sizes</b> in Europe are 10 mm (16 mm), 14 mm (21 mm; sometimes, 16 mm), and 18 mm (24 mm, sometimes, 21 mm). In the United States, common <b>thread</b> (nut) <b>sizes</b> are 10mm (16mm), 12mm (14mm, 16mm or 17.5mm), 14mm (16mm, 20.63mm) and 18mm (20.63mm).|$|R
5000|$|AN sizes {{range from}} -2 (dash two) to -32 in {{irregular}} steps, {{with each step}} equating to the OD (outside diameter) of the tubing in 1/16" [...] increments. Therefore, a -8 AN size would be equal to 1/2" [...] OD tube (8 × 1/16 = 1/2). However, this system does not specify the ID (inside diameter) of the tubing because the tube wall can vary in thickness. Each AN size also uses its own standard <b>thread</b> <b>size.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Usually, {{one side}} has a fixed type stepped threading, {{and the other}} side is {{threaded}} for a standard freewheel. Occasionally you may find double sided fixed hubs with stepped threading on both sides, but these are rare and only a few companies offer them. The fixed side has a stepped down diameter thread to accept a lockring. The larger diameter thread on the fixed side accepts a standard threaded cog, and uses the same <b>size</b> <b>threads</b> as the freewheel side of the hub. The most common standard I.S.O. <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> is 1.375" [...] x 24 tpi (threads per inch), but there are other less common older sizes (British 1.370" [...] x 24 tpi, French 34.7 x 1 mm, Italian 35 mm x 24 tpi).|$|R
2500|$|Today engine lathes and CNC lathes are the {{commonly}} used machines for single-point threading. On CNC machines, {{the process is}} quick and easy (relative to manual control) due to the machine's ability to constantly track {{the relationship of the}} tool position and spindle position (called [...] "spindle synchronization"). CNC software includes [...] "canned cycles", that is, preprogrammed subroutines, that obviate the manual programming of a single-point threading cycle. Parameters are entered (e.g., <b>thread</b> <b>size,</b> tool offset, length of thread), and the machine does the rest.|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} {{model was}} the Diax Ia for interchangeable lenses, with 3 different viewfinders in the top, each {{in a different}} color: blue for 35mm lenses, yellow for 85 or 90mm lenses and neutral for 45 or 50 mm lenses. The Diax II, Diax IIa and Diaxette models were rangefinder cameras. The b models were like the a models, but with a rapid film advance lever. The Diax system also included 10 lens types covering 6 focal lengths with a common filter <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> of 40.5mm.|$|R
50|$|Some lampshades {{or light}} fittings, {{especially}} in glass, typically terminate in a finial which also serves to affix the shade to the lamp or fixture. Finials are twisted onto the lamp harp. Typically the finial is externally decorative whilst hiding an internal screw thread. There are several standard <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> which are used.|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} of standards in industry and commerce became highly important {{with the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution and the need for high-precision machine tools and interchangeable parts.

40|$|Modern {{computer}} systems {{are based on}} a wide variety of software servers, such as web servers, application servers, database servers, and mail servers. The typical software architecture of such servers includes a set of processes or threads that serve requests submitted to the server. Requests that arrive at the server and find all threads busy, are placed in a queue. Threads that are busy executing requests compete for hardware resources (e. g., processors and I/O devices) at the machine where the software server runs. It is important to be able to model software servers in a way that takes into account both software contention—waiting for threads—and hardware contention—waiting for processors and I/O devices. This paper presents analytical models for a wide range of multithreaded software server architectures: a) single class (i. e., all requests have similar demands) with unlimited <b>thread</b> queue <b>size,</b> b) single class with limited <b>thread</b> queue <b>size,</b> c) multiclass with unlimited <b>thread</b> queue <b>size,</b> and d) multiclass with limited queue size. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the use of the models. ...|$|R
50|$|A lamp harp is the {{component}} of a lamp to which the lamp shade is attached. It typically comes in two separate parts, a saddle which is fastened under the lamp socket, and the harp itself which consist of a lightweight frame attached to the saddle at its lower end and extending upwards to a point above the bulb. At {{the top of the}} harp is a threaded rod. The shade's internal frame (known as a spider) mounts on this rod and is secured in place by a lamp finial. Common materials for harps include brass and nickel. The most common <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> is 1/4-27.|$|R
50|$|Threaded Stud - A {{threaded}} stud is a fastener {{consisting of a}} shank portion which is driven into the base material (and is therefore not visible after fastening) and a threaded portion (which remains visible after the fastening). An object is then attached to the threaded portion with a nut. The most common <b>thread</b> <b>sizes</b> are 1/4-20, and 3/8-16.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} Presta valve has {{an external}} thread. An adapter can be fitted onto this external thread {{to permit the}} Presta valve {{to be connected to}} a pump with a Schrader chuck. The same adapter, because of a coincidence of <b>thread</b> <b>sizes,</b> may be able to convert a Schrader pump into one that can connect to flexible adapters of either kind.|$|E

Once again, there are slight variations in the tooling. Although the basic taper dimensions are the same, there are differences are in the flanges, draw-in <b>thread</b> <b>sizes,</b> and pull studs; the international versions use metric sizes.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a feature}} called [...] "Enhancement Diversification" [...] was {{introduced}} in Issue 6 to impose sharply diminished returns {{on the effectiveness of}} Enhancements in order to encourage players to use more than one type of enhancement to fully balance the power, the community reacted negatively, claiming that it was effectively a global nerf. They also complained that after defensive powers had been changed in recent major patches, the Enhancement Diversification feature would force them to completely change their play tactics. The response by players to the announcement on the official forums eventually exceeded the <b>thread</b> <b>size</b> allowed by software, forcing a second thread to be started.|$|R
30|$|The {{computing}} speed {{evaluation of}} the MV adaptive beamforming algorithm implementation comprised (a) the giga floating-point operations per second (GFLOPS), (b) the output image frame rate of the algorithm implementation, and (c) the computational speedup of the embedded GPU implementation over its ARM processor counterpart. The algorithm computing speed evaluation was conducted on Jetson TX 1 heterogeneous embedded development board. The evaluation test cases included various M and L combinations. While doing the evaluation tests, the value of M was first determined, which was chosen as 16, 32, 64, and 128, respectively. Then, the value of L was chosen from 1 to M/ 2. Therefore, there were 8 M and L combinations when M is 16, 16 M and L combinations when M is 32, 32 M and L combinations when M is 64, and 64 M and L combinations when M is 128. In the experiments, {{as the number of}} image pixels, 127 × 1000 pixels for one image, did not change during the tests, the number of the GPU compute blocks were not changed in the experiments. But the number of the GPU compute threads, a.k.a. GPU compute <b>thread</b> block <b>size,</b> was varying during the experiments. The algorithm computing speed of various GPU compute <b>thread</b> block <b>size</b> was tested so as to find the value of the GPU compute <b>thread</b> block <b>size</b> in the best practices. The GPU compute <b>thread</b> block <b>size</b> test cases covered the numbers from 32 to 1024 which were multiples of 32.|$|R
