40|$|How {{alternative}} chromatin-based regulatory {{states can}} be made stable and heritable {{in order to provide}} robust epigenetic memory is poorly understood. Here, we develop a stochastic model of <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>system</b> in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that incorporates cooperative binding of the repressive SIR complex and anti-silencing histone modifications, in addition to positive feedback in Sir 2 recruitment. The model was able to reproduce key features of SIR regulation of an HM locus, including heritable bistability, dependence on the silencer elements, and sensitivity to SIR dosage. We found that antisilencing methylation of H 3 K 79 by Dot 1 was not needed to generate these features, but acted to reduce spreading of SIR binding, consistent with its proposed role in containment of silencing. In contrast, cooperative inter-nucleosome interactions mediated by the SIR complex were critical for concentrating SIR binding around the silencers in the absence of barriers, and for providing bistability in SIR binding. SIR-SIR interactions magnify the cooperativity in the Sir 2 -histone deacetylation positive feedback reaction and complete a double-negative feedback circuit involving antisilencing modifications. Thus, our modelling underscores the potential importance of cooperative interactions between nucleosome-bound complexes both in the SIR system and in other chromatin-based complexes in epigenetic regulation.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and analyze}} a minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast, built upon known biomolecular interactions in the system. Doing so, we identify the epigenetic marks {{essential for the}} bistability of epigenetic states. The model explicitly incorporates two key chromatin marks, namely H 4 K 16 acetylation and H 3 K 79 methylation, and explores whether the presence of multiple marks lead to a qualitatively different systems behavior. We find that having both modifications {{is important for the}} robustness of epigenetic silencing. Besides the silenced and transcriptionally active fate of chromatin, our model leads to a novel state with bivalent (i. e., both active and silencing) marks under certain perturbations (knock-out mutations, inhibition or enhancement of enzymatic activity). The bivalent state appears under several perturbations and is shown to result in patchy silencing. We also show that the titration effect, owing to a limited supply of silencing proteins, can result in counter-intuitive responses. The design principles of <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>system</b> is systematically investigated and disparate experimental observations are assessed within a single theoretical framework. Specifically, we discuss the behavior of Sir protein recruitment, spreading and stability of silenced regions in commonly-studied mutants (e. g., sas 2 [Formula: see text], dot 1 [Formula: see text]) illuminating the controversial role of Dot 1 in the systems biology of yeast silencing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA barrier for {{horizontal}} {{gene transfer}} is high gene expression, which is metabolically expensive. Silencing of horizontally-acquired {{genes in the}} bacterium Escherichia coli {{is caused by the}} global transcriptional repressor H-NS. The activity of H-NS is enhanced or diminished by other proteins including its homologue StpA, and Hha and YdgT. The interconnections of H-NS with these regulators and their role in silencing gene expression in E. coli are not well understood on a genomic scale. In this study, we use transcriptome sequencing to show that there is a bi-layered gene silencing system - involving the homologous H-NS and StpA - operating on horizontally-acquired genes among others. We show that H-NS-repressed genes belong to two types, termed ``epistatic'' and ``unilateral''. In the absence of H-NS, the expression of ``epistatically controlled genes'' is repressed by StpA, whereas that of ``unilaterally controlled genes'' is not. Epistatic genes show a higher tendency to be non-essential and recently acquired, when compared to unilateral genes. Epistatic genes reach much higher expression levels than unilateral genes in the absence of <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, epistatic genes contain more high affinity H-NS binding motifs than unilateral genes. Therefore, both the DNA binding sites of H-NS as well as the function of StpA as a backup system might be selected for silencing highly transcribable genes...|$|E

40|$|In plants, RNA {{silencing}} (RNA interference) is {{an efficient}} antiviral system, and therefore successful virus infection requires suppression of silencing. Although many viral silencing suppressors have been identified, the molecular basis of silencing suppression is poorly understood. It is proposed that various suppressors inhibit RNA silencing by targeting different steps. However, as double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) play key roles in silencing, it was speculated that dsRNA binding {{might be a}} general silencing suppression strategy. Indeed, it was shown that the related aureusvirus P 14 and tombusvirus P 19 suppressors are dsRNA-binding proteins. Interestingly, P 14 is a size-independent dsRNA-binding protein, while P 19 binds only 21 -nucleotide ds-sRNAs (small dsRNAs having 2 -nucleotide 3 ′ overhangs), the specificity determinant of <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> <b>system.</b> Much evidence supports the idea that P 19 inhibits silencing by sequestering silencing-generated viral ds-sRNAs. In this study we wanted {{to test the hypothesis}} that dsRNA binding is a general silencing suppression strategy. Here we show that many plant viral silencing suppressors bind dsRNAs. Beet yellows virus Peanut P 21, clump virus P 15, Barley stripe mosaic virus γB, and Tobacco etch virus HC-Pro, like P 19, bind ds-sRNAs size-selectively, while Turnip crinkle virus CP is a size-independent dsRNA-binding protein, which binds long dsRNAs as well as ds-sRNAs. We propose that size-selective ds-sRNA-binding suppressors inhibit silencing by sequestering viral ds-sRNAs, whereas size-independent dsRNA-binding suppressors inactivate silencing by sequestering long dsRNA precursors of viral sRNAs and/or by binding ds-sRNAs.

40|$|RNA {{silencing}} is a conserved eukaryotic gene {{regulatory system}} in which sequence specificity is determined by small RNAs.

Transfer of a hairpin-expressing vector carrying fragments of the DsRed gene allowed efficient silencing of DsRed expression.

40|$|CpG islands (CGIs) are {{associated}} with most mammalian gene promoters. A subset of CGIs act as polycomb response elements (PREs) and are recognized by <b>the</b> polycomb <b>silencing</b> <b>systems</b> to regulate expression of genes involved in early development. How CGIs function mechanistically as nucleation sites for polycomb repressive complexes remains unknown. Here we discover that KDM 2 B (FBXL 10) specifically recognizes non-methylated DNA in CGIs and recruits the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC 1). This contributes to histone H 2 A lysine 119 ubiquitylation (H 2 AK 119 ub 1) and gene repression. Unexpectedly, we also find that CGIs are occupied by low levels of PRC 1 throughout the genome, suggesting that the KDM 2 B-PRC 1 complex may sample CGI-associated genes for susceptibility to polycomb-mediated silencing. These observations demonstrate an unexpected and direct link between recognition of CGIs by KDM 2 B and targeting of the polycomb repressive system.

40|$|A tetracycline-controlled transrepressor protein {{has been}} {{engineered}} to silence transcriptional activities of eukaryotic promoters that are stably {{integrated into the}} chromatin of human cells. By fusing the KRAB domain of human Kox 1 to the Tet repressor derived from Tn 10 of Escherichia coli, a tetracycline-controlled hybrid protein (TetR-KRAB) was generated and constitutively expressed in HeLa cells. The TetR-KRAB protein binds to tet operator (tetO) sequences in the absence {{but not in the}} presence of tetracycline. When TetR-KRAB bound to tetO sequences upstream of the immediate-early promoter-enhancer of human cytomegalovirus (CMV), the expression of a CMV-driven luciferase reporter construct (ptetO 7 -CMV-L) was repressed in transient transfection experiments. This silencing was found to operate on different promoters and from tetO sequences placed more than 3 kb from the transcriptional start site. We constructed a stable, doubly transfected cell line (TIS- 10) carrying a chromosomally integrated ptetO 7 -CMV-L reporter construct and expressing the TetR-KRAB protein. Upon addition of tetracycline, luciferase expression was induced more than 50 -fold above the baseline level, with half-maximal induction by 2 days. Furthermore, a protein of around 110 kDa was found to coimmunoprecipitate with the TetR-KRAB fusion protein. This protein might play a role as an adaptor protein mediating <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> exerted by <b>the</b> TetR-KRAB protein. <b>The</b> TetR-KRAB <b>silencing</b> <b>system</b> should be useful as a genetic switch for regulating the expression of chromosomally integrated heterologous and endogenous genes present in mammalian genomes...|$|R

Here, we explored the interplay between GMPS and USP 7 further and assessed their role in hormone-regulated gene expression. Genetic analysis established a strong cooperation between GMPS and USP 7, which is counteracted by the histone H 2 B ubiquitin ligase BRE 1. Loss of either GMPS or USP 7 led to increased levels of histone H 2 Bub in mutant animals.

In plants, a class of exogenous small RNAs (sRNAs) originating from the infecting virus called virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) are predominantly responsible for RNA silencing-mediated antiviral immunity. Nowadays, the process of vsiRNA formation and the role of vsiRNAs in plant viral defense have been revealed through deep sequencing of sRNAs and diverse genetic analysis. The biogenesis of vsiRNAs is analogous to that of endogenous sRNAs, which require diverse essential components including DICER-LIKE (DCL), ARGONAUTE (AGO), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR) proteins. vsiRNAs trigger antiviral defense through post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of viral RNA, and they hijack <b>the</b> host RNA <b>silencing</b> <b>system</b> to target complementary host transcripts.

As a proof of concept we induced <b>the</b> <b>silencing</b> of CH 42, a magnesium chelatase subunit, using our amiRNA platform. Expression of CH 42 in transgenic L. minor fronds was significantly reduced, which resulted in reduction of chlorophyll pigmentation. The techniques presented here will enable tackling future challenges in the biology and biotechnology of Lemnaceae...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{the project}} was to {{establish}} knock down of mRNA in human mesenchymal stem cells. Since these cells are difficult to transfect, a viral approach is needed to achieve sufficient expression of e. g. shRNA in a high percentage of cells to allow for an efficient silencing of corresponding mRNAs. For this purpose for every gene product of interest, a number of shRNA clones have to be tested to detect an individual shRNA with sufficient efficacy. Lentiviral systems for shRNA approaches have recently become available. The principal advantage of the lentiviral system is that it allows gene silencing in nondividing cells and therefore expands the usefulness of <b>the</b> RNAi-based gene <b>silencing</b> <b>system.</b> Lentivirus-delivered shRNAs are capable of specific, highly stable and functional silencing of gene expression in a variety of cell types. Since the viral transfection of MSCs is a time consuming process that involves transfection of 293 FT cells plus transduction of target cells, for this thesis the following approach was chosen: genes of interest were checked for expression in 293 FT cells by RT-PCR. These gene products can be silenced in 293 FT cells simply by transfection of shRNA clones and efficacy was subsequently tested by RT-PCR. Beyond this thesis then the project can proceed with effective clones to transduce primary MSCs with individual shRNA clones identified as effective silencing tool in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|While {{fraught with}} ambiguities, support for greater public {{participation}} in environmental policy making {{is experiencing a}} renaissance amongst sections of government and academia, particularly {{within the field of}} land-use planning. There is concern within this cohort that <b>the</b> planning <b>system</b> <b>silences</b> public voices through its current mechanisms for community involvement. Proponents of participation often presuppose that more public participation will produce both 'better' decisions and environmental benefits, but to date research has focused on the front-end, or 'processes', of participation rather than the 'products' that result. While procedural aspects of public participation are important it is imperative that critical consideration is also given to what emerges from the participation that is being exalted. This paper addresses this concern by focusing on the products of a public participation exercise conducted in Luton, South-east England in order to consider what it is that 'silence knows'. environmental values, public participation, land-use planning, Luton...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe gene {{expression}} state of exponentially growing Escherichia coli cells is manifested by high expression of essential and growth-associated genes and {{low levels of}} stress-related and horizontally acquired genes. An important player in maintaining this home-ostasis is <b>the</b> H-NS-StpA gene <b>silencing</b> <b>system.</b> A Δhns-stpA deletion mutant results in high expression of otherwise-silent horizontally acquired genes, many located in the terminus-half of the chromosome, and an indirect downregulation of many highly expressed genes. The Δhns-stpA double mutant displays slow growth. Using laboratory evolution we address the evolutionary strategies that E. coli would adopt to redress this {{gene expression}} imbalance. We show that two global gene regulatory mutations––(i) point mutations inactivating the stress-responsive sigma factor RpoS or 38 and (ii) an amplification of ∼ 40 % of the chromosome centred around the origin of replication––converge in partially reversing the global gene expression imbalance caused by Δhns-stpA. Transcriptome data of these mutants further show a three-way link amongst the global gene regulatory networks of H-NS and 38, as well as chromosome architecture. Increasing gene expression around the terminus of replication results in a decrease in the expression of genes around the origin and vice versa; this appears to be a persistent phenomenon observed as an association across ∼ 300 publicly-available gene expression data sets for E. coli. These global suppressor effects are transient and rapidly give way to more specific mutations, whose roles in reversing the growth defect of H-NS mutations remain to be understood...|$|R
