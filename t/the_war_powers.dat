25|$|The Supreme Court of the United States ruled TVA to be {{constitutional}} in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288 (1936).

40|$|It is {{the object}} of this {{dissertation}} to consider, as a problem of constitutional law, the nature and scope of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>power</b> of <b>the</b> central government in Australia, Canada, and the United States. <b>The</b> <b>war</b> <b>power</b> is something of an anomaly in federal constitutional law. In exercising it the central government may transcend the federal division of powers which is described in the organic law, and, to an extent which varies with the degree of emergency which is present, may invade an area which is normally reserved to the regional governments. Under conditions of an emergency attributable to <b>war,</b> <b>the</b> central government may also enact war legislation which in normal times would be considered to fall within the prohibition of a constitutional limitation. The constitutional systems of Australia, Canada, and the United States exhibit, sufficient similarities to make a comparative study of <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>power</b> profitable. In each the wax power is entrusted to the central government; in each the regional governments possess other reserved powers which in normal times may not be exercised by the central government; in each the federal judiciary has the last word in interpreting a written constitution. But certain basic dissimilarities dictate the pattern which this comparative study must follow. [Please see pdf. for full abstract. ...|$|R
25|$|The Court held 5–3 that {{citizenship}} {{should be}} allowed. The majority {{stated that the}} oath aliens {{are required to take}} to become citizens does not require them to bear arms in defense of the United States. The court also drew support from <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Act of 1941, enacted by Congress in 1942, which relaxed naturalization requirements for aliens who served in the United States Armed Forces during World War II, including those who served in non-combatant roles. The court explained that serving in a combatant role {{is not the only way}} to uphold and defend the US Constitution and that Girouard should not be denied citizenship because of his religious pacifism.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} of all presidential powers is the command of the United States Armed Forces as its commander-in-chief. While the power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, the president has ultimate responsibility for direction and disposition of the military. The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces (belonging to the Department of Defense) is normally exercised through the Secretary of Defense, with assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Combatant Commands, as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP). The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explains this in Federalist No. 69: Congress, pursuant to <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Resolution, must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual. Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war, critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Libya was {{strongly}} {{affected by the}} Arab Spring. Anti-government protests broke out in Benghazi, Libya, in February 2011, and the Gaddafi government responded with military force. The Obama administration initially resisted calls to take strong action but relented after the Arab League requested Western intervention in Libya. In March 2011, international reaction to Gaddafi's military crackdown culminated in a United Nations resolution to enforce a no fly zone in Libya. Obama authorized U.S. forces to participate in international air attacks on Libyan air defenses using Tomahawk cruise missiles to establish the protective zone. The intervention was led by NATO, but Sweden and three Arab nations also participated in the mission. With coalition support, the rebels took Tripoli the following August. The Libyan campaign culminated in the toppling of the Gaddafi regime, but Libya experienced turmoil {{in the aftermath of}} the civil war. Obama's intervention in Libya provoked criticism from members of Congress and ignited a debate over the applicability of <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Resolution. In September 2012, Islamic militants attacked an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Republicans strongly criticized the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack, and established a select committee in the House to investigate the attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or {{do a good job of}} overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{has several}} powers related {{to war and}} the armed forces. Under <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Clause, only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the {{authority}} to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, World War I and World War II. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against Pancho Villa constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant letters of marque and reprisal. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made {{for the support of}} the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the Federal Tort Claims Act which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the Feres Doctrine.|$|E
500|$|Cheney has {{actively}} promoted {{an expansion of}} the powers of the presidency, saying that the Bush administration's challenges to the laws which Congress passed after Vietnam and Watergate to contain and oversee the executive branch—the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Presidential Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act and <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Resolution—are, in Cheney's words, [...] "a restoration, if you will, of the power and authority of the president".|$|E

500|$|Minton's central {{judicial}} {{philosophy was}} to ascertain and uphold the original intent of legislation. He continued {{to take a}} broad view of governmental powers, demonstrated in his dissenting opinion {{in the case of}} Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, which ruled unconstitutional President Truman's wartime seizure of several steel mills to avert a workers' strike. Of all the cases in which Minton was involved, he disagreed most with the Youngstown decision and [...] "went into a tirade" [...] during the conference where the decision was made. He argued that there [...] "could be no vacant spot in power when the security of the nation is at stake." [...] Despite his strong protest, he could not influence the Court to permit the president to seize the plants without congressional approval. Minton joined with Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Stanley Forman Reed in the dissenting opinion that the President had the authority through <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>powers</b> clause of the constitution.|$|E
500|$|As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's {{shift in}} favor of {{military}} intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Resolution and the State Department's legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration). Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called [...] "convening power" [...] to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime. The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state, and {{the wisdom of the}} intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.|$|E
500|$|Supporting Roosevelt's {{provision}} {{of aid to}} Allied Powers during World War II, Barkley sponsored the Lend-Lease Act in the Senate. In November 1943, he helped draft the Connally–Fulbright Resolution {{for the creation of}} an international peace-keeping body {{at the end of the}} war, an idea he had favored since Woodrow Wilson's support of the League of Nations. Supreme Court Justice and fellow Kentuckian Louis Brandeis influenced Barkley to adopt Zionism; during and after the war, Barkley advocated creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and introduced a 1943 resolution demanding that the Nazis to be punished for persecuting Jews. U.S. entry into the war diverted Roosevelt's attention away from domestic affairs. Vice President Wallace, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, Democratic House Floor Leader John William McCormack, and Barkley – the president's [...] "Big Four" [...] – helped develop and pass the administration's legislative agenda. Barkley regularly met with the chairmen of the Senate's standing committees, forming a sort of legislative cabinet. With their support, he secured passage of <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Act and the Emergency Price Control Act. He also advocated passage of a measure to outlaw poll taxes, but the bill was defeated.|$|E

500|$|On 1 July 1973, {{however, the}} U.S. Congress passed {{legislation}} {{that all but}} prohibited any direct or indirect U.S. combat activities over or in Laos, Cambodia, and both Vietnams. On 7 November the legislative branch overrode Nixon's veto of <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>Powers</b> Act. During 1972–1973, South Vietnam had received $2.2billion in U.S. assistance. In 1973–1974, that figure was slashed to $965million, a more than 50 percent reduction. Nixon's growing political difficulties (especially the Watergate scandal) and the increasing antagonism between the legislative and executive branches over Vietnam policies, did little to dampen South Vietnamese expectations. Some among the Saigon leadership were more realistic in their appraisal. According to Vietnamese Air Force General Dong Van Khuyen: [...] "Our leaders continued to believe in U.S. air intervention even after the U.S. Congress had expressly forbidden it...They deluded themselves." [...] The shock of reduced aid was compounded on 9 August, when Richard Nixon, the guarantor of South Vietnamese independence, {{was forced to resign}} from office. In October 1973, the Arab oil embargo began, and the resulting oil shock of 1973-74 caused a massive bout of inflation that largely destroyed the South Vietnamese economy with a spokesman for Thiệu admitting in a TV interview that the government was being [...] "overwhelmed" [...] by the inflation. One consequence of the inflation was the South Vietnamese government had increasing difficulty in paying its soldiers.|$|E
