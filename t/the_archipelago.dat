5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on <b>the</b> <b>archipelago.</b> Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, which accounts for about 10% of <b>the</b> <b>archipelago.</b> Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>archipelago</b> {{features}} an Arctic climate, although with significantly higher temperatures than other areas {{at the same}} latitude. The flora {{take advantage of the}} long period of midnight sun to compensate for the polar night. Svalbard is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also features polar bears, reindeer, the Arctic fox, and certain marine mammals. Seven national parks and twenty-three nature reserves cover two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>archipelago,</b> protecting the largely untouched, yet fragile, natural environment. Approximately 60% of <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> is covered with glaciers, and the islands feature many mountains and fjords.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian {{victory against}} Sweden in 1743, the Swedes {{established}} {{a commission to}} identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses. In 1747, the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed to be improved and expanded, and that Sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy. Augustin Ehrensvärd (1710–72), an artillery officer, was {{the driving force behind}} these changes. The committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas. In 1756, Sweden established <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> fleet with the official name arméns flotta ("fleet of the army") under the command of the army department, Krigskollegium, with Ehrensvärd as supreme commander. For two decades, the struggle for power between the Hats and the Caps, the dominant political factions at the time, and rivalries between army and navy brought about changes to <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> fleet. The parliamentary victory of the Hats in the Riksdag in 1769–70 and the coup d'ètat by King Gustav III in 1772 secured <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> fleet's status as an independent branch of the army. Starting in 1770, <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> fleet merged with the Finnish Squadron (Finska eskadern) based at Sveaborg. In 1777, it incorporated the Swedish Squadron (Svenska eskadern), the galley fleet based at Stockholm. The Swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional, independent organization. <b>The</b> <b>archipelago</b> fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of King Gustav III, who had established himself as an absolute monarch in the 1772 coup.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> between 28December and 1January, before grazing <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected <b>the</b> <b>archipelago,</b> Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Tropical Storm Beryl {{produced}} {{heavy rainfall}} and gusty winds on the Cape Verde island of Sal.

5|$|The English claimed {{sovereignty}} {{based on}} the false claim that Svalbard was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553, that James I had annexed it in 1614 {{and that it was}} the English who had started whaling. The Netherlands stated that whaling could not be the basis for claiming sovereignty. The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark–Norway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming <b>the</b> <b>archipelago</b> a free zone under mare liberum.
