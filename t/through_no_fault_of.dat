His view is that, among equally deserving people, it is bad, because unfair, for some to be worse off than others <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> their own. But, among unequally deserving people, it is not bad, because not unfair, for someone less deserving to be worse off than someone more deserving, even if the former is worse off <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> her own. [...] To illustrate, egalitarians need not object if criminal John is worse off than law-abiding Mary, even if John craftily avoided capture and is worse off only because, <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> his own, a falling limb injured him. In that case the effects of luck need not trouble egalitarians because they do not undermine comparative fairness.|$|R

The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no authority to pay thousands of the state’s employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some “essential,” and sending the rest home.

25|$|In King Henry III's long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny {{continued}} in use until 1247. By then, however, <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the moneyers' {{there was a}} problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus giving people no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.|$|E

In the local elections, Labour finished third place behind the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats; Labour lost control of the four councils it had held prior to the election. The vote was widely considered to be a reaction to the expenses scandal; the share of the votes for all the major parties fell; Labour was down 1%, the Conservative share was down 5%.

Nelson's comments were echoed by Dominic Sandbrook in the Daily Mail, who felt the programme portrayed its participants sympathetically: [...] "The real scandal of Benefits Street, in fact, is what it tells us about a welfare system that abandons thousands of people – <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> their own – to a life without hope or ambition, effectively turning them into an underclass, dependent on the charity of the State." [...] Charlie Brooker also felt the programme had been [...] "broadly sympathetic" [...] to those it portrays.

40|$|Abstract Discrimination against {{persons with}} disabilities the world over {{in the realm of}} {{employment}} has been a real problem especially in developing countries such as Ghana, where there are no enough government incentives to help cushion the bad effects of unemployment and redundancy on the disabled. Negative perceptions suggesting that disability means incapability are rife and thus prevents the disabled from getting a job or rendering those who have jobs and became disabled <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> theirs' redundant. The disabled in Ghana, thus, can only make ends meet by resorting to begging on the streets, or engaging in some vocations. The few of them who are in employment face problems such as infrastructural deficiencies like the absence of adaptive aides to help them move around easily, for instance, the absence of elevators in storey buildings. Those in some vocations on their own suffer financial problems and hence cannot expand their ventures to the levels that can help them cater for their needs. Most of them are very poor and dependent on family and friends for survival. Laws made to safeguard their rights are not enforced. Ghana is not only a party to the ratification of the UN Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled, they have a Persons with Disability Act (Act 715 of 2006), but the situation is no better. This research aimed at exploring the difficulties faced by the disabled people in Ghana in terms of getting a job. Interview was set and qualitative method of study is applied to elicit authentic information from the informants who are graduates, vocational trained and illiterates, but are jobless. The study took place in Accra the capital of Ghana. Among other questions, the research found out how the disabled feels without a job {{and whether or not they}} would like to be employed. Twelve disabled (9 males and 3 females) were interviewed for this study. Informants chosen were the blind and physically challenged. All informants, but one wanted to work but they revealed "barriers" that prevents them from achieving that aim. Among some of the barriers were non-enforcement of existing laws that safeguard rights of the disabled; stereotyping and discrimination against {{persons with disabilities}}; and lack of capital to start businesses. Stemming the tides, it is expected of the government and various stakeholders to sensitize the population on the rights and capabilities of the disabled so as to reduce or eliminate the discrimination against them, as well as provide financial support and credit to those who wanted to start their own businesses. The findings confirm the Brown (1997) theory of well-beings and quality of life. The informants think or feel that lack of awareness and understanding of the appropriate laws, incentives and cultural rigidity are major sources of problem. If such barriers are removed they are going to enjoy a better life...|$|R

However, the Act also made the first clear distinction between the [...] "professional beggar" [...] and those unemployed <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> their own. Early in her reign, Elizabeth I also passed laws directly aimed at providing relief for the poor.

Those who “of his or their forward willful mind shall obstinately refuse to give weekly to the relief of the poor according to his or their abilities” could be bound over to justices of the peace and fined £10. Additionally, the 1572 Vagabonds Act further enabled Justices of the Peace to survey and register the impotent poor, determine how much money was required for their relief, then assess parish residents weekly for the appropriate amount. Her 1575 Poor Act required towns to create “a competent stock of wool, hemp, flax, iron and other stuff” for the poor to work on and houses of correction for those who refused to work where recalcitrant or careless workers {{could be forced to}} work and punished accordingly.|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{elements}} that have traditionally supported state level normative self-organization, most notably territory, are being actively undermined by rising sea levels, flooding, desertification, amongst other climate change effects. As more and more states come to be redefined as “disappearing”, that is, states losing their territories to the natural environment <b>through</b> <b>no</b> specific <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> their own, a question arises as to how displaced communities will be assisted in their desire (and right) to continue to practice principles of self-determination and self-government? What {{is clear is that}} the international community can no longer continue with the fiction of a unified or unchanging model of the liberal democratic state. Instead, alternative ontological models of sovereign community are required, as is a re-imagining of how statehood might be re-constituted in the future in response to deepening ecological problems. The international community must now begin to address the immanent nature of threats posed to disappearing states and consider how a model of statehood that does not privilege territory as a fixed component of state identity could be operationalized. This paper considers how a democratic reform of statehood might proceed and resettlement agreements for displaced communities determined. The transition to an era of peaceful sovereign relations under deteriorating global climate conditions and growing natural resource scarcity, it argues, will require a significant extension of established traditions of democratic compromise, human rights solidarity and cosmopolitan justice...|$|R

An enduring mark against him is the fact that, although <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> his own, he never proved himself in the Argentine Primera División as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the Albiceleste shirt—he does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displays—have in the past led to the false perception that he felt Catalan rather than truly Argentine.

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given {{time to get back}} into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, but this was a knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a partial copy of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E

People are quite rightly angry.“Credibility and confidence need to be restored. This will not be achieved by promoting existing management further up the chain.“A clean break is needed. The people who got the bank into the mess are not the people to get the bank out of the mess.”Mr Desmond said the bank's directors were obviously seriously out of touch with market perception and the sentiments of shareholders, accountholders and the market generally if they thought otherwise. [...] "Therefore he must have been responsible for fatal errors of judgment, including advancing loans to developers on the strength of overstated land values and insufficient security.He said he had nothing personal against Mr Boucher but perception was important if public confidence and the external reputation of the Irish banking system were to be restored".|$|R
40|$|South Africa is {{a highly}} distributively unequal country, and its {{inequality}} continues to be largely along racial lines. Such circumstances call for assessment {{from the perspective of}} contemporary theories of distributive justice. Three such theories—Rawlsian justice, utilitarianism, and luck egalitarianism—are described and applied. Rawls' difference principle recommends that the worst off be made as well as they can be, a standard which South Africa clearly falls short of. Utilitarianism recommends the maximization of overall societal well-being, a goal which South Africa again fails to achieve given its severe inequality {{and the fact of the}} diminishing marginal value of money—that a given amount of money tends to produce more utility for a poor person than it does for a rich person. The final theory, luck egalitarianism, aims to make distributions sensitive to individual exercises of responsibility. This view also objects to South Africa's inequality, this time on the basis that the poor are overwhelmingly worse off <b>through</b> <b>no</b> <b>fault</b> or choice <b>of</b> their own. These major theories of distributive justice therefore all propose large-scale redistribution to the benefit of the (predominantly black) poor. Perhaps more surprisingly, all three views also provide support for socio-economic affirmative action, as opposed to South Africa's race-based Black Economic Empowerment...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the recent}} {{philosophical}} literature about distributive justice and equality in the domestic context {{has been dominated by}} a family of theories now often called ‘luck egalitarianism’, according to which it is unfair if some people are worse off than others <b>through</b> <b>no</b> choice or <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> their own. This principle has also found its way into the literature about global justice. This paper explores some difficulties that this principle faces: it is largely insensitive to the causes of global inequality, and it is so demanding that it can only give rise to weak moral claims. I go on to argue that a) understanding justice claims as merely weak claims rests on an implausible and impractical concept of justice, and b) using the global luck egalitarian argument in practical discourse is likely to lead to misunderstanding, and to be counterproductive if the aim is to tackle global inequality. While these considerations do not suffice to make a conclusive case against the luck egalitarian principle, they should be acknowledged by global luck egalitarians – as some similar problems have indeed been by domestic luck egalitarians – and need to be addressed...|$|R
