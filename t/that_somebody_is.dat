5|$|In this episode, flashbacks {{depict the}} story behind Claire's pregnancy. Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child, Claire decides {{to go to an}} {{adoption}} agency out of a belief that she will struggle to raise it alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it. In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors.|$|E
25|$|On {{his first}} day in office as acting chief judge, Sinfield summons the mayor to his office and orders him to raise taxes and cut back on his popular social programmes, {{to make up for}} the {{shortfall}} in the city's budget caused by the expensive mutant township project. When the mayor protests, Sinfield threatens to undermine his re-election campaign if he does not do as he is told. Furious, Maybe decides to assassinate Sinfield, and infects him with deadly fungal spores. When Sinfield unexpectedly survives, Maybe covertly injects him with deadly bacteria, but again Sinfield pulls through. Realising <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> trying to kill him, Sinfield decides he wants the city's best judge to investigate, and puts Dredd in charge of the case, knowing that even though Dredd wants Sinfield to resign, his sense of duty will ensure that he is diligent in finding the assassin. Dredd brings Beeny with him to assist him.|$|E
500|$|The stories {{begin with}} the Big Bang, and then moves to the Paleolithic Age, where it is {{revealed}} that Peter's ancestor invented the wheel. The second story sees another Moses {{as a member of}} the Griffin family during the Bronze Age leading the Israelites to freedom. The family soon discovers that Meg can fit through the vent, so they force Meg through the vent and into the kitchen. Peter uses a loud speaker to contact Meg from the panic room, therefore alerting the burglars to the fact <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> in the kitchen. In order to take the family's mind off Meg being captured, Peter tells the story of Nate Griffin. Nate lived in the small village of Quahogsuana, but was captured by a white version of Cleveland Brown from South Carolina and taken to the United States. He, along with Quagdingo and Joe Mama, prank the ship captain. While sleeping, they push his bed into the ocean. Nate is caught after briefly escaping and forced to work on a plantation. He falls in love with the owner's daughter, Lois's relatives, and together, they bring up a secret family. After being discovered by his lover's father, the couple and their children escape, where Nate sets up the Department of Motor Vehicles to [...] "get back at the white man".|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E
2500|$|Using the Tralfamadorian {{passivity}} of fate, Billy Pilgrim {{learns to}} overlook {{death and the}} shock involved with death. Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He {{is still very much}} alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. [...] When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is [...] "So it goes."Billy Pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term [...] "so it goes" [...] as it relates to death. The ideas behind death, fate, time, and free will are drastically different when compared to those of Christianity.|$|E

6000|$|... "Being a woman,--no. The {{present moment}} is always {{everything}} to me. When that horrid old harridan halloaed out <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> smoking, I thought I should have died. It was very bad just then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why,' replied {{his sister}} {{with an air}} of triumph, 'hasn't there <b>been</b> <b>somebody</b> always coming in and out of this office for {{the last three or four}} weeks; hasn't <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>been</b> left alone in it sometimes--thanks to you; and do you mean to tell me <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> isn't the thief!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then it's Colonel Carrington who {{is running}} the Day Spring mine. I've heard the free prospectors talking about the new Syndicate. They opine there's nothing in it, and <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> {{going to be hard}} hit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Appleby dryly, {{raising his}} voice a trifle, “it is quite likely <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> there. In this country one takes precautions. You, however, have my word that in your case there is no {{necessity}} for apprehension.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{room has}} grown very dark. The door has been softly opened; Vernon and Fanny have entered noiselessly. Fanny remains {{near the door}} hidden by a screen, Vernon has crept forward.

[...] "Lance, {{there is}} more than dollars, or the bread <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> needing, behind what you are doing, and because I loved your mother I know how her {{approval}} would have followed you.

6000|$|... "Just so; but <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> a woman; doubtless {{a pretty}} one, {{probably}} dark. You recognize him, I see.

He has caught sight of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|A little flush {{seemed to}} creep into Alton's bronzed face. [...] "I find I {{can talk to}} you as I never did to any one else," [...] he said. [...] "Well, this valley's waiting to feed a host of people, and teeming with riches <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> wanting, and I feel it's my task {{to do the best}} I can for it.

60|$|As she was {{speaking}} I heard a sort of CLOOP, by which well-known sound I <b>was</b> aware <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> opening a bottle of wine, and Ponto entered, in a huge white neckcloth, and a rather shabby black suit.|$|R
50|$|He {{returned}} to Pakistan the following year, in 2000. His father had just died and his five-year marriage was ending. His ex-wife later {{said he had}} suffered from hearing imaginary voices and sudden bouts of believing <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> choking him.|$|R

6000|$|The {{evidence}} of the gentleman in question was brief and to the point. [...] "I have heard the statement that Gaspard's Trail was not insured, and can't understand it. The witness Niven took out a policy {{three months before the}} fire, and sent in his claim straight off to me. The company declined to meet it until this case was settled. Am I quite certain, or can I offer any explanation? Well, here's our premium receipt foil and record of the policy. Can't suggest any explanation, except <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> lying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be SORRY for me," [...] she said. [...] "That {{only makes}} me see the--the {{difference}} {{between you and}} me. And don't {{pay any attention to}} what these outlaws say about me. They're ignorant. They couldn't understand me. You'll hear that Bland killed men who ran after me. But that's a lie. Bland, like all the other outlaws along this river, is always looking for somebody to kill. He SWEARS not, but I don't believe him. He explains that gunplay gravitates to men who are the real thing--that it is provoked by the four-flushes, the bad men. I don't know. All I know is <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> being killed every other day. He hated Spence before Spence ever saw me." ...|$|E
60|$|And I also {{propose to}} rule out another set of topics from this discussion--simply because if we don't do so we shall have more matter than we can handle {{conveniently}} in the time at our disposal. I propose to leave out all questions of health and physical welfare. There is, as you know, a vast literature now in existence, concerned with the health and welfare of children before and after birth, concerned with infantile life, with social conditions and social work directed {{to the production of}} a vigorous population. I am going to assume here that all that sort of thing is seen to--that it is all right, <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>is</b> doing that, that we need not trouble for the present about any of those things.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{rated the}} album with {{four out of}} five stars.

60|$|Five {{minutes later}} Welch, enjoying a sound beauty-sleep, {{began to be}} possessed of a vague idea <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>was</b> trying to murder him.
