25|$|In Chile, <b>transgenderism</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with homosexuality. In {{the early part of the}} twenty-first century, the legal rights of transgender people in Chile has begun to improve.|$|E
25|$|The Saudi {{government}} views cross-dressing and {{any sort}} of <b>transgenderism</b> as being prohibited under Islamic jurisprudence, and is therefore illegal. Criminal sanctions for cross-dressing {{tend to be the}} same for homosexuality, i.e. torture, whippings, chemical castrations, fines, imprisonment, capital punishment, and, for foreigners, deportation.|$|E
25|$|According to one legend, male {{same-sex}} {{love was}} introduced into Japan by {{the founder of}} the True Word (Shingon) sect of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, Kūkai. Historians however, point that this is probably not true, since Kūkai was an enthusiastic follower of monastic regulations. Some Bodhisattvas change sexes in different incarnations, which causes some to associate this to homosexuality and <b>transgenderism.</b> Guanyin, Avalokiteśvara, and Tara are known to have different gender representations.|$|E
25|$|Many mythologies ascribe {{homosexuality}} and gender variance in humans {{to the action}} of gods or other supernatural interventions. This include myths in which gods teach people about same-sex sexual practices by example, as in Aztec or Hawaiian mythology or myths that explain the cause for <b>transgenderism</b> or homosexuality, such as the story in which Prometheus accidentally creates some people with the wrong genitalia while drunk, or instances of reincarnation or possession by a spirit of the opposite gender in Voodoo.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Pythia Peay first {{argued for}} the {{existence}} of a fourth wave of feminism, combining justice with religious spirituality. According to Jennifer Baumgardner in 2011, a fourth wave, incorporating online resources such as social media, may have begun in 2008, inspired partly by Take Our Daughters to Work Days. This fourth wave in turn has inspired or been associated with: the Doula Project for children's services; post-abortion talk lines; pursuit of reproductive justice; plus-size fashion support; <b>transgenderism</b> support; male feminism; sex work acceptance; and developing media including Feministing, Racialicious, blogs, and Twitter campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, discrimination, {{including}} harassment, {{based on}} real or perceived sexual orientation or HIV/AIDS (and probably transsexuality and possibly <b>transgenderism)</b> is prohibited throughout Canada {{in private and}} public sector employment, housing, services provided {{to the public and}} publicity. All aspects of employment are covered, including benefits for spouses and long-term partners. Examples of services include credit, insurance, government programs, hotels and schools open to the public. Schools open to the public are liable for anti-gay name-calling and bullying by students or staff. LGBT Canadians have been allowed to serve in the military since the Douglas case was settled in 1992.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{themes in}} mythology occur in mythologies and {{religious}} narratives that include stories of romantic affection or sexuality between {{figures of the}} same sex or that feature divine actions that result in changes in gender. These myths have been interpreted as forms of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) expression, and modern conceptions of sexuality and gender have been applied to them. Many mythologies ascribe homosexuality and gender variance in humans to the action of gods or of other supernatural interventions. Thus myths may relate how gods teach people about same-sex sexual practices, or stories may explain a cause for <b>transgenderism</b> or homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|However, most {{educational}} institutions, including {{privately owned}} schools {{open to the}} general public, are public services. They are subject to human rights acts and are strictly required to not discriminate against staff or students based on all the prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS (and transsexuality and <b>transgenderism,</b> see Grounds of prohibited discrimination above). They are strictly liable for harassment, name-calling and bullying of students and staff by staff on these grounds. In addition, {{as a result of}} the Jubran decision, they are liable for most such behaviour by students. They may be liable for anti-gay bullying even if the victim is not gay, nor believed to be (e.g. when a bully knowingly makes a false claim that a girl is a lesbian so that she will be ostracized or bullied by others or pressured to have sex with a boy to prove otherwise).|$|E
500|$|K. Nicole Hladky (2013) {{identifies}} {{four themes}} in the series: process (the various dimensions of transition); intersection (of transgender with race, class, age, nationality, etc.); stigma (borne by transgender people); and prescription, in which the documentary perspective of TransGeneration prefers or endorses [...] "particular views of <b>transgenderism</b> and approaches to transition". Hladky concludes that [...] "though the series does present {{a number of the}} complexities surrounding <b>transgenderism,</b> it nonetheless limits transgender individuals by the prescriptive view of transition it reinforces".|$|E
500|$|Harisu {{has been}} given credit for raising social {{awareness}} of <b>transgenderism</b> in the Republic of Korea, and has said in interviews that she hopes {{to be a role}} model for other trans people. In April 2007, she came to the aid of a Chinese trans woman unable to afford surgery, giving her the financial support needed to complete her transition. Affected by the 2008 suicides of gay actor Kim Ji-hoo and transsexual television personality Jang Chae-won, Harisu opened transgender club [...] "Mix-Trans" [...] in Apgujeong-dong, southern Seoul, in June 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{family of}} Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her {{repeated}} {{use of the}} male gender pronoun [...] "he" [...] in her Oscar acceptance speech. Teena's mother JoAnn Brandon said her child's <b>transgenderism</b> was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse, rather than being an expression of Teena's gendered sense of self. She said, [...] "She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her". Despite the criticism, Kevin Okeefe, writing for Out, defended Swank's acceptance speech; he said, [...] "Swank deserves {{a place in the}} great acceptance speech canon for being bold, not only as an actress, but as an award winner".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tom Devanney and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It was rated TV-14 for intensely suggestive dialogue (D), strong coarse language (L) and intense violence (V). It received generally mixed reviews, in addition to receiving some criticism [...] for its portrayal of <b>transgenderism,</b> including from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and the Parents Television Council. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.22 million homes in its original unedited airing. The episode featured a guest performance by Wally Wingert, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. [...] "Quagmire's Dad" [...] was released on DVD along with ten other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that <b>transgenderism</b> and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their victimisation to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E
2500|$|Myths {{often include}} homosexuality, {{bisexuality}} or <b>transgenderism</b> as symbols for sacred or mythic experiences. Devdutt Pattanaik writes that myths [...] "capture the collective unconsciousness of a people", {{and that this}} means they reflect deep-rooted beliefs ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{threats of}} arrest by Russian {{officials}} if {{she spoke in}} support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and <b>transgenderism</b> among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website: ...|$|E
2500|$|LGBT {{rights in}} Saudi Arabia are unrecognized. Homosexuality is {{frequently}} a taboo subject in Saudi Arabian society and is punished with imprisonment, corporal punishment and capital punishment. <b>Transgenderism</b> is generally associated with homosexuality and doctors are {{banned by the}} Saudi Ministry of Health from giving hormone replacement therapy to transsexual patients. (source needed) ...|$|E
2500|$|The pre-Confucian and pre-Taoist {{tradition}} of China was predominately shamanistic. Male same-sex love {{was believed to}} have originated in the mythical south, thus homosexuality is sometimes still called [...] "Southern wind". From this period, numerous spirits or deities were associated with homosexuality, bisexuality and <b>transgenderism.</b> These include Chou Wang, Lan Caihe, Shan Gu, and Yu the Great, and Gun.|$|E
2500|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) {{persons in}} Saudi Arabia face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents. Both {{male and female}} same-sex sexual activity is illegal. LGBT rights are not recognized {{by the government of}} Saudi Arabia. [...] The Saudi social mores and laws are heavily influenced by Arab tribal customs and ultra-conservative Wahhabi Islam. Homosexuality and <b>transgenderism</b> are widely seen as immoral and indecent activities, and the law punishes acts of [...] homosexuality or cross-dressing with execution, imprisonment, fines, corporal punishment, or whipping/flogging.|$|E
2500|$|NOM {{worked with}} Spain-based {{advocacy}} group CitizenGo {{and several other}} conservative organizations to attack the concept of <b>transgenderism</b> by having activists tour the United States, mainly on the East Coast, in the [...] "Free Speech Bus", a orange bus with an anti-transgender message. The bus has the slogan: “It’s Biology: Boys are boys… and always will be. Girls are Girls… and always will be. You can’t change sex. Respect all.” At one stop in Boston, people tried to block the bus, and at another stop, it was vandalized.|$|E
2500|$|Bioethicist Alice Dreger {{studied the}} {{reactions}} of trans activists and other controversies in her 2015 book Galileo's Middle Finger. She argued that although the science appears correct that eroticism is behind the typology of <b>transgenderism,</b> activists in the trans community preferred the simpler narrative of literally being one sex trapped {{in the body of}} the other. [...] Dreger says, [...] "Autogynephilia is perhaps best understood as a love that would really rather we didn’t speak its name", in reference to the famous expression the love that dare not speak its name formerly used to refer to homosexuality or pederasty.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs warned LGBT {{travellers}} about {{a vaguely}} worded law in Saint Petersburg {{that came into}} effect on March 17, 2012, making it a criminal offence to publicize acts of male or female homosexuality, bisexuality, or <b>transgenderism.</b> The intention {{of the law is}} to protect minors. A Russian travel advisory on the Foreign Affairs website notes that while homosexuality is legal in Russia (it was decriminalized in 1993), LGBT Canadian travellers should avoid [...] "displaying affection in public, as homosexuals can be targets of violence.... Public actions (including dissemination of information, statements, displays or conspicuous behaviour) contradicting or appearing to contradict this law may lead to arrest, prosecution and the imposition of a fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some lwa have {{particular}} {{links with}} magic, ancestor worship or death {{such as the}} Ghedes and Barons. A number of these are further particularly associated with <b>transgenderism</b> or same-sex interactions. These include Ghede Nibo, a spirit caring for those who die young. He is sometimes depicted as an effeminate drag queen and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds, especially transgender or lesbian behaviour in women. Ghede Nibo's parents are Baron Samedi and Maman Brigitte; Baron Samedi {{is the leader of}} the Ghedes and Barons and is depicted as bisexual dandy or occasionally transgender, wearing a top-hat and frock coat along with a women's skirts and shoes. Samedi has a tendency toward [...] "lascivious movements" [...] that cross gender boundaries and also imply a lust for anal sex.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{international}} jurisprudence {{that supports}} {{a reading of}} the word “sex” in the prohibition of sex discrimination to include discrimination against transgender persons. The Hong Kong government has provided public funding for the treatment of <b>transgenderism</b> covering counselling and, for those who proceed further, the provision of gender reassignment surgery. Post-operative transsexual persons can apply to change the gender on their identity cards and passports. However, a person's gender at law is determined by a birth certificate, which cannot be changed. In 2010, in W v Registrar of Marriages, Andrew Cheung J (as the Chief Judge then was) held that the references in the Marriage Ordinance to [...] "man" [...] and [...] "women", properly interpreted, do not cover post-operative transsexual persons. It was further held that the Marriage Ordinance, which deny marriage to transsexual persons, was not inconsistent with the right to marry under the Basic Law or the Bill of Rights. Until W's appeal was allowed at the Court of Final Appeal, it was not possible for a transsexual person to marry someone of the same biological sex under Hong Kong law.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of recorded history and in a multitude of cultures, myths, folklore and sacred texts have incorporated themes of same-sex eroticism and gender identity. Myths often include homosexuality, bisexuality or <b>transgenderism</b> as a symbol for sacred or mythic experiences. Homoeroticism or gender variance in myths have been analysed according to modern conceptions of LGBT identities and behaviours, for example, deities that disguise themselves as, or adopt behaviors traditional to, the opposite gender for a given culture may be called transgender, and beings with no reproductive organs or {{both male and female}} organs may be called androgynous or intersex. Individual myths have been denoted [...] "queer" [...] for rejecting an heteronormative and binary view of gender. The queer interpretations may be based on only indirect evidence, such as an unusually close same-sex friendship or dedication to chastity. These have been criticised for ignoring cultural context or mis-applying modern or Western preconceptions, for example in assuming that celibacy means only avoiding penetration or reproductive sex (hence allowing homoerotic sex), while ignoring the widespread beliefs in the spiritual potency of semen that mandate an avoidance of all sex.|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying …My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls– Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria– have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] The response was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and <b>transgenderism</b> among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E
