25|$|Some websites, such as Reddit, have rules forbidding the posting of {{personal}} information of individuals (also known as doxxing), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs {{of large numbers}} of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting {{of personal}} information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be censored in Facebook screenshots posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with.</b>|$|E

500|$|The film {{generated}} a huge {{reaction in the}} blogosphere. One comment to The Guardian read: [...] "To suggest that people who disagree with you deserve to die is incredibly stupid.

He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't want to cut anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in government, that is a problem for me." [...] On that same theme he said in another interview, [...] "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money that all of a sudden, I'd say, [...] we've done is for naught. So, let's support anybody at all … even if <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> everything that we do." ...|$|E
