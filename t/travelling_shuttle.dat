Mobility Allowance Shuttle Transit is a transportation concept that merges the flexibility of Demand Responsive Transit systems with the low cost operability of fixed-route bus systems. In this paper, we study the service capacity design problem for such a system. We analyze the relationship between service cycle time, and the length and width of the service area under a desired service level constraint. The analysis {{can be used as}} a guide for designing service area parameters. Given that a <b>shuttle</b> <b>travels</b> in a rectilinear pattern and utilizes a non-backtracking nearest-insertion algorithm, we derive closed-form approximate solutions for the service capacity design problem. We show that setting the length of the service area to half the travel speed of the shuttle multiplied by the cycle time is an effective approximation. ...|$|R
40|$|Shuttle {{cars are}} an unusual {{class of vehicle}} {{operated}} in underground coal mines, sometimes {{in close proximity to}} pedestrians and steering errors may have very serious consequences. A directional control–response incompatibility has previously been described in shuttle cars which are controlled using a steering wheel oriented perpendicular to the direction of <b>travel.</b> Some other <b>shuttle</b> car operators are seated perpendicular to the direction of travel and steer the car via a seat mounted joystick. A virtual simulation was utilised to determine whether the steering arrangement in these vehicles maintains directional control–response compatibility. Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to either a condition corresponding to this design (consistent direction), or a condition in which the directional steering response was reversed while driving in-bye (visual field compatible). Significantly less accurate steering performance was exhibited by the consistent direction group during the in-bye trials only. Shuttle cars which provide the joystick steering mechanism described here require operators to accommodate alternating compatible and incompatible directional control–response relationships with each change of car direction...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} risk {{caused by the}} population of Space junk in LEO and especially in SSO, an ecient active debris removal program must be developed. It has {{to take into account}} not only the technical challenges but also the econo-political ones implied by this complex task. This thesis presents three dierent ways to de-orbit the population of rocket bodies in SSO. The rst one, the Picker, implies to send one spacecraft to remove one debris at a time. The second one, the Mothership, has to visit several debris to equip them with autonomous de-orbiting units. The last one, the <b>Shuttle,</b> <b>travel</b> back and forth between high and low orbits to catch the debris and bring them on short-lifetime graveyard orbits. The three scenarios are optimized in terms of number of debris per spacecraft, number of spacecraft per launch vehicle and propulsion system (chemical solid, liquid bi-propellant or electric). They are compared in terms of cost per mass removed. The results shown that the Picker is approximately ten times more ecient than the other ones, with normalized cost as low as 10, 500 [$/kg]. In a second time, the comparison is made between a collaborative global program between the U. S., Russia and Europe and their three separated national program.

40|$|Public {{transport}} contributes {{greatly to}} people’s mobility. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) {{are used to}} provide safer and better transport services to ensure people’s mobility. Digital ecosystems, analogous to natural ecosystems, are self-evolving and self-sustaining. A small scale ITS system that bears {{the characteristics of a}} digital ecosystem was designed and developed in this PhD study. Based on the Internet Engineering Task Force presence model, the system was designed with three discrete but inter-connected components: an on-board device installed on a distributed network of shuttle buses; a central server; and a mobile application that allows users to access the system on the go. Using a combination of different communication protocols (e. g. HTTP, WSDL, SOAP, SSL), the system allows effective communication among the three components and ensures secured communication when needed. Using the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principle, the system software functions are designed to provide a stratum of services to the system, with the central layer of services designed to serve the other Connected Mobility Digital Ecosystem applications. Passengers’ <b>travel</b> patterns, <b>shuttle</b> bus <b>travelling</b> time on road, dwelling time at bus stops, and schedule adherence data was gathered and analysed. A historical data based prediction model was developed using an algorithm based on the historical travel data combined with the real-time bus travelling information. It incorporates variables of realtime bus travel speed, route distance, historical travelling time, and historical dwelling time at each stop before reaching a particular bus stop. The prediction accuracy of travel time by using historical data based model and linear regression model is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) method in comparison with the prescribed bus timetable. The evaluation results show clearly that the model based predictions of travel time from both linear regression and historical data based models show a significant advantage over using timetable. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy from the historical data based model consistently outperformed that using linear regression model in all the conditions, because the historical data based model has taken into account the dwelling time to improve the prediction accuracy while the linear regression model does not include the effect of dwelling time in its model. The system collects data from its distributed sensors (i. e. network of shuttle buses equipped with the on-board devices, and the passengers who use the app through smartphones), performs data analysis and predicts bus arrival time. While passengers utilise the system to better plan their travel, the system identifies the repeatable passenger usage patterns, which allows the dynamic scheduling of buses that optimises throughput. This process continues and forms an on-going digital ecosystem cycle, which allows better system performance and management. This system behaviour embodies the CMDE’s self-evolving, self-sustaining and mutual benefit design philosophy. An extensive evaluation study was conducted to assess the system’s usability and usefulness. Results showed that passengers highly value the system, with high ratings on the information sufficiency, accuracy, usefulness, relevance, and ease of use. The app’s main function, prediction of bus arrival time, attracted the most use. Most passengers believed the app provided them with the benefits of being able to plan ahead for a trip and elimination of the likelihood to miss a bus...|$|R
