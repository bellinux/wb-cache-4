5|$|Autocannons {{are often}} found in aircraft, where they {{replaced}} machine guns and as shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, as <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> greater destructive power than machine guns.|$|E
5|$|Stews {{are basic}} fare {{for every day}} family cooking and are always served with {{vermicelli}} rice or plain rice. They are popular because <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> {{a wide range of}} nutrients from the meat, the vegetables and the rice. The extra liquid is also essential in such dry climate. Stews are also economically beneficial, as <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> relatively small amount of meat into feeding large families, especially within the poorer population.|$|E
5|$|Albury offers similar {{facilities}} to Wagga Wagga {{to the far}} south of New South Wales and northern Victoria. The three largest centres in population in the region after Wagga Wagga and Albury are Griffith, Leeton and Deniliquin and <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> advanced services to the outlying farming regions.|$|E

5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|Death {{has always}} been a {{critical}} moment for those bereaved, and consequently death is surrounded by taboo-like rules. Family life has to be reorganized and in order to master such transitions, people use rites.

5|$|Elsewhere, the kabuki theater {{tradition}} in Japan employs ritualized representations of {{violence on the}} stage. While kabuki is technically theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> at least an area of overlap between theater and dance.|$|E
5|$|Highway401 {{features}} 19service centres {{controlled by}} the MTO. These service centres were announced in 1961 following public outcry over the lack of rest stops. <b>They</b> <b>provide</b> a place to park, rest, eat and refuel 24 hours a day.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} for scholars {{to piece together the}} exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions.

5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills. The fruit is handpicked, mostly {{during the rainy season}} between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans <b>they</b> <b>provide.</b>|$|E

5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} {{inside the}} rim of the bell, squeeze water out of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E
5|$|Polyptychs were {{produced}} by the more accomplished masters. <b>They</b> <b>provide</b> greater scope for variation, and {{a greater number of}} possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels. The Ghent Altarpiece, completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.|$|E
5|$|Ship – Ships {{can be used}} as {{hospital}} ships, mostly {{operated by}} national military services, although some ships are operated by charities.

5|$|Such {{recycling}} of revenue from permit auctions could offset {{a significant proportion}} of the economy-wide social costs of a cap and trade scheme. As well as reducing tax distortions, Kerr and Cramton (1998) note that auctions of units are more flexible in distributing costs, <b>they</b> <b>provide</b> more incentives for innovation, and they lessen the political arguments over the allocation of economic rents.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts are {{economically}} {{important in}} different ways. They are captured for food around the world. A {{small number of}} species such as herring, cod, pollock, anchovy, tuna and mackerel provide people with {{millions of tons of}} food per year, while many other species are fished in smaller amounts. <b>They</b> <b>provide</b> {{a large proportion of the}} fish caught for sport.

5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212.
