Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at <b>the</b> <b>university</b> <b>level,</b> but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery.
