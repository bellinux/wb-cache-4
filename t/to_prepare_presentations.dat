40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{qualitative}} study which examines the {{challenges faced by}} six international undergraduate students in their socialisation of oral academic discourse in a Malaysian public university. Data were collected employing interviews. Students ’ presentations were also collected. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed verbatim and qualitative content analysis {{was employed to examine}} the challenges faced by international undergraduate students in their socialisation of oral academic discourse. The results reveal that the major difficulties international undergraduate students face in their oral academic discourse socialisation are related to linguistic knowledge, presentation skills and content-related difficulties. Linguistic difficulties constrain students to express complex concepts and ideas while engaged in oral presentations. Difficulties related to presentation skills are associated with how to prepare PowerPoint slides and how to organise the content of the presentations. This study also reveals that content difficulties {{may be related to the}} specific topics the students are asked <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>presentations</b> on. In this study I argue that understanding the challenges faced by undergraduate international students in their oral academic discourse socialisation can be one of the essential steps to help them overcome the challenges they face...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGiving presentations {{is not an}} easy task. Especially when {{it comes}} to giving in a foreign language, the {{challenge}} multiplies. At Japanese Associate Degree Program (JAD Program), Malaysian students are trained to give technical presentations in Japanese. The students who are majoring Mechanical Engineering are required to give experiment result presentations in their sophomore year. At the beginning of the course, the majority of the students are reluctant to prepare for the presentations. This is a natural reaction, because most of the students have been studied Japanese for only two years at the time when this course starts and are not familiar with giving technical presentations in the language. Even in other languages, they have not been trained to give technical presentations. A number of techniques are used to improve the students’ presentation skills. The course is designed to motivate the students to improve their presentations through practice-discussion-modification cycle. By introducing presentation practice sessions, the students’ grades for presentations increase up to 7. 7 %. At the end of the course, 65 % of the students find the presentation practice sessions are very useful. Most of the students are able to give presentations with confidence. Moreover, 54 % of them say giving technical presentations is enjoyable. Considering the students are not willing <b>to</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>presentations</b> {{at the beginning of this}} course, the majority of the students largely change their attitude towards technical presentations by taking this course. In this paper, the techniques used at JAD program to improve the students’ presentation skills are discussed. The stress is on how to motivate the students to practice presentations so that they can improve their presentations by themselves. These techniques can be applied to improve technical presentation skills in any languages...|$|E

40|$|There are {{numerous}} technical reviews that occur throughout the systems engineering process life cycle.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the situation of}} oral English in schools in Japan today, including textbooks and exams, theoretical and practical approaches that encourage more speaking opportunities, and recommendations for particular activities. Oral activities can be located {{on a scale from}} tightly controlled to spontaneous talking: from the repetition of other people’s words and sentences, <b>to</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>presentations</b> in public speaking, oral reports and debates, to the generation of impromptu, novel utterances. It is the potential and immediate benefit of increased practice to develop ability in this final stage, the expression of one own’s thoughts and words in unrehearsed speech, which this essay particularly addresses. As Maurer (1997) says, “Improvisation can be considered the fifth skill [...] the skill which follows reading, listening, speaking, and writing. In many ways, it is the most important because it is the real test of whether students can use what they have learned without being told exactly what to do or say. ” When studying English as a Foreign Language in Japanese classrooms, the role of speaking is invariably relegated {{to the bottom of the}} list of skills to learn, quite inverse to its order in learning a first language.
