40|$|The {{validity}} {{of different types}} of models for crack-dislocation interactions and their effect on fracture is discussed. The brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in precracked silicon and sapphire can be described by a two-stage dynamic model based on dislocation motion to and around the crack tip. In silicon and germanium, where the stress-temperature-velocity relations for the test materials are known, the model allows accurate prediction of the transition <b>temperature.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations of the dynamic development of near-crack tip dislocation arrays then allows prediction of the shape of the BDT given the pre-existing dislocation arrangements in the crystals; we have performed experiments to confirm these predictions.

These predictions were then checked by measuring dislocation velocities and were found to be a close fit to experiment. We have also studied the brittle-ductile transition in semibrittle materials (b. c. c. metals and oxides), where pre-existing dislocations appear to control the transition behaviour via slow, stable crack growth.

A Monte Carlo algorithm was then used to find sets of two-body interaction energies for which these structures lay at an energy minimum. Good fits between calculated and experimental diffraction patterns were found in all cases. The fitted interaction energies were mainly positive, implying that most two-body interactions were repulsive between sites of like occupancy. Magnitudes were significant out to third-nearest neighboring interstitial sites. The magnitudes tended to be largest nearx= 0. 5.

40|$|Background/Objective: Radiofrequency (RF) {{catheter}} ablation is a {{minimally invasive}} medical procedure used to thermally destroy the focus of cardiac arrhythmias. Novel optical techniques are now being integrated into RF catheters in order to detect the changes in tissue properties. Loss of birefringence due to fiber denaturation at around 70 ºC is related to changes in accumulated phase retardation and can be measured by polarization-sensitive optical coherence reflectometry (PS-OCR). Since irreversible thermal lesions are produced when the tissue reaches 50 ºC, {{our goal was to}} seek the mathematical relationship between both isotherms. Materials and Methods: A two-dimensional model based on a coupled electric-thermal problem was built and solved using the finite element method. The model consisted of cardiac tissue, blood and a non-irrigated electrode with a sensor embedded in its tip to maintain a specific target electrode <b>temperature.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations were conducted by varying the tissue characteristics. Lesion depth was estimated by the 50 ºC isotherm, while the denaturation time (TD) was taken as the time at which the 70 ºC isotherm reached a depth of 0. 75 mm (which corresponds to the optical depth reached by PS-OCR technology). Results: A strong correlation (R 2 > 0. 83) was found between TD and lesion depth and an even stronger correlation (R 2 > 0. 96) was found between TD and the time required to achieve a specific lesion depth. For instance, the ablation time required to ensure a minimum lesion depth of 3 mm was 1. 33 × TD + 3. 93. Conclusions: The computer results confirmed the strong relationship between denaturation time and lesion depth and suggest that measuring denaturation time by PS-OCR could 3 provide information on the ablation time required to reach a specific lesion depth.

40|$|Knowledge of {{site-specific}} {{conditions is}} essential for the development of an architectural design that responds to the local environment. However, while meteorological data are recorded by the weather service in stations that are assumed to be representative of the surrounding region, generally no account is made of changes in local conditions caused by urban development - though these may be substantial. Micro-climate in city streets can be predicted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with fine spatial resolution. However, CFD requires extremely detailed input, involves long computation times and is thus limited to simulating short periods. The aim of this project was to create a model capable of simulating weather conditions for extended periods, with simplified inputs and less detailed, yet accurate, outputs. The CAT (Canyon Air <b>Temperature)</b> <b>computer</b> model predicts site- pecific air temperature in a city street based on data from a rural reference station. In addition to a rudimentary description of the two sites, it requires only inputs measured at standard weather stations, yet is capable of predicting accurately the evolution of air temperature in all weather conditions for extended periods. It simulates the effects of urban geometry on radiant exchange; the effect of moisture availability on latent heat flux; energy stored in the ground and in building surfaces; air flow in the street based on wind above roof height; and the sensible heat flux from individual surfaces and from the street canyon as a whole. A monitoring program was carried out in Adelaide, South Australia, in which weather conditions were recorded continuously at two streets and at a reference location outside the city centre for nearly a year. In addition to providing data required to calibrate and to validate the CAT model, the measurements provided evidence of a substantial nocturnal heat island in the city, of up to 8. 6 °C. The weather records also demonstrate the existence of an urban cool island during the daytime of up to 3. 8 °C, the intensity of which is related to the diurnal temperature range. The CAT model may be used to generate realistic, site- pecific temperature inputs for building thermal simulation software, required to produce more accurate modelling of energy use. It may also be used to evaluate the effect on micro-climatic conditions of proposed development at new urban locations. Thesis (Ph. D.)

These regions also exhibit high ion <b>temperatures.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations of the temperature structure of the plasmasphere under conditions of electron heating in the equatorial region suggest that such heating produces large gradients in both the electron and ion temperature in the ionosphere. These gradients result {{in an increase in}} the pressure of the electrons, which increases the polarization field, and of the ions, which results in large plasma scale heights at low altitudes and increased ion densities at high altitudes.

At higher altitudes the O(2 +) -O(+) collisions inhibit the upward flow of O(2 +) resulting in a high-altitude peak in the O(2 +) density.

The damage that it can cause to the retina is called photochemical or blue-light retinal injury. For the retinal injury assessment of the photochemical and aphakic retinal hazards in the wavelength range of 300 - 700 nm, use of effective spectral radiance limits (W. m- 2. sr- 1) seems to be slightly perplexing for ophthalmologists. However, in this study, the temperature (OC) that can emit the same effective spectral radiance limit was detected using a computer code; this method could help prevent blue-light retinal injury. Materials and Methods The limits proposed by International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection for blue-light induced photochemical and aphakic eye hazards were expressed in terms of <b>temperature</b> by a <b>computer</b> code for 13 Planckian sources that produce the same radiance. The calculated <b>temperature</b> by the <b>computer</b> code, here known as threshold temperature, is the maximum source temperature that for a specified viewing distance and source diameter does not cause the exposure at the receptor position to exceed the exposure limit. Results In terms of threshold temperature, the exposure limits for aphakia or infant retinal injury are much lower than retinal photochemical damage. For light sources with more effective radiances, these differences reach 800 K.
