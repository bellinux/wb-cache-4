5|$|In her book, Folklore, Horror Stories, and <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man {{to ancient}} folklore about fairies. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives {{that are often}} difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man calls the woods and wild places his home and kidnaps children.|$|E
5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2014, a minor moral panic {{occurred}} over <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man after readers of his fiction {{were connected to}} several violent acts, particularly a near-fatal stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Waukesha, Wisconsin.|$|E

50|$|This salamander's {{range is}} on Breckenridge Mountain {{located on the}} western slopes of the {{southern}} Sierra Nevada, east of the lower Kern River canyon in Kern County. Much of what was formerly known as <b>the</b> relictual <b>slender</b> salamander has now gone over to <b>the</b> Greenhorn Mountains <b>slender</b> salamander (Batrachoseps altasierrae), <b>the</b> Fairview <b>slender</b> salamander (Batrachoseps bramei) and <b>the</b> Kern Plateau <b>slender</b> salamander (Batrachoseps robustus).|$|R
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users {{to tap into the}} ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises (genus Nycticebus) are strepsirrhine {{primates}} and {{are related}} to other living lorisoids, such as slender lorises (Loris), pottos (Perodicticus), false pottos (Pseudopotto), angwantibos (Arctocebus), and galagos (family Galagidae), and to the lemurs of Madagascar. They are most closely related to <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> lorises of South Asia, followed by the angwantibos, pottos and false pottos of Central and West Africa. Lorisoids {{are thought to have}} evolved in Africa, where most living species occur; later, one group may have migrated to Asia and evolved into <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> and slow lorises of today.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing the}} story, an {{unidentified}} woman from Cincinnati, Ohio, told a WLWT TV reporter in June 2014 that her 13-year-old daughter had attacked {{her with a}} knife, and had written macabre fiction, some involving <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man, who the mother said motivated the attack.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man to be {{an authentic}} form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Tolbert also accepts <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, <b>the</b> <b>Slender</b> Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii, {{commonly}} known as <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> parasol or graceful parasol, is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Lepiotaceae. The species is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it fruits singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} eucalypt woodlands, parks, and roadsides. It is a tall mushroom up to roughly , with a broad cap covered with distinctive rings of dark brown scales. The whitish gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and free from attachment to <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> stipe, which has a loose ring on its upper half, and a bulbous base. The edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, but closely related parasol mushrooms are edible and some are very sought after.|$|E

50|$|Males measure 22 - 26 mm {{and females}} 26 - 32 mm in snout-vent length. <b>The</b> body {{relatively}} <b>slender.</b> <b>The</b> head is long with rounded snout. The tympanum is distinct. <b>The</b> limbs are <b>slender.</b> <b>The</b> fingers are without webbing whereas the toes are webbed. The back is reddish brown in colour and without markings. There are reddish dorso-lateral glandular ridges. The flanks are blackish, {{with a sharp}} border towards the dorsum.|$|R

5|$|The diet of <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> smooth-hound is diverse, but {{dominated}} by small, benthic bony fishes and decapod crustaceans. It exhibits a specialized form of aplacental viviparity with oophagy: the females produce a single capsule in each uterus that contains 30–80 ova, of which one ovum develops into an embryo that consumes {{the rest of}} the ova and stores the yolk material in its external yolk sac. The growing embryo is mainly sustained by this yolk sac during gestation, though it may be additionally supplied with histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. The typical litter size is two pups, one per uterus. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> smooth-hound as Least Concern; it is taken as fishery bycatch but not in great numbers, and furthermore large portions of its range see minimal fishing activity.|$|E
5|$|Unlike galagos, {{which have}} longer legs than arms, slow lorises have {{arms and legs}} of nearly equal length. Their intermembral index (ratio of arm to leg length) averages 89, {{indicating}} that their forelimbs are slightly shorter than their hind limbs. As with <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> lorises, their arms are slightly longer than their body, but the extremities of slow lorises are more stout.|$|E
5|$|Adjectives {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E

5|$|Harmless {{to humans}} and of no {{economic}} value, <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> smooth-hound is occasionally caught incidentally in bottom trawls and on bottom longlines. Much of its northern range lies in little-fished waters, {{and thus the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. However, this shark's very low fecundity would render it susceptible to population depletion should fishing pressure increase in the future.|$|E
5|$|In 1959, a study {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Hawker Siddeley and Bristol for preliminary designs based on <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> delta concept, which developed as the HSA.1000 and Bristol 198. Armstrong Whitworth also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached Lockheed, and after the creation of British Aircraft Corporation in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with Boeing, General Dynamics, Douglas Aircraft and Sud Aviation.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October 1956 the Ministry of Supply asked Morgan {{to form a}} {{new study}} group, the Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee (STAC), with the {{explicit}} goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, {{the decision was made to}} fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> delta, a contract that eventually produced the Handley Page HP.115. This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as 69mph, about ⅓ that of the F-104 Starfighter.|$|E

5|$|The {{zebra shark}} feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. <b>The</b> <b>slender,</b> flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The foramen magnum (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark has an elongated body, {{over half of}} which is comprised by <b>the</b> <b>slender</b> caudal peduncle. The snout is short and rounded, with the nares placed almost at the tip along {{with a pair of}} tiny barbels; there are grooves running from the nares to the mouth. There are 2635 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2132 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small, with broad bases and triangular cusps. The eyes are oval in shape and elevated, with a large spiracle below each. The five pairs of gill slits are small, with the fourth and fifth very close together.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the state}} of California does not {{specifically}} protect <b>the</b> California <b>slender</b> salamander, several groups have proposed it. For example, in 1992, the University of California Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources published the 16-page booklet, Wildlife among the Oaks, which describes and illustrates the interdependence of native oak trees and California wildlife such as <b>the</b> California <b>slender</b> salamander. [...] In 1999, BayWood Artists, a group professional Marin County landscape painters, attempted to save <b>the</b> California <b>slender</b> salamander habitat in the Oakwood Valley portion of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area by putting on an art show and sale to benefit the Oakwood Valley Restoration Project.|$|R
