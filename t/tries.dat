5|$|Smith {{played a}} total of 32 Tests for Scotland, and scored 24 <b>tries,</b> which still gives him {{a share of the}} Scottish record with Tony Stanger. Smith's record for {{international}} <b>tries</b> was not beaten until 1987 when it was overtaken by Australian David Campese. Remarkably, Smith's first 17 <b>tries</b> were scored in only 14 Test matches. His 24 career <b>tries</b> in the Five Nations – now Six Nations – remained a record until first equalled and then surpassed by Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll in 2011. Smith spent much of his playing career playing in the backline with GPS Macpherson; 21 of Smith's 24 Scotland <b>tries</b> were scored outside the three-quarter Macpherson. When Smith scored four <b>tries</b> against France in 1925, Macpherson contributed to all those scores.|$|E
5|$|Besides Lindsay, {{six players}} have scored {{more than three}} <b>tries</b> in a Championship match; of these Ian Smith is the only player to achieve the feat twice. He scored four <b>tries</b> in {{successive}} matches during the 1925 Five Nations Championship. Wales' Jehoida Hodges normally played as a forward, but after an injury to winger Tom Pearson during a match against England, Hodges {{was moved to the}} wing. Despite playing out of position, he scored a hat-trick in a 21–5 victory for Wales. As of 2017, the only forwards to score a Championship hat-trick while actually playing in the forwards are Michel Crauste; he scored three <b>tries</b> for France in their 13–0 victory over England in 1962 and CJ Stander; he scored three <b>tries</b> for Ireland in a 63–10 win over Italy in 2017.|$|E

Anthony Minichiello became the highest try scorer in the Roosters history when he scored his 105th try against the Newcastle at Ausgrid Stadium in June 2011. 'Mini' finally retired after the 2014 season, and ended his career with 139 <b>tries.</b> He is also the first fullback in 70 years to win the Grand Final (2013), whilst captaining the Club.

40|$|Trypsinogen (<b>TRY),</b> the {{precursor}} to the serine protease trypsin, {{is found in the}} pancreas and mediates digestive proteolysis in the small intestine. Differential display of cDNAs expressed by human colorectal tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal colonic mucosa identified an isoform of <b>TRY</b> (<b>TRY</b> 2) up-regulated in colorectal cancers. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from a series of 28 malignant colon tumors and corresponding normal mucosa showed that <b>TRY</b> transcripts were up-regulated 2 - to 33 -fold in 29 % of tumors. Further, <b>TRY</b> mRNA was expressed in 6 colorectal cancer cell lines, with highest levels detected in the metastatic tumor lines SW 620 and HT 29. Immunostaining for <b>TRY</b> protein expression showed intense immunoreactivity in the supranuclear cytoplasm of colon tumors in 16 % of tissue specimens. To evaluate the relative contributions of 2 isoforms of <b>TRY,</b> <b>TRY</b> 1 and <b>TRY</b> 2, to total <b>TRY</b> mRNA expression, a semiquantitative multiplex RT-PCR assay was developed. <b>TRY</b> 2 mRNA was detected in all 6 colorectal tumor cell lines, whereas <b>TRY</b> 1 mRNA was expressed only in the metastatic tumor lines, showing that the high levels of <b>TRY</b> expression in the metastatic tumor lines are likely due to up-regulation of <b>TRY</b> 1. Evaluation of <b>TRY</b> 1 and <b>TRY</b> 2 mRNA expression by multiplex RT-PCR in a series of 20 colon tumor tissues representative of the range of tumor progression showed that <b>TRY</b> 2 mRNA was expressed much more commonly than <b>TRY</b> 1 mRNA in normal mucosa (26 % vs. 6 %) as well as in primary tumor tissues (65 % vs. 15 %). These data demonstrate that <b>TRY</b> 2 is the dominant <b>TRY</b> in colon tissue and suggest that up-regulation of <b>TRY</b> 1 expression in colon tumors may be associated with a metastatic phenotype.
