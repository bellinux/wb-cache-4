25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>When</b> I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E
500|$|In a {{separate}} publishing from The New York Times, David Browne criticized the song's overuse of processed vocals, writing that: [...] "As heard on her current single 'We R Who We R' {{from her new}} mini-album, 'Cannibal,' Kesha has a thin, often computer-manipulated voice that recalls ’80s new-wave pop acts. It’s often hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> her singing voice ends and the Vocoder processing kicks in." [...] Rolling Stone gave the song {{two and a half}} stars out of five, referring to the combination of Kesha's style and the song's themes as an [...] "awkward fit". However, Rolling Stone later placed the song at number 50 in its Best 50 Singles of 2010 list.|$|E
500|$|Work on DJ Hero 2 started {{some months}} after the first game was completed, as the {{development}} team had endured heavy working hours to meet the release deadline. [...] FreeStyleGames' creative director Jamie Jackson said that DJ Hero 2 took about seven months to complete. While {{they were able to}} easily build on the existing framework for DJ Hero, FreeStyleGames wanted {{to do more than just}} include new mixes, and sought to include additional features such as the Battle Mixes into the game. [...] Many of the game's new features are a result of feedback from players, including the game's social modes and improvements in the game's interface to provide a cleaner look and instantaneous visual feedback to the player. The team also worked at improving the game's graphics; the appearance of DJ Heros graffiti-based menus gave the impression of being a hip-hop game, but FreeStyleGames wanted to distance DJ Hero 2 from that. They also wanted to clean up the gameplay's interface, providing better feedback to the player and making it easily <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> they were winning or losing. [...] While DJ Hero 2 does not use Kinect or PlayStation Move motion-sensing technology, Jackson had not ruled them out for a future iteration of the game.|$|E

500|$|While Retro Studios {{tried to}} create [...] "the {{ultimate}} first-person experience" [...] with the Metroid Prime series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story Other M intended <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>When</b> Sakamoto met Team Ninja, he said his intent was a game with [...] "controls as simple as those of a NES game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, {{and tried to make}} the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion. The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed. Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more [...] "comfortable" [...] for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D [...] " [...] have the same distractions when you want to give them story sequences". While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that [...] "made those games unique" [...] were implemented into Other M, such as the [...] "immersive sight" [...] of the first-person mode. When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden, Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, there will still be the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games. Sakamoto said that Other Ms story progression was {{in the same manner as}} Metroid Fusion, and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is [...] "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group working toward a common goal".|$|E

Also, in the episode [...] "When Janet Met Johnny", Donna sings the line [...] "Don't stay in watching EastEnders." [...] Also, in an episode of Pulling, the character of Donna asks [...] "Who am I going <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> I have {{an idea for a}} new plotline in EastEnders?".|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Martini, a New York book dealer, {{found that}} the Gutenberg Bible held by the library of the General Theological Seminary in New York had a [...] forged leaf, {{carrying}} part of Chapter 14, all of Chapter 15, and part of Chapter 16 of the Book of Ezekiel. It was impossible <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> the leaf had been inserted into the volume. It was replaced {{in the fall of}} 1953, when a patron donated the corresponding leaf from a defective Gutenberg second volume which was being broken up and sold in parts. This made it [...] "the first imperfect Gutenberg Bible ever restored to completeness." [...] In 1978, this copy was sold for $2.2 million USD to the Württembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart, Germany.|$|E

2500|$|She {{has written}} {{critical}} studies of Dame Iris Murdoch, {{who was a}} friend, mentor and a significant influence on her own writing. In those books and other works, Byatt alludes to, and builds upon, themes from Romantic and Victorian literature. She conceives of fantasy as an alternative to, rather than an escape from, everyday life, and {{it is often difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> the fantastic in her work actually represents the eruption of psychosis. [...] "In my work", she notes [...] "writing is always so dangerous. It's very destructive. People who write books are destroyers." [...] Possession (1990) parallels the emerging relationship of two contemporary academics with the past of two (fictional) nineteenth century poets whom they are researching. It won the Booker Prize in 1990 and was made into a film in 2002. Byatt's novella Morpho Eugenia, included in Angels & Insects (1992), was turned into the successful film with this same title (1995), nominated for an Academy Award. Her novel [...] The Children's Book was shortlisted for the 2009 Man Booker Prize and won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.|$|E
2500|$|The often intense {{emotions}} {{experienced by}} people with BPD can {{make it difficult for}} them to control the focus of their attention—to concentrate. In addition, people with BPD may tend to dissociate, which can be thought of as an intense form of [...] "zoning out". Dissociation often occurs in response to experiencing a painful event (or experiencing something that triggers the memory of a painful event). It involves the mind automatically redirecting attention away from that event, presumably to protect against experiencing intense emotion and unwanted behavioral impulses that such emotion might otherwise trigger. Although the mind's habit of blocking out intense painful emotions may provide temporary relief, it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking or blunting the experience of ordinary emotions, reducing the access of people with BPD to the information contained in those emotions, which helps guide effective decision-making in daily life. Sometimes, it is possible for another person <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> someone with BPD is dissociating, because their facial or vocal expressions may become flat or expressionless, or they may appear to be distracted; at other times, dissociation may be barely noticeable.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Durham" [...] {{comes from}} the Celtic element [...] "dun", {{signifying}} a hill fort, and the Old Norse [...] "holme", which translates to island. The Lord Bishop of Durham takes a Latin variation of the city's name in his official signature, which is signed [...] "N. Dunelm". Some attribute the city's name to {{the legend of the}} Dun Cow and the milkmaid who in legend guided the monks of Lindisfarne carrying the body of Saint Cuthbert {{to the site of the}} present city in 995 AD. Dun Cow Lane is said to be one of the first streets in Durham, being directly to the east of Durham Cathedral and taking its name from a depiction of the city's founding etched in masonry on the south side of the cathedral. The city has been known by a number of names throughout history. The original Nordic Dun Holm was changed to Duresme by the Normans and was known in Latin as Dunelm. The modern form Durham came into use later in the city's history. The north eastern historian Robert Surtees chronicled the name changes in his History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham but states that it is an [...] "impossibility" [...] <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> the city's modern name came into being.|$|E

2500|$|The {{system uses}} a loop between the rails, to send {{instructions}} to the train and so the train can send updates to the control centre. Each side of the loop crosses over approximately every 25m, and each 25m section is subdivided into 4 further sections, effectively creating 160 virtual 'blocks' in every kilometre of track. These crossovers cause a 180 degree phase shift that is detected by the train <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> it has passed over one. The system allows trains {{to get up to}} 50m away from each other while both are moving at very low speeds. The system is capable of bi-directional or [...] "wrong way running", but London Underground has this feature disabled. Thus, a train has to be put into restricted manual to run the wrong way along a track. There are exceptions, such as the sidings north of Wembley Park and West Hampstead, and a small area around Stratford Market Depot where the track becomes [...] "locked out" [...] to any other train but the one given a movement authority. Trains constantly receive speed instructions based on the train's determined position that uses a wheel tachometer between loop crossovers, however they receive definite instructions once they report and have passed over a track loop. S40 does not allow speeds higher than 108km/h, and the 1996 stock had to be upgraded slightly so it could use the new equipment, which includes a Vehicle On Board Computer for the S40 system that must interface with the train's control system.|$|E
