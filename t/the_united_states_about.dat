After seven years of construction and US$47 million more from Packard, totaling US$54 million, Monterey Bay Aquarium opened on October 20, 1984 as the largest public aquarium in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>About</b> 2.4 million people visited the aquarium within the following year.|$|E
5|$|Geisel {{created the}} book in {{response}} to a debate in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>about</b> literacy in early childhood and the ineffectiveness of traditional primers such as those featuring Dick and Jane. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II and who was then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.|$|E

5|$|The major {{producers}} of calcium are China (about 10000 to 12000 tonnes per year), Russia (about 6000 to 8000 tonnes per year), and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> (<b>about</b> 2000 to 4000 tonnes per year). Canada and France are {{also among the}} minor producers. In 2005, about 24000 tonnes of calcium were produced; {{about half of the}} world's extracted calcium is used by the United States, with about 80% of the output used each year. In Russia and China, Davy's method of electrolysis is still used, but is instead applied to molten calcium chloride. Since calcium is less reactive than strontium or barium, the oxide–nitride coating that results in air is stable and lathe machining and other standard metallurgical techniques are suitable for calcium. In the United States and Canada, calcium is instead produced by reducing lime with aluminium metal at high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of the Bayou virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>About</b> 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Oryzomys extends from New Jersey {{in the eastern}} United States through Mexico and Central America south to northwestern Colombia and east to northwestern Venezuela and Curaçao. Species of Oryzomys usually live in wet {{habitats}} such as marshes, streams, and mangroves, but both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are also occasionally encountered in drier habitats. They occur or occurred on many continental-shelf islands and one oceanic island, Jamaica; their adeptness at colonizing islands {{may be caused by}} their close association with water and frequent occurrence in coastal wetlands. The oldest fossils date to the Rancholabrean of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>about</b> 300,000 years ago; although there have been some earlier North American records, those are not in fact referable to Oryzomys or even Oryzomyini. Oryzomyines likely evolved in South America east of the Andes; the presence of Oryzomys in Central America and other trans-Andean regions is thought {{to be the result of}} one of several independent invasions of this region by oryzomyines. Alternatively, Oryzomys may have evolved from the Pliocene North American Jacobsomys. O.antillarum may have reached Jamaica during the last glacial period while sea levels were low.|$|E
