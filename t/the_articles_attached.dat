This represents a fertile field of discourse which brings into focus issues relating to microbes, people and working practices as well as the concepts of risk and vulnerability. A regular feature of reporting has been the presence of explanations for drug resistance involving repeated random mutations of the microbe to achieve progressively greater resistance and versatility, largely through a Darwinian process which is clever at overcoming human attempts at elimination. More recently a discourse has emerged which foregrounds also the vulnerability of patients who are very young, old or otherwise immunocompromised, or whose own genetic makeup might put them at risk from the microbe. The hospital is decentred as a source of infection, and attention is turned instead to nursing homes and gymnasia as sources of infection in the community. This latter development mitigates the responsibilities of hospitals and statutory healthcare providers and turns the risk back towards the individual as a responsible actor in an ecology of mutation...|$|R

Based on in-depth interviews with 10 matrons in a health care trust in the UK Midlands region, we explore how they construe their working lives and their view of the powers they have to enhance cleanliness and reduce infection. Despite claims in policy documents that modern matrons would have considerable authority, participants felt their control over the environment was limited, and could be accomplished only through reflecting, communicating and liaising. The lack of formal structures of accountability and personal authority meant that participants could be characterised as working in what Courpasson calls a "soft bureaucracy". Moreover, in the light of limited power to command cleanliness, participants described their role in terms of reflexive work upon themselves and their interpersonal environment, involving self-scrutiny of their activity, channelling information, empowering, facilitating and remodelling the emotional environment of care delivery. This aligns with accounts of the self in the workplace from Anthony Giddens and Nikolas Rose where it is seen as a reflexive project. We explore why the project of the self seems to have eclipsed the managerial role as the major focus of matron's work...|$|R

The Inclusive Libraries Initiative has been designed to address these barriers. Since 2003, this project has been fostering the development of inclusive libraries in Northeast Alberta, the second-most-westerly province in Canada. The project is based on the premise that local libraries are ideally positioned to offer access to high-quality computer and online technology, including assistive technology, as well as expertise in their use. Libraries are natural supports that can be developed to increase community capacity, thereby enhancing the inclusion of individuals with disabilities, as well as those in other marginalized groups, in the communities where they live, work, and learn.

A program schema defines a class of programs, {{all of which have}} identical statement structure, but whose functions and predicates may differ. A schema thus defines an entire class of programs according to how its symbols are interpreted. Two schemas are strongly equivalent if they always define the same function from initial states to final states for every interpretation. A subschema of a schema is obtained from a schema by deleting some of its statements. A schema S is liberal if there exists an initial state in the Herbrand domain such that the same term is not generated more than once along any executable path through S. In this paper, we introduce near-liberal schemas, in which this non-repeating condition applies only to terms not having the form g() for a constant function symbol g. Given a schema S that is linear (no function or predicate symbol occurs more than once in S) and a variable v, we compute a set of function and predicate symbols in S which is a subset of those defined by Weiser's slicing algorithm and prove that if for every while predicate q in S and every constant assignment w:=g(); lying in the body of q, no other assignment to w also lies in the body of q, our smaller symbol set defines a correct subschema of S with respect to the final value of v after execution. We also prove that if S is also free (every path through S is executable) and near-liberal, it is decidable which of its subschemas are strongly equivalent to S. For the class of pairs of schemas in which one schema is a subschema of the other, this generalises a recent result in which S was required to be linear, free and liberal.

The poor scaling shown was due to serialized grid connectivity computation and Ethernet bandwidth limits. The scaling of a peer-to-peer communication flow code on an IBM SP- 2 was also shown. The scaling of the code on the switched fabric-linked nodes was good, with a 2. 4 percent loss due to communication of intergrid boundary point information. The code performance on 30 worker nodes was 1. 7 (mu) s/point/iteration, or a factor of three over a Cray C- 90 head. The attached paper, 'Nonlinear Fluid Computations in a Distributed Environment', documents the effect of several computational rate enhancing methods on convergence. For the cases shown, the highest throughput was achieved using boundary updates at each step, with the manager process performing communication tasks only.

Through a phenomenologically-inspired approach, {{the purpose of this}} article is to examine the different ways in which sportspeople experience asthma, a condition that affects 5. 4 million people in the UK. To date, sociological phenomenology has been under-utilised both in relation to health and illness experiences and vis-a-vis sporting embodiment. Drawing on in-depth interview data from non-elite sportspeople (n = 14), all of whom had been diagnosed with asthma, ranging in degree of severity, here we explore asthma sporting embodiment via a threefold asthma identity typology. The findings are communicated through vignettes, assembled from participants’ accounts, in order to highlight the multifaceted and multilayered ‘voices’ of sportspeople with asthma. Transforming data in this way can, we argue, resonate with others – both those with asthma and those without – to give a ‘feel’ for asthma experiences and sporting embodiment. This form of typology may be useful as a heuristic framework to assist healthcare and sports professionals in understanding asthma experiences as lived in everyday life, and potentially in developing more appropriate and effective care regimes for sportspeople in order to improve the quality of that everyday life...|$|R

I go on to show: first that the discourse of power and control underpinned much of the behaviour of senior managers; second, the discourse of territoriality shows that the battle for asserting rights over space is linked to the masculine assertion of power. Finally I argue that masculinities survive and gain predominance, at the expense of other potentially beneficial social practices. Educational Leadership and Managemen...|$|R

40|$|People are {{equipped}} with sophisticated skills to detect, interpret and react to social stimuli in their environment. The exceptional importance {{of being able to}} navigate in social encounters with uncertain meanings and outcomes becomes saliently recognizable in problems of individuals with high functioning autism (HFA) characterized by specific deficits in social communication and interaction. Thus, the studies included into this doctorial thesis investigate the neural processing of social cues in healthy and HFA participants in order to provide a better specification of mechanisms underlying social cognition and to promote a better understanding of autism spectrum disorders. Interestingly, in comparison to verbal communication, the nonverbal communication and the interpretation of animated agents occur phylogenetically and ontogenetically earlier in the human development. Because of this special role of social information that is not transmitted via the semantically defined and syntactically logical language related to a more formal way of thinking, the focus is put on the perception of nonverbal and animated social stimuli and their implications for social psychology. In the present synopsis, five studies are summarized within three topics: 1) duration matters: the neural signature of the social gaze (Study 1); 2) distinct paths to first impressions via verbal and nonverbal information (Studies 2 and 3); and 3) different looks on animacy: mind attribution in high-functioning autism (Studies 4 and 5). The measurement of whole brain neural correlates of cognitive processes was carried out by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
