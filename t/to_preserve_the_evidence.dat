40|$|The main riscks of the {{landscape}} are the overexploitation of the soil and a high physical vulnerability of our country determined by considerable seismic and volcanic activities, and by the peculiar geomorphological and hydrogeological pattern. This risk needs to be mitigated through a careful analysis of the criticity levels in the different geographical areas and by developing strategies based on requirements and operational guidance. In this paper two different procedures for vulnerability analysis are described, designed for completely different landscape areas. The first case concerns the historical center of Sant’Elia Fiumerapido, {{in the province of}} Frosinone, with the objective of analysing the town and its exposure to natural factors of degradation. The second case is the basin of Coreno Ausonio, in the province of Latina, deeply marked by intense mining activities.

Distally linked deltaic successions should also feature distinctive attributes, with great potential <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> stratigraphic <b>evidence</b> of exceptional discharge events. We describe Late Carboniferous deltafront, valley-confined sandstones from the Pennine Basin (UK), originally deposited at paleoequatorial latitudes during final {{assembly of the}} Pangean megacontinent and characterized by giant sedimentary structures with repetitively sigmoidal geometry. Facies traits indicate geologically instantaneous deposition of a large sediment volume from a density current at sustained supercritical-flow conditions, leading to aggradation of cyclic steps, recently identified bedforms developing in high-energy flows and of which {{this is the first}} complete outcrop example. The lack of unconformable erosional surfaces and absence of different associated facies point to a single aggradational event during which the structures attained dimensions comparable to those indicated by seismic data sets from which they are remotely detected on modern seafloors. Cyclic-step formation in a deltaic setting suggests that Pangean megamonsoons could have triggered hydrologic events capable of imprinting sedimentologic signatures on shallow-marine deposits...|$|R

In this study, using an experimental model of progressive chronic neurodegeneration, murine prion disease, we define the temporal dynamics of the generation, maturation and integration of new neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, using dual pulse-chase, multicolour ?-retroviral tracing, transmission electron microscopy and patch-clamp.

Legal frameworks, including the Federal Rules of Evidence, also help companies to identify ways of preserving a chain of evidence with the digital data gathered {{in the aftermath of}} a cyber-attack. It is essential that companies apply these guidelines to increase their resilience to future attacks. However, they provide the least support where they are needed the most. Existing guidelines focus on corporate office-based systems; they cannot be applied to support companies dealing with cyber-attacks on safety-critical infrastructures. This is an important omission. It is impossible to immediately disconnect infected systems where they provide life-critical functions.

40|$|Isotopic abundances of {{short-lived}} radionuclides such as 26 Al {{provide the}} most precise chronometers {{of events in the}} early solar system, provided that they were initially homogeneously distributed. On the other hand, the abundances of the three stable isotopes of oxygen in primitive meteorites show a mass-independent fractionation that survived homogenization in the solar nebula. As as result of this and other cosmochemical evidence, the degree of spatial heterogeneity of isotopes in the solar nebula has long been a puzzle. We show here that based on hydrodynamical models of the mixing and transport of isotopic anomalies formed at, or injected onto, the surface of the solar nebula, initially high levels of isotopic spatial heterogeneity are expected to fall to steady state levels (~ 10 %) low enough to validate the use of 26 Al for chronometry, but high enough <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for mass-independent fractionation of oxygen isotopes. The solution to this puzzle relies on the mixing being accomplished by the chaotic fluid motions in a marginally gravitationally unstable disk, as seems to be required for the formation of gas giant planets and by the inability of alternative physical processes to drive large-scale mixing and transport in the planet-forming midplane of the solar nebula. Such a disk is also capable of large-scale outward transport of the thermally annealed dust grains found in comets, and of driving the shock fronts that appear to be responsible for much of the thermal processing of the components of primitive meteorites, creating a self-consistent picture of the basic physical processes shaping the early solar nebula.

40|$|Cattle {{pastoralism}} is {{an important}} trait of African cultures. Ethnographic studies describe the central role played by domestic cattle within many societies, highlighting its social and ideological value well beyond its mere function as 'walking larder'. Historical depth of this African legacy has been repeatedly assessed in an archaeological perspective, mostly emphasizing a continental vision. Nevertheless, in-depth site-specific studies, with a few exceptions, are lacking. Despite the long tradition of a multi-disciplinary approach {{to the analysis of}} pastoral systems in Africa, rarely do early and middle Holocene archaeological contexts feature in the same area the combination of settlement, ceremonial and rock art features so as to be multi-dimensionally explored: the Messak plateau in the Libyan central Sahara represents an outstanding exception.

This was centred on the frequent deposition in stone monuments of disarticulated animal remains, mostly cattle. Animal burials are known also from other African contexts, but regional extent of the phenomenon, state of preservation of monuments, and associated rock art make the Messak case unique.

40|$|Among {{the rights}} proclaimed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by article 60 of the Second Vatican Council's {{pastoral}} constitution on the Church {{in the modern}} world is the right to culture. Implicit in this right is the duty imposed on <b>the</b> public authority <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> tangible <b>evidences</b> of culture, cultural property. This study aims at exploring the origins and development of the notion of res pretiosa and asks if res pretiosa has become the cultural property of the Church in the 1983 Code of Canon Law. The term cultural property comes from the civil law. It seems first to have appeared in the 1954 Hague Convention and it has become well developed in international law and, more recently, in Anglo-American common law. Chapter 1 traces the development of this law and summarizes the legislation for the preservation of cultural property internationally and in Britain and the United States. Chapter 2 follows the notion res pretiosa from its locus classicus in the 1468 papal bull Ambitiosae back to its cradle in the Roman law of tutor and ward, where it meant "valuable chattels," and then forward through its adoption in canon law. It also looks at its elaboration there, and its codification in the 1917 Code of Canon Law where it has been narrowed to include only chattels valuable for their artistic, historical or intrinsic worth character and the effects of Vatican II on it. Chapter 3 looks at the notion of res pretiosa as found in the 1983 Code, the 1990 Eastern Code and in the suppletive documents, especially those of the Pontifical Commission for the Preservation of the Church's Cultural Heritage. The chapter concludes with a look at that agency and the other agencies of the Roman Curia having care of the Church's cultural heritage. In the conclusion section the author answers the question whether in the 1983 Code res pretiosa has become the cultural property of the Church. He concludes that, while res pretiosa includes cultural property, the term res pretiosa remains broader than the term "cultural property. " He also concludes that it would be desirable for the Supreme Legislator to amend the 1983 Latin Code and 1990 Eastern Code so that the terms res pretiosa might be used identically on both and that term and "cultural property" might become coterminous. He also suggests that the Historic Churches Committees developed by the Bishops of England and Wales and their procedures might usefully be adopted in North America to deal with cases of changes proposed to historic churches...|$|R
40|$|Fibres {{are one of}} {{the most}} common forms of {{evidence}} associated with forensic investigations. The use of adhesive lifters to recover fibres from crime scene samples has long been established as an effective method to recover such items of evidence. Once fibres have been lifted they are transferred to evidence bags for storage, safe transport and <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> chain of <b>evidence.</b> This study shows that when fibres are tape lifted particles of substances present trapped within those fibres are also lifted. Cotton, linen and wool fibres were examined in colours ranging from white to black. Samples of seized ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and amphetamine were supplied by East Sussex Police and by the TICTAC unit at St Georges Hospital Tooting. The Raman spectra obtained showed that it is possible to identify drugs of abuse from particles trapped within fibres without interference from the fibre itself. It was also possible to obtain spectra after fibres were lifted with adhesive tapes without the detection process being compromised. Raman spectra from particles of drugs of abuse within fibres following tape lifting were also recorded through <b>evidence</b> bags. Again <b>the</b> detection process was not compromised. This initial study has shown that fibres have the potential to provide even more evidence than they do currently. Individuals that have had drugs of abuse about their person may have trace amounts of these substances trapped within the fibres of their clothing. This may be of particular importance if drugs have been carried in pockets of a garment. This technique has the advantage of being non destructive, allows for re-testing, requires no sample preparation and also can be performed on samples without removal from <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> bag thus removing any potential risk of contamination. It is important however to remember that when dealing with trace amounts of drugs of abuse the presence of such particles may be due to innocent transfer of such particles. Detection of particles of drugs of abuse on clothing does not necessarily indicate criminal activity in the absence of other evidence...|$|R

The aim of the thesis is to gather all of the available information about the ICT in accounting, to emphasize the impacts of ICT on accounting and following draw the attention to the risks which result from the application of ICT. In order to achieve the aim the qualitative analysis and the search of the accessible information resources are used. Some parts of the thesis are demonstrated on examples. The purpose of single chapters is to discuss, according to the theoretical base defined, subsequently all phases {{of the life cycle}} of accounting documents which are presented as financial statements at the output from the accounting. Special attention is given to accounting evidence. The last part of the thesis has application nature. The use of XML in financial reporting is demonstrated there in the real existing and secured systems based on ICT. According to the analysis made I {{came to the conclusion that}} because of the requirement for the reliability of accounting the internal control system has growing importance. Regardless the technologies used there is need <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> at the level of accounting record during all of its life cycle phases [...] when it is made out or received, when it is transferred, conversed to some other form and archived. I dealt also with another important phase of the life cycle of accounting records [...] with the evidential financial reporting. There I came to conclusion that key phases are following: Firstly, there is need to provide evidential linkage between bookkeeping and the statements assembled. Further it is crucial to assure secured transfer of the statements to the final storage place or publishing location of the statements. Finally it is desirable to consider trustworthy storage place for the statements and also its evidential method of publishing them on the web. It is possible to deduce from the statistics available that information and procedures described in the thesis do not correspond with the actual ordinary practice in the Czech Republic. More likely it can be seen as a sum of the knowledge which can be technically and legally used by the accounting entities. Its wider use can be expected in the following years...|$|E
40|$|In March 2013, {{a former}} head of the civil service in the United Kingdom, Lord Butler of Brockwell declared: I believe that each {{department}} should appoint a historical adviser, not to advise on the historical background to every problem which a department has to manage – no single person could have the expertise to do that – but to put the policy-makers in contact with a source of such expertise. [1] This sparked a cacophony of voices in support. Sir David Cannadine – a prominent English historian currently teaching at Princeton – observed that Most government ministers live very intensely in the present. They often don’t know much about the history of their department when they weren’t in charge of it. They aren’t allowed to see the papers of their predecessors, and live in some historical vacuum. Closer to home, the head of the Department of Defence Dennis Richardson, once a student of the Sydney University historian Neville Meaney, is championing history as part of the training needed by public servants. He has instituted short courses in history for graduates both in his old Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in Defence as a start to rounding out individuals trained in other disciplines. Richardson has done so because he worries that, without at least some understanding of the historical context, these officers {{will not be able to}} formulate views on the matters before them; they will become mere issues managers. Moreover, without knowledge of the historical record, and openness to different interpretations of the facts, public servants and politicians risk taking bad decisions, sometimes, as we saw in Iraq, with fatal consequences. In both the UK and Australia, it is in the foreign affairs and defence portfolios that historical advisers still exist. Elsewhere in the Commonwealth public service, history appears to be an ad hoc affair. Historical perspectives are introduced by individuals who recognise their role or by significant milestones that seem worthy of commemoration. But not even the department responsible for heritage lists history as a discipline that might be desirable in prospective graduate recruits. There are, of course, the National Archives of Australia (NAA), which perform a vital role in records management and in making documents accessible. Moreover, archivists do understand that, to quote the NAA website, “the significance of an individual document lies not only in its content but in its context”. [2] And they do raise awareness of the need <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of how public policy is formulated and implemented. How much easier that might be were there greater promotion of historical ways of thinking across the public service! Two American professors of history, Andrews and Burke, have encapsulated historical thinking into the concepts of “change over time”, “causality”, “context”, “contingency” and “complexity”. [3] These five Cs should be in the kit bag of anyone grappling with public policy. Returning to Butler. He put the view that historical advice would be particularly useful when considering civil service reform, noting that “a lot of what has been proposed in the government’s latest programme for reform was actually done in the 1980 s and 1990 s, when I was head of the civil service”. In Australia too historical perspective is useful for those in the midst of reform frenzy. Take education as an example. Unlike Foreign Affairs, the federal education department has no historical section – if it did it would be hard pressed to define its scope, given the regularity with which the department changes its shape and focus, not to mention its ministers! Some historical memory could help short-circuit the rediscovery of ideas long-since tested and avoid obstacles in implementing new policy. The tertiary education system does have the National Centre for Vocational Education Research (NCVER), where I worked from 2007 to 2012. NCVER’s remit has broadened from vocational education and training (VET) to doing research into all post-compulsory training. NCVER has a clear responsibility: to inform policy and practice in tertiary education and training. Therefore its research is decidedly applied and its publications aim to engage policy makers and practitioners. NCVER does not do much history. Again, it’s usually work driven by individual interest and squeezed into the budget. That said, one recent project commissioned by the then federal departments of innovation and education explicitly sought an historical perspective, which resulted in an excellent essay by Robin Ryan, a prominent player and researcher in VET policy, who trained as an historian. [4] Several factors combined during my time as general manager to push a bit more history-making: Ryan’s essay, my interests and the revamping of VOCED website, a fantastic repository of research about tertiary education and its connections to work and society. Thanks to the drive of the librarians responsible for the site we grasped an opportunity to digitise landmark policy documents and publish these – something Australian Policy Online is now doing with its policy history collection. [5] Ryan’s essay pointed to the waves of reform that mark the history of VET policy. This led us to create timelines to illustrate these waves and identify the major documents associated with the reforms. We did this again when NCVER was engaged to do background work for an expert panel on apprenticeship reform. That exercise resulted in a timeline on apprenticeship policy and an essay by Brian Knight. The Evolution of apprenticeships and traineeships in Australia: an unfinished history[6] exposed the enduring issues the apprenticeship system faces, in particular the necessity of a solid general education as well as technical skill development to be part of an apprentice’s training. It also reminded us of the generally conservative attitude to the system, which only in recent decades has been subject to significant reform. Has this modest foray into history had an impact on public policy? The government did not heed all the advice NCVER offered on the apprenticeship system, in which louder voices – notably, employers and unions [...] than those of researchers of any hue prevail. But behind the scenes there do seem to have been some changes. For example, the types of apprentices being funded have been pared back. [7] As is unfortunately the norm, this policy shift was not accompanied by any articulation of the sources on which it was formulated. It is a great pity for historians that public servants hardly ever use footnotes. Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable to assume that some lessons from history seeped into policy formulation. Another function of Knight’s essay was to prompt a considered response from a past player. This is an important feature of histories of administration, which become a way, either directly through oral histories or by instigating reflections and critique, to get insider views onto the record. While such views may be skewed by time and place, they are important illuminators of how policy evolves. Capturing how policy develops from those once involved may well be becoming even more important in the age of the post-it note, email and fear of Freedom of Information releases. People do visit the history resources NCVER has compiled, as recently revealed in a lively discussion about the history of VET in a LinkedIn forum. The statistical time series are particularly popular. * Historical advice does have a place in public administration. The question remains how this is best provided. The former US Senate Historian Richard Allan Baker did so with a historical minute at the weekly Democratic conference meeting: For the past 12 years, I have greatly enjoyed observing senators in this informal closed-door setting. That experience has offered unsurpassable insights into the Senate’s culture and has helped me to establish a close professional association with some current members. One recently told me that these historical vignettes about key personalities and events from the Senate’s past remind him and his colleagues “that we are not the first ones to serve here and that today’s issues are not as novel as we think they are”. I’m not sure this would be feasible at a Labor caucus meeting, and as resources are most unlikely to stretch to implementing Lord Butler’s recommendation of an advisor in every department, it is worth considering other options. Among these might be: 	Ensuring a core function of maintaining historical documents within departments, with public officials obliged to keep full and accurate records. 	Using historical analysis to consider past approaches to persistent policy issues, either by internal staff historians or by commissioning outsiders. 	Fostering historical ways of thinking in the public service and beyond. Greater engagement with policy makers will depend on historians using their craft to tell stories that matter in the contemporary world of sound-bites and tweets. Even then, history won’t offer the answers but it might provide a short-cut or two and help avoid at least some of the same mistakes being made again.   Photo Credit: betta design via Compfight cc [1] [URL] accessed 27 June 2013 [2] [URL] accessed 27 June 2013 [3] [URL] accessed 3 July 2013 [4] [URL] [5] [URL] [6] [URL] [7] See for example changes to existing worker apprenticeship funding announced in the 2012 - 13 budget [URL]...|$|E

This study involves the {{application of}} Raman spectroscopy for the analysis of drugs of abuse in latent fingerprints for fingerprints that had been treated with powders and also subsequently lifted with adhesive tapes. Samples of seized ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and amphetamine were supplied by East Sussex Police and by the TICTAC unit at St. Georges Hospital Tooting. Contaminated fingerprintswere deposited on clean glass slides. The application of aluminium or iron based powders to contaminated fingerprints did not interfere with theRamanspectra obtained for the contaminants. Contaminated fingerprints developed with powders and then lifted with lifting tapes were also examined. The combination of these two techniques did not interfere with the successful analysis. The lifting processwas repeated using hinge lifters. As the hinge lifters exhibited strong Raman bands the spectroscopic analysiswas more complex and {{an increase in the number}} of exposures to the detector allowed for improved clarification. Spectral subtraction was performed to remove peaks due to the hinge lifters using OMNIC software. Raman spectra of developed and lifted fingerprints recorded through evidence bags were obtained and it was found that the detection process was not compromised. Although the application of powders did not interfere with the detection process the time taken to locate the contaminant was increased due to the physical presence of more material within the fingerprint...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of powders to fingerprints {{has long been}} established as an effective and reliable method for developing latent fingerprints. The powders adhere to the ridge pattern of the fingerprint only, thus allowing the image to be visualised. Fingerprints developed in situ {{at a crime scene}} routinely undergo lifting with specialist tapes to facilitate subsequent laboratory analysis. As with all recovered evidence these samples would be stored in evidence bags to allow secure transit from the scene to the laboratory and also <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> chain of <b>evidence.</b> In this paper, the {{application of}} Raman spectroscopy for the analysis of exogenous material in latent fingerprints is reported for contaminated fingerprints that had been treated with powders and also subsequently lifted with adhesive tapes. A selection of over the counter (OTC) analgesics were used as samples for the analysis and contaminated fingerprints were deposited on clean glass slides. The application of aluminium or iron based powders to contaminated fingerprints did not interfere with the Raman spectra obtained for the contaminants. In most cases background fluorescence attributed to the sebaceous content of the latent fingerprint was reduced by the application of the powder thus reducing spectral interference. Contaminated fingerprints developed with powders and then lifted with lifting tapes were also examined. The combination of these two techniques did not interfere with the successful analysis of exogenous contaminants by Raman spectroscopy. The lifting process was repeated using hinge lifters. As the hinge lifters exhibited strong Raman bands the spectroscopic analysis was more complex and {{an increase in the number}} of exposures to the detector allowed for improved clarification. Raman spectra of developed and lifted fingerprints recorded through evidence bags were obtained and it was found that the detection process was not compromised in any way. Although the application of powders did not interfere with the detection process the time taken to locate the contaminant was increased due to the physical presence of more material within the fingerprint. The presence of interfering Raman bands from lifting tapes is another potential complication. This, however, could be removed by spectral subtraction or by the choice of lifting tapes that have only weak Raman bands...|$|R
