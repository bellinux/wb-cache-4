5000|$|The birch forests {{also contain}} {{other species of}} trees. The number of rowan, grey alder, <b>trembling</b> <b>poplar</b> and {{hackberry}} is relatively high. [...] The alpine blue-sow-thistle is very widespread in this zone and is the food the bears prefer. Garden angelica also grows in the forests, reaching a height of 2 to 3 m. Many other plants in this zone can also attain exceptional size.|$|E
50|$|Populus tremuloides is a {{deciduous}} tree {{native to}} cooler areas of North America, {{one of several}} species referred to by the common name aspen. It is commonly called quaking aspen, trembling aspen, American aspen, Quakies, mountain or golden aspen, <b>trembling</b> <b>poplar,</b> white poplar, popple, and even more names. The trees have tall trunks, up to 25 meters (82 feet) tall, with smooth pale bark, scarred with black. The glossy green leaves, dull beneath, become golden to yellow, rarely red, in autumn. The species often propagates through its roots to form large clonal groves originating from a shared root system. These roots are not rhizomes, as new growth develops from adventitious buds on the parent root system (the ortet).|$|E
5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), <b>poplars</b> (<b>Trembling</b> Aspen, Balsam <b>Poplar),</b> birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|R
50|$|Fort des <b>Trembles</b> or <b>Poplar</b> Fort 5 (or 9) {{miles west}} of Portage la Prairie. In 1781 it was defended against Indian attack and them abandoned. This is {{different}} from Fort aux Trembles near Fort la Corne.|$|R
50|$|Melampsora medusae is a fungal pathogen, {{causing a}} disease of woody plants. The {{infected}} trees' leaves turn yellowish-orange. The disease affects mostly conifers, e.g. the Douglas-fir, western larch, tamarack, ponderosa, and lodgepole pine trees, but also some broadleaves, e.g. <b>trembling</b> aspen and <b>poplars.</b> Coniferous hosts are affected in late spring through early August, and <b>trembling</b> aspens and <b>poplars</b> from early summer to late fall. It {{is one of only}} two foliage rusts that occur naturally in British Columbia.|$|R
60|$|He gave {{a sign to}} Menecreta, and she approached, tottering {{like one}} who is drunken with wine, or who has {{received}} a heavy blow on the head. She stood before Dea Flavia, with head <b>trembling</b> like <b>poplar</b> leaves and great hollow eyes fixed in meaningless vacancy upon the great patrician lady.|$|R
60|$|She traversed {{the whole}} length of meadowland close {{under the shadow}} of the fringed bank, and gained the forest. Here she hesitated. All was so wild and still. No {{definite}} course through the woods seemed to invite, and yet all was open. Trees, trees, dark, immovable trees everywhere. The violent <b>trembling</b> of <b>poplar</b> and aspen leaves, when all others were so calm, struck her strangely, and the fearful stillness awed her. Drawing a deep breath she started forward up the gently rising ground.|$|R

50|$|White spruce, <b>trembling</b> aspen, balsam <b>poplar</b> {{and white}} birch {{are the most}} {{prominent}} native trees in and around town. Black spruce and tamarack occur in poorly drained areas and jack pine may {{be seen on the}} driest sites. European aspen, blue spruce and sand cherry are among the exotic trees occasionally seen.|$|R
50|$|Broad-leaved {{deciduous}} trees include yellow birch, paper birch, grey birch, red maple, sugar maple, balsam <b>poplar,</b> <b>trembling</b> aspen, bigtooth aspen, speckled alder, northern red oak, American elm, American beech, {{and black}} ash. Silver maple and butternut are uncommon, {{but can be}} found at alluvial sites along the Southwest Miramichi River. Hop hornbeam (=Ironwood) and white ash are uncommon to rare, but do occur on well-drained upland soils.|$|R
25|$|Common {{types of}} trees present in BC's forests include Western Redcedar, Yellow-cedar, Rocky Mountain juniper, Lodgepole pine, Ponderosa or yellow pine, Whitebark pine, Limber pine, Western white pine, Western larch, Tamarack, Alpine larch, White spruce, Engelmann spruce, Sitka spruce, Black spruce, Grand fir, Amabilis fir, Subalpine fir, Western hemlock, Mountain hemlock, Douglas-fir, Western yew, Pacific dogwood, Bigleaf maple, Douglas maple, Vine maple, Arbutus, Black hawthorn, Cascara, Garry oak, Pacific crab apple, Choke cherry, Pin cherry, Bitter cherry, Red alder, Mountain alder, Paper birch, Water birch, Black cottonwood, Balsam <b>poplar,</b> <b>Trembling</b> aspen.|$|R
5000|$|The native {{coniferous}} trees in Wilcox Lake's watershed include white spruce, eastern hemlock, white pine, red pine, eastern white cedar and tamarack. [...] The native deciduous trees include red maple, silver maple, sugar maple, red oak, white oak, burr oak, balsam <b>poplar,</b> <b>trembling</b> aspen, large-tooth aspen, white ash, black ash, blue ash, green ash, basswood, paper birch, pin cherry and black cherry. The native wildflowers include purple coneflower, yellow coneflower, flat-topped aster, heath aster, smooth aster, silky aster, ox-eyed susan, black-eyed susan, bluebeard lily, wood lily, trout lily, common strawberry, common milkweed, blazing star, fireweed, star flower, wild columbine and wild bergamot. Aquatic vegetation that {{is native to}} the lake itself include bulrushes, cattails, water arums, water plantains, water lilies, arrowheads, blue flag irises, smartweeds and pickeral weeds. Native shrubs found around the lake include speckled alder, smooth serviceberry, Allegheny serviceberry, nannyberry, red osier, gray dogwood, silky dogwood, broad-leaved meadowsweet, swamp rose, spicebush, buttonbush, shining willow, slender willow, black willow and pussywillow.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} boreal forests have been {{harvested}} {{to retain a}} portion of the original canopy, thereby providing forest struc-ture, mostly for biodiversity reasons. Boreal mixedwood cutovers were surveyed at one and five years after harvesting with approximately 10 % structural retention, to quantify the mean annual mortality rates of the residual <b>trembling</b> aspen, bal-sam <b>poplar,</b> paper birch and white spruce trees. For comparison,“natural ” mortality rates by species were estimated from permanent sample plots in stands of similar composition. Species ranking of the annual mortality rates of residuals in areas harvested with structural retention were: poplar (10. 2 %) > birch (8. 7 %) > aspen (6. 1 %) > spruce (2. 9 %). Annual mortality rates were 2. 5 to 4 times greater than in the reference stands. The majority of broadleaved species died as snags (~ 70 %– 90 %), while most spruce died due to windthrow (80 %). Mortality rates increased with slenderness coefficient for codominant and understory poplar and for understory birch. For aspen, codominants were most likely to die, while in spruce, dominant trees and trees with the greatest damage to the bole from harvesting operations had the highest mor-tality...|$|R
25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include paper birch, <b>trembling</b> aspen, balsam <b>poplar,</b> and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980). Seral species {{giving way to}} white spruce include paper birch, aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|R
