5|$|In 1980, Applewhite and Nettles {{had about}} 80followers, {{many of whom}} held jobs, often working with {{computers}} or as car mechanics. In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting their followers to visit relatives on Mother's Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell <b>their</b> <b>families</b> that they were studying computers at a monastery. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discover}} cancer patients' {{views about}} {{disclosure of information}} to <b>their</b> <b>family,</b> <b>their</b> <b>family's</b> influence over the information given them, and their preferences for doctors' behaviour if they and <b>their</b> <b>family</b> disagree, as a complement to applied ethical theory. DESIGN: Semistructured interviews followed by qualitative content analysis. SETTING: Mainly urban British general practice. SUBJECTS: 30 patients in whom cancer, excluding basal and squamous cell skin carcinomas, was diagnosed 1 - 7 years earlier. RESULTS: All subjects wished doctors to respect their views rather than those of <b>their</b> <b>family,</b> should they differ. With their consent, subjects favoured close family receiving information about their illness, all but one mentioning advantage to <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> Without such consent, six unconditionally favoured disclosure of information to <b>their</b> <b>family</b> while seven unconditionally opposed disclosure. Seventeen participants restricted their approval for such disclosure to specific circumstances. Only two participants approved of <b>their</b> <b>family</b> influencing {{the information that they}} received about their illness; all but seven wished to receive full information, the exceptions relating to information about bad prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects favoured openness with <b>their</b> <b>family</b> but most rejected unconditional disclosure of information without their consent and <b>their</b> <b>family</b> influencing what information they would be given. They valued respect for their autonomy more highly than beneficence and considered that their own needs took priority over those of <b>their</b> <b>family...</b>|$|R
50|$|This factor {{assesses the}} individual’s {{subjective}} satisfaction with <b>their</b> <b>family,</b> and the subjective well-being of and within <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> Family offers physical, mental, cultural, spiritual and social nurturance, {{and is an}} integral aspect of Pacific self-concept, closely tied to wellbeing.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{participants}} started to view themselves negatively or as being selfish {{when they started}} to borrow money to gamble {{and when they were}} in debt.

Participants reported developing a sense of hopelessness when they perceived that they have continuously disappointed <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members.|$|R

5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca.

The captured nobles and <b>their</b> <b>families</b> could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E

30|$|However, some {{participants}} decided to quit gambling only when <b>their</b> <b>family</b> members no longer offered assistance in solving their debt issues, and when <b>their</b> <b>family</b> severed relational ties {{or would not}} communicate with them anymore.

40|$|Background: Genetic {{predisposition}} is a {{risk factor}} for many chronic diseases, yet {{little is known about the}} frequency in which college students seek out <b>their</b> <b>family</b> health history or with whom they communicate relevant information. Purpose: This study examines motivations and barriers associated with obtaining one’s family health history and discussing it with others. Methods: Data were analyzed from 625 college students using an internet-delivered questionnaire. Questions asked respondents about intentions and motivations to obtain and share family health history as well as barriers encountered in obtaining family health history. Responses were bifurcated by participants’ sex. Chi-squared and t statistics were used to identify response differences by sex. Results: Females were significantly more likely than males to be motivated to obtain <b>their</b> <b>family</b> health history, and more likely to have: shared <b>their</b> <b>family</b> health history with others; state they would share <b>their</b> <b>family</b> health history with others; and express a preference for sharing <b>their</b> <b>family</b> health history with a wider range of people. Discussion: Educational interventions and improved student health services could be effective mechanisms to increase college students’ knowledge, awareness, and perceived importance of obtaining <b>their</b> <b>family</b> health history...|$|R

40|$|KEY FINDINGS * If {{employees}} feel <b>their</b> <b>family</b> life {{interferes with}} their work, {{they tend to}} feel guilty. They 2 ̆ 7 re actually less likely to feel guilt when they feel work interferes with <b>their</b> <b>family</b> life, possibly because it 2 ̆ 7 s increasingly acceptable for work to spill over into our private lives. * People with traditional gender role views (i. e., believe men should be primarily responsible for work, and women for family) tend to experience more guilt when <b>their</b> <b>family</b> interferes with <b>their</b> work, regardless of gender. * People with more egalitarian gender role views (i. e., feel men and women can equally share work and family roles) tend to experience more guilt when their work interferes with <b>their</b> <b>family</b> time. * Men with the most traditional gender attitudes experience the most guilt when <b>their</b> <b>family</b> conflicts with <b>their</b> work, compared to women, and compared to more egalitarian men. * Contrary to the popular perception that only women are affected by work-family conflict, men also experience guilt from this conflict—sometimes {{even more so than}} do women...|$|R
