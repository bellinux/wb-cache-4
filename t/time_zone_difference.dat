40|$|Using {{distance}} and <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> <b>differences</b> {{as a measure}} for coordination costs between service suppliers and consumers, we employ a Hausman- Taylor model for services trade by foreign affiliates. Given the need for proximity {{in the provision of}} services, factors like distance place a higher cost burden on the delivery of services in foreign markets. In addition, <b>differences</b> in <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> add significantly to {{the cost of doing business}} abroad. Decomposing the impact of distance into a longitudinal and latitudinal component and accounting for <b>differences</b> in <b>time</b> <b>zones,</b> it is possible to identify in detail the factors driving the impact of increasing coordination costs on the delivery of services through foreign affiliates. Working with a bilateral U. S. data set on foreign affiliate sales in services this paper examines the impact of <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> <b>differences</b> and East-West and North- South distance on U. S. outward affiliate sales. Both distance as well as <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> <b>differences</b> have a significant positive effect on foreign affiliate sales. By decomposing the effect of distance our results show that increasing East-West or North-South distance by 100 kilometers raises affiliates sales by 2 %. Finally, focusing on <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> <b>differences</b> our findings suggest that affiliate sales increase the more <b>time</b> <b>zones</b> we have to overcome...|$|R

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{interviews with}} sixteen members of teams that worked across global <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> <b>differences.</b> Despite <b>time</b> <b>zone</b> <b>differences</b> of about eight hours, collaborators still {{found time to}} synchronously meet. The interviews identified the diverse strategies teams used to find time windows to interact, which often included times outside of the normal workday and connecting from home to participate. Recent trends in increased work connectivity from home and blurred boundaries between work and home enabled more scheduling flexibility. While email use was understandably prevalent, there was also general interest in video, although obstacles remain for widespread usage.
