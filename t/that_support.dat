50|$|In the mid-to-late 1960s, {{mainframe}} computers, {{such as the}} IBM System/360, had memory sizes from 8 KB to 512 KB. In {{order to}} conserve memory, transients were small modules <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> a specific task, and were swapped {{in and out of}} memory. The operating system for the 360 had two areas reserved for transients <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> input/output operations. These were referred to as the “logical transient area,” and the “physical transient area.” If an application program, for example, needed to use the printer, transients <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> printing were brought into the transient areas. If an application needed to use tape drives, transients <b>that</b> <b>supported</b> tape drive access were brought into the transient areas.|$|R

Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him {{the chance to be}} president.|$|E
5|$|However as {{the army}} took shape, French {{officers}} were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust.
