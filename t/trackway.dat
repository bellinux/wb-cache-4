5|$|Despite the {{frequent}} mentioning of the Diolkos {{in connection with}} military operations, modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the <b>trackway</b> {{must have been the}} transport of cargo, considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often, and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce. Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo, which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace, also imply a commercial use of the <b>trackway.</b> Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece, the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble, monoliths and timber to points west and east. It is not known what tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory, {{but the fact that the}} <b>trackway</b> was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity.|$|E

5|$|The chief {{engineer}} of the Corinth Canal, Béla Gerster, conducted extensive {{research on the}} topography of the Isthmus, but did not discover the Diolkos. Remains of the ship <b>trackway</b> were probably first identified by the German archaeologist Habbo Gerhard Lolling in the 1883 Baedeker edition. In 1913, James George Frazer reported in his commentary on Pausanias on traces of an ancient <b>trackway</b> across the Isthmus, while parts of the western quay were discovered by Harold North Fowler in 1932.|$|E
50|$|These Mountains {{are home}} to world famous Early Permian <b>trackways</b> of {{invertebrates}} and vertebrates. The main locality was recently designated the 100th active national monument in the United States, and named Prehistoric <b>Trackways</b> National Monument. Rock outcrops in the area preserve numerous examples of Early Permian <b>trackways.</b> These <b>trackways</b> include prints of Dimetrodon, Edaphosaurus, Eryops, Cacops and many other small pelycosaurs.|$|R

50|$|Mammal <b>trackways</b> {{are among}} the least common <b>trackways.</b> Mammals were not often in mud, or {{riverine}} environments; they were more often in forestlands or grasslands. Thus the earlier tetrapods or proto-tetrapods would yield the most fossil <b>trackways.</b> The Walchia forest of Brule, Nova Scotia has {{an example of an}} in situ Walchia forest, and tetrapod <b>trackways</b> that extended over some period of time through the forest area.|$|R

5|$|A {{feature of}} the canal was the variety of methods used at Combe Hay to {{overcome}} height differences between {{the upper and lower}} reaches, initially by the use of caisson locks and when this failed an inclined plane <b>trackway</b> and then finally a flight of 22 conventionallocks.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{scientists}} {{described the}} first known extensive dromaeosaurid <b>trackway,</b> in Shandong, China. In addition to confirming {{the hypothesis that the}} sickle-claw was held retracted off the ground, the <b>trackway</b> (made by a large, Achillobator-sized species) showed evidence of six individuals of about equal size moving together along a shoreline. The individuals were spaced about one meter apart, and retained the same direction of travel, walking at a fairly slow pace. The authors of the paper describing these footprints interpreted the trackways as evidence that some species of dromaeosaurids lived in groups. While the trackways clearly do not represent hunting behavior, the idea that groups of dromaeosaurids may have hunted together, according to the authors, could not be ruled out.|$|E
50|$|Prehistoric <b>Trackways</b> National Monument is the nation's newest {{national}} monument {{and is currently}} being developed just northwest of Las Cruces in the Robledo Mountains. This {{national monument}} protects 280-million-year-old fossil footprints and <b>trackways</b> discovered by Jerry P. MacDonald. These <b>trackways</b> include tracks from numerous extinct animals such as Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus.|$|R
50|$|When {{this station}} opened on July 10, 1919, the BMT Broadway Line had ended north of this station as six <b>trackways,</b> of which only two tracks (local tracks) {{continued}} to the 60th Street Tunnel to Queens. The other four <b>trackways,</b> both the express tracks and the outermost <b>trackways</b> (both of the outermost <b>trackways</b> are ramps which {{have never been}} used) curve slightly west before ending, which were a provision for the line to run to Upper Manhattan via Central Park West.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of leylines {{and their relationship}} with ancient <b>trackways</b> was first suggested in 1921 by the amateur archaeologist Alfred Watkins, in his books Early British <b>Trackways</b> and The Old Straight Track. Watkins theorized that these alignments were created for ease of overland trekking on ancient <b>trackways</b> during neolithic times and had persisted in the landscape over millennia.|$|R
5|$|The Sweet Track is {{an ancient}} {{causeway}} in the Somerset Levels, England. It was built in 3807BC and is the second-oldest timber <b>trackway</b> discovered in the British Isles, dating to the Neolithic. It is now known that the Sweet Track was predominantly built {{over the course of}} an earlier structure, the Post Track.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} tracks and two side {{platforms}} here. In between the local tracks and the express tracks, there are <b>trackway</b> walls. The station {{has a full}} length mezzanine, but as the fare control and booth area {{are at the center}} of the mezzanine, crossover is available only at the easternmost staircase.|$|E
5|$|At present, the {{building}} houses administrative offices and the university's geological museum. The museum, {{one of the}} oldest collegiate geology collections in the United States, was founded by state geologist and Rutgers professor George Hammell Cook in 1872. Its exhibits showcase the natural history of New Jersey; focusing geology, paleontology, and anthropology. Exhibits include fluorescent zinc minerals from Franklin and Ogdensburg, a mastodon from Salem County, a dinosaur <b>trackway</b> discovered in Towaco, and a Ptolemaic era Egyptian mummy.|$|E

5000|$|In South Africa, two ancient <b>trackways</b> {{have been}} found {{containing}} footprints, one at Langebaan and one at Nahoon. Both <b>trackways</b> occur in calcareous eolianites or hardened sand dunes. At Nahoon, <b>trackways</b> of at least five species of vertebrates, including three hominid footprints, are preserved as casts.

5|$|Parts of the A303, such as {{the section}} past Stonehenge, have been a right of way for people, wagons, and later motor {{vehicles}} for millennia. Portions of it follow the Harrow Way, an ancient <b>trackway</b> across Wessex {{that is one of}} Britain's oldest roads, reportedly being used as long ago as 3,000 BC. Other sections run on part of the Fosse Way, a Roman road between Exeter and Lincoln constructed around 49 AD.|$|E
5|$|Sedgemoor is a low-lying area {{of land in}} Somerset, England. It lies {{close to}} sea level south of the Polden Hills, forming {{a large part of}} the Somerset Levels and Moors, a wetland area between the Mendips and the Blackdown Hills. The Neolithic people {{exploited}} the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways, including the world's oldest known timber <b>trackway,</b> the Post Track, dating to the 3800s BC.|$|E
5|$|The Diolkos {{remained}} reportedly {{in regular}} service {{until at least}} {{the middle of the}} 1st centuryAD, after which no more written references appear. Possibly the <b>trackway</b> was put out of use by Nero's abortive canal works in 67AD. Much later transports of warships across the Isthmus in the late 9th century and around 1150 are assumed to have used a route other than the Diolkos due to the extensive time lag.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} Diolkos at Corinth, there is scant {{literary}} evidence {{for two more}} ship trackways by that name in antiquity, both in Roman Egypt: The physician Oribasius (c. 320–400AD) records two passages from his 1st centuryAD colleague Xenocrates, in which the latter casually refers to a diolkos close to the harbor of Alexandria {{which may have been}} located at the southern tip of the island of Pharos. Another diolkos is mentioned by Ptolemy (90–168AD) in his book on geography (IV, 5, 10) as connecting a false mouth of a partly silted up Nile branch with the Mediterranean Sea. Neither Xenocrates nor Ptolemy offers any details on his <b>trackway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) of the timbers {{has enabled}} precise dating of the track, showing {{it was built}} in 3807 BC. This dating led to claims that the Sweet Track was the oldest roadway in the world, until the {{discovery}} in 2009 of a 6,000-year-old <b>trackway</b> built in 4100 BC, in Plumstead, near Belmarsh prison. Analysis of the Sweet Track's timbers has aided research into Neolithic Era dendrochronology; comparisons with wood from the River Trent and a submerged forest at Stolford enabled a fuller mapping of the rings, and their relationship with the climate of the period.|$|E
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the grooves {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the grooves can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the <b>trackway.</b>|$|E
5|$|South of the 36th Street {{station on}} the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, there are three <b>trackways</b> that diverge from the line at a flying junction. These <b>trackways</b> end under the eastern curb of Fourth Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|In 2014 {{researchers}} published {{information about}} {{the discovery of a}} new area containing 90 <b>trackways.</b> These paralleled existing <b>trackways</b> of sauropods.

40|$|ABSTRACT-As {{part of a}} {{study of}} {{vertebrate}} <b>trackways</b> in the cross-stratified Coconino Sandstone (Permian) of northern Arizona, <b>trackways</b> made by living salamanders under different substrate conditions were compared, The sample of 230 <b>trackways</b> of the western newt, Taricha torosa, included ten combinations of the following substrate characteristics: I) sediment: muddy or of fine sand; 2) attitude: level or sloped (25 degrees); 3) moisture content: dry, damp, wet, or submerged. <b>Trackways</b> in wet mud produced the most accurate representation {{of the number of}} toes per foot and the arrangement of toes, All other conditions studied yielded a reduced average number of toes per foot, and a large sample was needed before the data had the potential to indicate the true structure of the trackmaker's feet. <b>Trackways</b> made on sloped, submerged mud or sand, sloped, dry sand, and sloped, damp sand rarely included the full complement of toes. The positions and orientations of the toe marks were distorted if the animals were walking underwater or on sloped, damp sand. <b>Trackways</b> on the slopes of cross-stratified deposits make reliable identification of the trackmaking animals exceptionally difficult.

5|$|Of {{the four}} shuttle tracks, only three are in use, {{with the former}} {{southbound}} express track space being used for platform space at each terminal. The former southbound local track is now Shuttle Track 1. Track 2 no longer exists, but the trackbed of Track 2 can be seen inside the tunnel from passing trains on Tracks 1 and 3. At the two terminals, the <b>trackway</b> for Track 2 is occupied by platforms that provide access to Track 3, which was the former northbound express track. The former northbound local track is Track 4. Track 2 was removed between the two stations in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the <b>trackway</b> were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the <b>trackway,</b> presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a dry period. The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is Scelidosaurus, from Early Jurassic England, which lived about 190Mya. Interestingly, it possessed {{features}} of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A <b>trackway</b> of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|E
