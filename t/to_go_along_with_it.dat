5|$|Long ago, King Childeric I came to {{the forest}} to build a city while the Queen experimented with black magic to gain eternal life. A plague swept through the land, and she hid in her tower, while her husband and {{everyone}} below her perished. Her spell granted her immortal life, but not the youth and beauty <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Her youthful appearance now only exists in her mirror, the source of her life, as an illusion and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{introduces}} his illegitimate son, Donald (Michael Benjamin Washington), to the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff. Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{suspect that}} Donald is embezzling from Tracy {{as they do}} not believe that Donald is twenty-one years old, which Donald claims to be. Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate and gives it to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy knew all about Donald's scam, explaining he decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> because Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing good for the community.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Paul City Council {{decided in}} late 1974 to support I-35E, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} influence of proponents. R.I.P. 35E proposed an alternative to the original plan, and convinced the city council <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection of this parkway to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying noise pollution, air pollution, vibrations, and slope stability as the main concerns. In addition to the nearby location of historic districts, hospitals were worried about the effects of vibrations on sensitive operations; the MHD solved this problem while the report was being developed. The EIS identified the primary benefit of completing I-35E as connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice, but with minor changes such as lowering the freeway below Grand Avenue and Ramsey Street.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle also tried, {{largely in}} vain, {{to attract the}} support of French forces in the French Empire. He telegraphed to General Charles Noguès (Resident-General in Morocco and Commander-in-Chief of French forces in North Africa), {{offering}} to serve under him or to cooperate in any way. Noguès, who was dismayed by the armistice but agreed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> refused to cooperate and forbade the press in French North Africa to publish de Gaulle’s appeal. Noguès told the British liaison officer that de Gaulle’s attitude was “unseemly”. De Gaulle also sent a telegram to Weygand offering to serve under his orders, receiving a dismissive reply.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{had many}} highlights. After the Astrodome hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in July, the Astros {{went on a}} streak with five {{straight}} come-from-behind wins (two against the Mets and three against the Montreal Expos). In {{a game against the}} Dodgers, pitcher Jim Deshaies (who came from the Yankees in exchange for Joe Niekro) started the game with eight straight strikeouts. On September 25, Mike Scott helped his team clinch the NL West by no-hitting the San Francisco Giants. This was the only time in MLB history that any division was clinched via a no-hitter. Scott would finish the season with an 1810 record and a Cy Young Award <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|The more {{moderate}} {{members of the}} Volunteers' Provisional Committee {{did not like the}} idea, nor the way it was presented, but they were largely prepared <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> to prevent Redmond from forming a rival organisation, which would draw away most of their support. The IRB was completely opposed to Redmond's demands, as this would end any chance they had of controlling the Volunteers. Hobson, who simultaneously served in leadership roles in both the IRB and the Volunteers, was one of a few IRB members to reluctantly submit to Redmond's demands, leading to a falling out with the IRB leaders, notably Tom Clarke. In the end the Committee accepted Redmond's demands, by a vote of 18 to 9, most of the votes of dissent coming from members of the IRB.|$|E

When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky thought it a ruse and disregarded it. Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident Red Army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.|$|E

500|$|Assessments vary as {{to whether}} Anderson was a {{deliberate}} impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. Pierre Gilliard denounced Anderson as [...] "a cunning psychopath". The equation of Anderson {{with members of the}} imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, rather than with Anderson herself. Anderson appeared <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> afterwards. Writer Michael Thornton thought, [...] "Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person. I think it happened by accident and she was swept along on a wave of euphoria." [...] Lord Mountbatten, a first cousin of the Romanov children, thought her supporters [...] "simply get rich on the royalties of further books, magazine articles, plays etc." [...] Prince Michael Romanov, a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, stated the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud, and that the family looked upon her and [...] "the three-ringed circus which danced around her, creating books and movies, as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack (Sean Hayes) {{learns that}} OutTV, the gay {{television}} network {{where he is}} employed, has been bought by a [...] "large corporation" [...] and that his talk show Jack Talk will have a co-host [...] "to widen the audience." [...] Not {{in favor of the}} idea, Jack agrees and meets his co-host, Amber-Louise (Britney Spears). During an episode of Jack Talk, Jack is stunned to realize that OutTV, which has been bought by right-wing conservatives, have made changes to the show, including it being renamed Talk Time USA. Not thrilled at the idea, Jack is told to compromise; Amber-Louise admits to Jack that she is a lesbian, and is merely pretending to be an ultra-conservative Christian to get by in the TV world. She asks him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> so that he can keep his job. Jack gets on board and informs his guest, actor George Takei, that the network asked that he not reveal he is gay on the show. Will tells Jack not to be let himself be [...] pushed around, and to stand up for who he is. Jack takes Will's advice and does not compromise, which ultimately costs him his job.|$|E
500|$|The soap opera's {{official}} website stated that Eve was the [...] "beautiful and compassionate town doctor" [...] who was enjoying a successful career; [...] she {{was described as}} an altruist by John Berlau of The Atlas Society. Ross initially saw the character as easy to play, calling her [...] "everyone's best friend, and the town doctor, and a great mother". The actress had a more difficult time when Eve began behaving in morally questionable ways to protect secrets about her past. She felt that the change in Eve's character made the role challenging on an emotional level, comparing the experience to [...] "getting a jail sentence and you're expected <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> without any explanation" [...] or [...] "the gods messing with somebody with no reason but to mess with them". When asked to describe Eve in three words, Ross responded {{that she was a}} [...] "contradiction inside an enigma". Playing Eve, she said, was [...] "as if somebody came and told you that your closest friend is doing abominable things". Ross appreciated Eve's characterization as a human being who was not portrayed as completely good or bad and had admirable qualities as well as faults. She later connected Eve's shame of her past life with Julian and inability to tell her family to Lavinia Kingsley's regrets about her youth in the 2002 comedy film The Banger Sisters.|$|E

2500|$|While Montag and Mildred are perusing {{the stolen}} books, a {{sniffing}} occurs at their front door. Montag recognizes it as The Hound while Mildred passes {{it off as}} a random dog. They resume their discussion once the sound ceases, but Mildred refuses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He then states that maybe the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and {{they set up a}} date to watch the [...] "parlor walls" [...] (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.|$|E

Smoove) and others <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> he eats a large meal and drinks a bottle of laxative prior to the event. Wanting foreplay, Julie is angered when Doug wants to finish, and she runs into the street. Chasing after her, he is then hit by a car and graphically evacuates his bowels everywhere. She cradles him and apologizes; covered and surrounded by his excrement on the road, she exclaims that it is the [...] "most beautiful thing" [...] she has ever seen and accepts his marriage proposal.

2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when we fail to recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> or not.
