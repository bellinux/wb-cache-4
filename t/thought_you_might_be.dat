500|$|Scott Shetler of Pop Crush {{noted that}} the song was {{indirectly}} about Lopez's ex-boyfriends and husbands. He commented that the song was [...] "obviously condemning several exes" [...] and wrote [...] "A logical reading of the lyrics, though, reveals that the “bad boy” is probably Lopez’s former long-term boyfriend and Bad Boy Records founder Diddy, while the guy J. Lo danced with until saying “I do” is her second husband Cris Judd, a professional dancer and choreographer. The lyrics go on to reference two more men, who {{would seem to be}} Ben Affleck (“went nowhere but kept the ring”) and Lopez’s current husband, Marc Anthony (“he sang to me.”)" [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that [...] "One Love" [...] examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not [...] "trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life. She honestly <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> curious about Ben Affleck and whatever happened to that huge engagement ring he gave her all those years ago, during Bennifer’s dark reign." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} the incident now. A mere misunderstanding. I {{had done with}} the worm, and <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> glad to have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Rylands, [...] "but that lady, {{your old}} friend, Miss Clifford, does, and I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> hankering after it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on board!" [...] shouted Lingard. [...] "Why didn't {{you speak}} at once? I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> some {{masquerading}} Dutchmen from a dodging gunboat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. Don't get excited. She {{objects to}} civility, then, from what I understand. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> tender. <b>You</b> {{know we are}} on service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't you see him, either, {{before he}} left?" [...] inquired Mrs. Holt; [...] "I <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{able to give}} me some further {{explanation}} of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; only I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{going to}} the yacht; and Valencia would have walked down with you. She wants to find Major Campbell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} you are her mother," [...] he said, quietly, [...] "that I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> glad to find a {{suitable}} home for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame de F. (with a sigh). I {{wish you}} could attend the {{services}} of a better church. And when was it you <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> good, Ethel? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh nowhere, nowhere,' he {{returned}} with excessive mildness. 'The streets are filled with blue cockades. I rather <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> among them. I am glad you are not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> bruised {{against the}} bulkhead," [...] he said. [...] "Are you sure you're not hurt that I can't get you anything? From the steward, I mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} thought so. But I have <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> induced to imperil your neck--as you have it--for its own sake, {{and to the}} end that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> save it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} to the hotel," [...] he said, in a low tone. [...] "They <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> here. Can you come up later--say at one o'clock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really? You know, Major, for {{a little}} while I {{suspected}} you. Because you wouldn't let me kill him. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> protecting him." [...] She laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, I {{begin to}} believe there really is,' {{returned}} Carker; 'I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> jesting when you seemed to hint at it; for I know you military men-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{have had a}} school of your own," [...] said the lad. [...] "You know so much, and get on so well with boys. I should have <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> tutor at a college." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{interested}} to know, Miss Fielding, {{that you will}} meet the gentleman--with the same name as your friend--this evening. Lord Runton has been good enough {{to ask him to}} come up and dine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she said, {{laughing}} a little; [...] "feminine curiosity I suppose. I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> Good-bye," [...] and {{she went}} on, leaving Edward Cossey to the enjoyment of a very peculiar set of sensations.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a fair copy. The one Monk {{showed me}} was rather smudged. I suppose they <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> hurt {{if you got}} an inky round-robin. Considerate chap, Monk.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Clare," [...] she said, [...] "I've {{called to}} see you and Mrs Clare, and to inquire if ye be well. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> back here again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mighty {{glad to see}} you got here," [...] {{declared}} Gif. [...] "I {{read about}} the awful storm you had down around New York, and I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> delayed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Neither he nor she has {{the least}} idea of my intention; I only <b>thought,</b> sir, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> willing to {{consider}} how best to assist a nephew, who has certainly not been wanting either in industry or economy, and who bears your name.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{made myself}} {{a cup of}} tea the first thing, boys, and had a slice of bread and butter, for I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> down for some time; but I am quite ready to join you; we have got fish. I put them down {{directly}} you called." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I then <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{spared the}} pain of knowing {{anything}} of the matter. I tell you now because I hear to-day in Hamworth that people are talking on the subject. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> annoyed, as I was just now, if the first tidings had reached you from some stranger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was not {{alarmed by}} your footstep," [...] she said, [...] "for {{anyone who was}} searching for us would come along slowly and stealthily; but I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> pursued." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sorry, old man. Can't. Just {{on my way}} to the Ritz. Stepped {{in because}} I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> here. I wanted you to be the first to hear the news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have been}} there ever since you went away. It was Mrs. Sam who sent me after you: who said that she <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> doing {{something}} stupid--something like yourself, Huxter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Sabin {{contemplated}} {{it himself}} thoughtfully. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I rather <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{able to explain}} that to me. I have an {{idea that there is}} a society in Europe--sort of aristocratic odd-fellows, you know--who had adopted it for their crest. Am I not right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Black One [that is, Panda] {{sent me to}} tell Saduko that {{he would}} be allowed to see you, Macumazahn, before the trial, if he wished, for he knew that you had been a friend of his, and <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to give {{evidence}} in his favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is best so," [...] she whispered. [...] "I only minded when--I <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> back in time. I am quite--content now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> tired {{with the}} dancing." [...] Then Tappitt's mind flew {{off to the}} champagne, and he {{determined}} {{that the young man}} before him was too disagreeable to be endured.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid Lise {{has gone}} away with him," [...] said Janet. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{able to find}} out {{something}} about him, and--whether any one had seen them. She left home yesterday morning." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerome. I am {{collecting}} for the Monastery, and my donkey {{has gone}} lame; I {{have had to}} put {{it up in the}} village. I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to lend me one to go on with.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> hungry, Mr. Stubbs, {{and this}} is some of what the skeleton's wife gave me. I hain't got very much {{time to talk with}} you now; but the first chance I can get away tomorrow, an' when there hain't anybody round, I want to tell you something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have an {{application}} for a suite of rooms next week," [...] she said, referring to the letter, [...] "and as we shall be rather full, father <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> gentlemen <b>might</b> <b>be</b> willing to take another larger room for your meetings, and give up these, which {{are part of a}} suite--and perhaps not exactly suitable"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear it," [...] I replied. [...] "I <b>thought</b> {{that perhaps}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>be.</b> Now tell me, to change the subject, how long will Dingaan keep us here?" ...|$|R
