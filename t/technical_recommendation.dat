Criolla Colombia, fertilizer represents 17 % of the total costs, and it’s inappropriate and sometimes excessive use translates into expensive investments with technical inefficiency. This is mainly {{due to a lack}} of nutrient absorption levels of the selected variety. The research was conducted in Granada (Colombia) with five fertilization treatments (absolute control, commercial control, <b>technical</b> <b>recommendation</b> + 50 %, <b>technical</b> <b>recommendation</b> and <b>technical</b> <b>recommendation</b> - 50 %) arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. We evaluated dry matter, nutrient uptake, yield and specific gravity.

In order to verify if this recommendation is indeed realistic, {{the aim of this}} study was to describe the elbow flexion angle ant its angular velocity, linear speed and range of motion of the shoulder, elbow and wrist during the sculling motion. Data were calculated using three-dimensional kinematic process from underwater video images of ten athletes of synchronized swimming. The results indicate that the arm is relatively stationary and the forearm moves, which agrees with the <b>technical</b> <b>recommendation.</b> However, the elbow flexes and extends, which contradicts the <b>technical</b> <b>recommendation.</b> These findings should be considered when this action is practiced, especially in synchronized swimming, in which sculling motion is a fundamental technique...|$|E
