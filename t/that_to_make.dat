25|$|Machine {{learning}} is a scientific discipline that deals with the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.

25|$|Although {{the initial}} {{analysis}} is correct, {{there is another}} effect that can happen, known as the overvoltage effect. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the E°cell. This {{may be due to}} kinetic rather than thermodynamic considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the activation energy for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in kinetic terms. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the voltage of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).|$|E

Blair offered to provide the needed motorcycles, but he wanted the name changed from the Bobby Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils Thrill Show to Evil Knievel and His Motorcycle Daredevils. Knievel didn't want his image to be that of a Hells Angels rider, so he convinced Blair to allow him to use Evel instead of Evil.|$|E
25|$|Donal Nolan {{has argued}} that to {{consider}} Rylands as part of private nuisance is unsound. Private nuisance requires the claimant to {{have an interest in}} land, while Rylands does not; although exceptions to this rule have occasionally been made in private nuisance, in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, the House of Lords ruled <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> exceptions would transform nuisance from a tort against land to a tort against the person, and should not be permitted. John Murphy, Professor of Common Law at the University of Manchester, agrees with Nolan, and makes the additional point that nuisance is focused on a loss of enjoyment to land, not physical damage as Rylands is. It has also been concerned that the reasonable use test, which appears in nuisance, is not 9 to cases brought under Rylands.|$|E
25|$|The artists' {{colony in}} Aurora {{consisted}} of a log cabin tavern on U.S. Route 50, and a lodge and studios (of various sizes, and constructed of various kinds of materials) in the nearby woods. Among the artists, diplomats, philosophers, and writers staying at the colony were the painter Robert Gates and his wife, the physician David Lindsay Watson, the psychiatrist Sigurd Graven and his wife, and the former Latvian diplomat Arved Kundzin. Menke suggested <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ends meet, Wentzel use the Voigtländer camera his father had given him to photograph the local area and make postcards for sale. Wentzel converted an old pump house across Route 50 from the tavern into a darkroom, although light leaking through cracks in the walls, around the door, and from the ceiling forced Wentzel to primarily use it at night.|$|E

25|$|Mining at Løkken Verk had {{its roots}} back to 1633 when King Christian IV of Denmark–Norway had opened the mine. At this time all mining was a {{privilege}} of the king. Later, in the 1800s, the mine was privatised and owned by Løkken Kobber og Kisværks Interessentskab. In 1868 the local farmer and sawmill owner Wilhelm A. Thams and his accountant Christian Salvesen from Leith, Scotland founded the mining company Ørkedals Mining Company and bought {{a number of small}} mines around Løkken. In the early 1880s Wilhelm's grandson, Christian Thams returned from Switzerland and took over the running of the mining company. He realized <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money from mining, he had to purchase the largest mine of the all, but didn't succeed until 1896 when it no longer was feasible to manually pump out the water, and bought Løkken Mine.|$|E
25|$|In December 2010, Google {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{it easier}} for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an official Chrome MSI package. For business use {{it is helpful to}} have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized via transform files (.mst) but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI wrapper fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet their needs. The normal downloaded Chrome installer puts the browser in the user's local app data directory and provides invisible background updates, but the MSI package will allow installation at the system level, providing system administrators control over the update process it was formerly possible only when Chrome was installed using Google Pack. Google also created group policy objects to fine tune the behavior of Chrome in the business environment, for example by setting automatic updates interval, disabling auto-updates, and configuring a home page. Until version 24 the software is known not to be ready for enterprise deployments with roaming profiles or Terminal Server/Citrix environments.|$|E
25|$|The government, {{upon hearing}} of the SNM attack on Burao, began {{rounding}} up Isaaq men fearing they would assist an SNM attack on Hargeisa.

Isaaq military officers were one of the first groups to be arrested. According to Human Rights Watch's Africa Watch, some 700 Isaaqs from the armed forces were brought to one prison, this particular prison was already overcrowded, an additional 70 military personnel were then also brought for detention (40 from Gabiley and 30 from Hargeisa). Arrests were done at such scale <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> room for the Isaaqs detainees, all non-Isaaqs were released, including those sentenced to death or life imprisonment for murder and drug-related offences. Some of those released to make room for Isaaq detainees were given arms and made guards over Isaaq detainees whilst others joined the military.|$|E

25|$|Education is a {{critical}} input in human resource development and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the productivity and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force {{that is capable of}} leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It {{can be one of the}} most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of social justice but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability. Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of child labor and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.|$|E

The Marsdens were the least-developed characters when the pilot was produced; Robert Bathurst noted that David was [...] "set up as a post-Thatcherite boo-boy to represent all that is evil about materialism". He was concerned that the only character note in the script related to David's high salary and <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more than a brief cameo appearance in the series, the character needed to be significantly developed.

500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{features}} {{a range of}} genres; including pop, reggae, disco and dancehall, R, hip hop and [...] "punky" [...] electro-pop music. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly viewed it as [...] "an album so directly torn from Stefani's recent, much-documented romantic upheavals {{that it could be}} called 'The Ballad of Blake and Gavin". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic added that: [...] "Stefani spends roughly half of the record singing breezy songs of liberation." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented: [...] "While an artist converting personal tragedy into creative capital is hardly new, the nakedness with which Stefani assesses the ruins of her relationship is stark, especially compared to the self-proclaimed guilty pleasures of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape." [...] On writing about both relationships, Stefani claimed: [...] "I don't have any secrets; I don't have anything to hide. I haven't done anything wrong. I'm happy to share my story. [...] is really the only record I've written that's mostly happy; all the others are about heartbreak.

500|$|Second-century {{philosopher and}} theologian Irenaeus, after whom the theodicy is named, {{proposed}} a two-stage creation {{process in which}} humans require free will {{and the experience of}} evil to develop. Another early Christian theologian, Origen, presented a response to the problem of evil which cast the world as a schoolroom or hospital for the soul; theologian Mark Scott has argued that Origen, rather than Irenaeus, ought to be considered the father of this kind of theodicy. Friedrich Schleiermacher argued in the nineteenth century that God must necessarily create flawlessly, so this world must be the best possible world because it allows God's purposes to be naturally fulfilled. In 1966, philosopher John Hick discussed the similarities of the preceding theodicies, calling them all [...] "Irenaean". He supported the view that creation is incomplete and argued that the world is best placed for the full moral development of humans, as it presents genuine moral choices. British philosopher Richard Swinburne proposed <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a free moral choice, humans must have experience of the consequences of their own actions and that natural evil must exist to provide such choices.|$|E
