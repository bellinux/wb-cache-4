5|$|A {{number of}} lessons had been {{learned from the}} 1856 {{disaster}} <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> Church to continue the handcart system while avoiding another disaster. Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} view {{holds that}} unsafe medical practices in Africa during years following World War II, such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination, antibiotic, and anti-malaria treatment campaigns, were the initial vector <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> virus {{to adapt to}} humans and spread.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Indiana {{became the}} first state to adopt {{eugenics}} legislation, <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> involuntary sterilization of dangerous male criminals and the mentally defectives. It was never put in effect and in 1921 Indiana {{became the first}} state to rule such legislation unconstitutional when the Supreme Court of Indiana acted. A revised eugenics law was passed in 1927, and it remained in effect until 1974.|$|E

5|$|Kuhnke assumed {{command of}} the 33rd U-boat Flotilla upon {{arriving}} at Flensburg. He relinquished command of U-853 back to Frömsdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure U-853 was fitted with a Schnorchel, a retractable air intake and exhaust <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The Schnorchel reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Humanitarian Bowl Most Valuable Player honors {{were awarded}} to Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott, who rushed for 174yards, and Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who threw for 370yards. Each was the {{statistical}} leader at his respective position, and Scott scored Maryland's two final touchdowns {{to break the}} 28–28 stalemate. Scott also was able to help Maryland clinch the victory in the final minutes by rushing for a first down <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> team to run out the clock.|$|E
5|$|Until the mid-15th century, organs had no stop controls. Each manual {{controlled}} ranks {{at multiple}} pitches, {{known as the}} Blockwerk. Around 1450, controls were designed <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> ranks of the Blockwerk to be played individually. These devices were the forerunners of modern stop actions. The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained grouped together under a single stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.|$|E

5|$|With these defections, Massino was slapped with a {{superseding}} indictment charging {{him with}} seven additional murders: the three capos (this time {{for participation in}} the murder itself rather than conspiracy), Mirra, Bonventre, Infanti and Sciascia. Of particular interest was the Sciascia hit, which took place after a 1994 amendment to racketeering laws <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> death penalty for murder in aid of racketeering.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
5|$|By 1809 the territory's {{population}} had climbed to over 20,000. Congress passed legislation <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> Indiana Territory {{to elect a}} bicameral legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison to dissolve the existing one and created the Illinois Territory. The effect of these actions, was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half. The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party. The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803, and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction. They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state.|$|E

5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E
5|$|Four of the {{officers}} were {{of the line and}} responsible for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle, while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves. In Monitors turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two 11-inch Dahlgrens. Each gun was crewed by eight men. Thus, during battle, at least 18 men were present in the turret. In Worden's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> crew to work without getting in each other's way.|$|E

The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic {{the feeling of being}} hit.|$|E

5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind. As the bomb aimer turned a wind direction knob, the main portion of the sight was pushed {{to the left or}} right, indicating the required angle to fly. The CSBS was the first bombsight <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> bomber to approach the target from any direction, which offered greatly increased tactical freedom.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Prime Minister Ian Smith {{declared}} a unilateral independence <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> country's white minority {{to dominate the}} government. Great Britain pressured the Mexican state to deny Rhodesia {{an invitation to the}} 1968 Summer Olympics and supported a proposed African boycott of the Games that ultimately prevented Rhodesia from taking part. The nation was positioned to compete at the Olympics in 1972 and made it to the Olympic Village before a last-minute International Olympic Committee (IOC) decision barred its athletes from participating. The National Olympic Committee was expelled permanently in 1975 and Rhodesia never again participated under that banner. Rhodesia never took part in the Winter Olympic Games and no Rhodesian competitor ever won an Olympic medal, although it was able to continue competing at the Paralympics through 1972 and reached the podium on multiple occasions.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{the school}} {{received}} a donation of around 250 pieces of ancient, European, Middle Eastern, and Asian {{art from the}} Sponenburgh family. Alumnus Dan Schneider suggested to an art faculty member, Roger Hull, that the school should have a museum to display the university’s art collection in 1992. Then in 1994 Roger Hull made a presentation to the school’s trustees to push {{for the creation of}} an art museum. Over the next two years plans were developed and donations were made that led to the purchase of a building near campus for a museum. One large donation came from Hallie Ford and the Ford Family Foundation <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> purchase and remodel to move forward. The museum officially opened in 1998 with over 3,000 pieces of art, and was the second largest art museum in the state at that time.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Urlacher won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year {{after playing}} for a {{defensive}} team <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> fewest points per game, and created the most turnovers in the National Football Conference. Urlacher himself recorded at least 10 tackles in six consecutive games, while finishing {{the season with a}} team high 121 tackles. He was also credited as one of the team's leaders, whose audibles and experience helped develop several younger teammates. Urlacher led the Bears to an 11-5 record, marking their best finish since 2001. Urlacher played his second career playoff game against the Carolina Panthers on January 15, 2006. He recorded seven tackles and one interception in a 29–21 loss. Urlacher was also selected to the 2006 Pro Bowl, but declined the position on account of an injury.|$|E
5|$|In February 1946, the NHL officially {{stated that}} the trophy {{was to go to}} the team <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> fewest number of goals during the regular season. The goaltender playing the most games for that team would be awarded the Trophy. Manager Tommy Gorman of the Montreal Canadiens stated that if the trophy was awarded to his team, {{management}} would decide which of the Habs' two goaltenders (Paul Bibeault and Bill Durnan) would receive the trophy. However, at a banquet that October, NHL President Clarence Campbell indicated that while the league was considering changing the voting methods of the Calder, Hart, and Lady Byng Trophies, the criteria for the Vezina were not actually changing.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, strike force F-105 Thunderchiefs were {{equipped}} with QRC-160 radar jamming pods whose effectiveness virtually ended their losses to surface-to-air missiles. As a result, SAM attacks {{shifted to the}} Phantoms, unprotected because of a shortage of pods. To protect the F-4s, rules of engagement <b>that</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>the</b> MiGCAP to escort the strike force {{in and out of}} the target area were revised in December to restrict MiGCAP penetration to the edge of SAM coverage. MiG interceptions increased as a result, primarily by MiG-21s using high-speed hit-and-run tactics against bomb-laden F-105 formations, and although only two bombers had been lost, the threat to the force was perceived as serious.|$|E
