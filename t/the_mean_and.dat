5|$|Analysis of {{the letter}} {{preference}} data revealed a name-letter effect: an enhanced liking for letters in the participant's own name. Analysis of the number preference data revealed a birthday-number effect. For each number, the researchers first calculated the mean liking by participants {{who did not have}} that number in their birthday. These means served as a baseline. For each participant 50 relative liking scores were computed between the baseline of a number and the actual preference. The mean liking scores for different types of numbers showed that participants disproportionately preferred numbers in their birthday. The effect was stronger for higher numbers, over 12, than for lower numbers. The effect was weakest for males and their birth month (only a 0.03 difference from <b>the</b> <b>mean),</b> <b>and</b> strongest for females and the day of their birthday (0.77 difference with the mean). Overall, women showed a greater liking for the numbers in their birthday than men did.|$|E
5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description in terms of <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of}} time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.|$|E
5|$|The Marriott School {{student body}} {{comprises}} approximately 1,900 undergraduate and 1,100 graduate students. Nearly 75 {{percent of the}} students are bilingual and about 30 percent speak a third language, most having lived abroad while serving a mission for the LDS Church. Approximately 16 percent of students are international students, 66 percent are married, and whites (non-Hispanic) comprise 91 percent of the student body as of 2009. Eighty-seven percent of domestic students hail from the West. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> median ages of undergraduate students is 23, 21 percent of whom are female.

25|$|The normal {{distribution}} {{is the only}} absolutely continuous distribution whose cumulants beyond the first two (i.e., other than <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variance) are zero. It is also the continuous distribution with the maximum entropy for a specified mean and variance. Geary has shown, assuming that <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variance were finite, that the {{normal distribution}} is the only distribution where <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> variance are independent. This theorem was later reproved by Lukas who only assumed that the variance was finite.|$|E
25|$|Better approximations to <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> {{variance}} {{are given}} by Levin (1984, 1990), McCullagh and Nelder (1989), Liao (1992), and Eisinga and Pelzer (2011).
