5|$|We {{therefore}} {{hold that}} there was a riot, and <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> here charged were in the full heroic performance of their duties as citizens when this unfortunate event occurred. But the blood of these victims must be upon their own heads.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded in his diary that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men,</b> whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E
60|$|Further {{argument}} {{was interrupted by}} Tarzan, who, seeing <b>that</b> <b>these</b> strange <b>men</b> were not following him, had returned to their side.|$|R
60|$|It was for him, {{even though}} it had been against his wishes, <b>that</b> all <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were working, and for him would accrue the profits, if indeed there were any.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Sholto. But I {{am afraid}} of any unpleasantness arising {{between you and}} <b>that</b> <b>man.</b> <b>These</b> working <b>men</b> are so savage to their wives, and so jealous of gentlemen. I hardly like your going into his house at all." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{statements}} to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A {{in the days leading}} up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.|$|E
5|$|The {{biography}} of Geta states {{he was born}} at Mediolanum on 27 May; the year is not specified but it was 'in the suffect consulships of Severus and Vitellius'. He was actually born at Rome on 7 March 189; {{there was no such}} pair of suffect consuls in this or any other year; however, {{it has been suggested that}} the names for these persons be amended to be Severus and Vettulenus, and <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were suffect consuls sometime before 192.|$|E
5|$|As {{the last}} {{surviving}} {{member of the}} RNAS, and the last living {{founding member of the}} RAF, Allingham was an honoured guest when the British Air Services Memorial was unveiled at Saint-Omer on 11 September 2004. During the ceremony Allingham was given the Gold Medal of Saint-Omer, which marked the award of the Freedom of the Town. The group of RAF technical trainees that joined him at this ceremony continued to visit Allingham at his retirement home in Eastbourne, demonstrating the bond of respect <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> had for Allingham.|$|E
6000|$|She {{felt the}} {{stricken}} amaze <b>that</b> made <b>these</b> <b>men</b> silent and immovable. With level gaze averted she left them. Returning {{to the house}} and her room, she prepared for something--for what? To wait! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't logic, it wasn't even {{conventional}} morality, <b>that</b> impelled <b>these</b> <b>men.</b> It {{was something}} that was part of them. What's more, men of their type are more common than the cynics believe." ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>these</b> two <b>men,</b> Mascarille and Jodelet, are impostors whose real identities are as the valets {{of the first}} two men who were scorned and rejected.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, more Texian {{settlers}} joined the group at La Bahía. Many of them were from Refugio, a sprawling settlement that was furthest from Matagorda. Historian Hobart Huson speculates <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were the last to receive word of the planned attack. Austin ordered that 100men remain at Goliad, {{under the command of}} Dimmitt, while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Béxar. Collinsworth returned to Matagorda to recruit additional soldiers, but on October 14 the remaining Texians at Goliad began the march towards Béxar.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and pointed it at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E
25|$|It {{is to be}} regretted <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> {{should have}} escaped unpunished. If the severest penalty of the law was inflicted on all crews of slavers, it would prove a {{considerable}} check to men engaged in that nefarious traffic.|$|E
5000|$|The coroner came. He found <b>that</b> <b>these</b> six <b>men</b> {{had been}} murdered in their beds while they peacefully slept; shot by gunmen in the employ of the coal company." ...|$|R
60|$|Tom {{had been}} feeling {{a good deal}} ashamed of his nervousness, and was much {{relieved}} at hearing <b>that</b> <b>these</b> seasoned <b>men</b> had felt somewhat the same as he had done.|$|R
6000|$|Tom {{began to}} feel <b>that</b> <b>these</b> two <b>men</b> were exhibiting a very unseemly curiosity. There {{seemed to be no}} satiating their desire for information. [...] "It creates a vacuum," [...] he cried desperately.|$|R
25|$|Hans Turley, using {{literary}} evidence, {{suggests that}} the deviant nature of piracy went hand-in-hand with their perceived homosexuality. Both Turley and Burg note that this homosexual behavior in no way implied <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were effeminate. On the contrary, their contemporaries considered them hypermasculine.|$|E
25|$|The still-older notes, {{designed}} by Eliel Saarinen, {{were introduced in}} 1922. They also depicted people, but these were generic men and women, and did not represent any specific individuals. The fact <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> and women were depicted nude caused a minor controversy at the time.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{they thought}} Caux & Castillou were Spanish because they used Latin words for packing, such as secundo and aparejo. It {{is not hard}} to {{determine}} where these words originated when one remembers <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> grew up {{at the base of the}} Pyrennes Mountains, which is the border of Spain & France.|$|E
60|$|Then one day, unexpectedly, {{they came}} upon two trappers by a beaver-dam. Neale was {{overcome}} by his emotion; he sensed <b>that</b> from <b>these</b> <b>men</b> he would learn something. The first look from them {{told him that his}} errand was known.|$|R
6000|$|The {{greater part}} of all <b>that</b> <b>these</b> two <b>men</b> did is hastily and [...] incompletely done; and all that they did {{on a large scale}} in [...] color is in the best qualities of it perished.|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably {{not much}} yourself; but I thought <b>that</b> as <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were your father's tenants, {{you might feel}} unwilling that they should turn murderers; and as I am your father's friend, you might, for his sake, wish to prevent them murdering me." ...|$|R
25|$|The paṇḍaka is {{a complex}} {{category}} that is variously defined in different Buddhist texts. In the earliest texts, the word seems {{to refer to a}} socially stigmatized class of promiscuous, passive, probably transvestite men, who were possibly prostitutes with other males. Paisarn Likhitpreechakul argue <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> are grouped together as special types of those suffering impotence due to seminal absence/deficiency rather than gender roles.|$|E
25|$|This {{new number}} {{was based on}} {{information}} obtained from two imprisoned Kiowa chiefs at Fort Cobb who faced death by hanging. In view of their predicament, it seems likely <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> would have said anything to avoid the gallows. But such skepticism is not warranted {{in the case of}} the Washita prisoners. The Cheyenne women were allowed to mingle freely with the officers and knew many of them on an intimate basis. They were assured good treatment and had no apparent reason to distort their statements about dead kinsmen.|$|E
25|$|Policies were {{established}} {{to cope with}} men unable to pass physical examinations. It was determined <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were to be mustered into Federal service, their status remaining {{the same as those}} men passing the physical examination. After being mustered into Federal service, the men who did not pass the physical examination were discharged and given free passage home. The 1st Arkansas Infantry had a discharge rate because of physical defects of only 12 per cent; when the 1st Arkansas Infantry was mobilized for duty on the Mexican border the discharge rate was 50 per cent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let it burn me up," [...] replied Imbozwi with ineffable contempt, [...] "and I {{will believe}} <b>that</b> <b>these</b> white <b>men</b> are magicians worthy {{to be kept}} alive, and not common slave-traders such as we have often heard of." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 18 June - Two {{people were}} killed in sectarian {{violence}} within the Pakistani city of Karachi. It was later reported <b>that</b> <b>these</b> two people included both a doctor, as well as a soldier and <b>that</b> <b>these</b> two <b>men</b> appeared to have targeted because they were Shia Muslims.|$|R
60|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{the power of}} <b>that</b> name. <b>These</b> <b>men</b> looked doubtful--but paralyzed, all the same. They were quite silent for a moment; then one of them said--with the reverence in his voice which is always present in a Scotchman's tone when he utters the name.|$|R
25|$|British {{authorities}} quickly realised <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> {{could not}} just be dumped into any old armaments factory because of two problems – the obvious one of language (most Belgian soldiers spoke little or no English) and totally different working practices. Thus {{it was decided to}} man {{one or two of the}} factories with only Belgians and put purely Belgian management teams in charge, with a British supervisory team alongside to monitor the financial aspects of the job. After all, it was the British government who was paying for everything, even if the Belgian government was finding the workers. Birtley was chosen as one of these sites.|$|E
25|$|Policies were {{established}} {{to cope with}} men unable to pass physical examinations. It was determined <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> were to be mustered into Federal service, their status remaining {{the same as those}} men passing the physical examination. After being mustered into Federal service, the men who were unable to pass the physical examination were given discharges and furnished with transportation to their homes. The 1st Arkansas Infantry was proud of its record of only 12 per cent being discharged because of physical defects. When the 1st Arkansas Infantry was mobilized for duty on the Mexican border 50 per cent of its men were rejected because of Physical defects.|$|E
25|$|Garry Adelman has countered the {{argument}} that a Confederate capture of Little Round Top would have badly hurt the Union effort. Examining {{the number of troops}} available in the vicinity in the late afternoon, he determined that at most 2,650 Confederates could have been available to defend the hill after capturing it, and <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>men</b> would have been exhausted from combat and short on ammunition. In contrast, 11,600 fresh Union reinforcements were available within a mile, primarily from Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's VI Corps. In addition, the value of Little Round Top as an artillery position has been overstatedthe shape of {{the crest of the hill}} forces guns to be placed one behind the other, limiting their effectiveness when engaging targets directly to the north, such as the Union line on Cemetery Ridge.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{the traders}} serve {{the rest of}} Pern is by {{allowing}} Craft Journeymen or Masters to travel with them so <b>that</b> <b>these</b> talented <b>men</b> and women {{do not have to}} take the long and sometimes dangerous journey by themselves.|$|R
50|$|The Methodist Preachers rode {{across the}} Alleghenies with the pioneers, and many historians agree <b>that</b> <b>these</b> Methodist <b>men</b> of God, the {{remarkable}} breed of men {{known as the}} circuit riders, were greatly responsible for bringing order to the new frontier.|$|R
6000|$|... "But Stephen says no," [...] said Gerard: [...] "he says <b>that</b> <b>these</b> great <b>men</b> {{have never}} {{made use of}} us but as tools; and that the people never can have their rights until they produce {{competent}} champions from their own order." ...|$|R
