My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and people seem <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> works.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Rusty, a house cat, {{runs into}} a ThunderClan apprentice, Graypaw, {{in the forest}} in his backyard. Rusty, however, does not run away, but fights back. Bluestar and Lionheart, Graypaw's mentor, having watched the confrontation, invite Rusty to join ThunderClan. Rusty asks <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> over, and after talking it over with his best friend and {{neighbor}} Smudge, decides {{to go with the}} Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm meet him the next day and lead him to the camp. Due to his house cat past, some members of the Clan are hostile towards Rusty. This hostility eventually leads Rusty to attack Longtail, losing his collar in the ensuing fight. Bluestar then ends the fight and announces that Rusty has earned his Clan name, Firepaw. He forms a strong bond with Graypaw, and with Ravenpaw, an apprentice to the ambitious warrior Tigerclaw.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} her illness has been debated by contemporaries and historians. Secretary of Giovanni Francesco Commendone claimed that her illness {{was caused by}} her use of {{contraceptive}} measures. Radziwiłłs in their letters debated whether she had a sexually transmitted disease. There were persistent rumors that she was poisoned by Bona Sforza. Modern historians tend <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was cervical or ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Media {{across the}} nation began speculating whether the vote was not an {{indication}} of dissatisfaction with the PUP administration; most seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was. Most political analysts credited the UDP with smart selection, timely deduction and ruthless campaigning, whereas the PUP {{did not seem to}} put their all into the campaign, perhaps wiped out from the protests the previous year.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

25|$|The {{second part}} is signed by {{those from the}} first signing and in {{addition}} by professors Ulrich Kridweiss of Esslingen, Konrad Vorn of Kampen, Cornelius Pays of Breda and Dietrich of Balveren (Bummel). Signatories attest that: 1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by {{the authority of the}} Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge that they think it right to carry out their office zealously.2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works with them is not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but consonant with the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, {{to the extent that they}} can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.4) All princes and Catholics should be urged <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> right to assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.|$|E
25|$|Cartagena, {{one of the}} {{principal}} cities in the New World Spanish Empire, {{was one of the first}} to rebel against the Spanish yoke. In the early 19th century, a few white Criollos, e.g., locally born people of Spanish ancestry, were given a classical education, some of them in Santa Fe, and a few even in Europe, and had begun to excel in literature and the arts, as well as professions such as medicine, law and the natural sciences. In the course of their studies, they had been exposed to liberal ideas of liberty and equality, and as they increasingly developed an identity as Hispanic Americans, they chafed at their secondary status in the Spanish colonial caste system to the Peninsulares, or Spanish-born Spaniards. Consequently, many of the Criollos began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was time to take the reins of government into their own hands, whatever the outcome of the war with Spain that was sure to result. They did not act immediately, however, as they awaited the right moment to strike. Meanwhile, the long-established colonial social order in Cartagena was being undermined by the ideas of the libertarians (meaning the patriotic defenders of liberty). The final blow to bring down the royalist government, the coup de grace dreamed of by the patriots, would not be accomplished easily, as the city was a formidable base of Spanish power, and had entrenched political, military, religious and administrative bureaucracies.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

Mercedes began working as an escort; Metcalfe explaining, [...] "Mercedes signs up with an escort agency to try to earn some quick cash.

500|$|Stephen Doig, a {{professor}} at Arizona State University, estimated that 1.1 millionpeople attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken {{a little less than}} 45minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. In spite of his crowd estimate, Doig stated that [...] "if I had to bet, I would say the [...] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [...] {{or any of the other}} things... I'm wholly prepared <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was the largest crowd." [...] Approximately 1.2million people had attended the second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky was {{inspired}} to reach beyond Russia with his music, according to Maes and Taruskin. His exposure to Western music, they write, encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> belonged not just to Russia but to the world at large. Volkov adds that this mindset made him think seriously about Russia's place in European musical culture—the first Russian composer to do so. It steeled him {{to become the first}} Russian composer to personally acquaint foreign audiences with his own works, Warrack writes, {{as well as those of}} other Russian composers. In his biography of Tchaikovsky, Anthony Holden recalls the dearth of Russian classical music before Tchaikovsky's birth, then places the composer's achievements into historical perspective: [...] "Twenty years after Tchaikovsky's death, in 1913, Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring erupted onto the musical scene, signalling Russia's arrival into 20th-century music. Between these two very different worlds Tchaikovsky's music became the sole bridge." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{started their}} defence {{of the league}} {{championship}} at home to Queens Park Rangers on 17 August 1991. It was the visitors who had led the match right from the 15th minute, but for Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson to earn his side a point after equalising well into stoppage time. The draw according to The Independent showcased the need for reinforcements: [...] "...not just to improve the squad, but also to cause a buzz in the dressing room". Arsenal were beaten 3–1 by Everton at Goodison Park three days after and lost to Aston Villa by the same scoreline. Graham dismissed any talk of crisis, saying [...] "I have been in football too long <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{is going to be}} nice and comfortable every season" [...] and felt the performance at Villa showed signs of improvement compared to the earlier league fixtures. A 2–0 win at home to Luton Town was followed by victory against Manchester City, where Alan Smith and Limpar scored a goal apiece.|$|E

500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I {{can look at it}} now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1943 Vaughan Williams {{conducted}} {{the premiere of}} his Fifth Symphony at the Proms. Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth, and led some commentators <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a symphonic valediction. William Glock wrote that it was [...] "like {{the work of a}} distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language". The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war, Thanksgiving for Victory, was marked by what the critic Edward Lockspeiser called the composer's characteristic avoidance of [...] "any suggestion of rhetorical pompousness". Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his Sixth Symphony (1948), described by the critic Gwyn Parry-Jones as [...] "one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century", opening with a [...] "primal scream, plunging the listener immediately into a world of aggression and impending chaos." [...] Coming as it did near the start of the Cold War, many critics thought its pianissimo last movement a depiction of a nuclear-scorched wasteland. The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories: [...] "It never seems to occur to people that a man might just want to write a piece of music." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Aden's {{most notable}} storylines {{highlighted}} {{the issue of}} sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles {{to cope with the}} sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the [...] "taboo issue". Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline [...] "one hundred percent justice" [...] because there are people, [...] "more than we probably realise" [...] in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was unrealistic. Lasance said he had to come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes though [...] "the huge rebellion years" [...] and the subsequent attempts to [...] "reconnect with those people who had betrayed you." [...] Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used [...] "haunting" [...] techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline to show US agents his acting abilities.|$|E
