5|$|After {{the success}} of Platoon (1986), Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to {{research}} and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. The director pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in Crime and Punishment. The director {{had been thinking about}} <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> movie as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.|$|E
500|$|Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald argues that, {{although}} Is This It provided substantial musical influence, {{its biggest}} success was in revamping {{the music industry}} and making A delegates scout and promote alternative bands. Gunn links the success of alternative music in British charts throughout the 2000s to the album, but notes that [...] "the copyists" [...] could never match the attention to detail and heartfelt emotion of the Strokes. Mulholland adds that even the pop stars of that decade who rediscovered disco, electro, and synthpop owe a debt to the record, because its commercial success [...] "made every forgotten art-pop experiment of the late 70s and early 80s instantly hip and ripe for reinvention". Hamish MacBain of NME writes that [...] "the western world has moved on, and is now swinging {{to the tune of}} Is This It", while Pitchforks Joe Colly suggests that [...] "you only capture <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lightning in a bottle once". Gunn concludes that, while the status of the album as the 2000s' most influential guitar record may be [...] "a double-edged sword" [...] because of poor quality copyists, its status as the decade's best pop album should not be in doubt.|$|E

2500|$|Giving Beowulf {{three out}} of four stars, Roger Ebert argues that the film is a satire of the {{original}} poem. Time magazine critic Richard Corliss describes the film as one with [...] "power and depth" [...] and suggests that the [...] "effects scenes look realer , more integrated into the visual fabric, because they meet the traced-over live-action elements halfway. It all suggests that <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moviemaking is more than a stunt. By imagining the distant past so vividly, Zemeckis and his team prove that character capture has a future." [...] Corliss later named it the 10th best film of 2007. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers argues that “The eighth-century Beowulf, goosed into twenty-first century life by a screenplay from sci-fi guru Neil Gaiman and Pulp Fictions Roger Avary, will have you jumping out of your skin and begging for more... I've never seen a 3-D movie pop with this kind of clarity and oomph. It's outrageously entertaining." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 9, 710, Li Chongfu {{arrived at}} Luoyang {{and took over}} Pei's mansion, and the {{officials}} at Luoyang, surprised, largely began to flee. Li Chongfu began {{to try to take}} command of the imperial troops in Luoyang, but the official Li Yong (李邕) persuaded the imperial guards to reject Li Chongfu, and when Li Chongfu arrived at imperial guards' camps, they fired arrows at him. His attacks on the governmental offices were also repelled. He thereafter fled and tried to hide, but the next day, with troops closing in on his position, he jumped into a canal and drowned. Zheng tried to flee by putting on women's clothes and changing his hair style into a woman's hairstyle, but was nevertheless captured. When both he and Zhang were interrogated, he was so fearful that he was shivering and unable to answer any questions. Zhang, who answered questions normally, commented as he looked on Zheng, [...] "I deserve defeat for starting a rebellion with <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man." [...] Both Zheng and Zhang were taken to a busy marketplace and beheaded in public.|$|E

2500|$|Foster the People {{issued its}} first {{commercial}} non-single release in January 2011, a self-titled EP featuring [...] "Pumped Up Kicks", [...] "Houdini", and [...] "Helena Beat" [...] that {{was intended to}} hold fans over until their first studio album, Torches, was completed. Fans who purchased the EP through the iTunes Store were able to apply it towards the purchase of their full-length debut album. The EP drew the attention of organizers of March's South by Southwest festival, as well as executives looking to license music for upcoming season finales of television series. Columbia senior director of creative licensing Jonathan Palmer said, [...] "The plan helped {{us a great deal}} to set up more opportunities rather than chasing the release date. So by the time we put the record out in May, we had already placed several songs." [...] Half of Torches songs were licensed—among them are: [...] "Pumped Up Kicks" [...] (Gossip Girl, The Vampire Diaries, Friends with Benefits, Entourage), [...] "Houdini" [...] (Gossip Girl); [...] "Helena Beat" [...] (The Vampire Diaries); [...] "Don't Stop (Color on the Walls)" [...] (Suits, Nissan Motors commercial); and [...] "Call It What You Want" [...] (FIFA 12). Palmer commented, [...] "I haven't seen <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> range of song licenses from one album since we worked the first Ting Tings record three-and-a-half years ago.

2500|$|The {{result was}} not {{received}} particularly well by the Church gazette Glas Koncila editor Ivan Miklenić, who stated Josipović's legitimacy, but first {{pointed out that}} he was elected by {{less than a third of}} the total population, and claimed that he was supported by [...] "obscure power centers". He concluded that the election is the result of a policy of continuation and [...] "not a democratic breakthrough". The secular Jutarnji list editor Davor Butković lambasted that opinion, saying he was personally a Catholic but was offended by the notion that the Church would undermine the election result. Having a third of the electorate's votes is not relevant because not even the late Franjo Tuđman or even any single Government was ever elected with more than a half of the electorate. He concluded by asking why the Church is [...] "insulting its faithful who voted for Josipović" [...] and saying that as long as <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stance persists, the Croatian churches will [...] "remain empty other than on major holidays". The secular Večernji list chief commentator Milan Ivkošić once again called on Josipović to stay away from former President Mesić's [...] "selective finger-pointing" [...] which in his opinion particularly impacted the President's relations with Kaptol, in addition to a perceived [...] "complaisance in the defence of Croatian national interests". He also noted that the new President remains [...] "marked" [...] by his agnosticism in relation to the right-wing voting body, but called on the Croatians to determine a basic consensus and avoid any accusations of [...] "treason". Josipović indeed explicitly stated that he [...] "will not step into that whole polemic" [...] and that he has no comment.|$|E
