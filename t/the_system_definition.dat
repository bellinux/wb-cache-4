All required resources {{for a given}} application are managed as a unified system; all the information for deploying and managing runtime services levels for the resources required by a given application are captured top-down in a single system definition. In contrast, in an infrastructure-centric or bottom-up approach, resources (servers, storage, and network resources) are managed individually.

50|$|Next to {{specifying the}} {{arrangement}} of processes, stocks, and flows in <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>definition,</b> the practitioner also needs to indicate the scale and the indicator element or material of the system studied.The spatial scale describes the geographic entity that is covered by the system. A system representing a certain industrial sector {{can be applied to}} the USA, China, certain world regions, or the world as a whole. The temporal scale describes the point in time or the time span for which the system is quantified. The indicator element or material of the system is the physical entity that is measured and for which the mass balance holds. As the name says, an indicator element is a certain chemical element such as cadmium or a substance such as CO2. In general, a material or a product can also be used as indicator as long as a process balance can be established for it. Examples of more general indicators are goods such as passenger cars, materials like steel, or other physical quantities such as energy.|$|E
