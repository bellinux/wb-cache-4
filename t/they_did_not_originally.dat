25|$|Cues act {{as guides}} {{to what the}} person is {{supposed}} to remember. A cue can be virtually anything that may act as a reminder, e.g. a smell, song, color, place etc. In contrast to free recall, the subject is prompted to remember a certain item on the list or remember the list in a certain order. Cued recall also plays into free recall because when cues are provided to a subject, they will remember items on the list that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originally</b> recall without a cue. Tulving explained this phenomenon in his research. When he gave participants associative cues to items that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originally</b> recall and that {{were thought to be}} lost to memory, the participants were able to recall the item.|$|E
500|$|The group {{worked well}} with German {{producer}} Conny Plank on Whodini, and {{were trying to}} find a similar producer. According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided that we needed to get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originally</b> consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E

It is implied once that Eric tells people (such as Rachel) that [...] "Feeny" [...] is his grandfather, not just his neighbor. Eric also coins the [...] "Feeny call," [...] which becomes a popular ongoing joke throughout the series and carries on into the spin-off, Girl Meets World.

With this aim she examined the types of records, particularly the distinction between lamenta de intus and lamenta de foris in the 15 th century. The author underlines the importance of the researcher’s knowledge of the original organization of the judicial series for the purpose of better economization of the investigation and accuracy of interpretation. She also points to the great value of these sources as compared to other towns in medieval Dalmatia but in Italy as well.

500|$|Every {{aspect of}} the film was {{constantly}} analyzed, with storylines, jokes, and characters regularly being rewritten. Although most animated films <b>do</b> <b>not</b> make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions, The Simpsons Movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May, {{two months before the}} film was released. James L. Brooks noted, [...] "70 percent of the things in —based on where we were eight weeks ago—are no longer in the movie." [...] Groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut. Various new characters were created, and then cut because <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> contribute enough. <b>Originally</b> Marge was the character who had the prophetic vision in church. The writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to Grampa. The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He was previously named Dexter and Adrien, and his appearance was completely altered. One idea was to have Milhouse act as Lisa's love interest, but the writers realized [...] "the audience was not as familiar with [...] long-standing crush on [...] as [...] thought". A car chase in which Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with [...] "more emotional and realistic" [...] scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace.|$|R

Schafer said when they originally were about to secure the rights to Grim Fandango from LucasArts to make the remaster, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originally</b> have plans to redo the other LucasArts adventure games, but with the passionate response they got on {{the news of the}} Grim Fandango remaster, they decided to continue these efforts. Schafer described getting the rights to Day of the Tentacle a [...] "miracle" [...] though aided by {{the fact that many of}} the executives in the legal rights chain had fond memories of playing these games and helped to secure the rights. Schafer has expressed interest in continuing to restore these older titles, listing Full Throttle as his next goal, which is also confirmed to release in the future. 2 Player Productions, which has worked before with Double Fine to document their game development process, also created a mini-documentary for Day of the Tentacle Remastered, which included a visit to the Skywalker Ranch, where LucasArts games were originally developed, where much of the original concept art and digital files for the game and other LucasArts adventure games were archived.|$|E
2500|$|There {{remains the}} {{possibility}} that Alba is simply a Gaelic translation of the Pictish name for Pictland. Both the Welsh and the Irish use archaic words for Briton to describe the Picts. It is very likely therefore that the Picts did so themselves; or if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originally,</b> they came to do so. In which case the Pictish for Pictland would have been either {{the same as their}} word for Britain, or an obsolete term. Alba was exactly this kind of word in Old Irish. It is therefore plausible that Alba is simply a Gaelic translation. The name change is first registered {{at the very beginning of}} the tenth century, [...] not long before Constantine II is alleged to have Scotticised the [...] "Pictish" [...] Church, and at the height of Viking raids. Later records, especially the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba and other documents in the Poppleton Manuscript, tell us that the Picts were simply conquered and annihilated by king Kenneth MacAlpin (Cináed mac Ailpín). This is the traditional explanation, and the one repeated by many historians. [...] The only thing which is certain is that before 900, [...] the Cruithentuath (Gaelic for Pictland), and perhaps Fortriu, became Gaelic-speaking Alba.|$|E
60|$|In {{so far as}} {{this notion}} has any {{connection}} at all with reason, it seems to originate in confounding two entirely distinct evils, to which a paper currency is liable. One is, the insolvency of the issuers; which, if the paper is grounded on their credit—if it makes any promise of payment in cash, either on demand or at any future time—of course deprives the paper of any value which it derives from the promise. To this evil paper credit is equally liable, however moderately used; and against it, a proviso that all issues should be “founded on property,” as for instance that notes should only be issued on the security of some valuable thing, expressly pledged for their redemption, would really be efficacious as a precaution. But the theory takes no account of another evil, which is incident to the notes of the most solvent firm, company, or government; that of being depreciated in value from being issued in excessive quantity. The assignats, during the French Revolution, were {{an example of a}} currency grounded on these principles. The assignats “represented” an immense amount of highly valuable property, namely, the lands of the crown, the church, the monasteries, and the emigrants; amounting possibly to half the territory of France. They were, in fact, orders or assignments on this mass of land. The revolutionary government had the idea of “coining” these lands into money; but, to do them justice, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originally</b> contemplate the immense multiplication of issues to which they were eventually driven by the failure of all other financial resources. They imagined that the assignats would come rapidly back to the issuers in exchange for land, and that {{they should be able to}} reissue them continually until the lands were all disposed of, without having at any time more than a very moderate quantity in circulation. Their hope was frustrated: the land did not sell so quickly as they expected; buyers were not inclined to invest their money in possessions which were likely to be resumed without compensation if the revolution succumbed; the bits of paper which represented land, becoming prodigiously multiplied, could no more keep up their value than the land itself would have done if it had all been brought to market at once; and the result was that it at last required an assignat of five hundred francs to pay for a cup of coffee.|$|E

Moreover, a group of three pits used for drying hides in the tannery is located near the southeastern corner of the property. Also located on the property are a barn, a garage, an outhouse, and two wooden sheds; as all were built or rebuilt in the twentieth century, <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> contribute to the house's significance {{in the way that the}} previous house sites and the tanning pits do.|$|R

5000|$|Migration from Thailand to Canada has {{gradually}} increased since the 1950s, {{when a few}} Thai students first came to study at Canadian universities. Migration has since continued at a slow pace, with a brief increase after the 1997 financial crisis in Thailand, which resulted in more Thais looking for work and educational opportunities overseas. [...] Thai immigrants who choose to remain in Canada have generally immigrated to study, {{to take up a}} business, or to marry a Canadian. Many of them claim that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>originally</b> intend to stay in Canada.
