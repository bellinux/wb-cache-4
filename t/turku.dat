5|$|Early {{studies on}} the timing of {{migration}} began in 1749 in Finland, with Johannes Leche of <b>Turku</b> collecting the dates of arrivals of spring migrants.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{several other}} bones, {{including}} a jawless skull, {{were found in}} a sealed closet in the Cathedral of <b>Turku.</b> These are {{also referred to as}} Henry's relics in popular media and even by the church, even though that designation remains speculative and the bones may have belonged to some other saint. The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of <b>Turku.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{high-profile}} start of Henry's cultus, {{it took more}} than 100 years for the veneration of Saint Henry to gain widespread acceptance throughout Sweden. As of 1344 there were no relics of the bishop in the Cathedral of Uppsala. According to one biographer, Henry's veneration was rare outside the Diocese of <b>Turku</b> throughout the 14th century. Vadstena Abbey near Linköping seems to have {{played a key role in}} establishment of Henry's legend elsewhere in Sweden in the early 15th century. Henry never received the highest totum duplex veneration in Uppsala nor was he made a patronus of the church there, which status he had both in <b>Turku</b> and Nousiainen.|$|E
5|$|Growing up in <b>Turku,</b> Finland, Salo had {{aspirations}} {{of playing with}} the Finnish national team, rather than the NHL. He idolized Jari Kurri and was more familiar with other Finnish players, such as Esa Peltonen and Heikki Riihiranta, than he was with any NHL stars.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{was born}} in <b>Turku,</b> Finland, to {{carpenter}} Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi's siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central <b>Turku,</b> where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi {{and his friends were}} inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi's father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in <b>Turku.</b> He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.|$|E
5|$|Henry and his {{crusade to}} Finland {{were also a}} part of the legend of King Eric. The {{appendix}} of the early 13th century Västgötalagen, which has a short description of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of <b>Turku</b> in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from <b>Turku.</b> Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{allegedly}} buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something that was}} thought to be his bones—were transported to <b>Turku</b> in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the National Board of Antiquities {{claimed the}} relic {{as its own}} {{on the basis of}} the Finnish law on ancient objects, though it was contradicted by the Lutheran Cathedral Parish of <b>Turku.</b> However, the Board {{ultimately}} had the relic relocated to the Cathedral of Saint Henry in Helsinki, the oldest church in the modern Catholic Diocese of Finland, because Catholics still actively venerate the relic as sacred. Since then, it has been located inside the altar of the Catholic cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Paavo Nurmi Marathon, held {{annually}} since 1969, is {{the oldest}} marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest. In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi's hometown of <b>Turku</b> since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957. Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi. A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987. The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively. The Nurmi bill {{was replaced by a}} new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993. In 1997, a historic stadium in <b>Turku</b> was renamed the Paavo Nurmi Stadium. Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy's records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi's record on the 3000 m and Zátopek's record on the 10,000 m. In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman's 1974 novel Marathon Man as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi. The opera on Nurmi, Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream., written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000. In a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar.|$|E
5|$|Whatever the case, the bishop's grave {{seems to}} have been traced to Nousiainen latest after his {{elevation}} to sainthood. A number of medieval documents mention that the bishop's grave continued to be located in the local church, presumably meaning that all the bones had not been translated to <b>Turku.</b> The church was later adorned with a grandiose 15th century cenotaph, whose replica {{can be found in the}} National Museum of Finland in Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|After {{developing}} {{his skills}} with the junior club of his hometown, <b>Turku,</b> Finland, Salo turned professional with TPS of the SM-Liiga in 1994–95. He appeared in seven games, recording a goal and two assists {{in his first}} season in the SM-Liiga. The following campaign, he recorded a Finnish career-high 14 assists and 21 points over 47 games. In the off-season, Salo was selected by the Ottawa Senators with their last selection in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft, 239th overall in the ninth round. He remained in Finland for two more seasons upon being drafted. He improved from seven goals to nine in 1996–97. The following season, he transferred from TPS to Jokerit. In his lone season with the Helsinki-based team, he tallied three goals and eight points over 35 games.|$|E
5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland {{had demanded}} to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into {{an attack on}} Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, <b>Turku</b> and Lahti. During a night session {{on the same day}} the Finnish parliament decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the bones}} in <b>Turku</b> were still in place in 1720 when they were catalogued for a {{transfer}} to Saint Petersburg during the Russian occupation of Finland in the Great Northern War. The man behind the idea was the infamous Swedish Count Gustaf Otto Douglas who had defected to the Russian side {{during the war and}} {{was in charge of the}} grim occupation of Finland. What happened to the bones after that, remains unknown. According to some sources, the Russian vessel transporting the relics sank on the way. However, it is generally acknowledged that a piece of Henry's ulna had been placed in Bishop Hemming's reliquarium that was built in 1514 and treasured in the cathedral. Also enclosed was a piece of parchment stating the bone belonged to Henry. During the restoration work of the cathedral, the relic was relocated to the National Board of Antiquities.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi {{made his}} {{international}} debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He {{took his first}} medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain {{the only time that}} Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden's Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi's success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in <b>Turku.</b> Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|The first {{finished}} {{train was}} unveiled {{to the press}} on 14 October 1994, and the first two trainsets started their regular test traffic on 27 November 1995 between Helsinki and <b>Turku</b> on the coastal track. Test traffic was stopped only after three months, {{at the end of}} February 1996, due to technical difficulties with the trains. Testing later resumed, and VR announced in 1997 that it would start normal operations with the Pendolino despite electrical problems. The ability of the train to cope with the Finnish winter was put into question, but VR denied that coldness had been a factor in the electrical failures.|$|E
5|$|A bronze {{statue of}} Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925. The {{original}} is {{held at the}} art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in <b>Turku,</b> in Jyväskylä, {{in front of the}} Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship Vasa when it was lifted {{from the bottom of the}} sea in 1961. Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work Löpare (Runners) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide. Boken om Nurmi (The Book about Nurmi), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman. Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939, while Finnair named its first DC-8 Paavo Nurmi in 1969. Nurmi's former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.|$|E
5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as {{the year of the}} crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact that}} also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to <b>Turku</b> cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|There are 53 {{municipalities}} of Finland in which Finnish {{is not the}} sole official language. In Finland, as of December 31, 2013, 89.3% of the population speak Finnish, 5.3% Swedish and 0.04% Sami languages. Both Finnish and Swedish are official languages of Finland. Officially, a municipality is bilingual if the minority language group consists of at least 8% of the population, or at least 3,000 speakers. A previously bilingual municipality remains so if the linguistic minority proportion drops below 8%, up to 6%. If it drops below 6%, {{it is possible for}} the municipality to remain bilingual by government decree, on the recommendation of the municipal council, for a further ten years. Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital Helsinki and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, <b>Turku.</b> On the Åland archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in Ostrobothnia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Turku</b> is {{the only}} city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: <b>Turku</b> Central, Port of <b>Turku,</b> and Kupittaa.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Ages, <b>Turku</b> was {{the seat}} of the Bishop of <b>Turku</b> (a title later {{upgraded}} to Archbishop of <b>Turku),</b> covering the then eastern half of the Kingdom of Sweden (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if <b>Turku</b> had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the Åbo bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, The Royal Academy of <b>Turku,</b> was founded in <b>Turku.</b> <b>Turku</b> was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.|$|E
25|$|<b>Turku</b> {{is one of}} {{only two}} cities in Finland to have an {{established}} international school (the other city being Helsinki). <b>Turku</b> International School, located in the eastern district of Varissuo, has been operating since 2003. By an agreement signed between the city of <b>Turku</b> and the University of <b>Turku,</b> Turun normaalikoulu takes care of the teaching in the international school.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2004, the <b>Turku</b> region (including the {{economic}} districts of <b>Turku</b> and Åboland) had a population of 319,632, out of which 174,824 people {{lived in the city}} of <b>Turku.</b> The city's population density is 718 inhabitants per square kilometre.|$|E
25|$|Rail {{traffic to}} and from <b>Turku</b> is handled by the Finnish {{national}} carrier, VR. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the <b>Turku</b> Central railway station in Pohjola, and two smaller stations in Kupittaa and the Port of <b>Turku.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Turku</b> Bus Station and the <b>Turku</b> Central {{railway station}} are {{currently}} located in different places. The City of <b>Turku</b> {{is planning to}} combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long distance buses.|$|E
25|$|Due to its location, <b>Turku</b> is {{a notable}} {{commercial}} and passenger seaport with over three million passengers {{traveling through the}} Port of <b>Turku</b> each year to Stockholm and Mariehamn.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{the city}} of <b>Turku</b> ordered a more {{detailed}} study to be made about the way public transport systems are developed in the City Region of <b>Turku</b> in the future, comparing light rail- and bus-based alternatives. The goal is to present a solution {{for the creation of}} an efficient, attractive and uniform public transport system for <b>Turku</b> and the neighbouring cities. An intermediary report for this study was completed in December 2008, which recommended a somewhat different light rail system from the 2002 study. In the 2008 study the line to Naantali was abandoned but a more extensive network within central <b>Turku</b> was proposed, including the recreation of tracks that had been used by the old <b>Turku</b> tram system.|$|E
25|$|A more {{exclusive}} {{definition for}} the urban {{area is the}} city region of <b>Turku</b> with a population around 235,000 consisting of four major municipalities Kaarina, Raisio, Naantali, and <b>Turku.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although archaeological {{findings}} in the area {{date back to the}} Stone Age, the town of <b>Turku</b> was founded in late 13th century. The Cathedral of <b>Turku</b> was consecrated in 1300.|$|E
25|$|After the Finnish War, {{which ended}} when Sweden ceded Finland to Imperial Russia at the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, <b>Turku</b> became briefly the {{official}} capital, but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor Alexander I felt that <b>Turku</b> {{was too far}} from Russia and too aligned with Sweden {{to serve as the}} capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland. The change officially took place in 1812. The government offices that remained in <b>Turku</b> were finally moved to the new capital after the Great Fire of <b>Turku,</b> which almost completely destroyed the city in 1827. After the fire, a new and safer city plan was drawn up by German architect Carl Ludvig Engel, who had also designed the new capital, Helsinki. <b>Turku</b> remained the largest city in Finland for another twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Being both a {{regional}} and provincial capital, <b>Turku</b> {{is an important}} administrative centre, hosting {{the seat of the}} Archbishop of Finland and a Court of Appeal. Aleksi Randell has been the mayor of <b>Turku</b> since 2010.|$|E
