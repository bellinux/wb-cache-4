5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both were painted by the same hand.|$|E
5|$|Less clearcut is the {{question}} of whether the regular auxilia recruited barbari (barbarians, as the Romans called people living outside the empire's borders). Although there is little evidence of it before the 3rd century, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> auxilia recruited barbarians throughout their history. In the 3rd century, a few auxilia units of clearly barbarian origin start to appear in the record e.g. Ala I Sarmatarum, cuneus Frisiorum and numerus Hnaufridi in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The more {{commonly}} spoken languages dominate the less commonly spoken languages, so the less commonly spoken languages eventually disappear from populations. The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of those will have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the film}} review {{aggregate}} site Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 56% [...] "Rotten" [...] score. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Poor White Trash was [...] "silly and over-the-top, {{but not very}} funny." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no title on Jack the Ripper ever gathers much dust … {{the hottest}} backlist titles now, {{in the true}} crime genre, deal with serial killers - the more gruesome and {{grotesque}} the better.|$|R
5000|$|Many reviewers noted <b>that</b> {{the levels}} <b>were</b> {{much harder than}} those in the {{original}} game, although <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> not quite as good as the first game or the (then) newly released arcade sequel.|$|R
5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E
5|$|The red-winged fairywren {{was officially}} {{described}} by ornithologist John Gould in 1837, who derived the bird's specific name {{derived from the}} Latin term elegans 'elegant'. He gave its location as the East Coast, but realised his error after further collections by John Gilbert from Southwestern Australia. Amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews described birds from the southern karri forests as subspecies warreni in 1916 {{on the basis of}} darker female plumage. However, others have not observed this subsequently and <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> no separate subspecies are recognized. In fact there is little variation in size or colour within the species between populations or individuals.|$|E
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{historical}} sources explicitly state Ecgfrith's reason for attacking Fortriu in 685, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it was to reassert Northumbria's eroded hegemony over the Picts. The most thorough description of the battle is given by Bede in his 8th century work Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) (completed c731), but this is still brief. Additional detail is given in the Irish annals of Ulster and Tigernach, and by the early Welsh historian Nennius in his Historia Brittonum (written c. 830).|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes it {{was given}} a rating of 43%, making it [...] "rotten." [...] <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> plot <b>is</b> derivative and incoherent, {{and that it does}} not engage the viewer.|$|R
50|$|A daytime {{assault was}} {{initially}} planned, but was postponed at the British battalion commander's request. In {{a meeting with}} his company commanders <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> long uphill assault across the harsh ground of Tumbledown would be suicidal in daylight.|$|R
50|$|Cisco and Google {{reported}} no significant issues during the test.Facebook called the results encouraging, {{and decided to}} leave their developer site IPv6-enabled as a result. But <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> more work {{needed to be done}} before IPv6 could consistently be applied.|$|R
5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army {{to break out of}} its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} that birds are {{a type of}} dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, extinct as is commonly stated. However, all non-avian dinosaurs {{as well as many}} groups of birds did suddenly become extinct approximately 66million years ago. It has been suggested that because small mammals, squamata and birds occupied the ecological niches suited for small body size, non-avian dinosaurs never evolved a diverse fauna of small-bodied species, which led to their downfall when large-bodied terrestrial tetrapods were hit by the mass extinction event. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including ammonites (nautilus-like mollusks), mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and many groups of mammals. Significantly, the insects suffered no discernible population loss, which left them available as food for other survivors. This mass extinction is known as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.|$|E
50|$|Even after Doer's selection, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NDP {{would not}} be reelected. However, they managed to {{stabilize}} at around 20% in the polls. Many traditional NDP voters, especially {{in the city of}} Winnipeg, abandoned the party to support the Liberals in this cycle.|$|R
50|$|The 1941 season {{marked a}} change in management, as Luke Sewell was {{appointed}} the Browns new manager on June 5, 1941. While the St. Louis Cardinals drew over 600,000 fans, the Browns barely drew 175,000. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> St. Louis could not support two teams.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} a debate has {{developed}} {{over the role of}} republicanism in the American Revolution and in the British radicalism of the 18th century. For many decades <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> liberalism, especially that of John Locke, <b>was</b> paramount and <b>that</b> republicanism had a distinctly secondary role.|$|R
25|$|Each of {{the heads}} wears {{headgear}} reminiscent of 1920s-style American football helmets, although each {{is unique in}} its decoration. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the heads likely represent mighty Olmec rulers.|$|E
25|$|Found in {{the library}} of Assurbanipal in Nineveh, it records the {{interaction}} of the Assyrian and Babylonian empires, from the Assyrian point of view. While useful, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> this chronicle should not be considered reliable.|$|E
25|$|This {{view has}} been {{challenged}} by other writers, who state that Madhyamaka is not nihilistic {{but it is a}} middle way between nihilism and eternalism. Some scholars interpret emptiness as described by Nāgārjuna as a Buddhist transcendental absolute, while other scholars consider it a mistake. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Nāgārjuna defended the middle way, one between nihilism and absolute eternalism, and sunyata as emptiness is the soteriological middle way.|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} shuttle mission, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{operations}} had <b>been</b> highly successful, and a joint atmosphere of celebration and high spirits reigned at Poltava. The second shuttle raid assigned Eighth Air Force B-17s to attack synthetic oil facilities near Berlin {{on the way}} to the Ukraine.|$|R

50|$|Reviews <b>were</b> mixed but <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{a marked}} {{improvement}} {{on the previous}} installment. The film received a 36% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 49 out of 100 on Metacritic. This is the first film in the series to be rated PG-13. The first two films were R-rated.|$|R
25|$|Although {{there is}} some {{speculation}} that Tutankhamun was assassinated, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his death was accidental. A CT scan taken in 2005 showed that he had suffered a compound left leg fracture shortly before his death, and that the leg had become infected. DNA analysis conducted in 2010 showed the presence of malaria in his system, leading {{to the belief that}} malaria and Köhler disease II combined led to his death.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} fully {{accurate}} history of broomball. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> modern broomball originated in Canada. Some think {{it came about}} by trying to play ice hockey without ice skates. The first recorded broomball games in North America were in Perdue, Saskatchewan on March 5, 1909, although {{there is some evidence}} to suggest broomball was being played {{in a small town in}} Massey, Ontario. These games, however, were played on a football field as early as the 1890s. From Canada the game spread south to the United States, becoming especially popular in Minnesota, where by the 1960s a broomball community was thriving.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} {{uses of the}} term post-modern there are critics of its application, however, at this point, these critics are in the minority. This {{is not to say}} that the phase of art denoted by {{post-modernism}} is accepted, merely that the need for a term to describe movements in art after the peak of abstract expressionism is well established. However although the concept of change has come to consensus, and whether it is a post-modernist change, or a late modernist period, is undetermined, <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a profound change in the perception of works of art has occurred and a new era has been emerging on the world stage since at least the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} Crab Nebula {{is the focus}} of much {{attention}} among astronomers, its distance remains an open question, owing to uncertainties in every method used to estimate its distance.

5000|$|Covington & Burling {{put out a}} {{press release}} {{revealing}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) had been unfairly targeted by the anti-smoking lobby, and that {{the claims of the}} independent research scientists and the concerned staff at the EPA should not be used [...] "in the future for policy decisions." ...|$|R
5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense of hard. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.|$|R
25|$|The {{causes of}} ice ages {{are not fully}} {{understood}} for either the large-scale ice age periods or the smaller {{ebb and flow of}} glacial–interglacial periods within an ice age. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> several factors are important: atmospheric composition, such as the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane (the specific levels of the previously mentioned gases are now able to be seen with the new ice core samples from EPICA Dome C in Antarctica over the past 800,000 years) changes in the earth's orbit around the Sun known as Milankovitch cycles, the motion of tectonic plates resulting in changes in the relative location and amount of continental and oceanic crust on the earth's surface, which affect wind and ocean currents, variations in solar output, the orbital dynamics of the Earth–Moon system, the impact of relatively large meteorites and volcanism including eruptions of supervolcanoes.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan's {{diversity}} is more visible along cultural differences and less along linguistic, religious or genetic lines. Almost all Pakistanis {{belong to the}} Indo-Iranian linguistic group of the Indo-European branch. Pakistan's rough estimates vary, but <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Punjabis are the largest ethnic group. Pashtuns (Pakhtuns) make up the second largest group and Sindhi are the third-largest ethnic group. Saraikis (a transitional group between Punjabis and Sindhis) make up 10.53% of the total population. The remaining large groups include the Muhajirs and the Baloch people, which make up 7.57% and 3.57% of the total population, respectively. Hindkowans and the Brahui, and the various peoples of the Gilgit–Baltistan, constitute roughly 4.66% of the total population. The Pakhtun and Baloch represent two of the major populations that are linguistically Iranian, while the majority Punjabis, Hindkowans, Sindhis and Saraikis are the major linguistically Indo-Aryan groups.|$|E
25|$|It {{is still}} debated whether Horn {{committed}} the Nickells murder. Historians including Chip Carlson {{believe he did}} not, while others such as Dean Fenton Krakel believe that he did, but had not realized he was shooting a boy. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others. Carlson, who extensively researched the Wyoming v. Tom Horn trial, concluded that although Horn could have committed the murder of Willie Nickell, he probably did not. According to Carlson's book, Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon (2001), there was no physical evidence that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day before it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession made it without value as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn's reputation and history made him {{an easy target for}} the prosecution.|$|E
50|$|As usual {{the season}} {{started with a}} 34-43 away defeat at Swindon, but there was {{encouragement}} {{in the way that}} Eric Boocock twice beat Barry Briggs, relieving him of the Silver Sash match race title in the process, and <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Pander <b>was</b> worth more than a solitary point from his first match.|$|R
50|$|Vijay did a semi-art film Avva for Kavita Lankesh at {{the start}} of 2008. Vijay won accolades for a bravura performance, but the film did not do well. He was then seen in Sumana Kittur's Slum Bala towards the end of 2008, which also did average business. <b>The</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> both films lacked action, which was Vijay's forte.|$|R
5000|$|Since cesium-137 is a fission product, {{it is an}} {{indicator}} of a nuclear fuel leak, but <b>the</b> <b>consensus</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cesium-137 probably leaked from defective fuel assemblies during or prior to 2001, when the last leak of <b>that</b> type <b>was</b> reported by Vermont Yankee. (Problems with fuel rods were common in the 1970s and 1980s.) ...|$|R
