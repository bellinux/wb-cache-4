5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, {{so much so that the}} new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of <b>the</b> <b>Broken</b> Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over <b>the</b> <b>Broken</b> gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of <b>the</b> <b>Broken</b> gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns <b>the</b> <b>Broken</b> gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of <b>the</b> <b>Broken</b> gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use <b>the</b> <b>Broken</b> gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use <b>the</b> <b>Broken</b> gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|E

In 1937, it was {{collected}} in a single hardcover volume and published by Éditions Casterman under the title L'Oreille cassée (<b>The</b> <b>Broken</b> Ear). For this collected edition, one small change was made; the minor character of Carajo was renamed Caraco, because the word carajo is Spanish slang for penis.|$|E

US-64/ US-169 follow a due south course to an interchange with the Creek Turnpike. The freeway merges with a free section of the turnpike, heading west.

Six years later, Revolution released <b>Broken</b> Sword: <b>The</b> Sleeping Dragon, which features 3D graphics and a direct-control mechanism. It uses the RenderWare engine. In 2006 <b>the</b> company released <b>Broken</b> Sword: <b>The</b> Angel of Death (Secrets of <b>the</b> Ark: A <b>Broken</b> Sword Game in North America), which returns to the point-and-click system used {{in the first two}} games. It is the only game in the series not released for a console, and it uses Sumo Digital's engine. <b>The</b> fifth installment, <b>Broken</b> Sword 5: <b>The</b> Serpent's Curse, was announced through a Kickstarter project in August 2012.

5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her {{research on the}} effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, <b>the</b> <b>broken</b> chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. <b>The</b> <b>broken</b> ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
