5|$|Heraldry {{developed}} in medieval Europe {{from the late}} 11th century, originally as a system of personal badges of the warrior classes, which served, among other purposes, as identification on the battlefield. The same insignia were used on seals to identify documents. The earliest seals bore a likeness of {{the owner of the}} seal, with the shield and heraldic insignia included. Over time, the seals were reduced <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> shield.|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} to reduce a wood sample <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> {{cellulose}} component before testing, but since this can reduce {{the volume of the}} sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well. Charcoal is often tested but is likely to need treatment to remove contaminants.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{varieties}} of the two-colored bolete: borealis and subreticulatus. Both varieties {{have a very}} similar habitat {{to that of the}} main species, except they appear to be limited <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> North American continent. Both varieties also have a slightly different coloration than that of the two-colored bolete, have deeper pores, and are not as often eaten or used in regional recipes.|$|E
5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, pipes and other creekside structures.|$|E

The visual ends with Inna appearing on the TV's display from the beginning, before it is switched off by a woman previously shown.

5|$|In 1935, Hull City's first shirt badge {{mirrored}} the familiar three crowns civic emblem of Kingston-upon-Hull, which was {{displayed on the}} sky blue shirts worn in the 1935â€“36 season. Following that season, the team went without wearing a badge until 1947, when the club crest depicted a tiger's head in an orange-shaded badge. This was worn up until 1957, when it was changed <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> tiger's head. This was worn for three years, when the shirt again featured no emblem. Then, in 1971, the club returned to showing the tiger's head on the shirt. This was used for four years, until the club's initials of HCAFC were shown for four years. After this, a logo with the tiger's head with the club's name underneath was used from 1979 until 1998. The next logo, which remains the club's current logo, features the tiger's head in an amber shield with the club's name, along with the club's nickname, The Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street Expressway, a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze Expressway. The first section from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze Expressway was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the expressway was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic circle on the east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into a dead-end street {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway, which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street Expressway to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E
5|$|Military {{aircraft}} {{flying at}} night {{have often been}} painted black or other dark colors, applied <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, {{in the hope of}} reducing the risk of being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matt black was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by 15mph (25kph) compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen.|$|E

5|$|The Covent Garden {{area has}} over 60 pubs and bars; {{several of them}} are listed buildings, with some also on CAMRA's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors; some, such as The Harp in Chandos Place, have {{received}} consumer awards. The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2011. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>The</b> Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It has been owned by the landlady since 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth guitarfish and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) and skates (Rajidae) while others have them basal to all other rays except sawfishes (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the sawfishes rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that {{it is part of}} the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina).|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{thirteen}} seats open for magistrate, a local court, {{the duties of}} which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court. In the magistrate races, each political party could nominate eight candidates, and voters could only vote for eight, with the result being that the majority party could only take eight of the thirteen seats, leaving five for the minority party. The Democrats took {{the maximum number of}} eight magistracies, with incumbents Vincent A. Dean and William Cibotti leading the ticket. Republicans were held <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> five slots allotted them, with incumbent Benjamin W. Schwartz taking the most votes of his party's nominees.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of release}} schedulesâ€”especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} yearâ€”and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the proposed site mounted, even after the Ancient Monuments Board's approval, and the YAYAS continued to apply pressure, calling another public meetingâ€”which it scheduled for 3 May 1923â€”forcing the war memorial committee to reconsider. The committee revisited a site on Leeman Road, outside the city walls, which had originally been proposed in 1921. Lutyens sent his assistant Albert J Thomas (an architect in his own right) to examine the site on 8 August 1923 and all parties agreed to it. By coincidence, the site was owned by the NER, which donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between {{the company and the}} city, the NER having recently been amalgamated into the London and North Eastern Railway. Lutyens submitted a revised design to account for the new locationâ€”a War Cross and a Stone of Remembranceâ€”which would have cost almost Â£2,500. The scheme was scaled back <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> cross and the council undertook to conduct the work using its own staff in order to keep within the Â£1,100 that had been raised by public subscription.|$|E
5|$|The {{order for}} the {{pre-production}} I-250s had been placed with Factory No. 381 in Moscow for two aircraft to be delivered in September, three more in October and the remainder {{by the end of}} the year. This proved to be very optimistic and it was revised to a single aircraft {{by the end of the}} year. The airframe was completed on this revised schedule, but its engine was not ready in time. The factory management was much criticized for these problems which were not entirely under their control as changes to the design and drawings were constant. The criticism was not limited <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> I-250 program as the other jet programs could not be developed as fast as the leadership wanted as well and Alexei Shakhurin, the head of MAP (Ministry of Aviation Industry) and its NKAP predecessor since 1940, was arrested in March 1946 as a sign of their displeasure. The new Minister severely reprimanded the designer of the VRDK and three factory directors on 13 April 1946 and set up a commission to determine why Factory No. 381 and TsIAM had failed to meet their deadlines. He refused to accept its findings as it apportioned blame fairly evenly among those responsible for the production program and he had the director of Factory No. 381 and his quality control manager arrested for industrial sabotage.|$|E
