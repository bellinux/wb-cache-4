40|$|A set {{of single}} pass full {{penetration}} friction stir bead-on-plate and butt welds in HSLA- 65 steel were produced using {{a range of}} traverse speeds (50 to 500 mm/min) and two tool materials (W-Re and PCBN). Part I described the influence of process and tool parameters on the microstructure in the weld region. This article focuses {{on the influence of}} these parameters on residual stress, but the presence of retained austenite evident in the diffraction pattern and X-ray tomographic investigations of tool material depositions are also discussed. The residual stress measurements were made using white beam synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD). The residual stresses are affected by the traverse speed as well as the weld tool material. While the peak residual stress at the tool shoulders remained largely unchanged (approximately equal to the nominal yield stress (450 MPa)) irrespective of weld speed or tool type, for the W-Re welds, the width of the <b>tensile</b> <b>section</b> of the residual stress profile decreased with increasing traverse speed (thus decreasing line energy). The effect of increasing traverse speed on the width of the tensile zone was much less pronounced for the PCBN tool material...|$|E
40|$|The glued- {{laminated}} lumber (glulam) {{technique is}} an efficient {{process for the}} rational use of wood. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRPs) associated with glulam beams provide significant improvements in strength and stiffness and alter the failure mode of these structural elements. In this context, this paper presents guidance for glulam beam production, an experimental analysis of glulam beams made of Pinus caribea var. hondurensis species without and with externally-bonded FRP and theoretical models to evaluate reinforced glulam beams (bending strength and stiffness). Concerning the bending strength of the beams, this paper aims only to analyze the limit state of ultimate strength in compression and tension. A specific disposal was used {{in order to avoid}} lateral buckling, once the tested beams have a higher ratio height-to-width. The results indicate the need of production control so as to guarantee a higher efficiency of the glulam beams. The FRP introduced in the <b>tensile</b> <b>section</b> of glulam beams resulted in improvements on their bending strength and stiffness due to the reinforcement thickness increase. During the beams testing, two failure stages were observed. The first was a tensile failure on the sheet positioned under the reinforcement layer, while the second occurred {{as a result of a}} preliminary compression yielding on the upper side of the lumber, followed by both a shear failure on the fiber-lumber interface and a tensile failure in wood. The model shows a good correlation between the experimental and estimated results. Brazilian research financing institution FAPESP-Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paul...|$|E

40|$|Composites {{consisting}} of woven Hi-Nicalon fibers, BN interphases, and different SiC matrices were studied in tension at room temperature. Composites with SiC matrices processed by CVI and melt infiltration were compared. Monotonic and load/unload/reload tensile hysteresis experiments were performed. A modal acoustic emission (AE) analyzer {{was used to}} monitor damage accumulation during the tensile test. Post test polishing of the <b>tensile</b> gage <b>sections</b> was performed {{to determine the extent}} of cracking. The occurrence and location of cracking could easily be determined using modal AE. The loss of modulus could also effectively be determined from the change in the velocity of sound across the sample.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of dynamic mechanical properties of steel sheets by the miniature testing technique. Several materials were investigated, namely S 235, S 355 and 1. 4301. The newly developed micro-tensile test (M-TT) allows local mechanical properties measurement which can be successfully used for example for weld heterogeneity determination. Furthermore, due to small size samples (<b>tensile</b> sample gauge <b>section</b> dimension of 0, 5 x 1, 5 x 3 mm), much higher strain rates can be attained using relatively slow loading velocities in comparison to standard dynamic tests resulting in high results consistency thanks to significant reduction of the oscillations which are typical for common high strain rate tests. The results obtained from M-TT and standard tensile tests were compared...|$|R

Within dimensional constraints, such as maximum length, tab region width, gage width, gage length, and minimum tab length, a transition contour radius of 41. 9 cm produced the lowest stress {{values in the}} specimen transition region. The stresses in the transition region were not sensitive to specimen material properties. The stresses in the tab region were sensitive to specimen composite and/or tab material properties. An evaluation of stresses with different specimen composite and tab material combinations must account for material nonlinearity of both the tab and the specimen composite. Material nonlinearity can either relieve stresses in the composite under the tab or elevate them to cause failure under the tab...|$|R

The influence of their variation upon the variation of the {{flexural strength}} of masonry was theoretically investigated in a probabilistic way. This was done by modelling a part of masonry with solids and interface elements and randomly sub-mitting values for tensile bond strength and fracture energy to parts of the joints.

40|$|Under complex, {{dynamic loading}} conditions, damage can occur within a {{material}}. Should this damage {{not lead to}} catastrophic failure, the material can continue to sustain further loading. However, little is understood about how to represent the mechanical response of a material that has experienced dynamic loading leading to incipient damage. Here, this effect is examined in copper. Copper is shock loaded to impart an incipient state of damage to the material. Thereafter compression and <b>tensile</b> specimens were <b>sectioned</b> from the dynamically damaged specimen to quantify the subsequent properties of the material {{in the region of}} intense incipient damage and in regions far from the damage. It is observed that enhanced yield stresses result from the damaged material even over material, which has simply been shock loaded and not damaged. These results are rationalized in terms of stored plastic work due to the damage process...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation undertaken {{to measure the}} elevated temperature mechanical properties of cold-formed steel tubular <b>sections.</b> <b>Tensile</b> coupon tests at temperatures ranging from 20 ºC to 800 ºC were conducted to determine the re-duced values of elastic modulus, yield strength and ultimate strengths with increasing temperatures. Based on the test results, suitable equations were proposed to determine the mechanical property reduction factors at elevated temperatures. These reduction factors along with the factors given in the current design codes were then used in the numerical modelling of stub columns to determine their failure loads at various elevated temperatures. The failure loads predicted using the reduction factors in the current design codes resulted in unacceptable differences compared to the proposed, more accurate reduction factors. This shows the importance of using the measured mechanical property reduction factors in the fire design of cold-formed steel tubular sections...|$|R

The CFRP plate strengthening is only applied to a small localize region subjected to concentrated load. The tubular members of square and rectangular hollowsections subjected toweb cripplingwere tested. Theweb crippling testswere conducted under two loading conditions of End-Two-Flange (ETF) and End-One-Flange (EOF). The tests were performed on five different sizes of tubular <b>sections.</b> <b>Tensile</b> coupon testswere conducted to determine the material properties of the ferritic stainless steel specimens. Most of the strengthened specimens were failed by debonding of CFRP plate from the ferritic stainless steel tubes. Two different failure modes were observed in the tests of the strengthened specimens, namely the adhesion failure as well as the combination of adhesion and cohesion failure. The failure loads, failure modes and the load-web deformation behaviour of the ferritic stainless steel sections are also presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Fractography and {{metallographic}} sectioning {{were used}} to investigate the influence of microstructure and strength on the fracture toughness (KIc) and fracture mechanism of an 18 Ni, 300 grade maraging steel. Increased yield strength from 1442 to 2070 MN/m squared through precipitation hardening results in a KIc loss from 143 to 55 MN/m superscript 3 / 2. Ti (C,N) Ti 2 S, and TiC inclusions in sizes from 1 to 8, 1 to 15, and 0. 1 to 2 microns respectively serve as sites for void nucleation and lead to fracture by the dimpled rupture process in all strength levels considered. TiC nucleated dimples occupy {{more than half the}} fracture in all conditions. Void nucleation rate and resultant number of dimples per unit area of fracture increase with increasing yield strength. Average dimple size decreases with increasing strength and/or overaging which follows from the decreasing amount of stable void growth measured by <b>sectioning</b> <b>tensile</b> specimens. Void growth is assisted by crack branching along a path of TiC inclusions. Coalescence occurs in the highest strength materials by a combination of TiC void nucleation and premature separation at strengthening precipitates...|$|R
40|$|Cast nickel-aluminum bronze (NAB) alloy is {{specified}} {{for many}} marine applications, including ship propellers, {{due to its}} excellent corrosion-resistance combined with acceptable mechanical properties. Friction stir processing (FSP) {{can be used to}} improve the alloyâ s mechanical properties by localized microstructure modification in the cast material. FSP converts an as-cast microstructure to a wrought condition in the absence of macroscopic shape change, closes porosity, and provides a means to surface harden the castings. The closure of porosity near the surface of the material may shorten the manufacturing and processing time for ship propellers. The surface hardening of cast NAB alloy can be used to increase the wear life of ship propellers. Rockwell Scientific Corporation (now Teledyne Scientific Corporation) supplied three Nickel Aluminum Bronze alloy plates which have been friction stir processed in a raster pattern under a Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) project. Each plate had been processed using a different tool RPM and IPM (inches per minute of transverse) combination. Miniature <b>tensile</b> samples were <b>sectioned</b> from the FSP zone and surrounding base metal and mechanical property distributions were determined in these regions.

40|$|The Fe- 16 at. (8. 5 wt) % Al alloy, {{known as}} FAPY, has been {{identified}} as a superior material for heating element applications. However, while the 15 -lb heats melted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) could be processed into wire, the large heat melted at Hoskins Manufacturing Company (Hoskins) could not be processed under commercial processing conditions. The primary objective of the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) was to demonstrate that wire of the FAPY alloy could be produced under commercial conditions from air-induction-melted (AIM) heats. The specific aspects of this CRADA included: (1) Melting 15 -lb heats by AIM or vacuum-induction melting (VIM) at ORNL. (2) Development of detailed processing steps including warm drawing and annealing temperature and time during cold-drawing steps. (3) Melting of 1400 -lb heats at Hoskins by the Exo-Melt{trademark} process and their chemical analysis and microstructural characterization.

40|$|Arc welds are {{heterogeneous}} as {{the thermal}} cycle during welding {{gives rise to}} local variations in microstructure. This complexity is not accounted for in standardized weld defect assessments, where stress-strain properties are ‘averaged’ by round bar tension testing. This simplification is known to give rise to inaccuracies. Therefore, specific procedures have been proposed to account for weld heterogeneity (e. g. the recently developed technique of ‘weld homogenization’). Crucial for the applicability of such procedures is the characterization of local stress-strain properties. To do so, the authors have explored two techniques on a selection of strongly heterogeneous welds: miniature <b>tensile</b> testing (cross <b>section</b> 2 x 0. 5 square mm) and Vickers hardness mapping of a weld macrograph. The former technique provides full range stress-strain curves but is challenging in execution. Instead, the latter technique provides a distribution of hardness, which merely gives an indication of ultimate tensile strength, but is more straightforward to perform. This paper provides details of the experimental program covering preparation of specimens, execution of tests and analysis of results. As regards miniature tensile testing, strain measurements have been performed by means of digital image correlation, requiring the application of small speckles having an optimal size of roughly 20 μm through a devoted speckling procedure. 3 D profilometry indicated a strong sensitivity of the linear elastic response to clamping conditions. The potential presence of weld porosities was found to invalidate {{a fair number of}} test results. For non-defected specimens, reliable post-yield stress-strain responses could be obtained. As regards hardness mapping, Vickers hardness values are compared with strength values obtained from miniature tensile testing at the corresponding position. It is concluded that both techniques show specific merits and limitations, and both deserve consideration in a detailed characterization of weld strength heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to qualify welding {{procedure}} specifications for the Las Positas College welding program using A 36 steel in accordance with American Welding Society (AWS) D 1. 1, B 4. 0, and B 2. 1. Qualification was to be performed using both 1 G (flat) and 3 G (vertical) positions for Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) and Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) processes. Required qualification procedures included two face and two root bend tests coupled with a visual inspection for cracks within the weld region greater than ⅛” long, along with two reduced <b>section</b> <b>tensile</b> tests to ensure the tensile strength exceeded 58 ksi if the sample broke within the weld region or 55. 1 ksi if the sample broke outside of the weld region. Tests were standardized by using American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards. Cracks greater than 1 / 8 ” {{were found in the}} weld region of bend tested samples in each process except for the 3 G GTAW, disqualifying them. The failed samples were broken open at the crack and examined using optical microscopy in conjunction with polarized light as well as stereo microscopy to determine the inclusion and porosity content of the base and weld metal. The microscopic examination revealed a high degree of porosity and a lack of fusion in a 1 G GTAW root bent sample as indicated by the presence of back gouging marks found in the areas of the weld having lack of fusion. This was the result of improper back gouging procedures. Microscopic examinations of GMAW fracture surfaces showed signs of heavy oxidation and inclusion content within the weld metal as well as a lack of fusion between the weld passes. Both 3 G GTAW samples passed tensile tests with tensile strengths greater than 64 ksi, and the 3 G GTAW process was therefore qualified...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Compared with metals, polymer materials have Iow strength and stiffness. However, molecular orientation can enhance many mechanical properties of polymer materials {{in the direction of}} orientation. Studies on solid state polymer extrusion (Le. extrusion carried out at temperatures below the melting point of the polymer) through convergent dies show {{that it is possible to}} produce extrudates exhibiting a high degree of monoaxial orientation in the extrusion direction. Although the strength of these extrudates has been greatly enhanced in the orientation direction, the strength decreases in the transverse direction to the axial orientation. Biaxially oriented polymer materials, on the other hand, show increased mechanical properties in more than one direction. But so far, extrusion processes that confer orientation in more than one direction have not received much attention. The present work is concerned with the development of biaxial orientation in thick thermoplastics extrudates by extrusion through dies exhibiting simultaneously converging and diverging walls perpendicular to each other and with a cross-section area at the die entry being the same as at the exit. Four die designs are examined, known respectively as the dual-taper die, the expansion fish-tail die, the constant fish-tail die and the cross die, using polytetrafluoroethylene and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. Measurements of birefringence and <b>tensile</b> strength on <b>sections</b> of the extrudates have shown that a preferential orientation along the transverse direction is normally achieved with the fish-tail dies and the dual-taper die, while the extrudates obtained with the cross die were found to exhibit a cross-ply orientation pattern with a bias in the extrusion direction for outerlayers and a preferential orientation in the transverse direction for the middle layers. The mechanics of the processes has been analysed by a plasticity approach for solid state extrusion, and by using variable wall boundaries for the melt extrusion analysis. The extrusion pressure predicted by the analysis compares very well with the values measured experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Friction Flash to Tube (F 2 T) is an {{innovative}} friction based manufacturing technique to produce seamless tubes based on open die forging, invented at Aalto University. These tubes {{can be produced}} economically in small sizes and batches, envisaging applications of high value materials that are not available in the market. The objective of this Master thesis was to develop the experimental condition of F 2 T {{as well as the}} proper parameters in F 2 T by approaching Taguchi method. The pre-defined parameters to investigate in Taguchi method were established as forging force, tool rotation and initial transient plunging depth and the investigating of geometrical and metallurgical characteristics were done. Cold rolled high strength and low alloy structural steel S 355 is the material used in this research work. The parameters of the F 2 T process were developed based on design of experiments, with geometrical and hardness properties as performance parameters. The optimized conditions and parameters were applied to produce tubes for extensive evalua-tion of the mechanical and metallurgical material properties. The F 2 T process has specific components and control demands that cannot be met by the existing manufacturing systems. This challenge was overcome by developing one first version of a dedicated system based on an existent Friction Stir Welding equipment. One additional challenge was to produce tubes longer than 40 mm because of buckling. The buckling was prevented by implementing a lateral support system constraining the consumable rod during the initial transient plunging period. The test specimens for extensive mechanical test and metallurgical analysis were extracted from tubes produced with 80 mm in length. These longer tubes were manufactured using the support system to prevent buckling. The results on tensile test, flattening test and flare test of F 2 T tube reveal that the mechanical properties of produced tubes are as good as tube of similar material produced by another manufacturing technique. The temperature during the application of the F 2 T process was monitored with thermo-couples. The mechanical properties of produced tubes were evaluated by hardness meas-urement of cross and longitudinal <b>sections.</b> <b>Tensile</b> test were applied to sub-sections of wall of the tubes, and flare and flattening test to the whole tubes.

40|$|High {{strength}} steels (HSS), {{which are}} {{generally considered to}} be those with yield strengths over 460 MPa, are being increasingly utilised in construction, particularly in high rise structural applications and where long and column-free spans are an important design requirement. In place of ordinary carbon steels, the use of HSS can enable structural elements with smaller cross-sections, resulting in significant material savings. However, compared to normal strength steels, the structural use of HSS is still quite rare. The European design code EN 1993 - 1 - 12 provides design rules for HSS up to S 700, but was conceived as a simple extension of the rules in EN 1993 - 1 - 1 for normal strength steels. In order to contribute to the existing limited HSS data pool and to verify and develop the current Eurocode 3 design rules, a comprehensive experimental programme on hot-finished S 460 and S 690 square and rectangular hollow sections has been carried out. The testing programme covered different structural aspects at the material, cross-section and member levels and consisted of 40 tensile coupon tests, 11 compressive coupon tests, 11 stub column tests, 11 full <b>section</b> <b>tensile</b> tests, 22 in-plane bending tests, 12 eccentrically loaded stub column tests, 30 long column tests, as well as measurements of geometrical imperfections and residual stresses. Numerical models, validated against the test results, were also developed to examine the cross-section and member behaviour, and subsequently employed in a comprehensive parametric study in order to generate further data. Based on the combined test and numerical data set, as well as experimental results reported in the literature, the current HSS design rules in Eurocode 3, including the slenderness limits for cross-section classification, effective width equation, N-M interaction curves and column buckling curves, were assessed by means of reliability analyses in accordance with Annex D of EN 1990. To realise the potential of HSS in long span structures, a novel structural form was also examined, namely an HSS truss with prestressing cables housed within the tubular bottom chord. A total of 4 prestressed trusses, made of S 460 square hollow sections with different prestress levels, were tested under static downward loading. The truss test results showed the enhanced structural efficiency brought about by the addition of prestressing cables and by the application of prestress. Additionally, 12 tensile and 10 compressive member tests with cables, representing the bottom chord of the truss under gravity and uplift loading, respectively, were carried out to investigate the behaviour of individual prestressed cable-in-tube members. Analytical models and numerical models were also established to compare with the test behaviour and to {{contribute to the development of}} design rules for prestressed cable-in-tube systems.
