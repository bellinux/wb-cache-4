500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I needed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people}} who are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It just goes to show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} between 28 May and 13 July 1956. The film's budget, at £92,000, was much larger than that of The Quatermass Xperiment. The bigger budget was {{achieved}} by the advance sale of the distribution rights in the United States to United Artists. United Artists contributed some £64,000 towards {{the production of the}} film, as well as Brian Donlevy's $25,000 fee and his airfare to London from the US. The larger budget allowed for greater use of location filming in the making of the film than had been possible for its predecessor. The key location used was the oil refinery at Shell Haven in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, on the Thames Estuary, which represented the secret Winnerden Flats complex. This was exactly the same location as used in the BBC television production of the story. Despite its size, the plant was run by {{a relatively small number of}} personnel, which made Guest's job of making the plant appear eerily deserted easier. Guest was also surprised at how relaxed the plant's management were about allowing him to stage the climactic gun battle at such a potentially flammable location. Focus puller Harry Oakes recalled, however, that a Newman-Sinclair clockwork camera had to be used for some scenes because of the danger posed by sparks from electrical equipment. The scenes of Vincent Broadhead emerging from one of the domes covered in the noxious black slime were particularly difficult to realise, necessitating many retakes. Tom Chatto, playing Broadhead, whose wife was a leading casting director, joked after the scene was finally completed, [...] "Remind me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife about casting me in this". The Shell Haven location was further enhanced by the use of matte paintings created by special effects designer Les Bowie to add the giant domes within which the aliens were incubated.|$|E
2500|$|A 2004 NPR survey {{indicated}} {{that the majority of}} the 1001 parent groups polled wanted complete sex education in schools, as over 80% agreed with the statement [...] "Sex education in school makes it easier for me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> child about sexual issues", and under 17% of polled parents agreed with the statement that their children were being exposed to [...] "subjects I don't think my child should be discussing". An additional 90% believed that their children’s sexual education was “not too early,” and 49% of the respondents were [...] "somewhat confident" [...] that the values taught in their children's sexual education classes were similar to those taught at home, with 23% of polled parents being somewhat less confident.|$|E
3000|$|... {{test and}} so I fled. I didn’t know about curves or that your grade on first test {{may not be}} your final grade. I didn’t know <b>to</b> go <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> teacher-or about rounding! [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The papers,' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, 'are in {{a canvas}} bag, {{in a hole}} a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you, <b>my</b> dear. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To-morrow {{night is}} Guild night," [...] she said. [...] "I go out then <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> girls. Miss Stevens {{is coming from}} the Lyceum Club to lecture to us on Woman's Suffrage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite {{the proper}} course," [...] commented Stirling. [...] "It's {{kind of a}} pity you didn't stick to it. When you had arrived at that wise decision, {{why did you come}} here <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> daughter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it. Most {{of my life}} I've {{been working}} with men with dirty finger-nails, and the only {{difference}} between them and the men with clean nails is a nail-cleaner, and that costs just ten cents at the corner drug-store. Seriously--I remember a cook I used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> on <b>my</b> way down <b>to</b> Panama once----" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “It is {{essentially}} a morning show format, but it runs {{in the middle of}} the night… Every day I basically get <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> one of <b>my</b> idols,” said Hazaert.|$|R
5000|$|Martha's letter: [...] "Dear David, {{thank you}} for your effort and your good-natured smile. I'm afraid that for this position, you really need some more {{business}} experience.

I admire your entrepreneurial spirit, and I know you will be successful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By G----," [...] said Lopez, [...] "there {{shall be}} no subject on which I will be afraid <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own wife. I insist on your assuring {{me that you}} will never speak to him again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} hard, {{and she is}} very kind; but I am far too dull and ignorant for her. I can only wait upon her; but when she has you and Julius <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> <b>my</b> stupidity will not matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{heard what}} I've said," [...] was the answer, [...] "and you'd better go by it, that's all. I shan't stay to bandy words with you, John Ellis. I'm going home <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> niece {{and tell her}} her duty plain, and what I want her to do, and she'll do it, I haven't a fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," [...] said he. [...] "It {{makes you}} quite {{invaluable}} as a companion. 'Pon my word, it {{is a great}} thing for me <b>to</b> have someone <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to,</b> for <b>my</b> own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at the door." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Proud! Bless your heart, what {{is there}} to be proud about; ain't I been working as a farmer for years and years with no one <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> but <b>my</b> own hands?--I mean my own men. No, that's just the thing to suit me; anyhow, I think I will try the experiment. If {{at the end of a}} couple of years I don't like it, why, there is no harm done." ...|$|R
60|$|He went {{on reading}} and Lady Langerdale began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me. But <b>my</b> {{attention}} was wandering. It {{was a strange}} idea which had occurred to me, perhaps a ridiculous one. Yet it was possessed of a certain fascination.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay {{as long as}} you like," [...] said Mrs Keswick. [...] "I turn nobody from my doors, even if {{they belong}} to the Brandon family. I want you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> niece, and get all you can out of her about this thing, and then you can go to work and blot out this contemptible {{marriage}} as soon as possible." ...|$|E
60|$|We lunched {{with the}} other three at Romsey. Then I sat in front {{for a little while}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Malachi. When I looked back, Shend was solidly asleep, and stayed so for the next two hours, while Leggatt chased Attley's fat Daimler along the green-speckled hedges. He woke up when we said good-bye at Mittleham, with {{promises}} to meet again very soon.|$|E
60|$|It was all one <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> nephew, {{as it was}} to talk to {{the rest}} before; he would go, he said, and he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having his men lost for want of help; he had rather, he said, lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and all: and so away went he.|$|E
60|$|With Dugan {{up for the}} Quakers in {{the third}} inning, Cogswell and Bannister, from the {{coaching}} lines, began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the Rube. <b>My</b> ears, keen from long practice, caught some of the remarks {{in spite of the}} noisy bleachers.|$|R
6000|$|... “To defend {{me against}} Mr. Littlemore? I’ve known him since I was a baby—I know the worst he can do.” She fixed her charming {{smile on her}} {{retreating}} visitor and added with much unexpectedness: “I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about <b>my</b> past!” ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{to see how}} like a king I dined too, all alone, {{attended}} by my servants! Pol, {{as if he had}} been my favourite, as the only person permitted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me; <b>my</b> dog, which was now grown very old and crazy, and found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at my right hand; and two cats, one on one side the table, and one on the other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of special favour.|$|R
6000|$|I {{left the}} team {{standing}} before the seeder, careless as to what became of them, for, even if acquitted, I felt that my career was closed at last. No forced labor could make up for time lost now, and, because justice in the West is slow, it was perfectly clear why the charge had been made. There was a scene with Sally {{when we reached the}} homestead, and Cotton fled before her biting comments on police sagacity. Even Mackay winced under certain allusions, and when I asked him: [...] "Am I permitted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> housekeeper alone?" [...] assented readily.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Oh, our folk'll {{attend to}} all that when we've time," [...] he says. He turns <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Aunt, while his men flew the stuff out of our hold. I think I saw old Moon amongst 'em, {{but he was too}} busy to more than nod like. Yet the Spanishers was going to prayers with their bells and candles before we'd cleaned out the ANTONY. Twenty-two ton o' useful stuff I'd fetched him. '"Now, Sim," [...] says my Aunt, [...] "no more devouring of Mus' Drake's time. He's sending us home in the Bridport hoy. I want to speak to them young springalds again." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is my {{complaint}} against {{so many of}} our teachers. They scold us for what we do, but so rarely tell us what we ought to do. Tell me how <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> baby, and I am willing to try. It is not as if I took a personal pride in the phrase: [...] "Did ums." [...] I did not even invent it. I found it, so to speak, when I got here, and my experience is that it soothes the Child. When he is howling, and I say [...] "Did ums" [...] with sympathetic intonation, he stops crying. Possibly enough it is astonishment at the ineptitude of the remark that silences him. Maybe it is that minor troubles are lost sight of {{face to face with the}} reflection that this is the sort of father with which fate has provided him. But may not even this be useful to him? He has got to meet with stupid people in the world. Let him begin by contemplating me. It will make things easier for him later on. I put forward the idea in the hope of comforting the young gentleman from Cambridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} formal, to-day," [...] she declared. [...] "You give {{too many of}} your {{thoughts}} to your little friend. I {{do not think that}} you are treating me kindly. I should like to sit with you in <b>my</b> room and <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you of <b>my</b> books. Look, is it not pretty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If he doesn't {{care for}} me, there shall {{be an end}} of it,' Marie said very gravely. 'If I only knew! If I thought that he loved me, I'd go through,--oh,--all the world for him. Nothing that papa could say should stop me. That's my feeling about it. I have never <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> any one but you about it. Isn't that strange? I haven't a person <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> That's <b>my</b> feeling, and I'm not a bit ashamed of it. There's no disgrace in being in love. But it's very bad to get married without being in love. That's what I think.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am no king's man," [...] {{replied the}} boy quietly, [...] "I am Norman of Torn, who has neither a king nor a god, and who says 'by your leave' to no man. But I {{have come in}} peace because I wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> another than <b>my</b> father. Therefore you may <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, priest," [...] he {{concluded}} with haughty peremptoriness.|$|R
60|$|He was {{surprised}} to see me and the supercargo in the boat with no more than two men; and though he was glad that we were well, yet he was in the same impatience with us to know what was doing; for the noise continued, and the flame increased; in short, it was next to an impossibility for any men in the world to restrain their curiosity to know what had happened, or their concern {{for the safety of the}} men: in a word, the captain told me he would go and help his men, let what would come. I argued with him, as I did before with the men, the safety of the ship, the danger of the voyage, the interests of the owners and merchants, &c., and told him I and the two men would go, and only see if we could at a distance learn what was likely to be the event, and come back and tell him. It was in vain <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> nephew, as it was to talk to the rest before; he would go, he said; and he only wished he had left but ten men in the ship, for he could not think of having his men lost for want of help: he had rather lose the ship, the voyage, and his life, and all; and away he went.|$|E
5000|$|Hegazys {{family was}} also angry with him. In a 2008 {{interview}} {{to a local}} Egyptian newspaper, Hegazys father said, [...] "I am going to try <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> son and convince {{him to return to}} Islam. If he refuses, I am going to kill him with my own hands." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “I was {{stressing}} out, missing my family. The {{phone system}} was down. I hadn’t been able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> family for four days. There were no cigarettes. I’m on antidepressants[...] [...] [...] I didn’t get my medication[...] [...] [...] I felt suicidal.” These negative effects that is brought upon a person within incarceration leaves a juvenile with trauma {{and long term}} mental effects.|$|E
6000|$|... "MY DEAR CHARLES,--I {{have wanted}} <b>to</b> see you <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you about <b>my</b> Foreign affairs. If {{you are going}} to be in London for a few days, I believe you can be very useful to me, at a {{considerable}} expense and trouble to yourself, in the way of buying accoutrements; inter alia, a sword and a saddle,--not, you will understand, for my own use.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{asked him}} [...] {{when he had}} his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one who}} did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going <b>to</b> be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, Ironcat {{began to}} have {{problems}} with some of their other artists. The deal with Dean fell through, with Dean opting not to publish Real Life with Ironcat. A more public disagreement occurred when Bennett stated that Ironcat could not contact Japanese artist Saya, creator of Central City, blaming it on an ex-employee who allegedly took the artist's information. In turn, Saya made a public statement, voicing that she was easily able to be contacted via her website, {{that she had never}} received any payments from the company and that she would never work with Ironcat again. She also stated that Bennett [...] "has no right to say this about his former employee. If they really wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, <b>my</b> e-mail address is very easy to find because there were links from their former web page to mine." ...|$|R
