40|$|Acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACCs) {{are crucial}} {{metabolic}} enzymes and are attractive targets for drug discovery. Haloxyfop and <b>tepraloxydim</b> belong to two distinct classes of commercial herbicides and kill sensitive plants by inhibiting the carboxyltransferase (CT) activity of ACC. Our earlier structural {{studies showed that}} haloxyfop is bound near the active site of the CT domain, at the interface of its dimer, and a large conformational change in the dimer interface is required for haloxyfop binding. We report here the crystal structure at 2. 3 Å resolution of the CT domain of yeast ACC in complex with <b>tepraloxydim.</b> The compound has a different mechanism of inhibiting the CT activity compared to haloxyfop, {{as well as the}} mammalian ACC inhibitor CP- 640186. <b>Tepraloxydim</b> probes a different region of the dimer interface and requires only small but important conformational changes in the enzyme, in contrast to haloxyfop. The binding mode of <b>tepraloxydim</b> explains the structure-activity relationship of these inhibitors, and provides a molecular basis for their distinct sensitivity to some of the resistance mutations, as compared to haloxyfop. Despite the chemical diversity between haloxyfop and <b>tepraloxydim,</b> the compounds do share two binding interactions to the enzyme, which may be important anchoring points for the development of ACC inhibitors...|$|E

O experimento foi conduzido em campo, em delineamento de blocos ao acaso com quatro repetições. Os tratamentos avaliados foram: {{clethodim}} (84 g ha- 1), clethodim + quizalofop-p-ethyl (48 + 40 g ha- 1), [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] (50 + 50 g ha- 1), sethoxydim (230 g ha- 1), <b>tepraloxydim</b> (100 g ha- 1), fluazifop-p-butyl (125 g ha- 1), haloxyfop-methyl (60 g ha- 1) e testemunha sem herbicida. A convivência das plantas de soja com as gramíneas infestantes resultou em perda significativa na produtividade de grãos. Os melhores níveis de controle de B. decumbens foram verificados com a utilização de haloxyfop-methyl. <b>Tepraloxydim</b> pode ser considerado seletivo a B. decumbens. Nenhum tratamento proporcionou controle final de D. ciliaris superior a 90 %, porém menor eficiência foi verificada quando se aplicaram sethoxydim e fluazifop-p-butyl. Apenas os tratamentos sethoxydim e [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] não mostraram controle satisfatório de E. indica. B. plantaginea foi a espécie mais facilmente controlada pelos herbicidas avaliados; no entanto, haloxyfop-methyl, <b>tepraloxydim,</b> clethodim e [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] se destacaram no controle dessa invasora. A adição de quizalofop-p-ethyl ao clethodim proporcionou incremento significativo no controle de C. echinatus. Também os herbicidas haloxyfop-methyl e <b>tepraloxydim</b> apresentaram controle satisfatório dessa espécie daninha. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the efficacy of ACCase-inhibitors (ariloxyfenoxypropionates and cyclohexanodiones), applied alone or in combination, in controlling the grass weed species Brachiaria decumbens, Digitaria ciliaris, Eleusine indica, Brachiaria plantaginea and Cenchrus echinatus in soybean crop. The study {{was carried out in}} the field in a randomized block design with four replicates. The following treatments were evaluated: clethodim (84 g ha- 1), clethodim + quizalofop-p-ethyl (48 + 40 g ha- 1), [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] (50 + 50 g ha- 1), sethoxydim (230 g ha- 1), <b>tepraloxydim</b> (100 g ha- 1), fluazifop-p-butyl (125 g ha- 1), haloxyfop-methyl (60 g ha- 1) and control (no herbicide). In the presence of the infesting weeds, soybean grain yield was significantly reduced. The highest efficiency of B. decumbens control was observed with the application of haloxyfop-methyl. <b>Tepraloxydim</b> was quite selective to B. decumbens. No treatment promoted a final control of D. ciliaris higher than 90 %; nevertheless, the lowest efficiencies were verified with the application of sethoxydim and fluazifop-p-butyl. The only treatments that did not present a satisfactory control of E. indica were sethoxydim and [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl]. The species most easily controlled by the herbicides evaluated was B. plantaginea. However, haloxyfop-methyl, <b>tepraloxydim,</b> clethodim and [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] presented the highest efficiency rates for controlling this weed. The addition of quizalofop-p-ethyl to clethodim significantly increased C. echinatus control The herbicides haloxyfop-methyl and <b>tepraloxydim</b> also presented a satisfactory control of this grass weed...|$|E
40|$|Acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACCs) {{are crucial}} {{metabolic}} enzymes {{and have been}} targeted for drug development against obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. The carboxyltransferase (CT) domain of this enzyme {{is the site of}} action for three different classes of herbicides, as represented by haloxyfop, <b>tepraloxydim,</b> and pinoxaden. Our earlier studies have demonstrated that haloxyfop and <b>tepraloxydim</b> bind in the CT active site at the interface of its dimer. However, the two compounds probe distinct regions of the dimer interface, sharing primarily only two common anchoring points of interaction with the enzyme. We report here the crystal structure of the CT domain of yeast ACC in complex with pinoxaden at 2. 8 -Å resolution. Despite their chemical diversity, pinoxaden has a similar binding mode as <b>tepraloxydim</b> and requires a small conformational change in the dimer interface for binding. Crystal structures of the CT domain in complex with all three classes of herbicides confirm the importance of the two anchoring points for herbicide binding. The structures also provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of the herbicide resistance mutations and cross resistance among the herbicides, {{as well as for the}} design and development of new inhibitors against plant and human ACCs...|$|E

The experimental design used was randomized complete blocks, with eleven treatments and four replicates, constituted by the following herbicides and adjuvants: fluazifop-p-butyl 313 g ha(- 1)) + Agral (TM) 0. 2 % v/v); sethoxydim 322 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); haloxyfop-methyl 120 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); clethodim+ fenoxaprop-p-ethyl 75 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); quizalofop-pethyl 125 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); clethodim 156 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); propaquizafop 175 g ha(- 1)) + Assist (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); <b>tepraloxydim</b> 400 g ha(- 1)) + Dash (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); butroxydim 100 g ha(- 1)) + Dash (TM) 0. 5 % v/v); isoxaflutole 60 g ha(- 1)) and weed-free check. At the moment of application, castor bean plants presented 4 to 6 leaves and Cenchrus echinatus, 1 to 5 tillers. AL Guarany 2002 cultivar presented high selectivity to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides, without visible symptoms of phytotoxicity in 14 DAA days after application), except for <b>tepraloxydim,</b> whose symptoms persisted until 21 DAA, and isoxaflutole HPPD inhibiting), which showed injuries in older leaves and significant yield reduction.

40|$|Background: Acetyl-CoA {{carboxylase}} (ACCase) inhibiting herbicides {{are important}} {{products for the}} post-emergence control of grass weed species in small grain cereal crops. However, the appearance of resistance to ACCase herbicides over time has resulted in limited options for effective weed control of key species such as Lolium spp. In this study, we have used an integrated biological and molecular biology approach to investigate the mechanism of resistance to ACCase herbicides in a Lolium multiflorum Lam. from the UK (UK 21). Methodology/Principal Findings: The study revealed a novel tryptophan to serine mutation at ACCase codon position 1999 impacting on ACCase inhibiting herbicides to varying degrees. The W 1999 S mutation confers dominant resistance to pinoxaden and partially recessive resistance to cycloxydim and sethoxydim. On the other hand, plants containing the W 1999 S mutation were sensitive to clethodim and <b>tepraloxydim.</b> Additionally population UK 21 is characterised by other resistance mechanisms, very likely non non-target site based, affecting several aryloxyphenoxyproprionate (FOP) herbicides but not the practical field rate of pinoxaden. The positive identification of wild type tryptophan and mutant serine alleles at ACCase position 1999 could be readily achieved with an original DNA based derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (dCAPS) assay that uses the same PCR product but two different enzymes for positively identifying the wild type tryptophan and mutant serine alleles identified here...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the {{mechanisms}} of herbicide resistance is important for designing long term sustainable weed management strategies. Here, we have used an integrated biology and molecular approach to investigate {{the mechanisms}} of resistance to acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibiting herbicides in a UK black-grass population (BG 2). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Comparison between BG 2 phenotypes using single discriminant rates of herbicides and genotypes based on ACCase gene sequencing showed that the I 1781 L, a novel I 1781 T, but not the W 2027 C mutations, were associated with resistance to cycloxydim. All plants were killed with clethodim and a few individuals containing the I 1781 L mutation were partially resistant to <b>tepraloxydim.</b> Whole plant dose response assays demonstrated that a single copy of the mutant T 1781 allele conferred fourfold resistance levels to cycloxydim and clodinafop-propargyl. In contrast, {{the impact of the}} I 1781 T mutation was low (Rf = 1. 6) and non-significant on pinoxaden. BG 2 was also characterised by high levels of resistance, very likely non-target site based, to the two cereal selective herbicides clodinafop-propargyl and pinoxaden and not to the poorly metabolisable cyclohexanedione herbicides. Analysis of 480 plants from 40 cycloxydim resistant black grass populations from the UK using two very effective and high throughput dCAPS assays established for detecting any amino acid changes at the 1781 ACCase codon and for positively identifying the threonine residue, showed that the occurrence of the T 1781 is extremely rare compared to the L 1781 allele. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study revealed a novel mutation at ACCase codon position 1781 and adequately assessed target site and non-target site mechanisms in conferring resistance to several ACCase herbicides in a black-grass population. It highlights that over time the level of suspected non-target site resistance to some cereal selective ACCase herbicides have in some instances surpassed that of target site resistance, including the one endowed by the most commonly encountered I 1781 L mutation...|$|E
