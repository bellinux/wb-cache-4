5|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policies frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

25|$|Concerning sewerage, out of 1,896 systems, 1,873 were {{separate}} sewer systems (between sanitary sewers and stormwater sewers) and only 23 were combined sewer systems. In 2002 about 75 {{million people were}} connected to sewers and 35 million people had their waste water treated through small-scale waste water treatment devices called jōkasōs. They are common in areas not connected to sewers, but also exist in areas connected to sewers. There is even a specific jōkasō law that regulates their construction, installation, inspection and desludging. Jōkasōs use different technologies and serve different sizes of buildings from single-family homes to high-rise buildings, public or commercial buildings. Treated water can be easily reused for various purposes such as toilet flushing, watering gardens or car washing.

25|$|The only {{indigenous}} mammals of Bermuda {{are five}} species of bats, {{all of which}} are also found in the eastern United States: Lasionycteris noctivagans, Lasiurus borealis, Lasiurus cinereus, Lasiurus seminolus and Perimyotis subflavus. Other commonly known fauna of Bermuda include its national bird, the Bermuda petrel or cahow. It was rediscovered in 1951 after having been thought extinct since the 1620s. It is important {{as an example of a}} Lazarus species. <b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> programme to protect it, including restoration of a habitat area. The Bermuda rock skink was long thought to have been the only indigenous land vertebrate of Bermuda, discounting the marine turtles that lay their eggs on its beaches. Recently through genetic DNA studies, scientists have discovered that a species of turtle, the diamondback terrapin, previously thought to have been introduced, pre-dated the arrival of humans in the archipelago. As this species spends most of its time in brackish ponds, some question whether it should be classified as a land vertebrate to compete with the skink's unique status.|$|E
25|$|Modi's {{first year}} as prime {{minister}} saw significant centralization of power relative to previous administrations. Modi personally selected the civil servants who served under his ministers, frequently giving them instructions without involving the ministers themselves. Modi's efforts at centralisation {{have been linked to}} {{an increase in the number}} of senior administration officials resigning their positions. Although <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> majority of seats in the Lok Sabha, it does not have one in the Rajya Sabha, which led to its policied frequently being stymied there. Thus, Modi resorted to passing a number of ordinances, or executive orders, to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. In 2014, the Prime Minister's Office prevented Gopal Subramaniam from being appointed to the Supreme Court. The stated reason was that his conduct in the 2G spectrum allocation scandal had been suspect: commentators stated it was because he had been the amicus curiae in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case, which had implicated BJP leaders including Modi's aide Amit Shah. The government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.|$|E

500|$|When Lincoln {{issued the}} Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, declaring freedom for all slaves in Confederate-held areas, he {{exempted}} Tennessee at Johnson's request. The proclamation increased {{the debate over}} what should become of the slaves after the war, as not all Unionists supported abolition. Johnson finally decided that slavery had to end. He wrote, [...] "If the institution of slavery... seeks to overthrow it , then <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> clear right to destroy it". He reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the Union Army, feeling that African Americans should perform menial tasks to release white Americans to do the fighting. Nevertheless, he succeeded in recruiting 20,000 black soldiers to serve the Union.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{acknowledging}} {{the possibility that}} humans may be partially responsible for climate change, Johnson rejects government action to control or limit it - including cap and trade - as ineffective. [...] "When {{you look at the}} amount of money we are looking to spend on global warming — in the trillions — and look at the result, I just argue that the result is completely inconsequential to the money we would end up spending," [...] he said. [...] "We can direct those moneys to other ways that would be much more beneficial to mankind." [...] Johnson has signed the Western Governors' Association resolution, which aims at [...] "collaborative, incentive driven, locally-based solutions," [...] and has advocated for free market solutions to environmental problems. He has stated that he will not [...] "compromise when it comes to clean air, clean land, or clean water."

500|$|Breyer wrote separately, {{concerned}} that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from Ginsberg and Miller. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: [...] "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with {{an image of a}} nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?" [...] Breyer further argued that [...] "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," [...] believing that <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions for their child as to [...] "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," [...] and that [...] "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression." [...] Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 Federal Trade Commission study.|$|E
