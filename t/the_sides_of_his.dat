5|$|While the Sudarshana Chakra is {{depicted}} as a subordinate figure with Vishnu, in many South Indian Vishnu temples, the Chakra as an ayudhapurusha is worshipped in its own shrine attached to the central temple. Here, the Chakra is regarded as an aspect of Vishnu and called Chakra-rupi Vishnu – Vishnu {{in the form of}} the Chakra. In the outline of the ordinary circular Chakra with a hexagram inscribed in it (shat-kona-chakra) – stands the personified Chakra in fierce form generally with eight arms. Often, Yoga-Narasimha, the lion-man ferocious aspect of Vishnu {{is depicted}} on the back of the Chakra sculpture. The Shilparatna describes that the fierce Chakra-rupi Vishnu should hold in his hands gada, chakra, a snake, a lotus, musala (a pestle), tramsha, pasha and ankusha. He {{is depicted as}} radiant as the sun and with protruding tusks from <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth. Another description describes the Chakra as a sixteen-armed fierce form of Vishnu. He holds a chakra, shankha, bow, parashu, asi (sword), arrow, trishula, pasha, ankusha, agni (fire), khadga (sword), shield, hala (plough), musala, gada and kunta. Three-eyed and golden-coloured with protruding tusks, the Chakra stands in the shat-kona-chakra, with Narasimha on the reverse of the sculpture.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 {{he invented}} {{a sort of}} helmet. Against the West Indies at Lord's he {{appeared}} wearing a rubber hat or cap with three peaks, two of which fitted over <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. Although a competent hooker of fast bowling he felt he needed extra protection to face bowlers such as Martindale and Constantine.|$|E

25|$|The sternsheetsman and bowman {{were to be}} {{available}} to take over from the coxswain or stoker should they be killed or injured. On longer journeys they might relieve them to rest. They also manned any additional machine guns and operated the kedge anchor, if it was required.

25|$|On {{the initial}} autopsy report in 1950, doctors {{concluded}} that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows {{in the skin}} beneath his chin and at <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> neck. There was no mark, however, {{at the back of}} the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.|$|E
25|$|Coulthard's helmet {{design is}} blue and {{consists}} of a white saltire on the top which resembles the flag of Scotland and the four tips are trepassed {{from the top of}} the chin area. Coulthard borrowed a helmet belonging to Michael Schumacher for the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix as his regular helmet was suffering from steaming up during the weekend. Upon Schumacher's first retirement in 2006, he suggested to Coulthard that he would swap one of his own helmets for one of Coulthard's, which was agreed by Coulthard. For the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix, he changed his design to grey with a stylised saltire on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> helmet, as an homage to the late World Rally Champion Colin McRae.|$|E

25|$|In May 1950, the Gilberton {{publishing}} company produced a comic-book adaptation of The Man Who Laughs {{as part of}} their prestigious Classics Illustrated series. This adaptation featured artwork by Alex A. Blum, much of it closely resembling the 1928 film (including the anachronistic Ferris wheel). The character of Gwynplaine is drawn as a handsome young man, quite normal except for two prominent creases at <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth. As this comic book was intended for juvenile readers, there may have been an intentional editorial decision to minimise the appearance of Gwynplaine's disfigurement. A revised Classics Illustrated edition, with a more faithful script by Al Sundel, and a painted cover and new interior art by Norman Nodel, was issued in the spring of 1962. Nodel's artwork showed a Gwynplaine far more disfigured than the character's appearance in either the 1928 film or the 1950 Classics edition.|$|E
500|$|Necrid is a bald, green, {{and muscular}} humanoid. His eyes glow bright red, and short bones {{protrude}} {{from his left}} arm, back, jaw and a Mohawk-like ridge on his head. The fingers on his right hand have claw points, but his left hand is much larger and has three fingers with large, talon-like bone claws. Two large, ram-like horns extend from opposite sides of his left wrist, toward and slightly beyond his elbow. His clothing consists of dark blue pants, large metal sandals held together by bandages, and armor plating covering his abdomen, <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> legs, {{and the back of}} his lower right arm. A pulsating red jewel described by McFarlane as a [...] "power plant" [...] is set in a circular piece of metal strapped to his chest. At about feet (196cm), Necrid is the second tallest Soul series character whose height is known.|$|E
500|$|Rufus is {{depicted}} as a large, heavily obese blond male. His head is mostly bald, with a long braided ponytail jutting from the top, and a mustache extending down <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mouth to his chin. His clothing consists of a yellow and black sleeveless jumpsuit with padded shoulders, with the closing straps left open due to his girth and exposing {{the center of his}} torso and lower abdominal hair. Black shoes cover his feet, while black fingerless gloves cover his hands and most of his forearms. His secondary outfit is similar, changing the jumpsuit to a dark blue and green version with sleeves and a raised collar, additionally removing the gloves and changing his hairstyle to a double ponytail. Other alternate designs were considered but rejected, amongst which included an Elvis impersonator appearance and martial artist attire. Rufus stands [...] tall, and weighs [...]|$|E

500|$|The coffin {{was loaded}} on a hearse and carried to a {{gathering}} at Fairfield; {{much of the}} gathering was spent in silence. After the coffin was removed, the assembled began talking. Frazer recalled that each person remembered Cope differently, and [...] "Few men succeeded so well in concealing from anyone... all <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> multiform character." [...] Osborn, intending to follow the coffin to the graveyard, was instead pulled aside by Collins and taken to the reading of Cope's will—Osborn and Cope's brother-in-law John Garrett were named executors. Cope gave his family a choice of his books, with the remainder to be sold or donated to the University of Pennsylvania. After debts were handled, Cope left small bequests to friends and family—Anna Brown and Julia received $5000 each, while the remainder went to Annie. Cope's estate was valued at $75,327, not including additional revenue raised by sales of fossils to the American Museum of Natural History, {{for a total of}} $84,600. Some specimens preserved in alcohol {{made their way to the}} Academy of Natural Sciences, including a few Gordian worms.|$|E
500|$|Stanton wanted WALL-E to be {{a box and}} EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's {{eyes were}} {{inspired}} {{by a pair of}} binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He [...] "missed the entire inning" [...] because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others pointed it out to him.|$|E
2500|$|Gurriel made {{a racially}} {{insensitive}} gesture {{in the dugout}} after his home run. He stretched <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> eyes and mouthing the Spanish word chinito, which translates to [...] "little Chinese Boy"; Darvish is from Japan. Gurriel apologized, and said that anyone from Asia is called a chino in Cuba, although he acknowledged knowing that the term was offensive in Japan from having played there. As a result, Gurriel was suspended {{for the first five}} games of the 2018 MLB season without pay, but allowed to continue playing in the World Series.|$|E

2500|$|Yet at {{his best}} his novels {{were among the most}} {{effectively}} and memorably written genre pieces. He also managed unusual and highly successful literary tricks: for example, halfway though A Hell Of A Woman, the first-person narrator Frank [...] "Dolly" [...] Dillon has a mental breakdown; <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality then take turns narrating the story's chapters, alternately violently psychotic (telling the sordid tale that actually happened) or sweet-natured and patient (telling the idealized fantasy that did not happen). In the final page of the original manuscript the two sides of Dillon's broken personality appear together as two separate columns of text. The publisher disliked that, and instead alternated the two narrations in one, long paragraph, alternating standard Roman type and italicised type. Thompson disliked the change, thinking it confusing and difficult for the reader.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the second}} series {{featured}} an indept storyline (possibly added {{to increase the}} shows praise), and vastly improved digital effects. Some minor aspects which were made in or changed in Season 2 included Rod's appearance being made more memorable by a mullet adorened with lightning bolts shaved into <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. Steve is vastly less tolerant to any sign of weakness expressed by his team (possibly due to their failure in Episode 7), often physically abusing them {{for no reason at}} all, and losing his apparent ability to appear anywhere to commentate on the team's progress. Kanangra is no longer a factor, but is mentioned in [...] Episode 2 to show Steve's familiarity with councils. The characters were seen talking more, hence we learn that Womp is mostly disliked, Rod and Mephisto have a minor friendship. We also learn that Steve is not the creator of Fistworthiness, having learned it from ancient monks. However, we also learn that Steve was displeased with the peaceful use of Fistworthiness and changed it into his violent version (which is nonetheless proved to be less powerful).|$|E
