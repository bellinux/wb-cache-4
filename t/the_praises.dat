5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E

Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad {{to explain why he}} wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E

40|$|Praising {{children}} is generally {{believed to have}} positive effects for educational purposes. However <b>the</b> effects of <b>praise</b> are not always as visible as expected. In this article, a research model where praise was not effective is introduced and why <b>the</b> <b>praise</b> was not effective is examined, and a new research model where praise could be effective is suggested. In past research, praise has been considered to have a one-way influence from the praiser to <b>the</b> <b>praise</b> receiver. In those research models, the role of <b>the</b> <b>praise</b> receiver was little evaluated. To study the receiver's active involvement evaluating <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>praise,</b> {{it is necessary to}} take into consideration individual traits of <b>the</b> <b>praise</b> receiver when a research model is established.

25|$|The Bhakti Movement was a {{rapid growth}} of bhakti, first {{starting}} in the later part of 1st millennium CE, from Tamil Nadu in Southern India with the Saiva Nayanars and the Vaisnava Alvars. Their ideas and practices inspired bhakti poetry and devotion throughout India over the 12th-18th century CE. The Alvars ("those immersed in God") were Vaishnava poet-saints who wandered from temple to temple singing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> of Vishnu. They established temple sites (Srirangam is one) and converted many people to Vaishnavism.|$|E

25|$|Communist China again {{compensated}} Albania for {{the loss}} of Soviet economic support, supplying about 90% of the parts, foodstuffs, and other goods the Soviet Union had promised. Beijing lent the Albanians money on more favorable terms than Moscow, and, unlike Soviet advisers, Chinese technicians earned the same low pay as Albanian workers and lived in similar housing. China also presented Albania with a powerful radio transmission station from which Tirana sang <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> of Stalin, Hoxha, and Mao Zedong for decades. For its part, Albania offered China a beachhead in Europe and acted as Communist China's chief spokesman at the UN. To Albania's dismay, however, Chinese equipment and technicians were not nearly as sophisticated as the Soviet goods and advisers they replaced. Ironically, a language barrier even forced the Chinese and Albanian technicians to communicate in Russian. Albanians no longer took part in Warsaw Pact activities or Comecon agreements. The other East European communist nations, however, did not break diplomatic or trade links with Albania. In 1964, the Albanians {{went so far as to}} seize the empty Soviet embassy in Tirana, and Albanian workers pressed on with construction of the Palace of Culture on their own.|$|E

500|$|In some legends, Hausa—described as a Varkari—is {{credited}} for Kanhopatra's {{journey to}} devotion. Other accounts credit the Varkari pilgrims who passed Kanhopatra's house {{on their way}} to the temple of Vithoba in Pandharpur. According to one story, for example, she asked a passing Varkari about Vithoba. The Varkari said that Vithoba is [...] "generous, wise, beautiful and perfect", his glory is beyond description and his beauty surpasses that of Lakshmi, the goddess of beauty. Kanhopatra further asked if Vithoba would accept her as a devotee. The Varkari assured her that Vithoba would accept her as he accepted the maid Kubja, the sinful king Ajamila and the so-called [...] "untouchable" [...] saint Chokhamela. This assurance strengthened her resolve to go to Pandharpur. In versions of the legend where Sadashiva does not appear, Kanhopatra immediately leaves for Pandharpur—singing <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> of Vithoba—with the Varkari pilgrims or coaxes her mother to accompany her to Pandharpur.|$|E

500|$|Masashi Ōji, {{writing for}} 4Gamer.net after the {{official}} release of Imagine, praised multiple {{aspects of the}} game, including its story, combat, demon mechanics, flexible character growth system and general sense of belonging within the Megami Tensei series. One recurring point raised by Ōji was that many features promised {{had yet to be}} added at that time, which faulted the experience slightly. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer greatly enjoyed the experience, echoing many of <b>the</b> <b>praises</b> given by other journalists, while finding the graphics a little dated, and said that some technical improvements would be positively met. Nick Tylwalk of Gamezebo praised the combat for being much more engaging than other free-to-play games of its type, enjoyed the character customization, and variety of demons, and [...] "excellent" [...] story. His main complaints were a steep learning curve, points where the narrative got lost, and dated-looking graphics and interface.
