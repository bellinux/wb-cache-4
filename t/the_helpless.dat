5|$|The {{adults of}} some Australian cicada {{are subject to}} a cicada-specific fungus from the genus Massospora, which grows on their {{genitalia}} and abdominal cavity, eventually causing the tail end to drop off. Australian cicadas are further preyed on by the cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and paralyses cicadas high in the trees. Their victims drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hind legs, sometimes over a distance of 100m (330ft). They are then shoved into the hunter's burrow, where <b>the</b> <b>helpless</b> cicada is placed on a shelf in an often extensive 'catacomb', to form food-stock for the wasp grub growing from the eggs deposited within.|$|E

25|$|Some fishes {{associated}} with reefs are generalized carnivores that feed {{on a variety}} of animal prey. These typically have large mouths that can be rapidly expanded, thereby drawing in nearby water and any unfortunate animals contained within the inhaled water mass.

40|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common mood disorders in the world with a life-time prevalence of approximately 17 %. MDD is characterized by emotional and cognitive disturbances, and is accompanied by volumetric changes of neural areas that likely arise from disturbed forms of neuroplasticity. The hippocampus has received a wealth of attention in MDD-related research not only because it is a prominent area to study forms of neuroplasticity, but also because it is engaged in cognitive as well as in emotional functions. In addition, the hippocampus displays a volumetric decrease in MDD. While it has been shown that stress associated with the development of MDD modulates forms of synaptic plasticity, investigations into the molecular correlates of these plastic changes are negligible. The present work investigates the immunolocalization and concentration of synaptic proteins involved in synaptic plasticity in <b>the</b> learned <b>helpless</b> model of depression. By means of immunogold electron microscopy, the relative concentration of the synaptic proteins syntaxin 1, the NMDA receptor subunit NR 2 B, and Arc were examined in different region of the synapse. The synaptic regions of interest were the active zone, the postsynaptic density (PSD), and the presynaptic and postsynaptic cytoplasm in Schaffer collateral synapses of hippocampal area CA 1. Comparing <b>the</b> learned <b>helpless</b> group to <b>the</b> wild-type group, I found a higher concentration of NR 2 B in the postsynaptic cytoplasm and in the PSD, as well as a higher concentration of Arc in the PSD of <b>the</b> learned <b>helpless</b> group. By contrasting <b>the</b> non-learned <b>helpless</b> group to <b>the</b> wild-type group, I found a lower concentration of syntaxin 1 in both the presynaptic cytoplasm and in the PSD, as well as a greater concentration of NR 2 B in the postsynaptic cytoplasm and in the PSD in <b>the</b> non-learned <b>helpless</b> group. In addition, <b>the</b> learned <b>helpless</b> group displayed a higher concentration of syntaxin 1 in the pre- and postsynaptic cytoplasm compared to <b>the</b> non-learned <b>helpless</b> group. <b>The</b> altered relative concentrations of these proteins are probably related to changes in synaptic plasticity in <b>the</b> learned <b>helpless</b> model of depression. One may speculate that the changed relative concentrations of the synaptic proteins contribute to the behavioral changes in <b>the</b> learned <b>helpless</b> model, and hence may be related to the pathology of MDD. </p...|$|R

25|$|When Sahuc {{participated in}} the Battle of Raab on 14 June, only the 8th and 25th Chasseurs were present. While Emmanuel Grouchy and Louis-Pierre Montbrun's cavalry on the right flank {{defeated}} the Austrians opposed to them, his division guarded the left. As the Austrian army withdrew {{at the end of}} the battle, Sahuc's cavalry launched a pursuit which soon came upon some Hungarian insurrection (militia) infantry formed in squares. Though the raw Hungarians fired a scattered volley, they managed to fend off the first charge because the French horsemen attacked in a disorderly fashion. The second charge was better organized. One Chasseur regiment concentrated on one side of a square and broke through. Furious at their earlier repulse, they butchered <b>the</b> <b>helpless</b> Hungarians without mercy, even cutting down those who tried to surrender.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 190s, {{northern}} China {{was divided}} between two contending warlords, Yuan Shao and Cao Cao. Each had assimilated the smaller powers around them and made political arrangements with the larger powers elsewhere, and were increasingly looking at each other for potential gains. Cao Cao had earlier secured <b>the</b> <b>helpless</b> Emperor Xian into his custody, a move that Yuan Shao regretted not to have made. After the successful conquest of Gongsun Zan's territories to the north, Yuan Shao turned to the south to prepare for an assault on Cao Cao in the summer of 199. In response, Cao Cao went on a patrol to the northern front and dispatched several armies to defend positions {{on the south side of}} the Yellow River in the eighth lunar month (September 8 - October 7) of 199. Among these was the placement of Yu Jin at Yan Ford (延津; north of present-day Yanjin County, Henan) with 2,000 troops. This position blocked Yuan Shao's direct approach over the ford toward Cao Cao's main defense lines at Guandu (官渡; northeast of present-day Zhongmu County, Henan).|$|E

25|$|In May, the Dutch {{agreed to}} support Pakubuwana II after {{considering}} that after all, the regencies in eastern interior were still loyal to this weak king but the Javano-Chinese rebel alliance had occupied the only road from Semarang to Kartasura and captured Salatiga. The princes in Mataram tried {{to attack the}} Javano-Chinese alliance but they were repulsed. On 30 June 1742, the rebels captured Kartasura and van Hohendorff had {{to run away from}} a hole in kraton wall with <b>the</b> <b>helpless</b> Pakubuwana II on his back. The Dutch, however, ignored Kartasura’s fate in rebel hands and concentrated its forces under Captain Gerrit mother and Nathaniel Steinmets to repulse the rebels around Demak, Welahan, Jepara, Kudus and Rembang. By October 1742, the northern coast of Central Java was cleaned of the rebels, who seemed to disperse into the traditional rebel hideout in Malang to the east and the Dutch forces returned to Semarang in November. Cakraningrat IV, who wished to free the eastern coast of Java from Mataram influence, could not deter the Dutch from supporting Pakubuwana II but he managed to capture and plunder Kartasura in November 1742. In December 1742, VOC negotiated with Cakraningrat and managed to persuade him to relieve Kartasura of Madurese and Balinese troops under his pay. The treasures, however, remained in Cakraningrat’s hand.|$|E

Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at <b>the</b> <b>helpless</b> Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

500|$|Allward {{constructed}} the memorial on {{the vantage point}} of Hill 145, the highest point on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is [...] high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There is a group of figures {{at each end of the}} front wall, next to the base of the steps. The Breaking of the Sword is located at the southern corner of the front wall while Sympathy of the Canadians for <b>the</b> <b>Helpless</b> is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are The Defenders and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In Breaking of the Sword, three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In Sympathy of the Canadians for <b>the</b> <b>Helpless,</b> one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.|$|E

By the end of the century only about 20 per cent admitted to workhouses were unemployed or destitute, but about 30 per cent of the population over 70 were in workhouses. The introduction of pensions for those aged over 70 in 1908 did not result in a reduction in the number of elderly housed in workhouses, but it did reduce the number of those on outdoor relief by 25 per cent.|$|E
