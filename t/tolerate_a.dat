5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing its belly in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E

A wide variety of nucleophiles {{can be used in}} conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving aliphatic, vinyl, aryl, and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant side reaction.|$|E

They are drought resistant, hardy to cold weather, and the species diversity in this genus gives gardeners {{a wide variety of}} choices. Most species that are native to Western Australia will be cold hardy to at least -1 to -2°C. The few that can be found all over Australia, like S. graminifolium, will <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> wider range of habitat since their native ranges includes a great diversity of ecoregions.

5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids {{are easy to}} culture {{on a large scale}} in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} type of postremission therapy is individualized based on a person's prognostic factors (see above) and general health. For good-prognosis leukemias (i.e. inv(16), t(8;21), and t(15;17)), people will typically undergo an additional three to five courses of intensive chemotherapy, known as consolidation chemotherapy. For people {{at high risk of}} relapse (e.g. those with high-risk cytogenetics, underlying MDS, or therapy-related AML), allogeneic stem cell transplantation is usually recommended if the person is able to <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> transplant and has a suitable donor. The best postremission therapy for intermediate-risk AML (normal cytogenetics or cytogenetic changes not falling into good-risk or high-risk groups) is less clear and depends on the specific situation, including the age and overall health of the person, the person's values, and whether a suitable stem cell donor is available.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{in the late}} 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally {{introduced}} into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all {{by the absence of}} efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-Mnemiopsis levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog has been {{detected}} {{in a wide}} range of habitats. It is generally associated with coastal swamps, wetlands, marshes, dams, ditches, small rivers, woodlands, and forests, but populations have also been found at former industrial sites (for instance, the Brickpit). It has even been found in human vessels such as bathtubs. The requirements of its habitat have been difficult to determine, for it has been found {{in a wide range}} of water bodies except fast-flowing streams. It is most typically found in short-lived freshwater ponds that are still, shallow, unshaded, and unpolluted, and it tends to avoid waters that contain predatory fish, whether native or introduced. However, it is most often found in areas that have been affected by human habitation. The frog prefers water bodies that support emergent vegetation, such as reeds and bullrushes, for basking, and winter habitats consist of available shelters around the breeding site, which can be vegetation, rocks, rubbish, or human debris and discarded building materials. Grassy habitats are usually close at hand to provide suitable terrestrial feeding grounds. It prefers waterways with a substrate of sand, rock, or clay, and can <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> wide range of water turbidities, pH and oxygen levels, and temperatures, although these can hamper physical growth. Although its legs provide much grip, the frog does not choose to climb trees or live up them to any significant extent. It spends most of its time within 10cm of the ground and rarely ventures more than a metre above the ground. The green and golden bell frog also has the ability to sit still for several minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{level of}} {{salinity}} {{can also be}} quite variable. Low salinities {{can be caused by}} rainwater or river inputs of freshwater. Estuarine species must be especially euryhaline, or able to <b>tolerate</b> <b>a</b> wide range of salinities. High salinities occur in locations with high evaporation rates, such as in salt marshes and high intertidal pools. Shading by plants, especially in the salt marsh, can slow evaporation and thus ameliorate salinity stress. In addition, salt marsh plants tolerate high salinities by several physiological mechanisms, including excreting salt through salt glands and preventing salt uptake into the roots.|$|E

25|$|Common kingfishers are {{important}} members of ecosystems and good indicators of freshwater community health.

25|$|Lake breezes {{in spring}} tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past, {{and in the}} autumn delay the onset of fall frost, {{particularly}} on the south shore. Cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season, protecting them from possible frost damage. Such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate, with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area. Apples, cherries, pears, plums, and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around Rochester.
