2500|$|During the Han Dynasty (202 BC220 AD), the {{government}} established ironworking {{as a state}} monopoly (yet repealed during {{the latter half of}} the dynasty, returned to private entrepreneurship) and built a series of large blast furnaces in Henan province, each capable of producing several tons of iron per day. By this time, Chinese metallurgists had discovered how <b>to</b> <b>puddle</b> molten pig iron, stirring it in the open air until it lost its carbon and became wrought iron. (In Chinese, the process was called chao, literally, stir frying.) By the 1st century BC, Chinese metallurgists had found that wrought iron and cast iron could be melted together to yield an alloy of intermediate carbon content, that is, steel. According to legend, the sword of Liu Bang, the first Han emperor, was made in this fashion. Some texts of the era mention [...] "harmonizing the hard and the soft" [...] in the context of ironworking; the phrase may refer to this process. Also, the ancient city of Wan (Nanyang) from the Han period forward was a major center of the iron and steel industry. Along with their original methods of forging steel, the Chinese had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel, an idea imported from India to China by the 5th century.|$|E

60|$|All round these hills, {{from here}} to Aldershot in one direction, and {{from here to}} Windsor in another, you see the same shaped glens; the wave-crest along their top, and {{at the foot of}} the crest a line of springs which run out over the slopes, or well up through them in deep sand-galls, as you call them--shaking quagmires which are {{sometimes}} deep enough to swallow up a horse, and which you love to dance upon in summer time. Now the water of all these springs is nothing but the rain, and mist, and dew, which has sunk down first through the peaty soil, and then through the gravel and sand, and there has stopped. And why? Because under the gravel (about which I will tell you a strange story one day) and under the sand, which is what the geologists call the Upper Bagshot sand, there is an entirely different set of beds, which geologists call the Bracklesham beds, from a place near the New Forest; and in those beds there is a vein of clay, and through that clay the water cannot get, as you have seen yourself when we dug it out in the field below <b>to</b> <b>puddle</b> the pond-head; and very good fun you thought it, and a very pretty mess you made of yourself. Well: because the water cannot get though this clay, and must go somewhere, it runs out continually along the top of the clay, and as it runs undermines the bank, and brings down sand and gravel continually for the next shower to wash into the stream below.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of puddling {{was that it}} used coal, not charcoal as fuel. However, that was of little advantage in Sweden, which lacked coal.

50|$|The {{large size}} of sand {{particles}} allow water to flow freely which, in turn, allows sand-based system to drain extremely well.

50|$|The hearth {{is where}} the iron is charged, melted and puddled. The hearth's shape is usually elliptical; 1.5 - 1.8 m in length and 1 - 1.2 m wide. If the furnace is {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>puddle</b> white iron then the hearth depth is never more than 50 cm. If the furnace is designed to boil gray iron then the average hearth depth is 50 - 75 cm. Due to the great heat required to melt the charge the grate had to be cooled, else it would melt with the charge. This was done by running a constant charge of cool air on it, or by throwing water {{on the bottom of}} the grate.|$|E

Under zero-g condition the maximum heat transport {{of the pipe}} may decrease as much as 30 % depending on the liquid slug behavior in the condenser section. In one-g environment the performance depends mainly on the fluid charge. The maximum heat transport, if over-charged, is almost equal to the value for uniform heating and cooling due <b>to</b> <b>puddling</b> effect. However, for some heater-cooler combinations the temperature drop across the heat pipe becomes very large.

During this transformation famous (but unfinished) works were lost, including the Battle of Cascina by Michelangelo, and the Battle of Anghiari by Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo was commissioned in 1503 to paint one long wall with a battle scene celebrating a famous Florentine victory. He was always trying new methods and materials and decided to mix wax into his pigments. Da Vinci had finished painting part of the wall, but it wasn't drying fast enough, so he brought in braziers stoked with hot coals to try to hurry the process. As others watched in horror, the wax in the fresco melted under the intense heat and the colors ran down the walls <b>to</b> <b>puddle</b> on the floor.
