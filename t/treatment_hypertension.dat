50|$|Familial hyperaldosteronism is a {{group of}} {{inherited}} conditions in which the adrenal glands, which are small glands located on top of each kidney, produce too much of the hormone aldosterone. Excess aldosterone causes the kidneys to retain more salt than normal, which in turn increases the body's fluid levels and causes high blood pressure. People with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood pressure, often early in life. Without <b>treatment,</b> <b>hypertension</b> increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure. There are other forms of hyperaldosteronism that are not inherited.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} {{hypertension}} within the United Kingdom {{has turned to}} examining the role that beliefs play in its diagnosis and <b>treatment.</b> <b>Hypertension</b> is an essential topic for study since it is linked to increased risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. The most common treatment for hypertension is medication but compliance for this treatment plan is low. A study conducted in the UK examined the differences between 'white' patients and first generation immigrants from the West Indies. There were differing reasons for non-compliance that involve the patients' perception and beliefs about the diagnosis. Patients commonly believe that high levels of anxiety when first diagnosed are the major cause and think that when stress levels decline so too will their hypertension. Other respondents in this UK based study had varying beliefs concerning the necessity of medication while others still {{argued that it was}} the side effects of medication that made them end their prescribed regimen. West Indian respondents whose lay culture teaches them to reject long-term drug therapy opted instead for folk remedies in higher numbers than the 'white' respondents. What can be seen here is that some people will choose to ignore a doctor's expert advice and will employ 'lay consultation' instead.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is taken}} for granted that diuretics may induce gout, {{but there is a}} general lack of {{evidence}} on this topic. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of gout in patients who use diuretics, taking into account concurrent hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: A case-control study was designed. From a primary care population all patients with a first gout registration (59 men, 11 women; mean (SD) age 55. 1 (13. 5)) were identified as cases. To relate the occurrence of gout to diuretic use a matched reference series of three controls for each case was compiled. Conditional logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of gout, and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), in subjects with and without diuretic <b>treatment,</b> <b>hypertension,</b> and cardiovascular diseases. Additional stratification analyses were made, particularly in the subjects not using diuretics. RESULTS: The IRRs of gout in subjects with v those without diuretic <b>treatment,</b> <b>hypertension,</b> heart failure, and myocardial infarction were 2. 8 (95 % CI 1. 2 to 6. 6), 2. 6 (95 % CI 1. 2 to 5. 6), 20. 9 (95 % CI 2. 5 to 173. 8), and 1. 9 (95 % CI 0. 7 to 4. 7), respectively. After adjustment, the IRR of gout for diuretic use dropped to 0. 6 (95 % CI 0. 2 to 2. 0), while the IRRs of gout for hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction were still > 1. This was also the case for subjects with hypertension or myocardial infarction, who had not used diuretics. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that diuretics do not actually increase the risk of gout.

The present study tested the hypotheses (1) that insulin dependent diabetes (IDD) causes hypertension, and (2) that simultaneous hypertension and IDD causes greater renal damage than would be expected from the independent contributions of each disease. IDD was induced by injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg i. p.) into male Wistar rats, causing severe hyperglycaemia within 4 days.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{the present}} {{experiments}} was to evaluate the differences in arterial pressure between H-Ras lacking mice and control mice and to analyze the mechanisms involved in {{the genesis of the}} differences. H-Ras lacking mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts from these animals were used. Blood pressure was measured using 3 different methods: direct intraarterial measurement in anesthetized animals, tail-cuff sphygmomanometer, and radiotelemetry. H-Ras lacking mice showed lower blood pressure than control animals. Moreover, the aorta protein content of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, soluble guanylyl cyclase, and cyclic guanosine monophosphate–dependent protein kinase was higher in H-Ras knockout mice than in control animals. The activity of these enzymes was increased, because urinary nitrite excretion, sodium nitroprusside–stimulated vascular cyclic guanosine monophosphate synthesis, and phosphorylated vasoactive-stimulated phosphoprotein in aortic tissue increased in these animals. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from H-Ras lacking mice showed higher cyclic guanosine monophosphate–dependent protein kinase promoter activity than control cells. These results strongly support the upregulation of the nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway in H-Ras–deficient mice. Moreover, they suggest that H-Ras pathway could be considered as a therapeutic target for hypertension <b>treatment.</b> (<b>Hypertension.</b> 2010; 56 : 484 - 489.)

40|$|Approximately 20 – 40 % of {{diabetic}} patients develop nephropathy {{which is}} the leading cause of ESRD in developed countries. The ACE I/D polymorphism is thought to be a marker for functional polymorphism which regulates circulating and tissue ACE activity. While the initial study found a protective effect of the II genotype on the development of nephropathy in IDDM patients, subsequent studies have addressed the role of ACE I/D polymorphism in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. RAAS blockers are the first line drugs for the <b>treatment</b> <b>hypertension</b> associated with diabetes and have been widely used in everyday clinical practice for the purpose of reducing proteinuria in patients with various renal diseases. However, the antiproteinuric effect of RAAS blockers is variable and the percentage of reducing proteinuria is in the range of 20 – 80 %. The antiproteinuric effect of RAAS blockers may be related to a number of factors: the type or the dose of RAAS blockers, the duration of therapy, the level of sodium intake, and the type of patient’s ACE I/D genotype. Besides the nongenetic factors, drug responses, can be influenced by ACE gene polymorphism. In this review, we discuss the relationship between ACE I/D polymorphism and diabetic nephropathy and therapeutic response of RAAS blockers...|$|E

Thirty four acromegalic patients were studied by non-invasive techniques. Seven of these patients had raised plasma concentrations of growth hormone at the time of study; three were newly diagnosed and had not received any <b>treatment.</b> <b>Hypertension</b> was present in nine (26 %) but only three (9 %) had electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy. Echocardiography showed ventricular hypertrophy in 12 (48 %) and increased left ventricular mass in 17 (68 %) patients. Holter monitoring detected important ventricular arrhythmias in 14 patients. Thallium- 201 scanning showed evidence for coronary heart disease in eight patients. Systolic time intervals were normal except when there was coexistent ischaemic heart disease. A comparison between 19 acromegalic patients with no other detectable cause of heart disease and 22 age matched controls showed appreciably abnormal left ventricular diastolic function in the group with acromegaly.

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{arguments}} put forward against the primary use of b-blockers has been concern about adverse metabolic effects, such as unfavorable effects on lipids or insulin sensitivity. Another less-appreciated potential drawback is their propensity to cause weight gain in some patients. In 8 evaluable prospective randomized controlled trials that lasted $ 6 months, body weight was higher in the b-blocker than {{in the control group}} {{at the end of the}} study. The median difference in body weight was 1. 2 kg (range 20. 4 to 3. 5 kg). A regression analysis suggested that b-blockers were associated with an initial weight gain during the first few months. Thereafter, no further weight gain compared with controls was apparent. There was no relationship between demographic characteristics and changes in body weight. Based on these observations, the first-line use of b-blockers in obese hypertensive patients should be reviewed.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{formulate}} and evaluate the administration of bisoprolol hemifumarate (BH) using transdermal delivery systems. The following formulae were prepared as a reservoir to be used in batch formulae. Gels: carbopol 934 and carbopol 940 (C. 934 and C. 940); each in three different concentrations was prepared. In addition, emulgels were prepared and thermo sensitive gels utilizing Pluronic F 127 (P. F 127). The physicochemical properties of the drug were characterized by determining the partition coefficients. Subsequently, the prepared formulae were evaluated according to their rheological properties, in vitro release using a USP dissolution tester, in vitro diffusion using Franz's diffusion cells and bioavailability (studied in albino rabbits). All the formulae were manifested as pseudoplastic flow with thixotropy. In general, the viscosity of the prepared formulae increased with increasing the polymer concentrations, and this led to a decline in the percentage of the drug released. From all the formulae that were tested, pluronic F 127 gave the highest drug concentration in rabbits (The highest Cmax and the lowest Tmax) in comparison to the other formulae and the oral commercial formulae. So, transdermal application of 20 % (w/w) P. F 127 gel containing 0. 5 % w/w BH can be a promising new dosage form for <b>treatment</b> <b>hypertension</b> and angina pectoris.

40|$|Introduction. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is {{the most}} common {{pediatric}} urologic abnormality and since it can predispose to urinary tract infection and resultant kidney scar it is an important issue in pediatric nephrourology. Methods. A retrospective chart review and follow-up of 958 patients with primary VUR was performed in the Children’s Medical Center, Tehran, Iran. Children with primary vesicoureteral reflux were included in the study and these parameters were studied: age, sex, clinical presentation, VUR grade, sonographic findings, DMSA changes, treatment modality (medical, surgical or endoscopic) and response to <b>treatment,</b> <b>hypertension</b> (presence/absence), urinary tract infection recurrence and development of new kidney scars in patients under medical treatment. Results. VUR was more prevalent in girls. Sonography was unable to detect VUR in many cases. Presence of renal scars was strongly associated with degree of reflux. Medical management was effective in a substantial percentage of patients and they experienced full resolution of reflux. This was especially true for lower degrees of VUR. 17. 6 % of patients developed new kidney scars on followup which was associated with higher degrees of VUR. Hypertension and breakthrough urinary tract infection was an uncommon finding in our patients. Conclusion. Medical management, which means using prophylactic antibiotics for prevention of urinary tract infection, is effective in many cases of VUR especially in cases with lower degrees of VUR. Surgical and endoscopic procedures must be reserved for patients with higher degrees of VUR unresponsive to conservative management or in whom new scars may develop...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Diabetic {{retinopathy}} is {{a leading}} cause of blindness in adults and is unique in displaying a uniform epidemiology profile worldwide. Diabetic maculopathy is the most common microvascular complication in diabetes which can produce severe visual loss. Apart from diabetes, a number of systemic factor like hypertension, has an important role in occurrence and progression of DME. Thus control of these factors along with control of blood sugars can prevent or reverse the maculopathy and there by restore the vision of diabetic patients. OBJECTIVE To study the association of diabetic maculopathy with hypertension and to highlight the effect of this factor on onset and/or progression of diabetic maculopathy. METHODS A cross sectional two group comparative study was carried out in 100 diabetic patients with retinopathy more than 18 years attending the department of ophthalmology (Katuri medical college) in the period of September 2012 to April 2014. For all patients, visual acuity with Snellen’s chart, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure by applanation tonometry, fundus examination with direct, indirect ophthalmoscopy and 90 D lens was conducted.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionSystemic venous {{circulation}} anomalies are uncommon; {{they are often}} incidental findings during echocardiography. CaseA 56 -year-old man, with dextrocardia, was evaluated for dyspnea. The patient's medical history included diabetes mellitus requiring insulin <b>treatment,</b> <b>hypertension,</b> and tobacco use. Physical examination revealed normal jugular venous pulsations and clear lungs. Cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds, and grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur over the right precordium. Echocardiography revealed normal chamber size and systolic function, without significant valvular lesions. The coronary sinus was dilated. It was evaluated using intravenous agitated saline contrast to rule out anomalous venous drainage or shunting. When injected into the left antecubital vein, contrast appeared initially in the right atrium followed by the right ventricle. However, when injected into the right antecubital vein, contrast appeared initially in the dilated coronary sinus followed by the right atrium and right ventricle. There {{was no evidence of}} intracardiac shunting. These findings were consistent with persistent right superior vena cava in the setting of situs inversus dextrocardia, with normally draining left superior vena cava. ConclusionPersistent superior vena cava connection to the coronary sinus is often incidental but an important finding which helps in planning safe invasive procedures. <Learning objective: Understand the importance of identifying anomalous venous connections with regard to catheter-based procedures. Appreciate the incidence of these vascular anomalies in the normal population and in congenital heart disease.
