25|$|Prevention is by {{avoiding}} things {{that cause the}} disease. Treatment includes medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, or proton pump inhibitors. During an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help. If gastritis is due to NSAIDs these may be stopped. If H. pylori is present it may be treated {{with a combination of}} antibiotics such as amoxicillin and clarithromycin. For those with pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 supplements are recommended either by mouth or by injection. People are usually advised to avoid foods <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> them.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." [...] Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented psychedelic music, to which he laughed and replied: [...] "A mad scientist approach... I don't consider [...] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions." ...|$|E

500|$|Quatermass and the Pit {{continues}} to be generally well regarded among critics. John Baxter notes in Science Fiction in the Cinema that “Baker's unravelling of this crisp thriller is tough and interesting. [...] The film has moments of pure terror, perhaps the most effective that in which the drill operator, driven off the spaceship by the mysterious power within is {{caught up in a}} whirlwind that fills the excavation with a mass of flying papers.” John Brosnan, writing in The Primal Scream, found that, “As a condensed version of the serial, the film is fine but the old black-and-white version, though understandably creaky in places and with inferior effects, still works surprisingly well, having more time to build up a disturbing atmosphere. Bill Warren in Keep Watching the Skies! said, “The ambition of the storyline is contained in a well-constructed mystery that unfolds carefully and clearly”. Nigel Kneale had mixed feelings about the end result: he said, “I was very happy with Andrew Keir, who they eventually chose, and very happy with the film. There are, however, a few things <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> me... The special effects in Hammer films were always diabolical.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "From {{the very}} first moment I saw him," [...] she confessed. [...] "Don't let <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> you, dear. He would never look at me except as a little pal. I never {{expected}} anything from him--anything serious, of course--never dared to hope for it. I have thrown myself at {{his head in the}} most shameless manner. It is all no good. I never met any one like him before. Louise, do you know that he is good--really good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father, I {{am sorry}} to say, is no better; indeed, {{although}} the doctors deny it, I believe he is worse, and I see no prospect of our getting away from here at present. However, don't let <b>that</b> <b>bother</b> you, and above all, don't think of coming out to this place which makes you miserable, and where you can't work. What a queer menage you must be at the Abbey now! You and the Star who has risen from the ocean--she {{ought to have been}} called Venus--tete-a-tete, and the, I gather, rather feeble and uninteresting old gentleman in bed upstairs. I should like to see you when you didn't know. Why don't you invent a machine to enable people at a distance to see as well as to hear each other? It would be very popular and bring Society to utter wreck. Does the Northern star--she is Danish, isn't she?--make good coffee, and how, oh! how does she get on with the cook?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then came}} that horrible embroilment--oh, {{how well he}} remembered it. Ah me, ah me, it seemed but yesterday--when his father insisted he was to marry Lady Emily Croke, Lord Aldeburgh's daughter; and he dared not marry her, of course, having a wife already, and he dared not tell his father, on the other hand, why he couldn't marry her. It was a hateful time. He shrank from recalling it. He was keeping Lucy, then his own wedded wife, as Mrs. Waring, in small rooms in Plymouth; and yet he was running up to town now and again, on leave, as the gay young bachelor, the heir of Tilgate Park--and meeting Emily Croke at every party he went to in London--and braving the Admiral's wrath by refusing to propose to her. What he would ever have done if Lucy had lived, he couldn't imagine. But, there! Lucy DIDN'T live; so he was saved <b>that</b> <b>bother.</b> Poor child, it brought tears to his eyes even now to think of her. He brushed them furtively away, lest he should waken Lady Emily.|$|E

6000|$|The cook said, [...] "Oh yes, ma'am," [...] and {{she gave}} me a good stare, while Mrs. Makely went to the kitchen window and made me observe that it let in the outside air, though the court that it opened into was so dark that one had to keep the {{electrics}} going in the kitchen night and day. [...] "Of course, it's an expense," [...] she said, as she closed the kitchen door after us. She added, in a low, rapid tone, [...] "You must excuse my introducing the cook. She has read all about you in the papers--you didn't know, I suppose, that there were reporters that day of your delightful talk in the mountains, but I had them--and she was wild, when she heard you were coming, and made me promise to let her have a sight of you somehow. She says she wants to go and live in Altruria, and {{if you would like to}} take home a cook, or a servant of any kind, you wouldn't have much trouble. Now here," [...] she ran on, without a moment's pause, while she flung open another door, [...] "is what you won't find in every apartment-house, even very good ones, and that's a back elevator. Sometimes there are only stairs, and they make the poor things climb the whole way up from the basement, when they come in, and all your marketing has to be brought up that way, too; sometimes they send it up on a kind of dumb-waiter, in the cheap places, and you give your orders to the market-men down below through a speaking-tube. But here we have none of <b>that</b> <b>bother,</b> and this elevator is for the kitchen and housekeeping part of the flat. The grocer's and the butcher's man, and anybody who has packages for you, or trunks, or that sort of thing, use it, and, of course, it's for the servants, and they appreciate not having to walk up as much as anybody." ...|$|E
