40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the possibility of}} applying a homogenization procedure to analyse the convergence of a <b>tunnel</b> <b>reinforced</b> by bolts, regarded as periodically distributed linear inclusions. Owing {{to the fact that}} a classical homogenization method fails to account for the interactions prevailing between the bolts and the surrounding ground, and thus tends to significantly overestimate the reinforcement effect in terms of convergence reduction, a so-called multiphase model is presented and developed, aimed at improving the classical homogenization method. Indeed according to this model, the bolt-reinforced ground is represented at the macroscopic scale as the superposition of two mutually interacting continuous phases, describing the ground and the reinforcement network, respectively. It is shown that such a multiphase approach can be interpreted {{as an extension of the}} homogenization procedure, making it thus possible to capture the ground-reinforcement interaction in a proper way, provided that the constitutive parameters of the model, and notably those relating to the interaction law, can be identified from the reinforced ground characteristics. The numerical implementation of this model in a f. e. m-based computer code is then carried out, and a first illustrative application is finally presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an elasto-plastic analytical solution of an axi-symmetrical {{problem for a}} circular <b>tunnel</b> <b>reinforced</b> by grouted bolts. Considered as the improved model of Indraratna and Kaiser (Int. J. Rock. Mech. Min. Sci. Geomech. Abstr. 1990; 27 : 269 - 281; Int. J. Numer. Anal. Meth. Geomech. 1990; 14 : 227 - 251), in proposed solution the rock mass obeys the non-linear Hoek-Brown yield criterion (version 2002) {{in terms of its}} peak and residual strength parameters (the most spread strength criterion for the rock masses). The proposed approach considers a 0. 5 for the rock mass and {{is based on the assumption}} that after the peak strength of the rock is reached, the material loses its strength, as dictated by a strength loss parameter. The strength loss parameter makes it possible to model either elastic-perfectly plastic or elastic-brittle-plastic behaviour. Because of the mathematical complexity, numerical treatments have been used to assist the solution in order to evaluate the equilibrium and compatibility equations. The concept of equivalent material for Hoek-Brown strength parameters is introduced to describe the rock mass improvement due to bolting effect. The results of the numerical analyses reveal a linear relation between the improved Hoek-Brown strength parameters and residual ones, taking into consideration the bolt density parameter (beta). The proposed solution is able to analyse the stress and displacement state in the presence of a bolting intervention with the objective of improving the degree of stability of the rock around the tunnel. Descriptive applications of the derived elasto-plastic solutions are also presented to explain the effectiveness of the grouted bolts in convergence reduction. Evidences obtained by numerical analysis verify the analytical solution. Copyright q 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Lt...|$|R

Precast tunnel segments have been adopted to test this fibre-reinforced solutions for structural elements, in which the longitudinal reinforcement has been designed to comply only with EC 2 minimum reinforcement requirements for no seismic design situations. This experimental campaign is the final step of a wider research, aimed at investigating an optimized mixture {{for the use of the}} polymeric fibres ISTRICE, as well as investigating the performance of some structural elements such as slabs, beams and tunnel segments, which are produced by using such a mix design. The experimental programme has been devised in such a way that in a first stage the structural behaviour of a fibre-reinforced tunnel segment has been first of all investigated under a 3 point bending test at 7 days after casting, mainly to underline the behaviour that this element would have in an initial movement phase. In a second stage the {{effectiveness of}} the fibre reinforced solution has been checked testing the tunnel segment under a lateral compression at 28 days, to highlight the behaviour of the element during the assembly stage with the advancing of the TBM.

However this was abandoned and a provision of a straight <b>tunnel,</b> with <b>reinforced</b> structure was left. However upon the change in the Metro development plans in the early 1960s, a future transfer point was to be organised in the area. As a result, in 1975, after the opening of Pushkinskaya station, works began. The design marked a real engineering achievement, as the central hall, and the passenger platforms were built without any disruption to the service.The station is located under the Pushkin Square in Moscow and was originally called Gorkovskaya after Maxim Gorky for whom the intersecting street, one of the main in Moscow was named up till 1990, when the old name was returned to the street and the station was renamed. The decoration is dedicated to the works of the author, and architects R. Semerdzhiev, B. Thor, N. Shreter and V. Cheremin made best to simultaneously show the revolutionary constructivism shapes of flared pylons and plastered ceiling thus leaving the engineering achievement visible. White marble was used for pylons and walls and red granite for the floor. Originally the end of the station was decorated with a sculptural composition dedicated to the theme of his works. However, in 1987 after the opening of a transfer with Chekhovskaya, the composition was moved to the escalator lobby in the transfer. Transfer to Pushkinskaya is achieved through the two underplatform passageways, and via the vestibule under the Pushkin square which they share.

However, {{there are very few}} studies on the life cycle impact of China’s HSR systems {{compared}} to studies around the world. Environmental impacts of China’s HSR could be very significant due to dependence on dirty coal-fired power and material and energy intensive bridges. Thus, a life cycle assessment of China’s HSR systems is necessary. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to investigate environmental impacts of China’s HSR system between Beijing and Shanghai, assessing life cycle stages including: (1) vehicle manufacture, maintenance, and disposal; (2) infrastructure construction; (3) operation. Data from Chinese Ministry of Railway, Ecoinvent database, and Chinese Core Life Cycle Database (CLCD), are compiled to build the HSR’s life cycle inventory. LCA software eBalance is used to conduct the analysis. Additional scenarios are developed by varying infrastructure composition, electricity mix, HSR development, travel length of cross-line vehicles, vehicle utilization, occupancy rate, and use of fly ash in concrete, in order to help identify major drivers of environmental impact and propose recommendations for improvement. It is discovered that operation stage contributes to 72 - 91 % of the impacts in Acidification Potential (AP), Primary Energy Demand (PED), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Global Warming Potential (GWP), and Respiratory Inorganics (RI). Vehicle stage contributes to 43 % of impact in Chinese Abiotic Depletion Potential (CADP).

40|$|Tunnel safety, {{especially}} {{in case of}} fires, has {{received a lot of}} attention due to heavy disasters. However, much attention is paid to controlling and extinguishing the fire, and not so much on the role of human behaviour. In this case, human behaviour includes the behaviour of road users, rail passengers, tunnel operators and emergency rescue services. Increasing the safety of tunnels starts with a proper design. The less chance of small accidents and incidents, the less chance of larger incidents or fires. Good design starts with proper lighting, signalling, enough lateral space and proper transitions from outside to inside the tunnel. In case of an accident or even a fire, In case of accidents or incidents in tunnels, the tunnel user has to understand {{what is going on in}} order to be able to show the right behavior. However, the question is whether knowing what is going on is sufficient, since people often underestimate a fire. The first period of a fire is very important, since there is no time to be lost. In case of fires, significant time can be lost from the moment the fire starts until people understand that they are in mortal danger and start of the actual the evacuation process. When this period is long, the possibility for loss of lives increases. Proper unambiguous signs should be provided (e. g. playing a fire alarm sound and specific instructions of a tunnel operator) and the same messages should be repeated via various channels. Information needs to be ‘over-complete’, with if possible a repetition of additional messages. Also, people with visible official status should be sent inside the <b>tunnel</b> to <b>reinforce</b> public address announcements and issue instructions to help people make the right decisions. Tunnel operators should inform the public and should stress that this is not a general message but that this is actually applying to them.

Field data were collected mainly with a 250 MHz Noggin GPR system manufactured by Sensors and Software Limited, but some additional data were also collected using frequencies of 50 and 100 MHz. Good results were achieved for mapping fractures, characterising an aggregate deposit and for locating infrastructure including, <b>tunnels,</b> voids, steel <b>reinforcing</b> bars and capping for a mineshaft.
