30|$|Hysterectomy, either {{abdominal}} {{and more}} commonly vaginally, and previous vaginal prolapse repair particularly enterocele and are recognised as risk factors <b>for</b> <b>vaginal</b> rupture. Dissection during vaginal surgery devascularises tissues and compromises {{the integrity of}} vaginal fascia and encourages vaginal shortening [1]. Prolonged use of <b>vaginal</b> pessaries <b>for</b> <b>vaginal</b> prolapse may lead to stretching, thinning, ulceration and weakness of the vaginal tissues and {{increase the risk of}} vaginal rupture particularly if vaginal surgical repair is subsequently used to manage the prolapse.|$|R
40|$|A single {{blind study}} of 103 women with vaginal candidosis was {{undertaken}} to compare treatment with conventional topical clotrimazole and oral ketoconazole. Both treatment regimens were equally effective {{in terms of}} clinical symptoms, negative results on culture for Candida albicans, and relapse rates. As treatment <b>for</b> <b>vaginal</b> candidosis takes several days, patient compliance is important {{and the success of}} a treatment regimen may depend on its acceptability to patients. Those in this study who had previously been treated <b>for</b> <b>vaginal</b> candidosis were asked to compare their current and previous treatments. Significantly more (p less than 0. 001) of those treated with ketoconazole than those treated with clotrimazole found it more acceptable than previous treatment. This indicated a strong preference for oral treatment, and oral antifungal agents may be the treatment of choice <b>for</b> <b>vaginal</b> candidosis in the future...|$|R
40|$|Objective Schistosomiasis {{is known}} to occur in preschool-aged children, but {{achieving}} accurate dosing of praziquantel {{in its current form}} is challenging. While waiting for a paediatric formulation, {{there is a need to}} develop a means for using the available products to treat this age group. Current 600 -mg tablets are differently scored to give units of 150 mg (a quarter of a tablet) or 300 mg (half a tablet). Methods We examined several dosing schemes to dose accurately (40 - 60 mg/kg) children aged 3 – 72 months (weight range 4 – 25 kg, based on available weight-for-age growth references from sub-Saharan Africa and Brazil, n = 106, 230). Results Adequate dosing can be achieved with formulations that can be split into four 150 mg quarters for children weighing 5 kg or more, and with tablets than can be split into two 300 mg halves for children weighing 10 kg or more. Giving ½ <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 5 – 7 kg; ¾ <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 8 – 10 kg; 1 <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 11 – 15 kg; 1 ½ <b>tablet</b> <b>for</b> 16 – 21 kg; and two <b>tablets</b> <b>for</b> 22 – 25 kg will have 100...|$|R
