500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. I suppose it was the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It never seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very good idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E

[...] But that is not the whole story. Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night-time light, characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love, acceptance and a better life." [...] Jennifer Devere Brody {{commented on the}} film's exclusion of Philip DeVine, a disabled African-American man who was another victim of the shooting. [...] "Perhaps one can only speculate about the motivations behind this decision. But the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations.|$|E

500|$|Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick's {{films are}} {{considered}} by film historian Michel Ciment to be [...] "among {{the most important}} contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", and he is frequently cited {{as one of the}} greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. [...] Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, Woody Allen, Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers, Ridley Scott, and George A. Romero, [...] have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration. On the DVD of Eyes Wide Shut, Steven Spielberg comments that the way Kubrick [...] "tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories" [...] and that [...] "nobody could shoot a picture better in history". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's Kubrick, film director Martin Scorsese notes that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood when first released, and came to be regarded as masterpieces only in the years after their releases. Orson Welles, one of Kubrick's greatest personal influences and all-time favorite directors, said that: [...] "Among those whom I would call 'younger generation', Kubrick appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> giant." ...|$|E

On 13 January, Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that [...] "In all matters of custom and tradition, even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is". On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce, describing himself as [...] "a dead man, one fundamentally a Peel–Cobden man". In 1896, in his last noteworthy speech, he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool. On 2 January 1897, Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism: [...] "I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by you and your friends with sincere interest, and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism".|$|E
2500|$|Chakraverti {{announced}} {{the launch of}} the Wiccan Brigade in November 2006. It was a platform for those interested in studying Wicca and using the branch of knowledge to holistic effect. Though Wicca was predominantly practiced by women, Wiccan Brigade welcomed men also. Chakraverti commented, [...] "Close to 100 people, comprising professionals, some housewives and many students, have approached me on the Net to start the group. I think it’s the right time to institutionalize Wicca. [...] Though it wouldn’t be possible to have here the kind of training we had in the Laurentians, there would be sessions on yoga and meditation, and lectures and group discussions." [...] A batch of 25 people were selected through a screening process and they [...] participated in the sessions consisting of social, historical, psychological and gender-related issues of Wicca. In July 2007, the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) nominated Chakraverti to head a panel tasked with improving the status of young girls in India. She launched the Wiccan Brigade in London in December 2007and [...] named it [...] Ipsita’s Yogini Club. Chakraverti commented, [...] "I’ve always believed the yogini and the witch are the same, and London seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> place where various cultures of the world have come together. It has a rich cultural history and an atmosphere in which the spirit of the past lives on. It is the right place for the Yogini Club." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always seemed to be looking past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E
