However, Flame Princess, {{confused}} by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her. She ventures to the Goblin Kingdom, intent on turning it into her new domain. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, return to the tree fort and, with the help of N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by Andy Milonakis), build flame-retardant battle robots.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Guillory was a {{lead in the}} {{ensemble}} cast of the fantasy Eragon, the film adaptation of the novel by Christopher Paolini; the role reunited her with The Time Machine co-star Jeremy Irons. She portrayed Arya Dröttningu, an elf princess. She had not read the novels before filming, but after accepting the role she became a fan of Paolini's work. Although Arya is a key character in the film, Guillory had little screen time {{and went on to}} say jokingly: [...] "I've been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> friends who've seen the trailer [...] I'm like, [...] " [...] but that's my whole part!"" [...] Eragon was not well received by the critics, but was nominated as Best Fantasy Film at the 2006 Saturn Awards. The film grossed approximately $75million in the US and $173.9million elsewhere, totaling $249million worldwide. Guillory was invited to reprise her role as Jill Valentine in , the sequel to Resident Evil: Apocalypse, but could not accept due to scheduling conflicts with Eragon.|$|E
500|$|When {{translating}} its game titles, Square Enix {{tries to}} take into account the cultural differences between Japan and the target territories. This sometimes involves rewriting dialogue or altering graphics, animations, and sounds. For instance, in Chocobo Racing, visual references to the Japanese folk heroes Momotarō and Kiji were changed to depict Hansel and Gretel, since the game was designed mainly for children, and Hansel and Gretel are better known in the West than Momotarō and Kiji. According to Honeywood, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the original development teams why some changes are needed can range from [...] "frustrating to downright hilarious". Generally, older development teams trust the translators with making changes while newer teams can be more reluctant, though they usually build up trust gradually. The localization team for The World Ends with You chose to preserve the Japanese elements to ensure the game's cultural aspect remained intact. While localizing Final Fantasy XII, translators Smith and Reeder worked to preserve the original script's meaning while using English dialects to reproduce the Japanese dialects found in the original version to identify factions within the game.|$|E

2500|$|Honus Wagner {{later wrote}} about {{a game in}} which the Giants were {{complaining}} about the umpire's refusal to suspend a game due to rain. [...] Wagner wrote, [...] "So Dummy Taylor, one of the Giant pitchers, went out to the third base coaching lines in his hip boots and a raincoat. [...] Then the umpire did get mad. [...] He chased Taylor out of the park, and it was funny to see Dummy <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him that he shouldn't be ejected." [...] Taylor later recalled that the umpire, Johnston, [...] "not only chased me, but declared the game forfeited to the other club." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 4, 2001, he was {{ejected from}} the American Airlines Arena in Miami during a {{basketball}} game between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks for cursing. After the game, referee Joe Forte said that he ordered him moved during the fourth quarter because [...] "there {{was a little boy}} sitting next to him and a lady sitting by him. He used some words he knows he shouldn't have used." [...] Forte apparently didn't know who Buffett was, and censured Heat coach Pat Riley because he thought Riley—who was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him who Buffett was—was insulting him by asking if he'd ever been a [...] "Parrothead", the nickname for Buffett fans. Buffett didn't comment immediately after the incident, but discussed it with Matt Lauer on The Today Show three days later.|$|E

[...] She was also persuaded that Golda was a [...] "grand-scale person," [...] one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role [...] "also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany." ...|$|E
