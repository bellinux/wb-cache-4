40|$|A {{study of}} soil and {{vegetation}} characteristics within a small area of coastal heath near The Gap, Albany, Western Australia, showed that significant differences exist in plant species composition between podzol and non-podzol (calcareous) soil environments. Leaf extracts of common plant species from podzol, non-podzol and <b>transitional</b> <b>soil</b> sites were tested {{for their ability to}} complex with iron. Only those species on the podzol and transitional soils proved to have this ability. Soil column experiments tested the rates of iron mobilization and results indicate that the podzol vegetation elutant solution, which was found to contain the iron-complexing agent gallic acid, was superior to the non-podzol vegetation elutant solution in the rate at which it mobilized iron. It is suggested that initiation of podzolization is due to the presence of gallic acid in the leaves of certain of the species in the coastal heath association, and that the pattern of podzol distribution can be linked to both plant succession and inherent differences in soil parent material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransitional {{behaviour}} {{has been}} recognised in a {{diverse range of}} soils in the literature to date, from gap-graded soils to well-graded silts and sands. It is typified by non-convergent compression paths and critical state lines that are non-unique and which are dependent on the initial sample density. Many soil mechanics theories assume soils to have unique normal compression and/or critical state lines, {{which is not the}} case for a <b>transitional</b> <b>soil.</b> For such a soil it would therefore be difficult to identify the effects of structure on the mechanics since there is no unique behaviour of the soil when reconstituted. This paper describes series of oedometer tests that were performed to investigate in more detail when and why non-convergent compression behaviour might be expected, as a first step to identifying which soils are transitional. The effects of mixing soils of different grain sizes and mineralogies were explored, the tests revealing that convergent or non-convergent behaviour could be brought about either by relatively small changes to the proportions of the soil particles or by changes to their nature. It was also found that in some soils with non-convergent compression behaviour there was particle breakage while in others there was not. Since the factors that influence the mode of compression behaviour were found to be complex, it is concluded that each new soil encountered must be assessed individually for whether it is transitional, and that the accuracy of void ratio measurements is of particular importance in establishing this reliably...|$|E
40|$|Oedometer {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to investigate whether particle breakage {{plays a significant role}} in the compression of <b>transitional</b> <b>soils.</b> Artificial mixtures of a carbonate sand and kaolin or a crushed quartz silt were both found to give measurable breakage within the sand fraction even at modest stresses, which is in contrast to the findings from tests by Nocilla et al. (2006) on clayey silts. It was found, therefore, that particle breakage may occur in <b>transitional</b> <b>soils,</b> although it is not a necessary aspect of their behaviour, as would be the case for clean sands. The amount of breakage was fairly similar for the two soils, so that it could also be concluded that the breakage was insensitive to the mineralogy or grading of the matrix material...|$|R

A load test programme designed to investigate various aspects of the design and behaviour of driven steel piles is discussed in the present paper. Although the literature contains information on load testing of instrumented piles driven in either sand or clay, limited information is available regarding their axial load response in <b>transitional</b> <b>soils</b> (soils composed of various amounts of clay, silt and sand). Results are presented for fully instrumented axial load tests performed on an H pile and a closed-ended pipe pile driven into a multilayered soil profile consisting of <b>transitional</b> <b>soils.</b> In addition, the load testing planning, the instrumentation of the piles, the testing methods and the interpretation of the pile testing data are discussed in detail in the context of this and other load testing programmes described in the literature, in order to illustrate the various steps...|$|R

40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{interactions between}} water, sediment and soil deeply influence {{the formation and}} development of the ecosystem. In this research, different freshwater, brackish and saline subaqueous environments of Northern Italy were chosen as study area to investigate the physicochemical processes which occur at the interface between water and sediments, as well as the effects of soil submergence on ecosystem development. In the freshwater system of the Reno river basin, the main purpose was to define the heavy metals hazard in water and sediments of natural and artificial water courses. Heavy metals partitioning and speciation allowed to assess the environmental risk linked to the critical action of dredging canal sediments, for the maintenance of the hydraulic safety of plain lands. In addition, some bioremediation techniques were experimented for protecting sediments from heavy metals contamination, and for giving an answer to the problem of sediments management. In the brackish system of S. Vitale park, the development of hydromorphic and subaqueous soils was investigated. The study of soil profiles highlighted the presence of a soil continuum among pedons subjected to different saturation degrees. This investigation allowed to the identification of both morphological and physicochemical indicators, which characterize the formation of subaqueous soils and describe the soil hydromorphism in <b>transitional</b> <b>soil</b> systems. In the saline system of Grado lagoon, an ecosystem approach was used to define the role of water oscillation in soil characterization and plants colonization. This study highlighted the close relationship and the mutual influence of soil submergence and aeration, tide oscillation and vegetation cover, on the soil development. In view of climate change, this study contribute to understand and suppose how soil and landscape could evolve. However, a complete evaluation of hydromorphic soil functionality will be achieved only involving physiological and biochemical expertise in these kind of studies. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem is}} defined and elucidated in Chapter I and {{examines}} the reclamation {{and use of}} the river basins in the Dutch river-clay area in the Middle Ages. The research was carried out in the district of Heusden and Altena (Fig. 1. 1). This district {{has been part of the}} Dutch province of Noord-Brabant since 1815; but before then it had belonged for centuries to the county of Holland. In the early Middle Ages, it was the most western part of the county of Teisterbant, which became fragmented in the eleventh century. The questions posed are about agricultural history; they are investigated by means of historical geography. Chapter 2 deals with an attempt to reconstruct the natural landscape, together with a survey of the occupation and social relationships in the reclamation period. The latter is roughly placed in the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Chapter 3 handles the reclamation of the basins, especially those in the district of Heusden en Altena (Fig. 1. 2). Historical, pedological, agricultural and geographic aspects of the reclamation are examined. This part of the study is mainly based on the literature, soil maps and topographical maps. Special attention is given to crops, of which oats was the most important, and to the significance of organic matter as an indicator of soil fertility. Chapter 4 is dedicated to developments in the period after the reclamation. First of all one looked at the physical developments which resulted from the reclamation, and which in their turn played a part in the use of the basin clay soils. In particural, lowering of ground level and changes in soil fertility are examined. Attention is given to area-specific developments. In Chapter 5 an account is given of published and non-published sources, of cadastral maps and of maps from the pre-cadastral period. This research had to be restricted to part of the studied area. Initially the villages of Eethen, Babyloniënbroek, Andel and Uitwijk were chosen for the purpose, and subsequently the territories of the villages of Wijk and Veen were added (Fig. 2 - 7). This Chapter ends with a recapitulation of the subject. In the final Chapter answers are formulated to the questions posed, and the results are discussed in a wider context. These results can be summarised as follows:For centuries, the formation of the area was determined by the different branches of the river Meuse. In the Roman period, the "Oude Maas" was the main course of this river (the "Oude" Maas" was taken as the southern boundary of the area to be studied). After Roman times, the river Alm must have been the main channel for the waters of the Meuse. Towards the end of the early Middle Ages a channel was formed from the Alm near Giessen to the river Waal (the most southern branch of the Rhine system) near Woudrichem (Fig. 1. 1). Under the name of Merwede, the rivers Waal and Maas flowed together to the North Sea. There is some disagreement amongst historians about the date of the formation of this new channel. Some of them believe that it occured during the twelfth or the thirteenth century, but this investigation lends support to an earlier date, namely the ninth or the tenth century. Occupation of the levees along the rivers started in the early Middle Ages, and in some places even much earlier. The levees of the "Oude Maas", the river Dussen and the river Alm (all of them are old branches of the Meuse) were inhabited in Roman times. Also in Merovingian times there was some habitation, especially on the broad levees of the Dussen ridge. The levee soils along the river Alm show evidence of occupation before the tenth century. The church was probably present in the tenth century. The bishops of Utrecht had a church at Woudrichem, which served as a Mother church. The Abbey of Saint Truiden (now in Belgium) had a curia in Aalburg. From information about the populations and the founding of churches, there seems to have been some cooperation between the church and the nobility; thus the county of Teisterbant was typically Frankish. Property belonging to the ancestors of the Counts of Holland was more than likely located in the villages of Wijk and Veen, near Aalburg. Here, in 889, Count Gerulf obtained two "hobas" from the German King Arnulf. In the period before reclamation, the basins were usually inundated in winter. In summer, natural drainage would have occurred. Permanent open water was possibly restricted to the main basin south of the river Alm. Nowadays the soils in this basin are o. 8 in below Ordnance Datum. The vegetation in the basins probably consisted of swamp forest (mainly Alder), marshes with reeds and sedges and bogs with rushes and reed mace. Owing to the activity of the Meuse, with formation and erosion of ridges, there must have been deposition of day in the basins in the early Middle Ages. So the top layers of the soil profile must be more recent. Because of draining in summer, the conditions were not suitable for peat formation, with the probable exception of some pools. This conclusion differs from recent publications, in which a recent vanishing of a peat cover is assumed. Both reclamation and land use in the basins were dependant on the soil type; roughly one can distinguish between basin clay soils without peat in the upper 80 cm of the profile, and clayon- peat soils. Today, as a rule, the first group of soils have a height at or above Ordnance Datum. They were the first to be reclaimed, and this was done by means of long, parallel ditches. In a number of places, the parcels were called "hoeven". They often had an area Of 12 to 14 hectares and several of them were inhabited. In some places the parcels did not have such an area. They still had a constant breadth, but varied in length; their area depended on this length. In the thirteenth century these soils were mainly used as arable land. It is feasible that some of these reclamations were realised as part of estates. Artefacts, indicating the presence of "villae" were found in Eethen, Aalburg, Wijk, Veen and in Uitwijk. in most of these places there is a field-name "Verwede" to be found, which I have interpreted as "bulls pasture". Altogether I found eight fields with the name of Verwede; I assumed they were part of a demesne. At least in Eethen, Aalburg and Wijk there are signs of a classical estate, a number of "mansi" seem to have existed there. The reclamations in question are not later than the twelfth century, possibly from the eleventh century or earlier. The reclamation of Babyloniënbroek (from the beginning of the twelfth century) has quite a different character, both technically and juridically. This territory was out-of-the-way; probably for this reason it was reclaimed later. From a street as axis, small areas of levee soil, basin clay soil and <b>transitional</b> <b>soil</b> were parcelled out together. From the later distribution of property and from the absence of a manor and manorial services, I concluded that the reclamation was done by independant farmers, who had possibly bought the parcels. Thirteenth century sources provide the surprising information that on the stream ridges and in the reclaimed basins oats was the main crop. Yield must have been fairly good. Farmers were heavily involved in horse-breeding, which continued until the twentieth century. The combination of the use of a heavy plough which turns the sod, of horses as draught animals and the extensive cultivation of oats, can be considerated as innovative. With respect to earlier farming methods, we may speak of an agricultural revolution. Farming which specialises in oats and horse-breeding demands the exchange of goods. Thirteenth century sources tell us of regional markets at Woudrichem and Giessen and in later times at Heusden. In the same period, the corn trade became firmly established in the nearby town of Dordrecht. By the twelfth century, several ecclesiastical "curiae" had been founded in this region, including an important Abbey (the Premonstratensian Abbey of Berne, near Heusden). The area was of considerable interest, presumably for economic reasons. The clay-on-peat soils were less appropriate for the same methods of reclamation and use. At the time of draining (by digging canals) subsidence would have started. These soil areas are also parcelled in strips; the strips were called "slagen" or "weren". No exact dating of this parcellation. is available, but there is evidence that it took place in the thirteenth and the early fourteenth century. These soils were presumably rarely used as arable land, but mostly for rough grazing and hay-making. Large landowners had often laid out a decoy on their lots. During the agricultural depression, from 1650 to 1750, the value of these clay-on-peat soils dropped temporarily to zero, in some years they could neither be sold nor leased. Initially, the reclaimed soils were rich in organic matter and plant nutrients, After one or two centuries of arable culture the soils became exhausted. At first, frequent floodings with river water effectivily supplied nutrients, but when the dikes along the rivers were made stronger, and higher, flooding occurred less frequently. A substainable exploitation of these lower heavy soils was developed by combining them in one farm with the easier to work levee soils. The soil in the basins served as an outfield, with a modest production of hay or oats, alternated with grazing. The infield was situated on the levee soils. From the fourteenth century onwards, vigourous diversification took place on the stream ridges (the infields). Wheat and rapeseed became important crops, orchards and hop gardens were laid out. The main problem of this agricultural system was the shortage of manure. Gradual diversification of the livestock, more cattle alongside the horses helped to solve this problem, and in the twentieth century fertilisers came into use. The basin soils have recently regained an important place in animal husbandry. Reclamation of the basin soils signified economic progress; it contributed to the wealth of both the settlements and their Lords. As early as the second half of the thirteenth century, one can speak of independant farmers, who worked for themselves and took their produce to the markets. They participated in law-making and in the administration of justice. The emancipation of farmers also expresses itself in the gradual development of self-government. In the villages, in the second half of the thirteenth century, we see farmers as jurymen or "heemraden". They act, together with the sheriff (the "schout") in regulating local affairs and particularly as a local polder board. However, the relationship between agricultural development and social change in the Middle Ages was not the subject of this study. 1 must confine myself to the remark that reclamation of the basins and emancipation of the farmers occurred in the same periode. By about 1300, in the district of Heusden and Altena, society as well as the landscape and the economy, was completely different than in the year 1000...|$|E
40|$|Seven <b>transitional</b> <b>soils</b> were {{selected}} to investigate the transition of Spodosols and Ultisols in the subalpine forests of Taiwan whose elevations range from 1900 m to 2700 m and have udic soil moisture regimes and mesic soil temperature regimes. The selected <b>transitional</b> forest <b>soils</b> include seven Ultic Spodosols based on USDA Soil Taxonomy, or seven Podzols based on the World Reference Base classification system. The soils with gentle landscape with < 10 % of slope are derived from sandstone and shale. The study area experiences a cool and humid climate with very high annual rainfall, ranging from 3000 to 4500 mm. The vegetation is coniferous vegetation dominated by Taiwan red cypress, Taiwan red pine, and peacock pine. The transition soils of Spodosols and Ultisols in Taiwan are specially characterized by loamy or clayey soil texture classes in the B horizon with clay contents ranging from 250 to 400 g/kg. High rainfall promotes the formation of these transition soils associated with strong illuviation of clay, organic carbon, free iron oxides, or organo-metallic complexes. We propose that vegetation, climate, and parent materials strongly influence the multiple pedogenic processes of the transition soils between Ultisol and Spodosols in Taiwan. Clay illuviation processes and podzolization are the two dominant pedogenic processes in these transition soils identified by field morphology, micromorphology and laboratory analysis.

40|$|AbstractTwo model soils, {{one made}} from sand with plastic fines and one made from sand with non-plastic fines, {{were tested in}} a {{triaxial}} apparatus to examine the basic mechanics of <b>transitional</b> <b>soils,</b> that is, soils whose initial density {{has a very strong}} influence on the behaviour. The sand with non-plastic fines defined parallel critical state lines and state boundary surfaces at the medium strain levels that can be reached in triaxial testing, the locations of which depended on the initial specific volume of the soil when it was created. Overconsolidating the soil, or shearing it a second time at an increased stress level, was not found to change this behaviour. There was also no significant effect of the initial specific volume on the soil stiffness, which was predominantly a function of the current stress level for normally consolidated states. A variety of different sample preparation methods was used, but the methods did not have any clear influence on the critical state volumes. Although the testing for the sand with non-plastic fines was more limited in extent, the patterns of behaviour seemed to be similar. The relationships between the initial specific volume and the critical state line intercept, Γ, gave gradients of 0. 52 and 0. 97 for the sands with plastic and non-plastic fines, respectively, showing significant differences in volume remaining after isotropic compression and monotonic compressive shearing...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} fragile areas in the China Loess Plateau, is the {{transitional}} belt that is subjected to wind and water erosion. The transitional belt accounts for about 30 % of the Loess Plateau area. To reduce soil degradation in the Loess Plateau, the Chinese government initiated a state-funded vegetation restoration project in 1999. The effectiveness of this project on <b>transitional</b> belt <b>soils</b> is unknown. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the effects of four dominant vegetation types on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) in a selected catchment within the transitional belt. Korshinsk Peashrub (KOP), purple alfalfa (ALF). and natural fallow (NAF) were selected as vegetation restoration types because they have been used widely to remedy soil degradation. The fourth vegetation type selected was millet (MIL) because it has been an important crop in the region. In 2004, four 61 x 5 m plots were established on 12 degrees slope land. The plots were parallel and separated by 80 cm. Based upon soil samples collected in August of 2007, there were large variations in the distributions and stocks of SOC and N across the four vegetation types. Compared with MIL, KOP significantly increased the concentration and stock of SOC and total nitrogen (TN) in 0 - 100 cm soil profiles, while ALF and NAF were not significantly different. The distributions of SOC and TIN concentrations and stocks of KOP, ALF and NAF were relatively uniform along a hillslope, while there was an increasing trend along the hillslope in MIL This result suggests that ALF and NAF would be beneficial in SOC and TN sequestration over a long-term because of their ability to reduce the loss of SOC and TN by soil erosion. We also found that both vegetation types and hillslope position had no significant effects on C:N ratio. Our Study demonstrated that improvements of SOC and TN stocks in the transitional belt could be made through well managed vegetation restoration measures. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

Due {{to the lack of}} studies on this ecosystem, the objective of the present work was to study the distribution of “Campinaranas” and their relationship with the predominant soils and geology in the western portion of the Brazilian Amazon. We used geographic data of vegetation, geology and soils, and analytical data of the soil profiles collected by the RADAMBRASIL project, updated and systematized by IBGE, and data from reference profiles collected in the National Park of Viruá,Roraima. In general, the soils of “Campinaranas” are predominantly sandy, developed on parent materials rich in quartz. The overlaying of geological data with areas dominated by “Campinaranas”, reveals the prevalence of recent sedimentary formations (Quaternary), constituted mainly of sandy materials. Based on the studied dataset, we suggest a minimum limit of 55 dag kg- 1 of sand in the soils for the occurrence of “Campinaranas”. Soils with higher clay content are present only in Forest-Campinaranas transitions, adjacent to the sandy deposits. It is verified the absolute prevalence of Spodosols and Psamments in “Campinaranas”. Even in different geological formations and under distinct pedogenetic processes, these soils possess similar morphological, chemical and physical properties. In spite of the pedological diversity found in the <b>transitional</b> areas, the <b>soils</b> keep similarities with the soils of “Campinaranas”...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the characteristic shrinkage curve of a soil as it dries. It also introduces a new method to measure specific soil moisture {{states such as}} permanent wilting point and field capacity using the shrinkage curve. The model considers the soil fabric as a non-rigid, aggregated and unsaturated soil water medium. Its functional parameters (defined as pedohydral parameters) are the independent parameters of the shrinkage curve, which defines two major aspects {{of the structure of}} the fabric: (i) the volumetric functional elements of the soil fabric, and (ii) the arrangement of solid, water and air as functions of water content. Two African tropical soils were characterized and analysed according to a structural model with parameters of their shrinkage curve. The parameters of four soil horizons for the two soil types were determined continuously along their shrinkage curves. They were then used as descriptive variables representing the soil’s hydrostructural behaviour in a canonical variate analysis, the results of which showed the A horizons to be distinct from the lower horizons, which appear as continua down the profiles. Analysis of the results reveals the importance of the clay and of the iron/clay ratio in the hydrostructural properties of the two <b>soils.</b> <b>Transitional</b> points of the shrinkage curve matched well some particular moisture states of the water potential curve, such as wilting points and field capacities.

40|$|Considerable {{savings in}} the cost and time {{expended}} in design and construction work will result from more realistic appraisal of material <b>transitional</b> between engineering <b>soil</b> and engineering rock. Research was therefore directed to seeking means of maximising the return of relevant information from routine site investigation work. Definitions of 'transitional material' are proposed, based on geological, contractual and technical criteria. Related definitions are proposed for 'engineering soil' and 'engineering rock'. Flow charts {{have been developed to}} assist in the categorisation of geotechnical material into the types proposed by a Working Party of the Geological Society (1977) and BS 5930 : 1081. Simple laboratory and fieldwork index testing was found to provide an adequate basis for the realistic assessment of the potential engineering behaviour of a range of geotechnical materials. Some modification to routine procedures is proposed for work with transitional material. Pressuremeter testing was generally found to give reproduceable results in fresh oolitic limestone (Beerstone) and in highly weathered Shale, Keuper Marl and Granite. The results of high pressure triaxial and pressuremeter testing of Beerstone are compared and assessed. Further comparison is drawn between the results of pressuremeter testing of Keuper Marl and those obtained during a commercial site investigation from (i) plate bearing tests, and (ii) laboratory testing, of material from the same site. The means of obtaining and communicating geotechnical information are critically appraised.

Here, the permanent species-rich grasslands beneath trees were regularly managed in the traditional manner until some were replaced in the 1970 ’s and 80 ’s by intensively managed orchards, {{some of which were}} abandoned in the early 1990 ’s. Our 2011 – 2015 phytosociological research followed the standard Braun-Blanquet approach. We classified 178 phytosociological relevés recorded in orchard meadows (156 relevés), former intensively managed orchards (16 relevés), and two relevés from a semi-intensively grazed orchard. Traditionally managed orchard meadows were classified in the following five units: (i) Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris – thermophilous variant, (ii) Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris – transitional variant to Alchemillo-Arrhenatheretum elatioris, (iii) Ranunculo bulbosi-Arrhenatheretum elatioris, (iv) Onobrychido viciifoliae-Brometum erecti, and (v) Brachypodio pinnati-Molinietum arundinaceae. Formerly intensively managed large-scale orchards were classified as Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris association and the semi-intensively grazed orchard as Lolio perennis-Cynosuretum cristati association. The species composition varies considerably due to tree-shading and different management treatments applied in the orchards, so the relevés of the delimited syntaxonomic units are not typical and have <b>transitional</b> character. Moisture, <b>soil</b> nutrients, and soil reaction were identified as the main environmental gradients influencing species composition. We tested four management treatments in direct gradient analysis and found that abandonment has the strongest effect on species composition. Comparison of grassland vegetation in the studied traditional orchards with that described in Germany reveals differences in species composition. Moreover, species richness of the compared Arrhenatherion elatioris and Bromion erecti alliances in Slovakian orchard meadows was higher than in the German orchards...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRiparian {{zones are}} complex disturbance-mediated {{systems that are}} highly {{susceptible}} to invasion by alien plants. They are prioritized in most alien-plant management initiatives in South Africa. The current practice {{for the restoration of}} cleared riparian areas relies largely on the unaided recovery of native species from residual individuals and regeneration from soil-stored seed banks. Little is known about the factors that determine the effectiveness of this approach. We need to know how seed banks of native species in riparian ecosystems are affected by invasion, and the potential for cleared riparian areas to recover unaided after clearing operations. Study sites were selected on four river systems in the Western Cape: the Berg, Eerste, Molenaars and Wit Rivers. Plots were selected in both invaded (> 75 % Invasive Alien Plant (IAP) canopy cover) and un-invaded (also termed reference, with < 25 % IAP canopy cover) sections of the rivers. Replicate plots were established at two elevations (mountain stream and foothill) and in three moisture regimes (dry, wet and <b>transitional</b> bank zones). <b>Soil</b> samples were taken, surveys were done of the aboveground vegetation, and comparisons were made between invaded and non-invaded sites. Seed bank communities were clearly defined by the state of the river (reference or invaded) and moisture regimes (wet and dry bank zones). Comparisons at a landscape scale showed no clear pattern, as the composition of both aboveground and seed bank species assemblages were strongly influenced by site history, especially the extent of invasion and fire frequency. Even after heavy and extensive invasion, riparian seed banks have the potential to initiate the restoration process. However, not all riparian species are represented in the seed bank. Based on these results, restoration recommendations are outlined for alien-invaded riparian zones...|$|R

In order to get more insight into the wave damping skills of salt marsh vegetation, it was decided to make SWAN suitable for modelling situations with vegetated foreshores. The numerical description of the effect of vegetation on waves that was used, is based on representing the vegetation by vertical, ridged cylinders and was derived by Dalrymple et al. (1984). The physical vegetation properties that are considered in this formulation are the relative vegetation height, vegetation diameter and density, and the drag coefficient. The calibration parameter in the Dalrymple et al. (1984) formulation, which is of significant importance for determining the wave dissipation due to vegetation, is the drag coefficient (Cd). By varying the drag coefficient different types of vegetation (both stiff and flexible) can be modelled. The value of the drag coefficient is dependent on the Reynolds number and on the shape and orientation of the object. A more severe study of the drag coefficient, first for a single cylinder in flow, subsequently for a multi cylinder array, gave insight in the relation with both wave and vegetation characteristics. A number of processes that are not accounted for in the Dalrymple formulation are also discounted in the drag coefficient. The model was made suitable to model homogeneous, horizontally varying (zoned vegetation) and vertically varying (f. i. Mangroves) vegetation fields. As a final validation the model was applied on field measurement results from the Paulina Marsh in the Westerschelde. In this case all parameters were known except for the drag coefficient, which was calibrated. The results were satisfactory, the value for the drag coefficient ranged between 0. 5 and 3. 0 and the relation with the vegetation height was as expected. The implementation of vegetation in SWAN was found successful for all types of vegetation. However, due to the dependency of the drag coefficient on wave and vegetation characteristics, the model can only be applied on specific situations where wave and vegetation measurements have been taken. In order to make the model generally applicable, more research needs to be done on the dependency of the drag coefficient on wave and vegetation characteristics. When more is known about these relations, a first prediction can be made on the value of the drag coefficient in a specific situation. This can be accomplished by doing more physical modelling tests and by taking wave measurements over vegetated foreshores. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScConsEcol(Conservation Ecology and Entomology) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Riparian {{areas are}} highly complex systems with {{varying levels of}} {{disturbance}} that are highly susceptible to invasion by alien plants. Once invaded, riparian areas {{play a major role}} in the dispersal and spread of invasive alien plants (IAPs) through the river system and, in some cases, to neighbouring landscapes. Riparian areas have therefore been prioritized by many alien clearing initiatives in South Africa. Current practice for the restoration of cleared areas is minimal and relies mainly on the un-aided recovery of native species from residual individuals and soil stored seed banks. Little research, however, has been done on the effectiveness of this approach or the extent to which riparian seed banks contribute towards community restoration. This study is part of a national research initiative (Targets for Ecosystem Repair in Riparian Ecosystems in Fynbos, Grassland and Savanna Biomes) funded by Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, in collaboration with Working for Water, The Centre for Invasion Biology and the Universities of Cape Town, Stellenbosch, Rhodes and Witwatersrand. The initiative undertook to investigate different restoration techniques on various invaded sites for their cost-effectiveness, efficiency, practicality and conservation integrity. This study has three aims. The first is to determine the composition of seed banks in un-invaded riparian areas within the fynbos biome to be used as a benchmark for future research, restoration grading and other management requirements. The second aim is to determine the composition of seed banks in heavily invaded riparian areas, and thus to assess the impact of invasion on the integrity of the seed banks. The third aim is to evaluate the restoration potential of riparian seed banks following the clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs). Study sites were selected within four river systems in the south-western part of the Western Cape Province in South Africa: the Berg, Eerste, Molenaars and Wit Rivers. Plots were selected in both invaded (> 75 % IAP canopy cover; considered “closed” alien stands) and un-invaded (also termed reference, with < 25 % IAP canopy cover) sections of the river. Replicate plots were established along varying gradients of elevation (mountain stream and foothill) and moisture regimes (dry, wet and <b>transitional</b> bank zones). <b>Soil</b> samples were collected together with above-ground vegetation surveys and comparisons were made. Results from this study confirm those of previous studies that seed banks offer little reference to current aboveground vegetation, but rather offer insight into past vegetation history as well as future vegetation assemblages. Worldwide, many of the species that characteristically form seed banks are early successional species. A community study was done for the seed bank based on the species that germinated and were identifiable at termination of the project (6 months after initiation). Three clusters of species could be identified. One group comprised 32 generalist species that occurred in both reference and invaded sections of the rivers. A second group comprised 39 species associated with invaded sites, and a third group of 40 species that was associated with reference sites. A few sub-community groups were found within both the “reference” and “invaded” community groups which were assumed to be habitat specific. Most species were “pioneer” or relatively-short lived, early-successional species which play a vital role in the initial post-disturbance vegetation cover, and facilitate establishment of later successional species. Seed banks are notoriously variable over space and time, and floristic representation is often biased as a result of differences among species in seed production, dispersal and longevity in the soil. The general consensus is that seeds have an irregular, clustered spatial distribution that is dictated by both biological and environmental factors. Within river systems, the irregular clustering can be exceptionally skewed with the influence of pockets of high sediment deposition along the bank. Environmental factors that were found to significantly skew germination results were the presence of fire, as well as the extent and intensity of invasion (duration and cover). The high level of diversity and abundance in reference Berg River mountain stream seed banks was perceived to be a direct result of a moderate fire frequency (between 8 - 15 years) and the relatively natural state of the vegetation (i. e. very little invasion). Also, diversity and richness of indigenous species from the Wit and Molenaars Rivers were substantially higher in the invaded samples than the reference samples, probably because both river systems have a long history of invasion and other anthropogenic disturbances which would have an effect on the samples from “reference” sections (i. e. even a 25 % presence of IAPs seems adequate enough to alter the composition of the seed bank). Correspondence analyses showed that species had clear affinities towards different levels of “key” riparian environmental variables (fire, invasion and anthropogenic disturbance). Most species were associated with moderate levels of fire frequency, invasion history, and anthropogenic disturbance. Comparisons of seed bank species assemblages between the lateral and longitudinal variables of the rivers offered insights into the habitat requirements of certain fynbos and riparian species. Most significant were the results from bank zone comparisons which showed distinct species groupings along the different moisture bands. As could be expected, riparian species were best represented within the wet bank zones and fynbos species within the dry bank zone, while species characteristic of both zones occurred in the transitional zone, making this seed bank zone the richest in species. Mountain stream sections were richer and more diverse than foothill sections over both invaded and reference samples. This is hypothesised to be linked to lower levels of anthropogenic disturbance experienced in the mountain stream sections. The impact of invasion on the riparian seed bank was most clearly shown through the correspondence analyses for the 20 most frequently occurring species. The seed bank assembly patterns were clearly defined by the state of the river (reference or invaded). Interestingly, this pattern was evident at all three spatial scales; landscape (rivers), reach (mountain stream and foothill sections) and habitat (dry, wet and transitional zones). The reference seed bank assemblage was more tightly grouped, implying that the species were more closely associated with each other and less variable than those of the invaded seed bank assemblages. The species groupings within the invaded seed banks were influenced by variables such as reach and zone, whereas the reference seed bank assemblages seem relatively unaffected by these variables. This implies that the presence of invasive alien plants creates additional variation within the seed bank which alters the natural groupings. At a broad scale, the invaded seed banks were less species rich. This means that not only will the resulting seedling community be harder to predict, but it will also have fewer species. However although generally lower in species richness, the seed banks from almost all invaded rivers interestingly showed a higher diversity of indigenous species than their reference counterparts. This is very promising in terms of rehabilitation of post-cleared riparian sites, but more information is needed to understand the seed bank composition and determine how sustainable the seed banks are for rehabilitation in the long-term. All invaded sections had fewer herbaceous perennial species but more herbaceous annual species. Graminoids made up 50 % or more of the seed bank regardless of state (reference or invaded), while woody species (shrubs/shrublets) were generally more prevalent in the reference samples. These results imply that following the removal of invasive alien plants, the vegetation to regenerate from the seed bank is likely to comprise of short-lived, herbaceous species that are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the indigenous riparian community. It is however important to note that this study investigated only the species that were able to germinate over the study period (6 month germination period). Many riparian species may not have been represented because they are either late germinators or may not be present in the soil seed bank at all. In order to gain a holistic understanding of riparian community recruitment, it is recommended that seed bank studies such as this one be included in a more broad scale, long term investigation which takes into account various reproductive strategies used by riparian species. Research of this nature is in its infancy worldwide and there are many challenges involved in measuring diversity and change in these systems. However, within the scope of this study, I suggest that these results shed light on previously unanswered and important questions regarding the ecology of seed banks in the riparian ecosystems of the Western Cape...|$|R
