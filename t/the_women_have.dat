5|$|Arsenal Women are {{the most}} {{successful}} team in English women's football. In the 2008–09 season, they won all three major English trophies– the FA Women's Premier League, FA Women's Cup and FA Women's Premier League Cup, and, as of 2017, were the only English side to have won the UEFA Women's Cup or UEFA Women's Champions League, having won the Cup in the 2006–07 season {{as part of a}} unique quadruple. The men's and women's clubs are formally separate entities but have quite close ties; Arsenal Women are entitled to play once a season at the Emirates Stadium, though they usually play their home matches at Boreham Wood. At present <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> won 46 trophies in their 30-year history.|$|E
5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> dinner together while wearing latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse while wearing oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E

25|$|Many women {{write to}} tell me that {{although}} their husbands may not like me, they do.

25|$|A second graph-theoretic {{description}} {{of the problem is}} also possible. Once <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> been seated, the possible seating arrangements for the remaining men can be described as perfect matchings in a graph formed by removing a single Hamiltonian cycle from a complete bipartite graph; the graph has edges connecting open seats to men, and the removal of the cycle corresponds to forbidding the men to sit in either of the open seats adjacent to their wives. The problem of counting matchings in a bipartite graph, and therefore a fortiori the problem of computing ménage numbers, can be solved using the permanents of certain 0-1 matrices. In the case of the ménage problem, the matrices arising from this view of the problem are circulant matrices.|$|E

25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and {{want to know about the}} risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E
500|$|The women's {{program has}} had eight head coaches.

In those seasons, three coaches have led the Sooners to at least one postseason tournament: Maura McHugh, Burl Plunkett, and Sherri Coale. Coale, the current coach, is the only coach who has won conference championships with the Sooners. Hired in April 1996, Coale is the all-time leader in games coached, wins and winning percentage. Statistically, Amy Dahl has been the worst coach of the Lady Sooners, with a winning percentage of [...]125.|$|E

Mary arrives at Rosy's apartment and attempts to calm Rosy's nerves. [...] Mary provides Rosy with a large knife for protection before she goes to sleep.|$|E

500|$|From the {{experience}} of growing up within two cultures Cisneros was able to combine both ethnicities, and in her stories she develops a major theme of hybridity between the American and Mexican cultures. [...] She draws upon her life experience as she [...] "depicts {{the situation of the}} Mexican-American woman: typically caught between two cultures, she resides in a cultural borderland. The topics of the stories range from the confusions of a bicultural and bilingual childhood to the struggles of a dark-skinned woman to recognize her own beauty in the land of Barbie dolls and blond beauty queens." [...] Because these issues are complex, Cisneros does not try to resolve all of them. Instead, she attempts to find neutral ground where the characters can try to meld their Mexican heritage with an American lifestyle, without feeling homesick for a country which, in some cases, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> not even experienced.|$|E
500|$|Decorating of the Bride [...] ( [...] ; [...] ) {{measures}} [...] The {{painting is}} set in an impoverished 19th-century ethnic Albanian household. It shows {{the women of the}} family adorning a young bride. The jewelry that the bride is supposed to wear at her wedding is taken from an old wooden chest that {{can be seen in the}} left-hand corner and is temporarily set against a copper tray beside her. Immediately next to the chest, a little girl holds another copper tray, which also contains several items of jewelry. Two elderly women attend to the bride. To the far right, young maidens fashion a garland of fresh flowers and joyfully whisper to one another. The room in which <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> gathered is sparsely furnished, with a low ceiling, well worn carpet and plain plastered walls. The bride wears traditional garb, with a gold necklace around her neck and delicately embroidered slippers on her feet. The artist's signature, Germanicized as P. Joanowitch, can be seen at the bottom right.|$|E

Later, in a bar, {{a man by the}} name of Bert Zupanic (Randall [...] "Tex" [...] Cobb) comes across Betty. Moments later, Lulu walks into the bar and an earthquake occurs that breaks all the glass in the bar. Lulu then runs out. Mulder finds out through a man named Argyle Saperstein (Art Evans) that Zupanic and one of the women are in a relationship and that Zupanic is a professional wrestler. Scully finds that for the past 12 years <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> followed each other across 17 states and left mayhem in their wake. Saperstein calls Zupanic and it is revealed that Zupanic owes Saperstein money. In addition, Betty and Bert have been in a relationship, but he has been having an affair with Lulu. A second earthquake occurs as Lulu prepares to walk in on Zupanic and Saperstein exchanging money. After Betty emerges from the bathroom, the two see each other and the glass in the building begins breaking. Zupanic is knocked unconscious and Saperstein takes the money and leaves.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Outlaw Star has been favorable. Eric Luce, Ivevei Upatkoon, and Michael Poirier of EX.org all gave similarly positive reviews for the Japanese manga, Japanese anime, and English anime versions of Outlaw Star respectively. Luce was complimentary of the manga's [...] "raw" [...] yet [...] "good and distinctive" [...] artwork, detailed backgrounds, and good placement of characters among one another. However, he was annoyed that all <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> [...] "disturbing tendency to {{all have the}} same silicone stiffened chests" [...] and that characters typically wear mad grins. Upatkoon found the artwork of the anime version to be good, and he particularly enjoyed the opening sequence, but took issue with the occasionally inconsistent character designs. He also appreciated the show's dichotomy between serious and humorous subject matter, shown by the titular ship in its grappler mode and how it communicates with the crew. Poirier found the main protagonist Gene to be the anime's best characterization: [...] "Gene Starwind is a sly, sharp-shooting hero whose success with his gun (and with the ladies) is matched only by his propensity to get space-sick. Imagine that: the star of a space-faring series has to continually worry about vomiting onto his control panel. This sort of ironic comedy can be found throughout Outlaw Star, creating excellent segues between the fantastic action sequences and the delightful characters." [...] Poirier was intrigued by its other characters as well, and was impressed by the [...] "sharp but fluid" [...] animation style and the spaceship designs. Mania.com's David Owens appreciated the artistic style specifically for the characters, nearly all of which he incidentally found likeable. Jacob Churosh of THEM Anime Reviews additionally noted high animation quality throughout. Although he proclaimed the vehicle designs of Outlaw Star to be superb, Protoculture Addicts writer Martin Ouellette judged the animation and character designs to be [...] "less lucky" [...] and lacking in [...] "the special aura" [...] of Sunrise's acclaimed 1998 series Cowboy Bebop. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, authors of [...] agreeably denoted Outlaw Star as [...] "no competition for Cowboy Bebop in terms of style, content, or execution".|$|E

2500|$|Opposition {{from the}} Orthodox also stems from Halachic {{concerns}} {{and from a}} general disdain for non-traditional ritual in an area they claim serves as an Orthodox synagogue. Orthodoxy does not permit women to constitute a minyan (prayer quorum) and while <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> not considered themselves as doing so, this has not calmed ultra-Orthodox sensibilities. [...] Initially, the group did not receive support from Israel's primarily Orthodox religious authorities. Supporters highlighted {{the fact that only}} in Israel are Jewish women prohibited from praying according to their custom in a public location and a 2003 High Court ruling which prevented them from conducting prayer services at the wall was overturned in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} potters in Atzompa {{have turned to}} the making of clay figures. Luis Garcia Blando makes terra cotta figurines in a style his late mother developed. These figures are called [...] "embroidered dolls" [...] (muñecas bordadas) who are made with long skirts that reach the floor, {{eliminating}} the need to create breakable feet. They are elegantly adorned with earrings, necklaces and their dresses are decorated with elaborate floral designs. [...] Usually <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>have</b> two thick braids, like their creator did, and often carry a basket on the head. They are generally unpainted with almost all decorative details sculpted in clay. The style has been imitated and reinterpreted by other artisans.|$|E
