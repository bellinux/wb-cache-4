Therefore, research on new drugs and their targets for the treatment of this disease is urgently needed. In the present work, the efficacies <b>of</b> several seaweeds <b>extracts</b> against S. mansoni were tested. Worm couples were incubated with <b>different</b> concentration <b>of</b> seaweed <b>extracts</b> for 120 h and monitored after the first 2 h and then every 24 h to evaluate death, mobility reduction and couple detachment. <b>The</b> <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> 13 <b>different</b> seaweed species were tested in a first trial and <b>the</b> active <b>extracts</b> were further evaluated in lower concentrations. <b>The</b> <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> Gracilaria ornata and species belonging to the genera Dictyota and Laurencia showed activity at relatively low concentrations. <b>The</b> active <b>extracts</b> were analyzed by LC–MS, and possible candidates are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} been carried out on the medical flora of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula in search for new {{therapeutic}} agents, in particular against cancer. In this paper, we evaluated the cytotoxic potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> Bonellia albiflora, a plant utilized in the traditional Mayan medicine for treatment of chronic injuries of the mouth. We carried out <b>the</b> methanolic <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant by means of extraction with the Soxhlet equipment. We conducted liquid-liquid fractions on each <b>extract</b> with solvents <b>of</b> increasing polarity. All extracts and fractions were evaluated for cytotoxic activity versus four human cancer cell lines and one normal cell line through a tetrazolium dye reduction (MTT) assay in 96 -well cell culture plates. <b>The</b> methanolic root-bark <b>extract</b> possessed much greater cytotoxic activity in the human oropharyngeal cancer cell line (KB); its hexanic fraction concentrated the active metabolites and induced apoptosis with the activation of caspases 3 and 8. The results demonstrate the cytotoxic potential of the B. albiflora hexanic fraction and substantiate the importance of the study of the traditional Mayan medicinal plants...|$|R
30|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity was}} screened by agar well diffusion method. Saborouds dextrose agar {{was used as}} the culture media for fungi and Muller Hinton agar medium was used for bacteria. The inoculums were prepared in fresh nutrient broth from well-maintained slant culture. The inoculums were standardized following McFarland standards by regulating the turbidity of the broth culture by adding sterile broth. Petri dishes were spread with the inoculums and holes (8  mm) were punctured using sterile cork-borer. <b>The</b> plant <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> solvents were dissolved in DMSO and were added to the respective holes. DMSO being the negative control exhibited no zone of inhibition against any of the tested microorganisms. Experimental cultures were incubated for 24  h at 37  °C (for bacteria) and 72  h at 26  °C (for fungi). After incubation, the zones of inhibition (ZI) were measured and photographed with Canon ‘PowerShot SX 700 HS’ camera.|$|R
40|$|In goal {{of searching}} new active {{compounds}} with important biological activities, {{a screening of}} several plants from salt-marsh region of Chebba-Tunisia had been realized. Three species had been selected: Calendula arvensis, Chenopodium murale and Nicotiana glauca. <b>The</b> organic <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> aerial parts <b>of</b> these plants (stems, leaves and flowers) displayed variable contents of total polyphenols (TPP) and total flavonoids (TF). Flowers acetone extract from N. glauca contained the higher quantity in TPP (264. 8 ± 1. 6 µg GA/mg), while stems dichloromethane <b>extract</b> exhibited <b>the</b> best TF content (49. 8 ± 2. 2 µg QE/mg). The important TPP and TF contents reflected a good anti-oxidant and antimicrobial activities. The best acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity had been shown in the fractions obtained after extraction with low polarity solvents. Whence, a correlation of flavonoids contents with biological activities had been shown, while, there was no correlation with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity...|$|R
40|$|The root of Rotula aquatica is {{also called}} as pashanbed, {{belonging}} to the family Borogenaceae. It is widely distributed in India from kumaun to Assam and western to southern India. The medicinal values of plant lie in their component phytochemicals such as alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds and other nutrients like as amino acid, proteins, which produce a definite physiological action on the human body. The present study attempts pharmacognostic studies of root, extraction, identification of chemical constituents from <b>the</b> crude <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> Rotula aquatica. Macroscopic as well as microscopic studies of any crude drug are the primary steps to establish its botanical quality control before going to other studies. Hence phamacognostic studies of crude drug play {{a very important role}} in identifying the purity and quality of crude drugs. The present investigation reveals phamacognostic characters which include morphology, T. S, Powder microscopy, Phytochemical screening, and further isolation and identification of Phytoconstituents from ethanolic <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> Rotula aquatica...|$|R
40|$|Two {{neglected}} {{species of}} Araceae, Alocasia macrorhiza (Linn.) G. Don and Alocasia fornicata (Roxb.) Schott are important as food and ethno medicine in Asia and Africa. Their bioefficacy is {{documented in the}} Ayurveda. <b>The</b> solvent <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> edible parts <b>of</b> these two species like rhizomes, leaves, roots and stolons were screened for in vitro antioxidant properties using standard procedures. <b>The</b> successive <b>extracts</b> in hexane, benzene, toluene, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and water fraction exhibited IC 50 values in the following order, roots>rhizome>leaves for Alocasia macrorhiza and leaves>stolon for Alocasia fornicate, respectively in 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryl hydrazyl antioxidant inhibition assay. Maximum antioxidant activity was observed in diethyl ether extracts for both species. The IC 50 values were comparable with those of quercetine and ascorbic acid as standards. These {{results suggest that the}} two aroid species have antioxidant activity in their edible parts and should be extracted using diethyl ether solvent...|$|R
