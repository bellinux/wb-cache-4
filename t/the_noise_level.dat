40|$|Valuation {{of traffic}} noise {{abatement}} based on hedonic pricing {{models of the}} property market has traditionally measured <b>the</b> <b>noise</b> as <b>the</b> equivalent, or another average, level. What is not captured in such a <b>noise</b> indicator is <b>the</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> of a vehicle passage. In this study, we incorporate <b>the</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in <b>the</b> hedonic model letting the property price depend on both <b>the</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and <b>the</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Hedonic models for both rail and road noise are estimated. Data consists of characteristics of sold properties, property-specific noise calculation, and geographical variables. We use the hedonic approach to estimate the marginal willingness to pay (WTP) for maximum noise abatement where we model the effect as <b>the</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> subtracted with <b>the</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Furthermore, we control for <b>the</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in <b>the</b> estimations. The estimated results show that including <b>the</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in <b>the</b> model has influence on the property prices, but only for rail and not for road. This means that for road we cannot reject the hypothesis that WTP for noise abatement is based on <b>the</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> only. For rail, on the other hand, we estimate the marginal WTP for <b>the</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> {{and it turns out}} to be substantial. Also, the marginal WTP for <b>the</b> equivalent <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> seems to be unaffected by the inclusion of <b>the</b> maximum <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> in <b>the</b> model.

40|$|Context: In dental {{practical}} classes, {{the acoustic}} environment {{is characterized by}} high <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> {{in relation to other}} teaching areas, due to <b>the</b> exaggerated <b>noise</b> produced by some of these devices and use of dental equipment by many users at the same time. Aims: To measure, analyze and compare <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> of equipments among dental learning areas under different working conditions and also to measure and compare <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> between used and brand new handpieces under different working conditions. Materials and Methods: <b>Noise</b> <b>levels</b> were measured and analyzed in different dental learning areas that included clinical, pre-clinical areas and laboratories selected as representatives of a variety of learning-teaching activities. <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> were determined using a precision <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> meter (CENTER® 325 IEC 651 TYPE II) with a microphone.

Results: <b>The</b> <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> measured varied between 64 and 97 dB(A). The differences in sound levels when the equipment was merely turned on and during cutting operations and also between used and brand new equipments were recorded.
