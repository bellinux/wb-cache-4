500|$|The {{concert was}} {{telecast}} {{live by the}} National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{to an audience of}} 26 million viewers. As part of its program, NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations. While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score, Copland said, [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are two things you can do when listening to any new work. The {{most important thing is to}} lend yourself—or to put it another way—try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off. The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece, realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense." [...] He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail.|$|E
500|$|Wolf {{has been}} a {{consistent}} supporter of mandated paid sick days for employees, with his company Cape Air offering paid leave for all employees. Wolf, along with Kay Khan in the House of Representatives, introduced the [...] "2013 Earned Paid Sick Time" [...] bill, which would allow employees to one hour of paid sick leave for every thirty worked. To generate support among other Senators, Wolf {{went so far as}} to hold a protest with workers' rights activists at a Dunkin' Donuts frequented by legislators. While advocating for the bill in a committee hearing, Wolf admitted “it never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were that many businesses out there that didn't offer this as a benefit,” and referred to the experience as “an eye-opener.” Although the proposal eventually expired without being passed, for reasons Wolf described as a compromise with the legislature having already passed an incremental minimum wage increase, he campaigned for a ballot measure in 2014 which would mandate universal employee sick time.|$|E
2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a certain logic in female homosexuality. For if it is true, broadly speaking, we acquire our first sexual proclivities in infancy, girl {{children}} who are petted and fondled by their mothers, nurses and female relatives acquire what might be said to be a [...] "normal" [...] sexual affection for their own sex. But this is not true of male children, so it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a very fundamental difference between male and female homosexuality.|$|E

2500|$|Callahan {{enrolled}} in the University of Washington, but left after two months. Moving to San Francisco, he did illustrations for a children's magazine, and, while living in low-rent apartments with other artists, had his first exposure to contemporary abstract art. At that time he was painting in a realist style inspired by Thomas Hart Benton and the artists of the Ashcan School, but he was deeply impressed by the originality of Klee, Kandinsky, and Feininger. He later told journalist Deloris Tarzan Ament, [...] "It {{was the first time}} it occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> could be good art that I didn't like." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 17 February 2009, it was {{reported}} that Sutcliffe was [...] "fit to leave Broadmoor". On 23 March 2010, the Secretary of State for Justice, Jack Straw, was questioned by Julie Kirkbride, Conservative MP for Bromsgrove, in the House of Commons seeking reassurance for a constituent, a victim of Sutcliffe, that he would remain in prison. Straw responded that whilst the matter of Sutcliffe's release was a parole board matter, [...] "that all the evidence that I have seen on this case, and it's a great deal, suggests <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are no circumstances in which this man will be released".|$|E
2500|$|For 35 years, Barry Jones, who was {{a member}} of both the Victorian and Federal Parliaments refused to comment {{publicly}} on Ryan's hanging. Mr Jones broke his silence in 2002 at the launch of Mike Richards' book, The Hanged Man. Mr Jones says he remains [...] "unsure" [...] of whether Ryan ever pulled the trigger. [...] "It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was probably a reasonable doubt in the case," [...] he said. Mr Jones, also the former secretary of the Victorian Anti-Hanging Committee says he believes Ryan's hanging was an attempt by then Victorian Premier Henry Bolte, to push his law and order agenda.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> a way {{in which}} we could save {{something}} as well as our credit," [...] he said. [...] "I've had a hint that another big concern might be willing to take us over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is just as well to be {{interested}} in things as long as you live," [...] she had said. [...] "If you're not, it doesn't seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> much difference between the quick and the dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder who}} owns these places," [...] said Psmith. [...] "It seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> {{what you might}} call room for improvement. It wouldn't be a scaly idea to turn that Cosy Moments search-light we were talking about on to them." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1940 he got {{the lead}} role in Rodgers and Hart's Pal Joey, again choreographed by Robert Alton. This role {{propelled}} him to stardom. During its run he told reporters: [...] "I don't believe in conformity to any school of dancing. I create what the drama and the music demand. While I am a hundred percent for ballet technique, I use only what I can adapt to my own use. I never let technique {{get in the way}} of mood or continuity." [...] His colleagues at this time noticed his great commitment to rehearsal and hard work. Van Johnson—who also appeared in Pal Joey—recalled: [...] "I watched him rehearsing, and it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no possible room for improvement. Yet he wasn't satisfied. It was midnight and we had been rehearsing since eight in the morning. I was making my way sleepily down the long flight of stairs when I heard staccato steps coming from the stage...I could see just a single lamp burning. Under it, a figure was dancing...Gene." ...|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he sat in silence for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Figures, a black Assistant U.S. Attorney, {{testified that}} Sessions {{said he thought}} the Ku Klux Klan was [...] "OK until I found out they smoked pot". Sessions later said that the comment was not serious, but did {{apologize}} for it, saying that he considered the Klan to be [...] "a force for hatred and bigotry". Barry Kowalski, a prosecutor in the civil rights division, also heard the remark and testified that prosecutors working such a gruesome case sometimes [...] "resort to operating room humor and that is what I considered it to be". Another DOJ lawyer, Albert Glenn, said, [...] "It never occurred <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was any seriousness to it." [...] Figures testified that on one occasion, when the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division sent the office instructions to investigate a case that Sessions had tried to close, Figures and Sessions [...] "had a very spirited discussion regarding how the Hodge case should then be handled; in the course of that argument, Mr. Sessions threw the file on a table, and remarked, 'I wish I could decline on all of them, by which Figures said Sessions meant civil rights cases generally. Kowalski, however, testified that he believed [...] " [...] was eager to see that justice was done in the area of criminal civil rights prosecutions." ...|$|E
