5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> the bowling. Yardley took the new ball {{in an attempt}} to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked {{to the edge of the}} playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E

The timing of the publication is significant: during the 1980s, Austria's younger generation was trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> their country's Nazi past. The story of a February hidden in shadows—February Shadows—forces the readers, most of whom would be Austrians, to relieve the experience of that February and thus remember a past that most Austrians wanted to suppress. In this way, it is both a culturally revealing and politically charged story.|$|E

In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> the infidelity.

The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and the Bipartisan Policy Center's Debt Reduction Task Force have produced thoughtful and sound plans for debt reduction but have produced little political traction. Reluctance <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>to</b> the U.

25|$|The Russians met fierce {{resistance}} from Chechen rebel fighters intimately familiar with their capital city. The defenders {{had chosen to}} withstand the heavy Russian bombardment for the chance <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> <b>with</b> their enemy {{in an environment of}} their choosing, using interconnected firing positions and maneuver warfare. In stark contrast to the ad-hoc defense of 1994, the separatists prepared well for the Russian assault. Grozny was transformed into a fortress city under the leadership of field commander Aslambek Ismailov. The Chechens dug hundreds of trenches and antitank ditches, built bunkers behind apartment buildings, laid land mines throughout the city, placed sniper nests on high-rise buildings and prepared escape routes. In some instances whole buildings were booby-trapped; the ground floor windows and doors were usually boarded-up or mined, making it impossible for the Russians to simply walk into a building. Relying on their high mobility (they usually did not use body armor because of lack of equipment), the Chechens would use the trenches to move between houses and sniper positions, engaging the Russians as they focused on the tops of buildings or on windows. Well-organized small groups of no more than 15 fighters moved freely about Grozny using the city's sewer network, even sneaking behind Russian lines and attacking unsuspecting soldiers from the rear.|$|E

It is suggested, perhaps controversially, that government failure has been a longstanding feature of both industries. Understanding of the policy reform needed to remove economic inefficiency is better for sugar than for wool.

Here, Morrison imagines {{a narrative of}} a slave women grieving {{the death of her}} baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In Beloved, Morrison attempts <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, “Sixty Million and more,” Morrison presupposes {{there is no way to}} count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present. In her award-winning novel, Morrison expands the idea of the past, attempting to demonstrate the past is ever present and moreover, that the past is RIGHT NOW.|$|R

This book, she claims, was based in part on an earlier work, View of the Hebrews, by a contemporary clergyman Ethan Smith.
