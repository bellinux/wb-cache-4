5|$|Genetic {{research}} in mid-2014 by the British Antarctic Survey {{confirmed that the}} separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists believe that <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> regarded as separate subspecies {{and that they are}} evolving independently.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects of}} heart arrhythmias {{have also been}} reported. Increased {{prothrombin}} time and decreased platelet count have been reported; therefore, <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> monitored closely in patients who are also taking anticoagulants.|$|E
25|$|Thus, <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{used with}} caution and any new {{medication}} should be instituted {{in a controlled}} setting, with slow titration of levels and with a clear endpoint {{as to what the}} expected outcome for treatment is.|$|E
30|$|At certain occasions, {{one might}} {{consider}} economic support or price signals, but <b>these</b> <b>should</b> always <b>be</b> designed to eliminate barriers. In some cases subsidies or price signals can rupture inertia or create awareness. But since their effect is usually temporary, <b>these</b> policies <b>should</b> <b>be</b> of limited duration.|$|R

25|$|There are {{a series}} of pre-dive checks which are done after the diver is locked into the helmet, and before he is {{committed}} to the water. <b>These</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> done every time a diver is prepared for a dive.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{according}} to macroeconomic theory, a well-regulated fractional-reserve bank system also benefits {{the economy by}} providing regulators with powerful tools for influencing the money supply and interest rates.

25|$|In general, {{these new}} CMCs {{that are made}} {{possible}} by the Internet have altered the way people use language – there is heightened informality and consequently a growing fear of its deterioration. However, as David Crystal puts it, <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> seen positively as it reflects the power of the creativity of a language.|$|E

25|$|Sterilization: Proper {{disposal}} {{and treatment}} of all materials that may have {{come into contact with}} cholera victims' feces (e.g., clothing, bedding, etc.) are essential. <b>These</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> sanitized by washing in hot water, using chlorine bleach if possible. Hands that touch cholera patients or their clothing, bedding, etc., should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with chlorinated water or other effective antimicrobial agents.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{the high rate of}} complications, <b>these</b> {{diagnostic}} strategies <b>should</b> <b>be</b> discussed by multidisciplinary staff, the risk-to-benefit ratio <b>should</b> <b>be</b> carefully assessed, and <b>these</b> biopsies <b>should</b> ideally <b>be</b> performed in high-volume centers.|$|R

25|$|The reason inter-world {{communication}} {{seems like}} a possibility is because decoherence which separates the parallel worlds is never fully complete, therefore weak influences from one parallel world to another can still pass between them, and <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> measurable with advanced technology. Deutsch proposed such an experiment in a 1985 International Journal of Theoretical Physics article, but the technology it requires involves human-level artificial intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} (if any) {{between the}} Higgs {{field and the}} presently observed vacuum energy density of the universe has also come under scientific study. As observed, the present vacuum energy density is extremely close to zero, but the energy density expected from the Higgs field, supersymmetry, and other current theories are typically many orders of magnitude larger. It is unclear how <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> reconciled. This cosmological constant problem remains a further major unanswered problem in physics.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{diagnostic}} technique is with appropriate X-rays and hip scoring tests. <b>These</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> done at an appropriate age, and perhaps repeated at adulthood - if done too young {{they will not}} show anything. Since the condition is {{to a large degree}} inherited, the hip scores of parents should be professionally checked before buying a pup, and the hip scores of dogs should be checked before relying upon them for breeding. Despite the fact that the condition is inherited, it can occasionally arise even to animals with impeccably hip scored parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{public is}} also quite clear on its {{priorities}} {{when it comes}} to promoting energy conservation versus increasing the supply of oil, coal, and natural gas. When asked which of <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> the higher priority, the public chooses energy conservation by a very wide 68 percent-to-21 percent margin. The public also predominantly believes that the need to cut down on energy consumption and protect the environment means increased energy efficiency should be mandated for certain products. Ninety-two percent of Americans now support such requirements.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} threats to the long-term well being of human remains in museum collections is improper storage and packing. Proper storage of human remains is not only necessary for their physical preservation, but it also demonstrates the respect that sensitive materials such as <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> accorded. The ideal storage location for sacred artifacts and human remains is a designated space away {{from the rest of}} the collection; however, there are often many constraints which prevent this from being possible. At the minimum, ethical guidelines suggest that remains from different individuals should be stored in separate boxes or compartments from each other.|$|E
25|$|When the {{national}} flag has become worn or frayed {{it is no}} longer fit for display, and should not be used in any manner implying disrespect. The national flag, when used as a decoration, should always be treated with due respect. It may be used as a discreet lapel button or rosette or as part of a centrepiece for a table. When used in the latter context with the flags of other nations, {{the national}} flag should also be displayed in the place of honour on a nearby flag staff. Where multiple national flags are flown on festive occasions <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> of uniform dimensions. Bunting of the national colours may also be used on festive occasions.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} Jewish {{refugees}} from Arab lands {{continues to be}} on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that “The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal seizure of assets took place, <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected.” The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations.|$|E
25|$|The Metro has a {{very large}} {{expansion}} plan for the next half century. The Pravoberezhnaya Line was split in early 2009, and the new fifth line (Frunzensko-Primorskaya) took the northern (Primorsky) radius away from Pravoberezhnaya and opened with a new section (Frunzensky) to the south. The Pravoberezhnaya line will extend to the west, and then north to Lakhta, and then to Yuntolovo. The two stations, Bukharestskaya and Mezhdunarodnaya of the Frunzensko-Primorskaya line, opened in December 2012, {{will be followed by}} another three heading southward - Prospekt Slavy, Dunayskaya and Shushary. <b>These</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> open by 2017-2018. Three new lines, Krasnosel'sko-Kalininskaya, Admiralteysko-Okhtinskaya and Koltsevaya, will be opened. The first six stations of the Krasnosel'sko-Kalininskaya line are already under construction, and should be open by 2020. The Admiralteysko-Okhtinskaya line should appear before 2025. The Koltsevaya line will be opened after 2025.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{historians have}} doubted the {{historical}} accuracy of Livy's description {{of these three}} battles. Livy's battle-scenes for this time period are mostly free reconstructions by him and his sources, {{and there are no}} reasons why <b>these</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> different. The number of Samnites killed and the amounts of spoils taken by the Romans have clearly been exaggerated. Historians have noted the many similarities between the story of Publius Decius Mus, and an event said to have taken place on Sicily in 258 when the Romans were fighting the First Punic War against Carthage. According to the ancient sources, a Roman army was in danger of being trapped in a defile when a military tribune led a detachment of 300 men to seize a hilltop {{in the middle of the}} enemy. The Roman army escaped, but of the 300 only the tribune survived. It is unlikely that this latter, in ancient times more famous, episode has not influenced the descriptions of the former.|$|E
