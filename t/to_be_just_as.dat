5|$|In 2003, Wave Race 64 was {{released}} in China for the iQue Player console. A 1-hour demo of the game was also included with the console. On August 6, 2007, the game {{was released}} on the Wii's Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual Console versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> much fun as {{it was on the}} Nintendo 64.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, {{the normal}} diet {{includes}} rice and noodles {{as the main}} energy source, making their elimination difficult. Therefore, the MCT-oil form of the diet, which allows more carbohydrate, has proved useful. In India, religious beliefs commonly affect the diet: some patients are vegetarians, will not eat root vegetables or avoid beef. The Indian ketogenic diet is started without a fast due to cultural opposition towards fasting in children. The low-fat, high-carbohydrate nature of the normal Indian and Asian diet means that their ketogenic diets typically have a lower ketogenic ratio (1:1) than in America and Europe. However, they appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective.|$|E
5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question Do you know him?, but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E

5|$|Tigers {{have been}} studied in the wild {{using a variety of}} techniques. The populations of tigers have been {{estimated}} using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticised as being inaccurate. More recent attempts have been made using camera trapping and studies on DNA from their scat, while radio collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild. Tiger spray has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> good, or better, as a source of DNA as scat.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Petrograd's Finland Station, Lenin gave {{a speech}} to Bolshevik {{supporters}} condemning the Provisional Government and again calling for a continent-wide European proletarian revolution. Over the following days, he spoke at Bolshevik meetings, lambasting those who wanted reconciliation with the Mensheviks and revealing his April Theses, an outline of {{his plans for the}} Bolsheviks, which he had written on the journey from Switzerland. He publicly condemned both the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries – who dominated the influential Petrograd Soviet – for supporting the Provisional Government, denouncing them as traitors to socialism. Considering the government <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany and Austria-Hungary, rule by soviets, the nationalisation of industry and banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of establishing a proletariat government and pushing toward a socialist society. By contrast, the Mensheviks believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism and accused Lenin of trying to plunge the new Republic into civil war. Over the coming months, he campaigned for his policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda, and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.|$|E
5|$|The exiled prisoners from Earth {{form the}} Confederacy of Man in the Koprulu Sector. A de facto plutocracy, the Confederacy's inner {{workings}} are elaborated {{on in the}} novels Liberty's Crusade, Speed of Darkness and Nova. Taking {{the role of the}} primary antagonistic faction in StarCrafts Episode I, the Confederacy is shown as the most powerful faction in the sector at the beginning of StarCraft; in the novels, it is depicted as being brutal towards the public and corrupt at the highest levels on its capital Tarsonis. The player gets to control a division of the Confederate Security Forces in the prequel shareware campaign for StarCraft. Due to the brutality of the regime, it is opposed by a variety of rebel groups and is eventually overthrown by the Sons of Korhal. The Sons of Korhal, a rebel group led by Arcturus Mengsk that the player controls during Episode I of StarCraft, form the Terran Dominion to replace the destroyed Confederacy, with the planet Korhal IV as the capital. The Dominion is an autocracy with Mengsk as its emperor. The Dominion's operations are built on in The Dark Templar Saga series of novels. Although Mengsk sees himself as a benevolent dictator, he is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> harsh as his predecessors.|$|E
5000|$|Ambrose of Milan, former Pretorian Prefect of {{northern}} Italy before being elected bishop of Milan, preserved the Christian presumption {{against the use}} of violence, unless it <b>was</b> needed <b>to</b> protect important social values. While rejecting resorting to violence in self-defense, he argued that charity demanded one protect one’s neighbour. [...] "He who does not ward off injury from his comrade, when he <b>is</b> able <b>to,</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> guilty as he who does the injury." ...|$|R

25|$|Open-label {{case series}} have {{suggested}} that primidone is effective {{in the treatment of}} epilepsy. Primidone has been compared to phenytoin, phenobarbital, mephobarbital, ethotoin, metharbital, and mephenytoin. In adult comparison trials, primidone has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective.|$|E
25|$|Speed {{cushions}} {{are often}} less costly than speed humps or tables, and most cities report them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective. In some jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks (e.g. UPS, FedEx) are also not slowed down.|$|E
25|$|A short-course (3–7 days) of {{antibiotics}} seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> effective as the typical longer-course (10–14 days) {{of antibiotics}} {{for those with}} clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis without any other severe disease or complicating factors. The IDSA guideline suggest five to seven days of antibiotics is long enough to treat a bacterial infection without encouraging resistance. The guidelines still recommend children receive antibiotic treatment for ten days to two weeks.|$|E

40|$|Should liberal {{communities}} accommodate {{communities that}} praise ‘illiberal’ values? After all, a state-driven {{imposition of a}} single set of values {{in the name of}} liberalism is, if nothing else, a clearly contradictory interpretation of liberalism. Forcing people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> bad as forcing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unfree, argues Paula Zoido-Oses...|$|R
50|$|However, as had {{happened}} before {{and later in}} Mexican history, land sold/granted <b>to</b> foreigners <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> often expropriated.

25|$|After resigning {{from the}} Civil Aeronautics Authority, Omlie {{returned}} to Memphis and purchased a cattle farm in Como, Mississippi. Omlie's inexperience with operating a cattle farm posed {{a problem in}} running the business, and she traded the farm {{a few years later}} for a small cafe and hotel in Lambert, Mississippi. The hotel business proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> unsuccessful for Omlie, who returned to Memphis in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Ronstadt's {{recording}} {{output in}} the 1980s proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990, Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two are triple platinum (each with over three million U.S. copies sold); {{one has been}} certified double platinum (over two million copies sold); and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double-disc album.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth's {{military}} forces, however, proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> divided as {{the general}} populace. The State Guard, {{under the command of}} Simon B. Buckner, largely favored the Confederate cause, while the newly formed Home Guard were mostly Unionists. Several close calls almost started a conflict within the state, but Buckner successfully negotiated with Union general George B. McClellan and Tennessee governor Isham Harris to maintain the Commonwealth's neutrality through the summer.|$|E

25|$|For example, the viceroy {{butterfly}} appears {{very similar}} to the noxious-tasting monarch butterfly. Although for a long time thought to be an example of Batesian mimicry, the viceroy has recently been discovered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> unpalatable as the monarch, making this a case of Müllerian mimicry. Poison dart frogs of South America and mantella frogs of Madagascar are examples of Müllerian mimicry with their conspicuous warning coloration (bright colours against black markings) and toxic composition.|$|E
25|$|In a {{defensive}} battle, the Redskins played {{a little better}} by limiting the Vikings to only 76 rushing yards and piling up eight sacks among seven different players (Dave Butz, Kurt Gouveia, Ravin Caldwell, Dexter Manley, Charles Mann, Alvin Walton, and Clarence Vaughn). The Vikings string of playoff upsets {{came to an end}} in a game that proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> hard fought and intense as Washington's 27–24 overtime victory over them in Week 15 of the regular season.|$|E
25|$|Damage Control Team No. 8 {{had been}} assured of a 10-minute window {{in which to}} {{extinguish}} the fire and prevent the bombs from detonating, but the Composition B bombs proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> unstable as the ordnance crews had initially feared; after only slightly more than one minute, despite Chief Farrier's constant efforts to cool the bombs, the casing of one suddenly split open and began to glow a bright red. The Chief, recognizing that a lethal cook-off was imminent, shouted for his team to withdraw, but the bomb detonated seconds later— one minute and 36 seconds {{after the start of}} the fire.|$|E

25|$|Following an {{introductory}} {{meeting with the}} Office of District Government Matiari, the British schoolteachers visit several {{public schools in the}} vicinity, including one for children with mental disabilities. They discover that teaching styles are more direct in Pakistan, with an ‘I talk, you listen’ approach as opposed to ‘let us do it together’ that is used in the UK. One look at the children’s report cards, however, ascertains the effectiveness of this approach in the results that appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> good. An emphasis on discipline surfaces as a common feature in all the individual opinions expressed, when inquired about the school visits.|$|E
25|$|The Dynamo {{then had}} to face New York Red Bulls who had bested them {{during the regular season}} in all three meetings, and it looked like they would thrash the Dynamo in the playoffs as well after the Red Bulls jumped out to a 2–0 lead during the first leg in Houston. Ricardo Clark was able to get on the board at the 50', and Omar Cummings, {{recently}} returned to full form, scored in stoppage time to complete the Dynamo exciting comeback. The 2nd leg in New York proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> exciting. Bradley Wright-Phillips put the Red Bulls in the series lead again in the 23', but Brad Davis punished a mistake from the Red Bull defense to level the score before the half. Enter Omar Cummings for a second time, and for a second time, he scored a thrilling stoppage time goal to put the Houston Dynamo into the Conference Championship for the 3rd consecutive year.|$|E
25|$|Many {{answered}} {{the call and}} an army of some 200,000 in total participated – roughly 150,000 – 100,000 men were sent by the Holy Roman Empire alone, a natural rival of Byzantium to the Imperial claim. King Henry II of England died and did not fulfill his crusader vow. However, his son and successor Richard I of England took the vow and along with his rival, Philip II of France took to the sea to retake the Holy Land. All three of these Crusaders had some scores to settle with Byzantium – Richard was the brother-in-law of William II of Sicily through the marriage of the later with his sister Joan of England. He would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> adventurous as his kinsman. Philip {{had heard of the}} sufferings of his own sister, Agnes of France. None of these would compare with the danger posed by Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. Almost seventy years old, Frederick had fought in many battles and charged at reckless odds in the pursuit of victory. There was no doubt therefore that his massive army would smash their way to Jerusalem with ease, provided it was given the means to do so by the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
