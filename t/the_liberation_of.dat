5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, {{over more}} militant and Marxist Palestinian groups. As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for <b>the</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>of</b> Palestine, Popular Front for <b>the</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>of</b> Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for <b>the</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>of</b> Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN {{participated in}} the US-led Western New Guinea campaign, which had the goal of {{securing}} bases {{to be used to}} mount <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the Philippines. Australian warships and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF {{participated in the}} capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E

5|$|Anarchism, then, really {{stands for}} <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> {{the human mind}} from the {{dominion}} of religion; <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals {{for the purpose of}} producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.|$|E
5|$|Besides their guerrilla activities, {{these groups}} {{also participated in}} many pivotal battles during <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> the islands.

At about the same time, the 31st Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. In the initial stages of Operation Bagration, the front's immediate objective was the city of Orsha. The 331st had the direct support of the 959th SU Regiment (SU-76s) for its initial assault; this regiment had been assigned to support of the corps since the beginning of June. In recognition of the 331st's role in <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> Orsha, on June 27, it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. The division went on to assist in <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> Borisov. While two divisions of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps of the 11th Guards Army attacked from the west and north, the 331st drove into the south of the city and it was cleared of German forces by 3:00 am on July 1. In the following days it took part in <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> Minsk, before joining the general advance to the 1941 Soviet-German frontier. In recognition of his successful command of {{the division}} in this operation, Major General Berestov was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union on June 27, 1945.|$|E

Among other operations, the unit was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>of</b> Honfleur on 25 August. It was also involved in <b>the</b> <b>Liberation</b> <b>of</b> Belgium in September 1944 and entered Brussels on 4September, the day after its Liberation.

5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works of the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E
5|$|As the Allies {{prepared}} for <b>the</b> <b>liberation</b> <b>of</b> Europe, the mass deportations began {{at a rate}} of four trains a day from Hungary to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, each train carrying around 3,000 people. Between 15 May and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Hungarian Jews are recorded as having been sent there on 147 trains, most gassed on arrival.
