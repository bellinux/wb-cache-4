5|$|In Zambia, Gryllotalpa africana is held {{to bring}} {{good fortune to}} anyone who sees it. In Latin America, Scapteriscus and Neocurtilla mole crickets are said to predict rain when they dig into the ground.

5|$|Reproductive mimicry {{occurs when}} {{the actions of the}} dupe {{directly}} aid in the mimic's reproduction. This is common in plants with deceptive flowers that do not provide the reward <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to offer. Other forms of mimicry have a reproductive component, such as Vavilovian mimicry involving seeds, and brood parasitism, which can also involve aggressive mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Web-spinning {{also caused}} the {{association}} of the spider with creation myths, as <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> {{to have the ability}} to produce their own worlds. Dreamcatchers are depictions of spiderwebs. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped nature. They placed emphasis on animals and often depicted spiders in their art.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware of them. Over the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E

5|$|In the dry season, {{the gray}} mouse lemur faces the {{challenge}} of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to ﬁnd food resources {{in the absence of}} sensory cues, and that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.|$|E
5|$|More {{is known}} about the role of Athenian {{children}} in religion than about any other aspect of their lives, and <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have played a prominent role in religious ceremonies. Girls made offerings to Artemis on the eve of their marriage, during pregnancy, and at childbirth. Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early-spring festival of the Anthesteria, depictions of boys are far more common.|$|E
5|$|Other themes include {{chance and}} coincidence. During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than what <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E

5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to {{the sidewalk}} outside the Rosencrantz apartment building in Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow when they have more dark feathers. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E
5|$|Wulfred {{came into}} {{conflict}} with King Coenwulf of Mercia {{over the issue of}} whether laymen could control religious houses, with the king supporting the rights of laymen to control monasteries. In 808 the papacy informed Charlemagne that Cenwulf had not yet made peace with the archbishop, but by 809 <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have been on good terms; the two were involved in a series of land transfers from 809 to 815.|$|E

5|$|According to the Domesday Book of 1086, the Bishop of Rochester {{was given}} land valued at 17s 4d in Aylesford, Kent, in {{compensation}} for land {{that became the}} site of Rochester Castle. Of the 48castles mentioned in the survey, Rochester {{is the only one}} for which property-owners were reimbursed when their land was taken to build the castle. From the 11thcentury the castle-guard was a feudal obligation in England. This often took the form of knights garrisoning castles for their lords for a set period. There is no comprehensive list of which castles were owed service in this form, but military historian Cathcart King notes that <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to have been predominantly high-status castles. Rochester's castle-guard consisted of 60knights' fees, marking it as a particularly important fortification.|$|E
5|$|At {{least five}} hot springs exist in valleys near Mount Cayley, {{providing}} more evidence for magmatic activity. This includes springs found at Shovelnose Creek and Turbid Creek {{on the southern}} flank of Mount Cayley and Brandywine Creek on the eastern flank of the volcanic field. They are generally found in areas of volcanic activity that are geologically young. As the regional surface water percolates downward through rocks below the Mount Cayley field, it reaches areas of high temperatures surrounding an active or recently solidified magma reservoir. Here, the water is heated, becomes less dense and rises {{back to the surface}} along fissures or cracks. These features are sometimes referred to as dying volcanoes because <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to represent the last stage of volcanic activity as the magma at depth cools and hardens.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. <b>They</b> <b>seem</b> to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E

5|$|On Lanzarote a {{somewhat}} {{larger number of}} these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western Canary Islands which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On Tenerife <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> relatively numerous {{but on the other}} islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland Spain, the western Canary Islands population is not classified as threatened.|$|E
5|$|Sea snakes are {{generally}} reluctant to bite, {{and are usually}} considered to be mild-tempered, although variation is seen among species and individuals. Some species, such as P. platurus, which feed by simply gulping down their prey, {{are more likely to}} bite when provoked because <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to use their venom more for defense. Others, such as Laticauda, use their venom for prey immobilization; these snakes are often handled without concern by local fishermen, who unravel and toss them back into the water barehanded when the snakes become entangled in fishing nets. Species reported as much more aggressive include Aipysurus laevis, Astrotia stokesii, Enhydrina schistosa, Enhydrina zweifeli, and Hydrophis ornatus.|$|E
5|$|The writer Ratazyayev, who {{jokes about}} using Devushkin as a {{character}} {{in one of his}} stories offends him, but genuinely seems to like him. Eventually Devushkin's pride is assuaged and their friendship is restored. The Gorshkovs come into money because the father's case is won in court. With the generous settlement <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to be destined to be perfectly happy, but the father dies, leaving his family in a shambles despite the money. Soon after this, Dobroselova announces that a rich man, Mr. Bykov who had dealings with Anna Fyodorovna and Pokrovsky's father, has proposed to her. She decides to leave with him, and the last few letters attest to her slowly becoming accustomed to her new money.|$|E
