40|$|In this study, the {{deformation}} of different fibers {{of the rat}} m. plantaris during "isometric" contractions at different muscle lengths was considered. Because the m. plantaris has an obviously inhomogeneous architecture, its fibers on the medial side of the muscle belly are judged to be shorter than those on the lateral side of it. It was expected that longitudinal {{deformation of}} different fibers would vary accordingly. A 3 D video analysis of contracting muscle showed that longitudinal strain of fibers {{as a function of}} muscle length does not differ between fibers on different sides of the muscle. Apart from longitudinal shortening, the fibers were also displaced laterally during a contraction. The fibers displaced during a contraction in a direction perpendicular to their longitudinal axis. The displacement of the fibers occurred asymmetrically, resulting in a helical deformation of the whole muscle. It is concluded that the asymmetric displacement and the helical deformation must result from <b>transversal</b> <b>forces</b> between the fibers. It is hypothesized that these <b>transversal</b> <b>forces</b> cancel out differences in longitudinal strains that might exist between fibers. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} <b>transversal</b> <b>force</b> {{transmitted to}} a chip during ultrasonic bonding {{is derived from}} measurements of the vibration amplitude at the tool tip and the die edge. To proof the derivation, the <b>transversal</b> <b>force</b> is measured as well {{by means of a}} microsensor, which is sensitive to the stress field in the silicon die. The force measured by the microsensor is further referred to as "y-force" To Al-metalized test pads with the integrated microsensors, AlSi 1 wire of 25 mu m diameter was bonded using a wedge/wedge auto-bonder. Measurements of the vibration amplitudes and the y-force during bonding were conducted for nine different bonding parameter settings of force and ultrasound (us) amplitude. They confirm a theory for the friction cleaning phase as it was described earlier and will be partially presented here. Compared to earlier measurements of Au-ball-bonds, the results largely show the same behavior and imply that us wedge bonding and thermosonic ball bonding are similar processes. Furthermore, the data approves former interpretations of the bonding process starting with a stiction phase. A clear break off point was found in all pad amplitude measurements, which is followed by a friction plateau that implicates the need of a minimum friction cleaning power. The discussion made in this paper is interesting fora bond process control system. The <b>transversal</b> <b>force</b> reflects the important stages of the bond process and contains the information to Suit as a control signal. But it is impractical to measure the <b>transversal</b> <b>force</b> in situ under the wedge in industrial production, where chip, Substrate and bonding table create a complex setup with a high geometric variety. An indirect measurement of the <b>transversal</b> <b>force</b> via the tool tip amplitude opens up new possibilities for gaining an efficient control variable, because the geometry and the properties of the bonding machine are well defined. As a first step it is shown by correlating vibration measurements with microsensor signals, that the tool tip amplitude measured by laser vibrometer contains all of the necessary information needed to control the bond process. From that point, process integrable measurement systems - which are cheaper, more handy and more fail safe than the laser vibrometer - might be developed...|$|E

We calculate the force of resistance acting on the body and examine how {{it depends on the}} kind of roughness (shape of the cavities). We show that the nonzero transversal component of the force generally appears, resulting in deflection of the disk trajectory. In several simple cases the trajectory is determined.

40|$|In this paper, the {{oscillating}} flow around a circular cylinder is investigated numerically using both a three-dimensional and a two-dimensional model. Two important threedimensional regimes of the Tatsuno & Bearman (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 211, 1990, p. 157) map are investigated: the asymmetric transverse-street regime D, and the doublepair diagonal regime F. The Stokes number is held constant (β = 20) and the Keulegan–Carpenter {{number and the}} Reynolds number changed so that they match the conditions of these two regimes. The cross-sectional vortex streets (V-pattern in regime D and diagonal pattern in regime F) appear to be unstable, and switching from a pattern to its mirror-image mode occurs during the simulation. This switching is related to a two-dimensional instability in the flow field; this phenomenon can be reproduced by pure twodimensional simulations. Three-dimensionality in the flow field always appears after the asymmetric vortex pattern has fully developed. The main effect of three-dimensionality in the flow field {{appears to be a}} rotation (circumferential effect) along the axial direction of the main sectional vortex patterns and a time delay along this axis of the switching from a two-dimensional mode to its mirror-image. These features contribute to generation of the three-dimensional sinuous S-mode as defined by Yang & Rockwell (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 460, 2002, p. 93). The three-dimensionality of the vorticity field affects the dynamic loads induced on the cylinder. The longitudinal component of the force acting on the cylinder appears to be weakly affected by three-dimensional effects, and so does its distribution in the axial direction. This finding explains why the results of two-dimensional simulations often agree fairly well with the data from laboratory experiments. Conversely, the <b>transversal</b> <b>force</b> appears to be significantly affected by the three-dimensional flow field, which suggests that an accurate numerical prediction requires the use of threedimensional numerical models. Finally, a simplified conceptual model explains why the axial variation of the sectional <b>transversal</b> <b>force</b> always appears to be much larger than that of the corresponding longitudinal one. The model also explains why two-dimensional simulations tend to underpredict the r. m. s. value of the longitudinal force and to overpredict that of the <b>transversal</b> <b>force,</b> compared to the data from three-dimensional studies...|$|E
