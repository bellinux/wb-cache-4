50|$|A voice {{interview}} can {{be conducted}} by an internal agent (i.e. an HR department) or an external agent (i.e. HR exit interview consulting firm). Questions are normally asked in a structured order. Voice interviews allow for higher complexity and depth of participation than other methods, because it allows the interviewer to pose follow-up questions, capture ideas through <b>tone</b> <b>indications,</b> probe for answers and clarifications, and ask for examples. However, this allows for bias {{on the part of}} the interviewer and the interviewee. This bias can represent itself in the way a question is asked and the length of an answer to a question. Also, an employee may find it difficult to verbalize constructive critique (particularly when the interview is conducted face-to-face) due to social pressure not to upset the other participant (the interviewer).|$|R

30|$|Inspired by {{the concept}} of {{reservation}} busy tones which are used in [28 – 30] to effectively mitigate interference, we define the Coordination mechanism (CM) to control the CCI in the uncoordinated scenarios under study. Following our approach, the tagged femtocell user (FU) triggers the coordination of surrounding FBS by issuing an in-band requesting signal to advertise its presence. To achieve that, the victim user momentarily suspend its reception and transmit a requesting signal that surrounding interferers detect [5, 29]. Different from the original busy burst solution whereby detecting transmitters estimate their interference parcel from the received feedback; herein, surrounding femtocells only use the busy <b>tone</b> as an <b>indication</b> of the nearby victim receiver presence. To reduce the likelihood that multiple simultaneous requests trigger the coordination procedure, an interference margin can be introduced {{in order to reduce}} the sensitivity of potential interferers to the triggering criterion. The beacon power is maintained low so as to ideally restrict the group of detecting femtocells to the dominant set of interferers. It is also worth noting that any FBS that has already triggered the coordination procedure ignores further requests that may occur while transactions related to the first request are still ongoing.|$|R
40|$|Dietary supplementation with fibre {{has been}} shown to {{ameliorate}} features of the metabolic syndrome and inhibit malignant growth in certain types of cancer. These effects have been linked to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), mostly acetate. However, the ubiquitous role of SCFAs in metabolism, combined with a short tissue half-life and the non-targeted nature of oral and peripheral administrations make achieving phenotypically relevant levels of SCFA by standard delivery techniques challenging and limit their therapeutic potential. Liposomal encapsulation of a therapeutic agent overcomes these issues by protecting against degradation, increasing circulation time and passively targeting both the liver and tumour tissue. In this research project, I have designed a bifunctional liposome formulation to transport SCFA, monitored their distribution and uptake utilising visualisation by MRI, PET/CT and fluorescence microscopy. These bifunctional liposomes were useful for effectively encapsulating small molecules within their aqueous core, which in this case was acetate, and capable of acetate delivery into cells while also being amenable to cellular imaging. I have shown that preferential delivery of liposome encapsulated acetate (LITA) nanoparticles to key sites of metabolic control provide beneficial therapeutic effects in animal models of both obesity and cancer. Chronic administration of LITA nanoparticles in an obeseogenic model led to a significant reduction in adiposity, intrahepatocellular lipid, inflammatory <b>tone</b> and genetic <b>indication</b> of a decrease fatty acid synthesis in the liver. Application of LITA in a murine xenograft model caused an inhibition of tumour growth in three colorectal cancer cell lines: HT- 29, HCT 116 p 53 +/+ and HCT 116 p 53 -/-. The mechanisms for these two outcomes are not fully defined; however cellular energy homeostasis of both scenarios was restored. These results indicate that LITA nanoparticles can be used to improve multiple metabolic pathways, in vivo. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Landsat data, in {{conjunction}} with collateral data sources such as synthesized texture channels and digital terrain models, {{can be used to}} delineate forest stands and other ecological land units found in the coniferous North American forest environment. Incorporation of texture and terrain channels enhances site-specific stratification of Landsat data, promoting delineation of forest stand units of a size and homogeneity approaching those found on manually prepared maps used in the management of timber, range, wildlife, watershed and recreational resources. The procedure is a joint research effort between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology and the University of California at Santa Barbara. The classification approach includes 1) compressing Landsat spectral data into one or two new channels of data using ratio and principle components techniques; 21 generating two texture measures where one channel emphasizes tonal contrast derived from statistical texture techniques and the other emphasizes spatial extent and shape using image segmentation procedures; 3) processing National Cartographic Information Center [...] U. S. Geological Survey Digital Terrain information into elevation, slope and aspect channels; 4) reducing the number of synthesized channels by using divergence analysis to identify channels not contributing significantly to the separation of preliminary training classes; 5) introducing spatial constraints by including line and sample coordinates into the unsupervised classification algorithm; and 6) properly weighting selected spectral, texture and terrain channels such that no single data set overpowers the others in unsupervised classification. The combination of spectral tone, tonal texture, spatial texture, topographic data and line and sample location coordinates, is likely to be sufficient for the stand delineation task because each contributes a separate, independent piece of information towards the stand delineation problem. Spectral tone is most important for recognizing the existence of a feature and combines with the topographic data to provide species information. Tonal texture measures the neighborhood contrast of spectral <b>tones</b> providing an <b>indication</b> of relative timber volume. Spatial texture stratifies tone to quantify the spatial extent and shape of tonal patterns. The topographic information provides a powerful independent parameter well known to improve forest classification accuracies because of its ecological predictive effect. Inclusion of line and sample coordinates introduces a strong spatial constraint designed to permit analyst regulation over the automatic merging of distant and unrelated, but similar appearing features. Target area for generation of maps delineating forest stands and related ecological land units is the 220 square kilometer Doggett Creek watershed located in the Klamath National Forest of northern California. The mountainous topography ranges from 500 to 2100 meters in elevation, and bears a variety of important coniferous timber types including douglas fir, ponderosa pine, white and red fir, and several miscellaneous hardwoods such as black oak and madrone...|$|R
