5000|$|As credits start appearing, a woman (Jeanne Crain) {{carrying}} a large shopping bag, {{and a smaller}} one in her arm, is walking through a busy shopping street of a rundown neighborhood, ignoring the stares and glances of various slum dwellers. As she stops alongside an aging, toothless denizen of skid row, he grabs <b>the</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grocery bags and quickly walks away with it. She enters {{the back of a}} chapel kitchen while, in the main hall, a local evangelist (Alex Nicol) is pouring coffee for destitute men who line up with round metal trays and then sit in the auditorium eating mess hall-style. The woman, Fanny, is the evangelist's wife and she is increasingly unhappy, telling him about the stolen groceries and adding, [...] "I'm drowning, Willis". He reassures her that things will get better and that he rented a quality hall for tonight's revival meeting.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{mountains}} northward end in {{the mountain}} Carrock--one huge, steep, enormous bulk of stones, desolately variegated with the heath plant; at its foot runs the river Calder, and a narrow vale {{between it and the}} mountain Bowscale, so narrow, that in its greatest width it is not more than a furlong. But that narrow vale is [...] "so" [...] green, [...] "so" [...] beautiful, there are moods in which a man might weep to look at it, On this mountain Carrock, at the summit of which are the remains of a vast Druid circle of stones, I was wandering, when a thick cloud came on, and wrapped me in such darkness, that I could not see ten yards before me, and with the cloud a storm of wind and hail, the like of which I had never before seen and felt. At the very summit is a cone of stones, built by the shepherds, and called the Carrock Man. Such cones are on the tops of almost all our mountains, and they are all called [...] "men". At the bottom of the Carrock Man I seated myself for shelter, but the wind became so fearful and tyrannous, that I was apprehensive some of the stones might topple down upon me, so I groped my way farther down and came to three rocks, placed on this wise 1/3\2*** each one supported by the other like a child's house of cards, and in the hollow and screen which they made, I sate for a long while sheltered, as if I had been in my own study in which I am now writing: there I sate with a total feeling worshipping the power and [...] "eternal link" [...] of energy. The darkness vanished as by enchantment; far off, far, far off to the south, the mountains of Glaramara and Great Gable and their family appeared distinct, in deepest, sablest [...] "blue". I rose, and behind me was a rainbow bright as the brightest. I descended by the side of a torrent, and passed, or rather crawled (for I was forced to descend on all fours), by many a naked waterfall, till fatigued and hungry (and with a finger almost broken, and which remains swelled to the size of two fingers), I reached the narrow vale, and the single house nestled in ash and sycamores. I entered to claim the universal hospitality of this country; but instead of the life and comfort usual in these lonely houses, I saw dirt, and every appearance of misery--a pale woman sitting by a peat fire. I asked her for bread and milk, and she sent a small child to fetch it, but did not rise herself. I ate very heartily of the black, sour bread, and drank a bowl of milk, and asked her to permit me to pay her. [...] "Nay," [...] says she, [...] "we are not so scant as that--you are right welcome; but do you know any help for the rheumatics, for I have been so long ailing that I am almost fain to die?" [...] So I advised her to eat a great deal of mustard, having seen in an advertisement something about essence of mustard curing the most obstinate cases of rheumatism. But do write me, and tell me some cure for the rheumatism; it is in her shoulders, and <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> back chiefly.

50|$|Presentations of {{the effect}} vary but a typical one is as follows. The magician {{presents}} a stand, placed stage centre, which supports a sword in a vertical position with the sharpened tip pointing upwards. An assistant is introduced and the magician (sometimes {{with the help of}} additional assistants) picks her up and balances her in a supine position on the tip of the sword. The assistant holds her body rigidly horizontal and <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> back rests on the tip of the sword. The magician then grasps the assistant's feet and rotates her on the sword tip. After spinning freely for a few turns the assistant sinks downwards, as if she has been impaled. As she drops her body goes limp so that she appears to hang lifelessly. The magician then appears to revive her with a kiss or with some magical gesture before lifting her from the sword and placing her back on her feet so that she can be seen to be unharmed.|$|E

Fez admits this to Charlie Richardson after he sees Kitty naked accidentally, asking what she looked like and saying, [...] "And I'm only asking this because I find Miss Kitty attractive in a sexual way." [...] Also, after Kelso has a break up with Hyde's sister, Angie, he tells Eric, [...] "I need a hug from your mom." [...] Eric concludes his conversation with Hyde, leaving to [...] "go pull Kelso off my mother". Also, Hyde, before his (technically not legal) adoption made him Kitty's son, demonstrated some attraction to Kitty, such as when she was teaching him dancing, he greatly enjoyed placing his hand in <b>the</b> <b>small</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> back, almost sexually. As part of the plot of that episode, Bob sees them and assumes they are having an affair.|$|E

She resisted Alice's suggestion that her brother Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and Marie's only daughter, Maria marry, but the couple would wed in 1874.

40|$|The {{story of}} Cinderella has had many variants, some {{dating back to}} ancient Tibetan trade routes and dynastic China.

In southern China the custom of footbinding became a historically defining feature of the society.

5000|$|... "Still, Maria Dermoût {{an author}} for the happy few. Is she a writer's writer? Certainly not. She is a storyteller par excellence. Her stories are subtle, {{but they are}} also accessible. Nonetheless she remains an author for the happy few, equal to the greats of Dutch prose, but much less known than they are. There are many reasons for her modest {{literary}} reputation: her own modesty, <b>the</b> <b>small</b> body <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work, <b>the</b> brevity <b>of</b> <b>her</b> literary career. But it is mainly her work itself that is the cause. It possesses something that wards off hordes of readers, yet still manages to attract a handful, who then embrace it and spread the word of its exquisite nature. The shell seekers among the readers, the slow walkers, those who stop and turn and bend over to pick up that one beautiful shell - they recognize her extraordinary work." ...|$|R
