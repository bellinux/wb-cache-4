5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} who become pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that <b>trimester.</b> The first <b>trimester</b> normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinematic}} {{analysis of}} gait during pregnancy provides {{more information about}} the anatomical changes and contributes to exercise and rehabilitation prescription. The purposes were to quantify the lower limb kinematics of gait and to compare it between the second and third <b>trimesters</b> of pregnancy and with a control group. A three-dimensional analysis was performed in twenty-two pregnant women and twelve nonpregnant. Repeated Measures and Manova tests were performed for comparisons between <b>trimesters</b> and between pregnant and controls. The walking speed, stride width, right-/left-step time, cycle time and time of support, and flight phases remain unchanged between <b>trimesters</b> and between pregnant and controls. Stride and right-/left-step lengths decreased between <b>trimesters.</b> Double limb support time increased between <b>trimesters,</b> and it increased when compared with controls. Joint kinematics showed a significant decrease of right-hip extension and adduction during stance phase between <b>trimesters</b> and when compared with controls. Also, an increase in left-knee flexion and a decrease in right-ankle plantarflexion were found between <b>trimesters.</b> The results suggested that pregnant women need to maintain greater stability of body and to become more efficient in locomotion. Further data from the beginning of pregnancy anthropometric data may contribute to the analysis. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third <b>trimester</b> and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first <b>trimester.</b> Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and use in the last <b>trimester</b> may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems.

5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first <b>trimester.</b> Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|Simple or {{uncomplicated}} malaria may {{be treated}} with oral medications. The most effective treatment for P.falciparum infection {{is the use of}} artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT), which decreases resistance to any single drug component. These additional antimalarials include: amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. ACT is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria. To treat malaria during pregnancy, the WHO recommends the use of quinine plus clindamycin early in the pregnancy (1st <b>trimester),</b> and ACT in later stages (2nd and 3rd trimesters). In the 2000s (decade), malaria with partial resistance to artemisins emerged in Southeast Asia. Infection with P.vivax, P.ovale or P.malariae usually do not require hospitalization. Treatment of P.vivax requires both treatment of blood stages (with chloroquine or ACT) and clearance of liver forms with primaquine. Treatment with tafenoquine prevents relapses after confirmed P. vivax malaria.|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-1940s, {{the school}} {{required}} {{students to be}} able to create a simple electric motor regardless of their major. During World War II, as an engineering school with strong military ties through its ROTC program, Georgia Tech was swiftly enlisted for the war effort. In early 1942 the traditional nine-month semester system was replaced by a year-round <b>trimester</b> year, enabling students to complete their degrees a year earlier. Under the plan, students were allowed to complete their engineering degrees while on active duty. During World War II, Georgia Tech was one of 131 colleges and universities that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. The school was also one of only five U.S. colleges feeding into the United States Naval Academy.|$|E
5|$|The risk {{of disease}} {{can be reduced}} by {{preventing}} mosquito bites {{through the use of}} mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first <b>trimester</b> of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no effective vaccine exists, although efforts to develop one are ongoing. The recommended treatment for malaria is a combination of antimalarial medications that includes an artemisinin. The second medication may be either mefloquine, lumefantrine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. Quinine along with doxycycline may be used if an artemisinin is not available. It is recommended that in areas where the disease is common, malaria is confirmed if possible before treatment is started due to concerns of increasing drug resistance. Resistance among the parasites has developed to several antimalarial medications; for example, chloroquine-resistant P.falciparum has spread to most malarial areas, and resistance to artemisinin has become a problem in some parts of Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy is {{typically}} {{divided into three}} trimesters. The first <b>trimester</b> is from week one through 12 and includes conception. Conception is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the fallopian tube and attaches {{to the inside of}} the uterus, where it begins to form the embryo and placenta. The first <b>trimester</b> carries the highest risk of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus). The second <b>trimester</b> is from week 13 through 28. Around the middle of the second <b>trimester,</b> movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with high-quality medical care. The third <b>trimester</b> is from 29 weeks through 40 weeks.|$|E
