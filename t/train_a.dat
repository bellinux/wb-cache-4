The early success of How to Sleep prompted MGM to rush two more short films featuring Benchley, How to <b>Train</b> <b>a</b> Dog, a spoof of dog-training techniques, and How to Behave, which lampooned etiquette norms. How to Sleep was named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards, {{while the latter}} two shorts were not as well received.|$|E

The People's Republic of China has trained Congolese troops at Kamina in Katanga from at least 2004 to 2009, and the Belgian government is training at least one 'rapid reaction' battalion. When Kabila visited U.S. President George W.

The company is being supervised by Special Operations Command-Africa Command. The various international training programmes are not well integrated.|$|E

5|$|By 2009, Purina {{was one of}} Nestlé's {{fastest growing}} divisions, due to an {{increasing}} willingness by consumers {{to spend more money}} on petcare. In 2008, it formed a separate company called PurinaCare with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas that sold pet insurance. PetCare was later acquired by Pethealth Inc. in 2013. By 2009 Purina had also introduced pet litter products and built new manufacturing facilities in Russia and Thailand.

5|$|By April 1975, morale in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force {{had sunk}} {{so low that}} some of their {{personnel}} simply defected to the Communist side. In a well-known incident, South Vietnamese pilot Nguyen Thanh Trung used his F-5E fighter-bomber to attack the Presidential Palace in Saigon instead of North Vietnamese troops. Shortly afterwards, Trung joined the Communist forces and he was ordered to <b>train</b> <b>a</b> group of North Vietnamese pilots to operate the U.S.-made A-37 Dragonfly fighter-bomber, in order to support the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. On the afternoon of April 28, 1975, Trung led a flight of five A-37 fighter-bombers against Tan Son Nhut Air Base, which temporarily stopped U.S. and South Vietnamese evacuation efforts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Tywyn Wharf station was {{in need of}} major improvements. Before preservation, the station had {{contained}} only a fan of sidings, which meant {{that there was no way}} for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the <b>train.</b> <b>A</b> loop was installed at Wharf for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.|$|E

He developed an interest in magic at age seven and performed his first show at the age of twelve, for which he was paid $10. His main early influence was Harry Houdini. By fourteen, Angel was performing throughout high school at restaurants in East Meadow, including the Wine Gallery. Angel's first major illusion was making his mother float in their family den.

5|$|ESPN {{noted the}} {{worldwide}} success of women horse trainers in 2013, particularly owing to wins {{in three of}} the world's major races within a one-month period.

Then, a few days after Ritvo's horse won the Breeders' Cup Classic, the Melbourne Cup was won by Fiorente, a horse trained by Australian trainer Gai Waterhouse, who was only the second woman to <b>train</b> <b>a</b> winner in that race.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{met with}} Arnold again in September 1943.

Arnold delegated responsibility for this to Major General Oliver P. Echols. In turn, Echols designated Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson as the Project Officer.|$|E

DynCorp was made responsible for individual training and PA unit training. In June–July 2005 the projected force strength {{was reduced to}} 2000 men. DynCorp and the U.S. Embassy scrutinized the personnel for the new armed forces thoroughly. Recruits had to pass a literacy test, an aptitude test, a drug test and an HIV test, and their names and faces were put on posters which are distributed {{to try to make}} sure none have a history of war crimes or other human rights violations. A new batch of 500 screened personnel started to arrive at the Camp Ware base at VOA Careysburg, inland from Monrovia, for initial training in early November 2007, joining 608 others who had graduated earlier.|$|E
5|$|In March 1549, {{the city}} of Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius to leave. Cranmer {{immediately}} invited the men to come to England and promised {{that they would be}} placed in English universities. When they arrived on 25 April, Cranmer was especially delighted to meet Bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence. He needed these scholarly men to <b>train</b> <b>a</b> new generation of preachers as well as assist in the reform of liturgy and doctrine. Others who accepted his invitations include the Polish reformer, Jan Łaski, but Cranmer was unable to convince Osiander and Melanchthon to come to England.|$|E
5|$|In the station, Dive Coasters {{that use}} non-floorless trains simply use a {{standard}} station. With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the <b>train,</b> <b>a</b> movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back up where the next riders board.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>train</b> path is the {{infrastructure}} capacity {{needed to run}} <b>a</b> <b>train</b> between two places over a given time-period.

5000|$|Programming by Analogous Examples: (1995) New {{behavior}} can be created through analogies. For instance {{the behavior of a}} car can be described as analogy to <b>trains.</b> <b>A</b> car moves on a road like <b>a</b> <b>train</b> on <b>a</b> <b>train</b> track. <b>A</b> challenge to this approach is conceptual exception handling. Analogies are often either incomplete or too general. This requires that users can refine programs produced by Programming by Analogous Examples.|$|R

5|$|Nichols {{kept the}} {{national}} laboratories operating with $60 {{million worth of}} research grants for fiscal year 1947. He helped Captain Hyman G.

In June 1946, Nichols went to Bikini Atoll to represent the Manhattan Project at Operation Crossroads, a series of nuclear weapons tests conducted to investigate their effects on warships. Like many of his contemporaries in an Army that was dramatically reduced in size as it rapidly demobilized, Nichols was reduced in rank, reverting to his substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 30 June 1946. On return from Bikini, he found {{that he had been}} made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E

The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas {{and much of the}} civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence.
