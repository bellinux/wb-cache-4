25|$|Having {{initially}} been an all-male institution, Wills {{became the}} last hall to accept both sexes, and went mixed in 1985, despite opposition from some traditionalists.

25|$|During this time, Ford Models {{expanded}} their agency. A successful Men's Division would dominate {{the pages of}} GQ magazine. In 1975, the Fords started a children's division. In her Lifetime Intimate Portrait, Eileen Ford said they started that division with Brooke Shields, then 9 years old, in mind. Shields was already an established model when the Fords signed her. She shot her first national advertising campaign with Francesco Scavullo in 1966 for Ivory soap. It was during <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> with Ford that she shot the infamous photos with photographer Garry Gross.

25|$|In February 1936, {{when the}} first Hall of Fame {{election}} results were announced, Cobb had been named on 222 of 226 ballots, outdistancing Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson, the only others to earn the necessary 75% of votes to be elected <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> His 98.2 percentage stood as the record until Tom Seaver received 98.8% {{of the vote in}} 1992. Those incredible results show that although many people disliked him personally, they respected the way he had played and what he had accomplished. In 1998, Sporting News ranked him as third on the list of 100 Greatest Baseball Players.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1875, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company leased the Frederick & Pennsylvania and the Littlestown Railroads.

That same year on July 1, the Pennsylvania established the Frederick Division with the York Branch and the Columbia Bridge, formerly operated as a portion of the Philadelphia Division, being transferred to, thus making that Division extend from Columbia to Frederick, a distance of 69.5 miles.

25|$|For the 1976 season, Brain {{moved to}} Gloucestershire, {{and though he}} started {{relatively}} slowly with 41 first-class wickets in <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> in the following seasons he claimed 77. He also scored his only first-class half-century, scoring 57 against Essex. This was a somewhat startling scorecard entry, as in his other eleven innings that season his highest score was just 6! The following summer he took 76 first-class wickets, managing his best bowling for his new county when he recorded 7–51 against the touring Australians in May. That season also saw him achieve his highest season's total of List A wickets: he dismissed 34 victims, at an outstanding bowling average of only 14.55.|$|E

25|$|Appalachian State {{began playing}} {{organized}} football in 1928. The coach <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> was Graydon Eggers. The Mountaineers competed {{as an independent}} before joining the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) North State Conference as a charter member in 1931. Kidd Brewer was the {{head coach of the}} Mountaineers from 1935–38, leading the team to two postseason bowl games. Brewer's 1937 squad is best remembered for going unbeaten and unscored upon during the regular season, outscoring opponents 206–0 before losing a postseason game to the Golden Eagles, 7–0. Appalachian found continued success under coach E. C. Duggins (1947–50 and 1952–55). During Duggins' eight years as coach, the Mountaineers claimed three more North State Conference championships and played in seven bowl games. The Mountaineers again competed as an independent from 1968–71 before joining the Southern Conference.|$|E
25|$|On the 24th of March, 1905, Charles D. Zirkle, while {{dying in}} his New Market, VA home, donated {{his share of}} his father’s property, a 42 acre piece of land on the {{outskirts}} of New Market, to the Virginia Conference of Seventh day Adventists. His purpose was to have a school built for Adventist youth education. Two years later, construction commenced on what was originally known as New Market Academy; that name however duplicated that of an old private school in New Market and thus was changed to its current name, Shenandoah Valley Academy. The school first opened in September 1908 and originally accommodated ten grades. <b>That</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> the school had an enrollment of 15 students, the first four of which graduated in 1911. At the time of its founding, Shenandoah Valley Academy was the seventh Seventh-day Adventist high school level academy in the United States.|$|E
25|$|When {{switching}} {{to the use}} of national teams in 1930, the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and Henri Desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race. The procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan. It formalised an existing situation, companies having started to follow the race. The first to sign to precede the Tour was the chocolate company, Menier, one of those who had followed the race. Its head of publicity, Paul Thévenin, had first put the idea to Desgrange. It paid 50,000 old francs. Preceding the race was more attractive to advertisers because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses. Advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race had already gone home. Menier handed out tons of chocolate in <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of preceding the race, as well as 500,000 policemen's hats printed with the company's name. The success led to the caravan's existence being formalised the following year.|$|E

25|$|Gurney's {{first major}} break {{occurred}} {{in the fall of}} 1957, when he was invited to test Frank Arciero's Arciero Special. It was powered by a 4.2-litre reworked Maserati engine with Ferrari running gear, and a Sports Car Engineering Mistral body. This ill-handling brute of a car was very fast, but even top drivers like Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles had found it difficult to handle. He finished second in the inaugural Riverside Grand Prix (behind Shelby), beating established stars like Masten Gregory, Walt Hansgen and Phil Hill. This attracted the attention of famed Ferrari North American importer Luigi Chinetti, who arranged for a factory ride for the young driver at Le Mans in 1958. Gurney, teamed with fellow Californian Bruce Kessler, had worked the car up to fifth overall and handed over to Kessler, who was then caught up in an accident. This performance, and others, earned him a test run in a works Ferrari, and his Formula One career began with the team in 1959. In just four races <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>year,</b> he earned two podium finishes, but the team's strict management style did not suit him.|$|E
25|$|Engineer William Rich Hutton was {{instrumental}} in getting the inclined plane built. Starting in 1875, a canal inclined plane was built two miles (3km) upriver from Georgetown, so that boats whose destination was downriver from Washington could bypass the congestion (and price gouging of independent wharf owners) in Georgetown. Originally the company planned to build a river lock, but then discovered that such a lock occasionally would consume more water than the level could provide. They then planned to make an inclined plane, much like the Morris Canal. The first boat went through in 1876; 1918 boats used the inclined plane <b>that</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> Usage reports conflict: Hahn reports that was only really used for two years, and sporadically in 1889, yet Skramstad reports that due to flood damage in 1880 to the Rock Creek outlet, any boat until 1889 (when another flood wrecked the canal) going further down the Potomac than Georgetown, {{had to use the}} inclined plane. Although Hahn says it was the largest inclined plane in the world at that time, it was 600 feet long, which is short compared to Plane 9 West of the Morris Canal at 1,500 feet. It originally used a turbine to power it (like the Morris Canal) but was later switched to use steam power.|$|E
