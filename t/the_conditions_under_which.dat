5|$|Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas' regime. The Jesuits, {{the only}} ones who refused to do so, were {{expelled}} from the country.

When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, general welfare and public works. None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. Black people did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was himself a slave-owner, and helped revive the slave trade. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular among blacks and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronized their festivities and attended their candombles. The gauchos admired his leadership and willingness to fraternize with them to some extent.|$|E

5|$|Vulcanoids, {{being an}} entirely new class of {{celestial}} bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering {{whether or not they}} exist would yield insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. If they exist they might contain material left over from the earliest period of planet formation, and help determine <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>under</b> <b>which</b> the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet's surface appear older than it actually is. If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints on planet formation and suggest that other processes have been at work in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.|$|E
