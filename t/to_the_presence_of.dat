5|$|The green huntsman spider {{is green}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> bilin {{pigments}} in the spider's hemolymph (circulatory system fluids) and tissue fluids. It hunts insects in green vegetation, {{where it is}} well camouflaged.|$|E
30|$|Spectrum sensing is {{required}} by cognitive radio <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> spectrum holes and more importantly <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> PUs. <b>The</b> priority is <b>to</b> avoid interference with PUs and thus, spectrum sensing should be highly reliable.|$|R
30|$|<b>To</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> faults in an {{induction}} machine rotor, diagnostic methods are classically based on frequency signals analysis of revealing signals [1 – 3]. It is usual <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> modulus of the Fourier transform {{of the current}} absorbed by <b>the</b> machine <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> this type of failure [4]. Indeed, {{a comparison of the}} amplitude of the fault signatory components with a reference threshold (threshold calculated when the machine is healthy) is used <b>to</b> detect <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> an abnormality in the rotor electrical circuits.|$|R
50|$|CD2 is a {{specific}} marker for T cells and NK cells, and can therefore be used in immunohistochemistry <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> such cells in tissue sections. The great majority of T cell lymphomas and leukaemias also express CD2, making it possible <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antigen <b>to</b> distinguish these conditions from B cell neoplasms.|$|R
5|$|Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is defined}} in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection. In the absence of specific treatment, around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years. The most common initial conditions that alert <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (40%), cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome (20%), and esophageal candidiasis. Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought to be related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} testify <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 {{years ago}} is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness {{since at least the}} 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E

5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E
5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance {{is a white}} solid sparingly soluble in water, but very soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid.

5|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{the production}} {{was not able}} to shoot the remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the production as Our Friends in the South.|$|E

5|$|Due to its graphic violence, The Great Silence {{was awarded}} an 18 rating in Italy, {{limiting}} its domestic box office returns.

5|$|From when it opened, {{the tower}} was {{referred}} to as both the Bond Tower and the R Tower, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> both logos on the building's exterior.

Neither argument is rigorous and, at this level, neither is quantitative...|$|R
5|$|In 1717, {{the dark}} {{pigmentation}} of a postmortem spleen and brain {{was published by}} the epidemiologist Giovanni Maria Lancisi in his malaria text book De noxiis paludum effluviis eorumque remediis. This {{was one of the}} earliest reports of the characteristic enlargement of the spleen and dark color of the spleen and brain which are the most constant post-mortem indications of chronic malaria infection. He related the prevalence of malaria in swampy areas <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> flies and recommended swamp drainage to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, it was {{proposed}} to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List. This was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> waste oil, fuel, solvents, and pesticides in the soil. Additionally, {{the burning of}} waste also created problems, {{in addition to the}} use of landfills in old gravel pits on site. The fire training area also needed clean up, as materials were burned until 1974 on that site. Loring was officially added to the list in February 1990.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> an ambulance {{before they can}} be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E

30|$|<b>To</b> {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> {{different species}} in the film, we have performed an XPS study of the films. A wide scan XPS survey was performed <b>to</b> confirm <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> different {{species in the}} film then detailed high-resolution spectra were performed for Zn 2 p, N 1 s, and O 1 s level regions. We have also performed depth-profiling study of our zinc nitride films <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> different species at different levels in the film. The film was etched by low-energy Ar ions for 30  s repeatedly until the films substrate interface was reached. After each etching, high-resolution XPS spectra of Zn 2 p, N 1 s, and O 1 s level regions were obtained.|$|R

5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate {{cell signalling}} events. In these cases, a serpin that {{has formed a}} complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> protease activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E
5|$|Irofulven, a {{compound}} derived from illuden S, is undergoing phase II clinical trials {{as a possible}} therapy for various types of cancers.

5|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{traditional}} use of narcissi for the treatment of cancer was due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners.
