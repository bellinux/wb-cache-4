2500|$|One of {{the regulars}} at the Dunbar {{in its heyday}} was future mayor Tom Bradley, then a young police officer. Bradley would stop in for coffee and conversation.

Halfway into that season, {{disappointed}} with her performance so far that year (8.31 ERA, 5 games, 8 innings, 17 hits, 2 walks, 2 strikeouts) and with her inability in the preceding offseason <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> from any clubs affiliated with the major leagues, she retired from baseball.|$|R

2500|$|Gotti and Gravano {{arrived at}} the {{restaurant}} shortly before 5 o'clock and, after circling the block, parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance. Around 5:30, Gravano spotted Castellano's Lincoln Town Car stopped at a nearby intersection and, via walkie talkie, alerted the team of hitmen stationed outside the restaurant of Castellano's approach. Castellano's driver, Thomas Bilotti, pulled the car up {{directly in front of}} the entrance. As Castellano and Bilotti exited the Lincoln, the roughly half dozen shooters moved in and opened fire, killing both men in a barrage of bullets. As the hat-and-trench-coat-adorned men slipped away into the night, Gotti calmly drove the car past the front of the restaurant <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the scene. Looking down at Bilotti's body from the passenger window, Gravano remarked, [...] "He's gone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I hope {{it may be}} so. If land is there, and you'll {{risk the}} schooner, I'll try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. I shall want you to put it down in black and white, however, that I'm to {{go as high as}} this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Battersby's only a boy. After all, Letty, I don't {{know whether}} I like {{officers}} {{so much better}} than other men,"--and she twisted her neck round <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her back in the pier-glass, and gave her dress a little pull just above her bustle.|$|E
6000|$|He turned nervously in {{his seat}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, then shifted the clutch and slowly started the car. The woman sat quiet. While bumping over the uneven road at a {{reckless}} speed the driver turned at times to cast stealthy glances at the person beside him. Finally he asked in exasperation: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She cannot call us {{back before}} to-morrow night in case only one {{stays on the}} {{plantation}} now," [...] Pierre said, [...] "and by that time we will have been able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> around the town--mayhap be so fortunate as to see some way by which we can work our will. At all events, it seems best that we do as I have said, although I am willing to fall in with whatsoever other plan you lads may propose." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'They {{shall be}} ordered, sir,' I answered, and away I went; {{and the way}} in which all the women in the house went on about that boy and his bold spirit was a thing to see. They climbed up all sorts of places <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, and they peeped, seven deep, through the keyhole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I.

6000|$|The news soon {{spread around}} the ranch that the [...] "tenderfeet" [...] had killed a big bobcat, and all the hands came <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the beast. They praised the boys, and said they must be nervy hunters or {{they could not have}} done it. Of course the lads were {{correspondingly}} proud, and who can blame them? The animal was prepared for stuffing, and then sent off by express to a taxidermist in the city.|$|E
50|$|In November 2001, {{he moved}} on to English club Stoke City, joining up with a number of fellow Icelandic players. He made his debut against Peterborough United in January 2002. He made just two more {{appearances}} during the 2001-02 season and when Guðjón Þórðarson was sacked {{at the end of the}} season Marteinsson struggled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> in with new manager Steve Cotterill and then Tony Pulis.

6000|$|... 'Oh, {{you know}} she is a real true beauty and no mistake,' said Bill, {{beginning}} to feel a personal pride in her; 'there's Miles raving about her, and every one runs about saying, [...] "Have you seen little Underwood's handsome sister?"

60|$|And at {{the words}} Michael bristled, dragged himself clear of the woman's detaining hands, and, with a snarl, whirled about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the black boy who must have just then entered the room and aroused the white god's ire. But there was no black boy. He looked on, still bristling, to the door. Harley {{transferred}} his own gaze to the door, and Michael knew, beyond all doubt, that outside the door was standing a Solomons nigger.|$|E
60|$|I did not, {{could not}} answer. I saw Grace endeavouring <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my countenance, {{as if to}} observe {{the effect of the}} scene. By my {{assistance}} she was so placed as to obtain her wish. The sight, I believe, aroused feelings that had begun to yield to the influence of the last great change; for, when my sister spoke next, it was with a tenderness of accent that proved how hard it for those who are deeply affectionate to lose their instincts.|$|E
500|$|They {{climb up}} into the {{projection}} booths, perceiving the film projectors as [...] "spaghetti merry-go-rounds".

Soon the rest of the babies start riding them. Then they grab the film and run around with them, tangling them up together as the films begin to unravel and break.|$|R
60|$|Fully {{five minutes}} passed, {{and then the}} bear {{stretched}} himself and commenced to sniff the air. Then, of a sudden, he arose on his hind legs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better <b>look</b> at his surroundings.|$|R

60|$|He {{felt better}} after this little breakdown, and {{presently}} his thoughts were turned from conscience to catamounts again; for {{sounds in the}} woods below led him {{to believe that the}} much-desired animal was on the prowl. His excited fancy painted dozens of them not far away, waiting to be shot, and there he was, cooped up on that narrow ledge, with a broken gun, unable even <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them. He felt that it was a just punishment, and after the first regret tried to comfort himself {{with the fact that he}} was much safer where he was than alone in the forest at that hour, for various nocturnal voices suggested restless and dangerous neighbors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now we're in Nail Canyon proper," [...] said Stewart; [...] "An' I know my bearin's. I {{can climb}} out a mile below an' cut across to Kanab Canyon, an' slip up into Nail Canyon agin, {{ahead of the}} mustangs, an' drive 'em up. I can't miss 'em, fer Kanab Canyon is impassable down a little ways. The mustangs will hev to run this way. So all you need do is go below the break, where I climb out, an' wait. You're sure goin' <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the White Mustang. But wait. Don't expect him before noon, an' after thet, any time till he comes.

6000|$|A {{feeling of}} security, to which I {{had been a}} {{stranger}} ever since we entered the ice, {{was created by the}} composure of Noah, and by his self-congratulation at what he called his project <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the Walrus's bottom. Notwithstanding all the fine declarations of exultation and success, however, that he flourished among us who were not mariners, I was much disposed to think that, like other men of extraordinary genius, he had blundered on the grand result of his [...] "ice-screws," [...] and that it was not foreseen and calculated. Let this be as it may, however, all hands were soon on the floe, with brooms, scrapers, hammers, and nails, and the opportunity of repairing and cleaning was thoroughly improved.|$|E
60|$|As {{the legs}} were cased in heavy sea-boots {{he failed to}} make any {{impression}} on them, and, {{after a few moments}} of exhausting effort, he stepped back so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> full <b>look</b> at his foe.|$|R
