5|$|Djibouti was {{represented}} by one male athlete at the 2008 Olympics in athletics: Mahamoud Farah, a 1500 meters runner. It was Farah's Olympic debut but he had previously competed in the 2007 IAAF World Championships. He competed on 15 August in Beijing, and finished 8th out of 12 in heat four {{in a time of}} 3minutes and 43.62seconds. He was 8.83seconds behind the winner of his heat, Mohamed Moustaoui. Overall he finished 42nd out of 53 athletes, and he was 1.32seconds slower than the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-final round and, therefore, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his competition.|$|E
5|$|Making his Summer Olympics debut, Yazaldes Nascimento {{qualified}} for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, without competing in any notable sporting event. He competed on 21 August in Heat 1 against seven other athletes. He ran a time of 11.00 seconds, finishing last of the eight athletes competing. Singapore's Poh Seng Song placed ahead of him {{with a time of}} 10.75 seconds, in a heat led by Namibia's Frank Fredericks who posted a time of 10.12 seconds, 0.88 seconds quicker than Nascimento's time. Out of 84 athletes, Nascimento ranked 67th and was 0.65 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals. Therefore, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his competition.|$|E

25|$|His {{next season}} saw a sudden drop of form. He played a Test in Sri Lanka {{and two in}} Australia with little success. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his Test career.|$|E
25|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Montgomery's {{first-class}} career, but {{he appeared}} in Minor Counties matches for Cheshire in 1911 and Hertfordshire in 1913. He was the cricket coach at Oundle School for around 30 years, retiring in 1946.|$|E
25|$|On 9 March Hitler phoned Rundstedt {{and told}} him he was to be {{replaced}} by Albert Kesselring, to be transferred from Italy. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Gerd von Rundstedt's military career after 52 years.|$|E
50|$|Because of its {{architecture}} {{which has}} been maintained as it <b>was</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of the 17th century, {{it is also a}} well-known landmark within the very distinct geophysical and geocultural entity <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Vexin normand and the forest of Lyons around <b>the</b> town <b>is</b> <b>the</b> border with Pays de Bray known for its traditional bocage landscape of woods, orchards and cattle economy.|$|R
30|$|In {{a social}} network service, if a user generates many links {{that do not}} follow the {{clustering}} property, we have good reasons to suspect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> user <b>is</b> a scammer. To detect this type of outlier nodes, we can first detect outlier edges. Then we find nodes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> points of these outlier edges. Nodes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> linked to many outlier edges {{are likely to be}} outlier nodes.|$|R
50|$|Deception {{technology}} produces alerts <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{product of}} a binary process. Probability is essentially reduced to two values: 0% and 100%. Any party that seeks to identify, ping, enter, view any trap (decoy) or utilizes a lure is immediately identified by this behavior. Anyone touching these traps or lures should not be doing so. This is an advantage over heuristics and probability-based approaches and the many thousands of extraneous alerts these techniques generate.|$|R
25|$|Despite being {{faced with}} dangers {{along the entire}} route of their journey, the battle weary Maedbdh along with Ailill and Fergus finally {{made it back to}} Cruachan and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tale of the Táin Bó Flidhais.|$|E
25|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his {{first-class}} playing career, but {{he returned}} to his home county of Hertfordshire and played for them for several years in the Minor Counties Championship; for them he scored relatively few runs but took many wickets, including 6–13 against Berkshire in July 1931.|$|E
25|$|In the Monaco Grand Prix, Montoya did not {{reproduce}} {{his previous}} form {{and had to}} be satisfied with qualifying seventh. In the race, he made one position at the start. He then tried to pressure teammate Ralf Schumacher to make a mistake, but it was he himself who made the mistake, by sliding into the barriers on the Swimming Pool section on lap 3. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the race for him.|$|E

25|$|If {{you read}} it, you must stop where <b>the</b> Nigger Jim <b>is</b> stolen from <b>the</b> boys. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> real <b>end.</b> <b>The</b> rest <b>is</b> just cheating.|$|R
25|$|Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot {{say there}} is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never {{reach a point where}} space stops and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of space. Space is {{infinite}} in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This <b>is</b> so for <b>the</b> dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.|$|R
25|$|With 21 runs {{required}} and 14 balls remaining, Taylor had Michael Hussey (then ranked as the world's best ODI batsman) bowled for 13, then dismissed Brett Lee lbw {{on the next}} ball. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the over, but he returned to bowl the final over, bowling Brad Hogg to complete the hat-trick. Earlier, Taylor had bowled Ricky Ponting, the fourth-ranked batsman in the world, for 1, and he finished with four for 49, at the time his second-best ODI career figures.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Bardswell {{played only}} {{in a couple of}} {{first-class}} matches for MCC against the Universities, but {{at the start of the}} 1899 season he reappeared for Lancashire, playing as captain in the first six games of the season, but standing aside when Archie MacLaren resumed his cricket career in June. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Bardswell's first-class cricket career apart from one appearance for Lancashire in an end-of-season match in 1902, in which he was not at all successful.|$|E
25|$|General Phoumi Nosavan, when {{informed}} of the coup in progress, declined to participate. Kouprasith Abhay was then named successor to power, with Siho his deputy. Kouprasith called in two battalions of his Mobile Group 17 (French: Groupement Mobile 17 - GM 17) to reinforce the DNC personnel. Communist forces promptly moved into the defensive positions strung along the north edge of the Plain of Jars that had been abandoned by GM 17. On 23 April, the American ambassador Leonard Unger returned from a conference in Saigon, Vietnam. He confronted Siho and the mutinous Lao officers and informed them that the United States supported Souvanna Phouma; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the coup.|$|E
500|$|Just {{above the}} rooftops of the Rue de Provence <b>the</b> balloon's gas <b>was</b> exhausted, and <b>the</b> craft struck {{the roof of}} a house.

25|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{as far as}} Schofield's brief {{relationship}} with an England cap was concerned. He returned to his county, and though he was picked for another A tour to the West Indies in 2000–01 things started to fall apart shortly afterwards. In 2001 he took only 14 wickets {{at an average of}} over 54, though 26 wickets at 18.53 in List A cricket were a compensation, and although his average of 18.38 in 2002 looked better it was deceptive: Schofield was bowled only 122 first-class overs in total that summer.|$|R

25|$|The {{investigations}} {{were widely}} {{reported in the}} press, but eventually junta leader Prayut Chan-o-cha intervened: the embezzlement case had already been closed in 2006 by the then Attorney-General and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> it. Prayuth {{was afraid of the}} rising conflicts. He then dissolved the religious committee of the reform council. However, Paiboon, Phra Suwit and Mano continued to address the leading Sangha's shortcomings through judicial means. In the meantime, the DSI investigated further, and it was discovered that a used vintage car in Wat Paknam's museum had not been properly registered, allegedly to evade taxes. Somdet Chuang was charged with tax evasion by the DSI, and the accusations were reason enough for the government to further postpone the appointment. Fear of Phra Suwit Dhiradhammo and his ties to the army may {{have played a role in}} this stalling. In December 2016, the National Legislative Assembly amended the 2005 Monastic Act to allow other monks than Somdet Chuang to be appointed Supreme Patriarch. Finally in February 2017, Somdet Amborn was appointed by King Vajiralongkorn to serve as the next Supreme Patriarch.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, as a {{postgraduate}} student with more time, Frazer finally played first-class cricket for Oxford University. He played {{in most of}} the team matches in the 1924 season, batting mainly in the middle order, but his best score and his only total ever of more than 50 was made as an opening batsman, with 81 in the match against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Eastbourne, a rather weak team composed entirely of amateurs, many of them not in the first flush of youth (Ernest Smith, the captain, was 54 and had played for Oxford University 36 years earlier in 1888). Frazer's timing for a big innings was immaculate: the next Oxford game was the University Match and he duly won a cricket blue to go with his two soccer blues, scoring 5 and 20 in his two innings in a nine-wicket defeat by Cambridge. Frazer played seven further matches for Sussex when the university term was over, without success, and appeared for two amateur teams in first-class matches against Oxford University in 1925, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his first-class cricket career.|$|E
500|$|Hamming {{attempted}} {{to rectify the}} situation with a new text, Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics (1985). In 1993, he remarked that [...] "when I left BTL, I knew that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it's really the end." [...] And so it proved. He became Professor Emeritus in June 1997, and delivered his last lecture in December 1997, {{just a few weeks}} before his death from a heart attack on January 7, 1998. He was survived by his wife Wanda.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> critical role we should play <b>is</b> to assist <b>the</b> Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs.

They would shout back at us and <b>that</b> would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> story.

500|$|Making his Summer Olympic debut, Lamin Tucker {{qualified}} for the Athens Games via winning an event in Freetown. He competed on 21 August in the Men's 100 meters against eight other athletes in the seventh heat. He finished the race in 10.72 [...] seconds, ranking sixth. He ranked ahead of American Samoa's Kelsey Nakanelua (11.25seconds) and behind Canada's Pierre Browne (10.32seconds), in a heat led by Jamaica's Asafa Powell (10.06seconds). Overall, Tucker placed 61st out of the 84 athletes that competed and was 0.38 seconds slower than the slowest athlete that progressed to the next round.

5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{power of the}} Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong conviction that {{the life of a}} Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|R
