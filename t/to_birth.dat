5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|Set {{seventeen}} {{years after the}} events of Silent Hill in which Harry Mason defeats {{the god of the}} town cult and is given a baby girl to care for, Silent Hill 3 focuses on Heather Mason, a teenage girl raised by Harry in Portland. She discovers that the cult plans to use her <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> their god, and becomes caught in a conflict within the cult.|$|E
5|$|Teenage pregnancies, {{especially}} among younger teens, are {{at greater risk}} of adverse outcomes including early birth, low birth weight, and death of the infant. In the United States 82% of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned. Comprehensive sex education and access <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} opponent <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control was the Catholic Church, which mobilized opposition in many venues during the 1920s. Catholics persuaded the Syracuse city council to ban Sanger from {{giving a speech}} in 1924; the National Catholic Welfare Conference lobbied against birth control; the Knights of Columbus boycotted hotels that hosted birth control events; the Catholic police commissioner of Albany prevented Sanger from speaking there; the Catholic mayor of Boston, James Curley, blocked Sanger from speaking in public; and several newsreel companies, succumbing to pressure from Catholics, refused to cover stories related <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control.Chesler, p. 220 (newsreels). The ABCL turned some of the boycotted speaking events to their advantage by inviting the press, and the resultant news coverage often generated public sympathy for their cause. However, Catholic lobbying was particularly effective in the legislative arena, where their arguments– that contraception was unnatural, harmful, and indecent– impeded several initiatives, including an attempt in 1924 by Mary Dennett to overturn federal anti-contraception laws.For a detailed discussion of religious objection <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control, see: Tobin, Kathleen (2001), The American Religious Debate Over Birth Control, 1907–1937, McFarland.|$|E
5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; they also are prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive <b>to</b> <b>birth.</b> When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating in the workforce. Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E

5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to be the cause, avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

The world-creating siblings Izanagi and Izanami first give <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> the Japanese islands (kuniumi) {{and then to the}} gods (kamiumi [...] ) [...]When they had finished giving <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> countries, they began afresh giving <b>birth</b> <b>to</b> Deities.

5|$|Workers first emerge between May and July. During {{this first}} emergence, {{reproductive}} males also emerge with this first brood and {{are called the}} early males. These males provide a great adaptation because they allow {{for the presence of}} reproductive males. Nests with a greater number of early males produce a greater number of workers, cells, pupae, and emergences. Although it is uncertain as to why, queen deaths are common in Polistes exclamans, most frequently in May. The majority of original queens are dead by July, “well before eggs that became autumn reproductive were laid,” as reproductives emerged from late August through September. Thus, queens must remain alive post June in order <b>to</b> <b>birth</b> future reproductives, and if they are not able to do so, the eldest former worker then becomes the new queen. The reproductive early males produced may be adaptive for the deaths of the queens so that the colony will not die and will be able to continue.|$|E
