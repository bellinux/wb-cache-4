50|$|The 9020As and 9020Ds were {{in service}} in North America until 1989 {{when they were}} finally {{replaced}} by IBM 3083 BX1 mainframes as part of <b>the</b> <b>FAA's</b> HOST Computer System (HCS) upgrade. The 3083s in turn were replaced with IBM 9672 RA4 parallel processing servers during <b>the</b> <b>FAA's</b> Host and Oceanic Computer System Replacement (HOCSR) completed in 1999. One reason for the 1999 upgrade was concern, probably unfounded, that the IBM 3083's microcode would not operate properly in the year 2000.

5|$|The first {{portion of}} the book is a {{critique}} of deficiencies in safety practices by the Federal Aviation Administration and United States Department of Transportation, and the inherent problems with the closeness between these agencies and the airline industry. The book is an exposé of what Schiavo saw as fraud, corruption, waste, mismanagement, and dangerous negligence in the aviation industry and <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> as a crusader for flight safety. Her primary criticisms in the book focus on the FAA's reluctance to address its many shortcomings, while expressing her concern that there was a fundamental conflict of interest between <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> job of oversight and <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> job of promoting aviation.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, {{acting on}} a {{recommendation}} made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) during its investigation of Comair 5191, <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> issued a safety notice that reiterated advice to pilots to positively confirm their position before crossing the hold-short line onto the take-off runway, and again when initiating takeoff.

5|$|In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> {{mandates}} {{the taking}} of weather observations at larger airports for safety reasons. To help facilitate the purchase of an automated airport weather station, such as ASOS, <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> allows federal dollars {{to be used for}} the installation of certified weather stations at airports. The airport observations are then transmitted worldwide using the METAR observing code. METAR reports typically come from airports or permanent weather observation stations. Reports are generated once an hour; however, if conditions change significantly, they may be updated in special reports called SPECIs.|$|E
5|$|On October 13, 2006, {{two days}} after the crash, <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> banned all fixed-winged {{aircraft}} from the East River corridor unless in contact with local air traffic control. The new rule, which took effect immediately, required all small aircraft (with the exception of helicopters and certain seaplanes) to seek the approval of and stay in contact with air traffic control while in the corridor. <b>The</b> <b>FAA</b> cited safety concerns, especially unpredictable winds from between buildings, as the reason for the change.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>FAA</b> {{had already}} warned Biman to replace its ageing DC-10s by December 2005. According to experts, these {{aircraft}} were inadequately equipped to safely cross the Atlantic. On 13 May 2006, <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> refused permission for Biman flight BG001 (Dhaka–Brussels–JFK) to enter its airspace, citing safety {{concerns over the}} ailing DC–10 aircraft used on the route. The flight was diverted to Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Canada, where the passengers were provided with alternative airline options to complete their journey. Canadian authorities inspected the aircraft {{and gave it a}} clean bill of health after which the aircraft returned to Dhaka without any passengers. <b>The</b> <b>FAA</b> eventually admitted it was mistaken and apologised for the error.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB report {{included}} {{a total of}} five recommendations for <b>the</b> <b>FAA.</b> These recommendations included: installing recorders for radar displays, installing audio conversation recorders at air traffic control facilities; establishing climb and descent corridors under ATC positive control in the vicinity of air terminals; and establishing more definitive procedures for receiving and handling the emergency transponder code 7700. Additionally, the NTSB strongly recommended that <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> and the Department of Defense cooperate to develop a program, in areas where a large intermix of civil and military traffic exists, to ensure that appropriate graphical depictions of airspace utilization and typical flow patterns are prominently displayed at all airports and operational bases for the benefit of all airspace users.|$|E

5|$|In late 2011, <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> {{assigned}} a common type rating to the 787 and 777, allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models, due to related design features.

5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. <b>The</b> <b>FAA</b> lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how <b>the</b> <b>FAA</b> uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, {{and how the}} agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E
