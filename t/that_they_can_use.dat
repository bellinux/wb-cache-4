5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk {{from one end of}} the game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E

Raoul realizes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> the Phantom's opera to capture him, as he will surely attend. Don Juan Triumphant is performed, and the Phantom makes his entrance (having secretly replaced the lead) with Christine. Raoul can do nothing but watch from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again. However, she once again removes his mask, revealing his deformities to the entire audience, who scream in fear. He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the five}} band members has a unique {{character}} class, which vary from one another mainly by the special magical attacks, called Anar-chi, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use.</b> Anar-chi attacks include Tommy Homicide's ability to summon acid-coated buzzsaws and The Rexecutioner's ability to summon and use a debris-spitting drum kit. Players are able to use new abilities by visiting an in-game tattoo parlor. Tattoos, and the special abilities that they unlock, are character-specific. Players can also unlock new abilities, including additional combination attacks, group attacks, {{and the ability to}} use two weapons at once, by leveling up.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass deduces that {{an alien}} {{life-form}} {{which comes from}} one of the moons of Saturn, which lives on ammonia, hydrogen and methane, but to which oxygen is a deadly poison, travels to earth in the meteorites, and in the few seconds they spend out of their shells before dying they possess human minds, and transmit knowledge to each other in a collective consciousness. From this, they assume that it was the population of Winnderden Flats itself who demolished the village and built the plant. Quatermass decides <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> the remaining Quatermass II rocket like a nuclear bomb and destroy the asteroid, much to Leo's protest at the rocket being unsafe to fly. Fowler tries to steal information about the other plants from the ministry, but is overcome and possessed by a makeshift meteorite hidden inside a filing cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) {{falls in love with}} the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that is heightened when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the release}} of BioShock Infinite, two major pieces of {{downloadable}} content have been released by Irrational. The first piece, titled Clash in the Clouds, was released on July 30, 2013. It is a non-story arena-based combat mode where the player is faced with increasingly difficult waves of enemies on various maps based on in-game settings. The player earns in-game money <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> at a central hub to buy new vigors, upgrade weapons and vigors, and unlock character models, concept art, kinetoscopes, and music. Various challenges {{in the form of}} blue ribbons are given to the player, such as by killing foes with specific weapon and vigor combinations.|$|E

25|$|Character {{classes have}} been present in Final Fantasy since the first title, where players chose a {{character}} class from the outset. Kawazu created this system to give players freedom to customize the party. For Final Fantasy II, jobs were attached to specific characters. Each character class in a Final Fantasy game has unique abilities which develop as the player's level increases. In some titles, the player can assign a character a specific class {{at the start of}} the game, while others allow characters to combine and learn abilities from a number of classes. In addition to other abilities, a character's class usually determines the types of weapons and armor <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|The player {{starts with}} {{a limited number of}} seed pack types and seed pack slots <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> during most levels. The number of slots can be {{increased}} through purchases with in-game money. At the start of a level, the player is shown the various types of zombies to expect and given the opportunity to select which seed packs to take into the level. Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, having a lower sunlight cost, and are ideal for nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogosticks.|$|E
25|$|Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these {{strategies}} of regulating attachment anxiety {{have very different}} consequences. The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave {{in a particular way}} and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.|$|E

25|$|Access network: The {{user can}} {{connect to the}} IP-core of NGN in various ways, most of which use the {{standard}} Internet Protocol (IP). User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, {{even when they are}} roaming in another network or country. The only requirement is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.|$|E
25|$|On Walt's 50th birthday, {{during his}} {{surprise}} party, he watches a news report about Hank's arrest of some methamphetamine drug dealers.

The next day, Walt faints at the car wash and is taken to a hospital; there, he is told he has inoperable lung cancer and will likely die in two years. During the ride-along, Hank busts a crystal meth ring; Walt sees {{one of his former}} students, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), fleeing the scene, and deduces that Jesse is part of the operation. Looking to secure his family's well-being by producing and selling meth, Walt tracks Jesse down and blackmails him into setting up an operation.

25|$|By {{presenting}} such a card, purchasers typically {{earn the}} right either to a discount {{on the current}} purchase, or to an allotment of points <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> for future purchases. Hence the card is the visible means of implementing a type of what economists call a two-part tariff. Application forms for cards usually entail agreements by the store concerning customer privacy, typically non-disclosure (by the store) of non-aggregate data about customers. The store uses aggregate data internally (and sometimes externally) {{as part of its}} marketing research. Over time the data can reveal, for example, a given customer's favorite brand of beer, or whether he or she is a vegetarian. Where a customer has provided sufficient identifying information, the loyalty card may also be used to access such information to expedite verification during receipt of cheques or dispensing medical prescription preparations, or for other membership privileges (e.g., access to a club lounge in airports, using a frequent-flyer card).|$|E
