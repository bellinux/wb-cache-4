5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from <b>the</b> <b>foil</b> material and other fission products by applying acid to <b>the</b> <b>foil</b> and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if <b>the</b> <b>foil</b> is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

The present method is validated by comparing computed results with other numerical and experimental data. The mutual vortex-vortex interaction between the shed vortices from both <b>foils</b> has <b>the</b> effect of changing the pointing direction of mushroom heads. <b>The</b> leading <b>foil’s</b> propulsive characteristics do not change much with the vertical distance between <b>the</b> <b>foils,</b> whereas <b>the</b> following <b>foil’s</b> propulsive characteristics are changed significantly depending on the vertical and horizontal distances between <b>the</b> <b>foils.</b> <b>The</b> overall wake patterns depend mainly on the horizontal distance. The intensity of the mutual interaction between the wake vortices depends on the vertical distance. Thus, the propulsive characteristics of <b>the</b> dual fish-like <b>foils</b> are complicated functions of the vertical and horizontal distances between <b>the</b> <b>foils.</b> <b>The</b> present method has the limitation of potential-low assumption.

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to develop and {{validate}} a common process for separating the active materials from the copper and aluminum foils of post-vehicle-application lithium-ion batteries. Batteries from two different manufacturers were disassembled, and anode and cathode samples were used for recycling testing. The materials tested from a third manufacturer were scraps of coated <b>foils</b> from <b>the</b> manufacturing process {{that had never been}} assembled into cells. The cathodes from each manufacturer were aluminum foils with coatings of differing chemistries. <b>The</b> anode <b>foils</b> from each manufacturer were copper with a carbon coating. The process developed used acid baths to separate the active materials from <b>the</b> <b>foils.</b> To allow for separation of the differing active materials (depending on supplier and battery chemistry) from <b>the</b> <b>foils,</b> <b>the</b> acids were selected to react with the aluminum and copper <b>foils.</b> <b>The</b> processes were stopped once sufficient reaction had occurred so that the coatings no longer adhered to <b>the</b> <b>foils.</b> <b>The</b> optimum recycling condition was identified as the lowest acid concentration, the lowest temperature, and the shortest time required for full separation of the coatings from <b>the</b> <b>foils</b> for all cell chemistries (manufacturers). Full separation of the graphite coating from <b>the</b> copper <b>foils</b> of <b>the</b> anodes was achieved within 35  s by using 0.5 mol/L of H 2 SO 4 (sulfuric acid) at 40  °C. Full separation of the active materials from <b>the</b> aluminum <b>foils</b> of <b>the</b> cathodes was achieved within 83  s by using 2.0 mol/L of HNO 3 (nitric acid) at 70  °C.|$|R

5|$|Small {{pieces of}} gold foil {{featuring}} engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. <b>The</b> <b>foil</b> pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E
5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off <b>the</b> <b>foil</b> after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of cation exchange, at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material. The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and <b>the</b> <b>foil</b> could be replaced.|$|E

40|$|The Interstellar Gas Experiment (IGE) exposed thin {{metallic}} <b>foils</b> aboard <b>the</b> LDEF spacecraft in low Earth orbit {{in order}} to collect neutral interstellar particles which penetrate the solar system due to their motion relative to the sun.

25|$|The {{entire process}} is reconstructed by Brekle as follows: First, the inscription's text was {{engraved}} {{with an iron}} stylus into an even copper or bronze block, with its letters facing the opposite direction and running from right to left. The displaced material rose up {{on both sides of}} the letter grooves forming two sharp, parallel ridges. In the second step, the inscribed side of the stamp block was placed on the plane gold sheet and sufficient pressure, either manually or by hammering onto a plate laid on top, was exerted from above to transmit the text. What produced the print image were the ridges caused by the material displacement; these left shallow double lines in <b>the</b> <b>foil,</b> thus creating the text. The actual, sunken letter lines were not transferred during the imprinting procedure, since they did not enter the surface of <b>the</b> <b>foil.</b>|$|E
25|$|A further {{indication}} {{for the use}} of {{a printing}} technique is the varying strength of the letters, which suggests that the surface of the lamella was not completely flat during printing. Thus, the outline of the letters, as to be expected with a print, appear in the slightly more elevated regions of the sheet (darker areas in the photo), more distinct than in the slightly deeper regions (lighter areas) that were not affected by the full force of the stamp. This can be observed particularly along the folds and in the last line where the edge of <b>the</b> <b>foil</b> was apparently slightly bent downwards while being printed. Consequently, the impressions of the letters appear less marked here. If the text had been directly inscribed with a stylus into <b>the</b> <b>foil,</b> these variations would not have occurred.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{microwaving}} thin metal films {{can be seen}} clearly on a Compact Disc or DVD (particularly the factory pressed type).
