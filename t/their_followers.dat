5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{feared that}} they would be assassinated, and taught <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> that their deaths would be {{similar to those of the}} two {{witnesses}} of the Book of Revelation. Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> that the former's treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proposing that circumcision {{was taken up}} by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Accounts of Pećanac's {{capture and}} death vary. According to one account, Pećanac, {{four of his}} leaders and 40 of <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> were {{captured}} by forces loyal to Mihailović in February 1944. All were killed within days except Pećanac, who remained in custody to write his war memoirs before being executed on 5 May 1944. Another source states he was assassinated on 6 June 1944 by Chetniks loyal to Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|But {{he became}} {{increasingly}} possessed by religious mysticism {{as he fell}} {{under the influence of}} the Polish philosopher Andrzej Towiański, whom he met in 1841. His lectures became a medley of religion and politics, punctuated by controversial attacks on the Catholic Church, and thus brought him under censure by the French government. The messianic element conflicted with Roman Catholic teachings, and some of his works were placed on the Church's list of prohibited books, though both Mickiewicz and Towiański regularly attended Catholic mass and encouraged <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> to do so.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Applewhite and Nettles {{had about}} 80followers, {{many of whom}} held jobs, often working with {{computers}} or as car mechanics. In 1982, Applewhite and Nettles allowed their disciples to call their families. They further relaxed their control in 1983, permitting <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> to visit relatives on Mother's Day. They were only allowed short stays and were instructed to tell their families that they were studying computers at a monastery. These vacations were intended to placate families by demonstrating that the disciples remained with the group of their own accord.|$|E
5|$|Religion plays a {{large part}} in the Forgotten Realms, with deities and <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> being an {{integral}} part of the world. They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshipers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several polytheistic pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.|$|E
5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E

50|$|The marabout-talibe {{relationship}} in Senegal {{is essentially a}} relationship of personal dependence. It can be a charismatic or a clientelistic relationship. In a charismatic relationship demonstrations of devotion and abnegation towards the marabouts can only explained because their talibes see them as intercessors or even intermediaries with god. This charismatic relationship is reinforced and complemented by a parallel clientelistic relationship between marabout and follower. The results is that marabouts are expected to provide certain material benefits to <b>their</b> <b>follower</b> {{in addition to the}} spiritual ones.|$|R
5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, and <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> {{traveled}} northeast to seek refuge {{with the}} Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party {{was seen by}} a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to surrender to the Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, rival regime {{officials}} and <b>their</b> <b>followers,</b> generally {{people of a}} younger generation, had begun to plot against the rule of Gomułka and his associates. Poland's security chief Mieczysław Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger. The party leader in Upper Silesia, Edward Gierek, who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France, also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the nomenklatura. From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the Prague Spring.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

2500|$|Slonim {{was born}} in the Russian Empire's port city of Odessa (now in Ukraine), {{although}} some sources have Novgorod-Severskiy, Chernihiv Governorate. His parents were upper-middle-class Russian Jewish intellectuals; Slonim's uncle was the literary critic Yuly Aykhenvald. The future critic was also a distant relative of Yevsey Lazarevich Slonim, whose daughter, Vera Yevseyevna, became the wife of novelist Vladimir Nabokov. According to Russologist Michel Aucouturier, Slonim's memoirs show him as an erudite and an adept of aestheticism, whose [...] "socialist sympathies" [...] were only cemented by the Russian Revolution. While completing his secondary studies at a classical gymnasium in Odessa, Slonim came into contact with the Socialist Revolutionaries (or [...] "Esers"), and, like his older brother Vladimir before him, became <b>their</b> <b>follower.</b> <b>Their</b> radicalism pitied them against their father, who supported the moderate-liberal Kadet Party.|$|R

5|$|Eusebio Joaquín González {{was born}} on August 14, 1896 in Colotlán, Jalisco. At a young age, he joined the Constitutional Army during the Mexican Revolution. While he was on leave in 1920, he met Elisa Flores, whom he later married. While {{stationed}} {{in the state of}} Coahuila in 1926, he came into contact with Saulo and Silas, two ascetic preachers from the Iglesia Cristiana Espiritual. Their teachings forbade <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> to keep good hygiene and wear regular clothes. After being baptized by the two itinerant preachers, González resigned from the army, and along with his wife became domestic workers to the two preachers.|$|E

He {{threatened}} to kill anyone and <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> who carried out the terms of the treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than going}} to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were {{received}} with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis {{in order to be}} free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had already found a new king in Cleph.|$|E

50|$|Conceptual {{complexity}} {{and levels of}} self-confidence make up a self-other orientation, which analyses the level of openness the individual is to input from others. Higher complexity than self-confidence mean {{more likely to take}} input, showing a concern for others and are successful at seeing the whole picture and dealing with situations on a case-by-case basis. The reverse situation (higher self-confidence) shows a leader who view the world as they wish to perceive it and use coercion to ensure their views become <b>their</b> <b>follower’s</b> views. Low in both is an individual who mirrors the group that elected them and tends to exhibit narcissistic tendencies.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Yogyakarta, Darwis (now played by Lukman Sardi) changes his name to Ahmad Dahlan and begins {{teaching}} Islam, preaching that prayers need only come from inner peace and do not require large donations or sacrifices. Conflict soon arises between Dahlan and the local kyais (religious leaders) after he shows that {{the direction in which}} they pray is wrong, pointing not to the Kaaba in Mecca but to Africa. The kyais, especially Cholil Kamaludiningrat (Slamet Rahardjo), decry Dahlan as the leader of a cult and provoke a crowd of <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> to destroy the building next to Dahlan's house used for studying prayer.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} source for this period in Kentish history is The Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written in 731 by Bede, a Benedictine monk from Northumbria. Bede was primarily {{interested in the}} Christianization of England, but he also provides substantial information about secular history, including the reigns of Æthelberht and Eadbald. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury. A series of related texts known as the Legend of St Mildrith provides additional information about events {{in the lives of}} Eadbald's children and throws some light on Eadbald himself. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a collection of annals assembled in about 890 in the kingdom of Wessex, also provides information. Other sources include papal letters, regnal lists of the kings of Kent, and early charters. Charters were documents drawn up to record grants of land by kings to <b>their</b> <b>followers</b> or to the church, and they provide some of the earliest documentary sources in England. None survive in original form from Eadbald's reign, but some later copies exist.|$|E
5|$|From late 1651, passes {{were needed}} {{to move from one}} area of the country to another. The {{ownership}} of firearms was restricted, necessitating a licence. In the Highlands the administration fell back on the ancient expedient of making clan chiefs responsible for the conduct of <b>their</b> <b>followers.</b> The security of the regime depended on an armed force of never less than 10,000 men. Citadels were built at Ayr, Perth and Leith and 20 smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost of money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped {{from as far away as}} Aberdeen, had cost £50,000 in 1655, when it was still unfinished. Inverlocky had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E

3000|$|..., {{increasing}} {{the depth of}} the tree. This is done recursively, the tree’s growth ends when no other follower shows activity. Passive listeners constitute the set of leaves in the tree. In our scheme, a node can only belong to one cascade (but could participate in it multiple times); the mentioned restriction may introduce measurement biases. Namely, two nodes sharing a follower may show simultaneous activity, but <b>their</b> <b>follower</b> can only be counted in one or the other cascade (with possible consequences regarding cascade size distributions or depth in the diffusion tree). To minimize this degeneration, we perform calculations for many possible cascade configurations, randomizing the way we process data.|$|R
