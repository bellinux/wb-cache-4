5000|$|Marshall {{noted that}} New Mexico {{conceded that the}} tribe had the {{authority}} to regulate hunting and fishing for both tribal and non-tribal members on reservation land, but claimed concurrent jurisdiction over the non-tribal members. Marshall observed that Public Law 280 specifically granted tribes the authority to regulate on-reservation hunting and fishing, and made it a federal crime <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> to hunt or fish without the consent of the tribe. Marshall rejected the state's claim of concurrent jurisdiction, noting that the state could [...] "effectively nullify" [...] tribal authority. Based in large part on the BIA involvement with the tribe in establishing regulations, Marshall held that federal law preempted state law and affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court.|$|E

40|$|At {{the most}} recent {{monetary}} policy meeting in October, I <b>entered</b> <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> against the majority decision. I, like my colleague Karolina Ekholm, instead advocated holding the repo rate unchanged and having a much lower repo rate path that rises steadily {{to a level of}} 2. 7 per cent {{at the end of the}} forecast period. My reason for <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> <b>reservation</b> on this occasion and at earlier monetary policy meetings is because I see several problems with our current monetary policy. In this speech I shall present the problems I currently see in Swedish monetary policy, discuss these problems and describe the motives for my reservation, as well as proposing possible solutions to the problems. An unwarrantedly tight monetary policy According to the Riksbank’s booklet “Monetary policy in Sweden ” (2010 a), and the Sveriges Riksbank Act and its preparatory works, monetary policy shall aim to stabilise inflation around the inflation target and resource utilisation around a normal level. But in practice the Riksbank appears to have conducted a tighter monetary policy than is justified, given our task, over several quarters. The arguments put forward for conducting this policy are tha...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} analyzes how consumers {{decide between}} <b>entering</b> <b>a</b> fixed price, an ascending auction or a BIN auction. We find that such entry decisions depend both on potential payoffs (price aspects) and consumer characteristics (non-price aspects). For values smaller {{than or equal}} to BIN prices, subjects are more likely <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that involves bidding. Conversely, for values greater than BIN prices, subjects are more likely <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism that involves immediate buying. We further find that price aspects mainly play a role for values greater than BIN prices, whereas non-price aspects play a role for values smaller {{than or equal to}} BIN prices. Impatience makes subjects less likely <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>a</b> mechanism involving bidding, whereas sensation seekingness and regret make subjects more likely <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> such <b>a</b> mechanism. Gender also has an impact on entry decisions...|$|R
