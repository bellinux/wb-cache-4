5|$|Hurricane Marie is tied as the seventh-most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} on record, attaining a {{barometric pressure}} of 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg) in August2014. On August10, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa over the Atlantic Ocean. Some organization of shower and thunderstorm activity initially took place, but dry air soon impinged upon <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> imparted weakening. The wave trekked westward across the Atlantic and Caribbean for several days. On August19, an area of low pressure consolidated within the wave west of Central America. With favorable atmospheric conditions, convective activity and banding features increased around <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> by August22, the system acquired enough organization to be classified as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E while situated about 370mi (595km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Development was initially fast-paced, as the depression acquired tropical storm-force winds within sixhours of formation and hurricane-force by August23. However, due to some vertical wind shear its intensification rate stalled, and for a time it remained a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Grace {{originated}} {{from a large}} extratropical cyclone that formed along a cold front on September27, roughly 470mi (755km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Initially attached to an occluded front, the low detached from <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> gradually acquired tropical characteristics. By October1, shower and thunderstorm activity began to develop {{near the center of}} the system as it tracked through the central Azores. However, the following day, convection began to decrease with <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> the National Hurricane Center (NHC) ceased monitoring it. Over the following two days, the system executed a counter-clockwise loop near the Azores. During the afternoon of October4, convection redeveloped around the center of the low and was classified as a tropical storm near São Miguel Island. Although the storm was tropical at this time, the NHC did not issue advisories for several hours.|$|E
