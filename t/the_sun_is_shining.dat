500|$|The video {{starts with}} Carey {{walking in the}} rain to meet Ne-Yo who is waiting {{for her in the}} studio. Clips of Carey singing in desperation in the rain are intercut with footage of her {{recording}} her vocals in the recording booth. For his scenes, Ne-Yo sings as he stands next to as well as plays the piano as Carey reminisces by herself, while other scenes show him in the booth with Carey as they sing their parts together. At the video's climax, both singers are belt the final note in the booth, which is followed by them walking out of the studio where it has stopped raining and <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining.</b> Robbie Daw wrote that the video gave him [...] "chills". He also commented on the use of product placement of Carey's perfume M and her own brand of champagne. Melinda Newman of HitFix thought that the video appeared to have a bigger production budget than that of the video for [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] with Minaj, but noted that it was still [...] "low-key" [...] for a Carey video. Newman further commented that while the singer appears to be wearing albeit little make-up, she looked more natural and [...] "beautiful" [...] than ever. Leonie Cooper thought that the video made the [...] "bland" [...] song more appealing: [...] "the video, with a moist Mariah mithering in the rain, preposterous sequinned gold boots, a puppy in the studio, and shameless pimping of her latest perfume, kind of makes up for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Respondents to {{the survey}} said they mostly found the {{building}} pleasant. They gave its daylighting their highest marks. [...] "I prefer the natural light whenever it is available," [...] one said in comments, [...] "and {{have a tendency to}} turn off the lights in the office when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> in through the atrium glass wall," [...] although two-thirds said they still used task lighting. Three-quarters said they made use of the window blinds to regulate the daylight in their offices. Almost half said their access to it was excellent.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't see the use {{of moving}} tonight, anyway. It {{would be a lot}} easier and pleasanter when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining.</b> This night air makes me so stiff that I know I never will get over it," [...] grumbled Reddy Fox.|$|E

60|$|Pleased {{with the}} simple and {{friendly}} Scala di Ferre, I shoulder my sack and we walk off to the second station. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> hot this afternoon--burning hot, by the sea.

60|$|This last {{sounded very}} profound, {{and a little}} magnificent, to my imagination; and I looked at the girls to note the effect.

60|$|June 20th.--Eight o'clock. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> {{in a clear}} sky. I {{have not}} been near my bed--I have not once closed my weary wakeful eyes.

60|$|The third stepped forward. She was {{beautiful}} and pale and thoughtful. Her hair was yellow, like corn when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> on it; and her dress was green, like the young grass of the spring. She spoke without the animation of the others, mournfully rather than proudly, {{and she looked at}} Amyntas with melancholy eyes.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{beautiful}} morning in Easter week. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> on the gilded weathercock, which flashes every time it veers from south to west; the snowdrops are getting quite out of date, and the buttercups and primroses have it all their own way; the grass is making a start, and getting quite long upon the graves in Friarswood churchyard.|$|E

60|$|Joan Valentine {{was a tall}} {{girl with}} wheat-gold hair and eyes as brightly blue as a November sky when <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> on a frosty world.

6000|$|... "So I think," [...] {{responds}} she; [...] "but, better, I {{should like}} a {{paper with a}} tone of buff,--something that produces warm yellowish reflections, and will almost make you think <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> <b>shining</b> in cold gray weather; {{and then there is}} nothing that lights up so cheerfully in the evening. In short, John, I think the color of a zafferano rose will be just about the shade we want." ...|$|E
