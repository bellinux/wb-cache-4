St Ambrose College Roman Catholic boys' grammar school is in Hale Barns and the village is also home to Ringway golf club.

5|$|With {{the end of}} the Western Roman Empire, domes {{became a}} {{signature}} feature of the church architecture of the surviving Eastern Roman Empire. A transition from timber-roofed basilicas to vaulted churches seems to have occurred between the late 5th century and the 7th century, with early examples in Constantinople, Asia Minor, and Cilicia. The first known domed basilica may have been a church at Meriamlik in southern Turkey, dated to between 471 and 494, although the ruins do not provide a definitive answer. It is possible earlier examples existed in Constantinople, where {{it has been suggested that}} the plan for the Meriamlik church itself was designed, but no domed basilica has been found <b>there</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 6th century.|$|E
5|$|Darin Cortland Ruf (born July 28, 1986) is an American {{professional}} baseball first baseman and outfielder for the Samsung Lions of the KBO League. He {{was born in}} Omaha, Nebraska, and played at Westside High School. Subsequently, he attended Creighton University, and excelled playing baseball <b>there</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia Phillies drafted him in 2009. In the minor leagues, he initially hit for a high batting average, but in 2011 combined that with power numbers {{to become one of}} the Phillies' top prospects. He made his major league debut in September 2012, after having hit 38 home runs to lead the Eastern League. In 2013, he split time between Triple-A and the major league Phillies, and was among the league's top rookies during the season. He was embroiled in a roster battle for a bench spot entering 2014, but hurt his oblique, and landed on the disabled list prior to the season.|$|E

The works grew steadily between 1841 and 1900 but efficient operation was always hampered by the restricted site, and there were several plans to close it and move the facility elsewhere. Nevertheless, between 1852 and 1957 more than 1200 steam locomotives as well as prototype diesel electric and electric locomotives were constructed <b>there,</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> eventual closure of the facility in 1962.|$|E
