50|$|As with Action Man, {{during the}} 60s, G.I. Joe had a wooden {{footlocker}} to store his accessories in. The overall dimensions were {{identical to the}} Action Man item, but the details varied. The metal hinges and clasps were of different manufacture; the hinges {{did not have a}} built in stop to prevent the lid from falling back. The insert tray was of a yellow simulated grain plastic, instead of the white version of Action Man. There are green cords (age-bleached in example) attached to each end of the footlocker for carrying purposes. The lid had a G.I. Joe logo decal, and spaces to write one's name, rank and serial no. The lid had a decal insert that itemised all the Combat Soldier accessories it contained, matching the actual <b>tray</b> <b>layout.</b> In 1969, each figure had its own footlocker; Adventure locker, Astronaut locker, and Aquanaut locker with a new lid cover decal that illustrated two available outfit sets for each line. The insert trays for Aquanaut and Astronaut were different from the mold previously used, allowing for an outfit on the right. The Adventurer tray matched the earlier version. All three had different lid insert decals, as appropriate.|$|E
40|$|Major agronomic and {{economic}} losses {{are caused by}} inaccurate application of nutrients from ground based spreading vehicles. These losses come from both over and under application of fertiliser resulting from such practices as driving at inappropriate bout widths. This work reviewed current spreader testing procedures; compared the performance of international test methodologies and evaluated {{the use of a}} digital image processing program to perform spreader testing. Methods to evaluate field performance were developed; this analysis of field application was used to calculate the economic effect of using precision agricultural technologies in New Zealand dairy farming systems. A matrix of fourteen hundred 0. 5 x 0. 5 m fertiliser collection trays was used to evaluate individual test methodologies. Results indicated that there were major variations in calculated certifiable bout width between different methods and direct comparison should be avoided. <b>Tray</b> <b>layout</b> within Â± 5 m of the centre spread line had the largest effect on calculated bout width whilst methods that incorporated rows of trays in the longitudinal direction were less variable compared to those using a single transverse test. The probability too accurately assign bout widths using different international test methods was analysed, the ACCU Spread (Australia) test method had the highest level of confidence in its bout width calculation followed by the ES (Europe) test method. The ISO(i) (World), ISO(ii) (World) and Spreadmark (NZ) tests were all found to be comparable to one another whilst the ASAE (USA) method had the lowest level of confidence in its bout width calculation because of wide collector tray spacing. A method to extract a wider range of data from spreader tests using a hybrid image processing system was developed. Results indicated that there was a strong relationship between two dimensional particle area and particle mass under laboratory (R 2 = 0. 991) and field (R 2 = 0. 988) conditions. Although transverse spreader tests provided a good indication of machine performance, they did not account for the interaction of the spreader and its operational environment. A method was developed that used the vehicle location during field application and the transverse spread pattern represented as polygons to create field application maps. Initial results showed large variations compared to the measured transverse spread pattern. A wider study over 102 paddocks on four dairy farms showed that average variation was 37. 9 %. An improvement to the field application method discussed is given; this tool used the geographical position, heading angle and a series of static spread pattern tests from the spreading vehicle to achieve greater accuracy in field measurements. The described field application methods were used to assess the ability to execute a nutrient plan using both actual and optimised spreading data collected during field application. A loss of $ 66. 18 ha- 1 was calculated when comparing the efficiency of using current spreading methods to those assumed in nutrient budgeting practice. If a guidance and control system were used correctly to provide optimised field application the loss could be reduced to $ 46. 41 ha- 1. This work highlighted the difficulties in achieving accurate field nutrient application; however, by developing the ability to quantify field performance, economic opportunities could be evaluated. Overall, this work found that there was a strong agronomic {{and economic}} case for the implementation of precision agricultural technologies in the New Zealand fertiliser industry. However, the current range of equipment used by the spreading industry would have difficulty in delivering these benefits...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} of CFD analysis and the {{description of}} mixture gas flow in the atmospheric column {{are listed in the}} report. This article builds on previous work [1]. There were calculated two cases with original distributor and with GT-OPTIFLOW distributor, see [1]. This article adds next two cases. The case with adjusted GT-OPTIFLOW distributor (enclosure 1) and adjusted GT-OPTIFLOW distributor with newly designed the chimney <b>tray</b> and new <b>layout</b> of the packing bed (enclosure 2). The flow area of the newly designed chimney tray is smaller than for previous design (5, 36 m 2 vs. 6, 89 m 2). New layout of the packing bed has smaller flow area (28, 27 m 2 vs. 29, 35 m 2) and higher pressure drop (129 Pa vs. 80 Pa) in comparison with last design of the packing bed also used in [1]...|$|R
