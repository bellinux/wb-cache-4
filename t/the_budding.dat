5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by <b>the</b> <b>budding</b> of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E
5|$|In colonial corals, growth {{results from}} <b>the</b> <b>budding</b> of new polyps. There {{are two types}} of budding, intratentacular and extratentacular. In intratentacular budding, a new polyp {{develops}} on the oral disc, inside the ring of tentacles. This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E

5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In <b>the</b> <b>budding</b> yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, lack of {{popularity}} with {{the fans and}} a fall out with Lorenzo Sanz resulted in Capello being sacked, and Vicente del Bosque eventually taking over in November of that year.

In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the European Cup/Champions League for the eight time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundTo {{function}} in diverse cellular processes, the dynamic behavior of microtubules (MTs) must be differentially regulated within <b>the</b> cell. In <b>budding</b> yeast, <b>the</b> spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) inhibits mitotic exit {{in response to}} mispositioned spindles. To maintain SPOC-mediated anaphase arrest, astral MTs must maintain persistent interactions with and/or extend through <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> neck. However, <b>the</b> molecular mechanisms that ensure the stability of these interactions are not known. ResultsThe presence of an MT extending through and/or interacting with <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> neck is maintained by spatial control of catastrophe and rescue, which extends MT lifetime > 25 -fold and controls the length of dynamic MTs within <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> compartment. Moreover, <b>the</b> single kinesin- 8 motor Kip 3 alternately mediates both catastrophe and rescue of <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> MT. Kip 3 accumulates in a length-dependent manner along the lattice of MTs within <b>the</b> <b>bud,</b> yet induces catastrophe spatially near <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> tip. Rather, this accumulation of Kip 3 facilitates its association with depolymerizing MT plus ends, where Kip 3 promotes rescue before MTs exit <b>the</b> <b>bud.</b> MT rescue within <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> requires <b>the</b> tail domain of Kip 3, whereas the motor domain mediates catastrophe at <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> tip. In vitro, Kip 3 exerts both stabilizing and destabilizing effects on reconstituted yeast MTs. ConclusionsThe kinesin- 8 Kip 3 is a multifunctional regulator that differentially stabilizes and destabilizes specific MTs. Control over MT catastrophe and rescue by Kip 3 defines the length and lifetime of MTs within <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> compartment of cells with mispositioned spindles. This subcellular regulation of MT dynamics is critical to maintaining mitotic arrest in response to mispositioned spindles...|$|R

They reigned for three centuries, some noted monarchs being Richard I, Edward I, Edward III and Henry V. The period saw changes in trade and legislation, including {{the signing of the}} Magna Carta, an English legal charter used to limit the sovereign's powers by law and protect the privileges of freemen. Catholic monasticism flourished, providing philosophers, and the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were founded with royal patronage. The Principality of Wales became a Plantagenet fief during the 13th century and the Lordship of Ireland was given to the English monarchy by the Pope.|$|E
5|$|Upon graduating, Harding had stints as {{a teacher}} and as an {{insurance}} man, and made a brief attempt at studying law. He then raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase a failing newspaper, The Marion Star, weakest of the growing city's three papers, and its only daily. The 18-year-old Harding used the railroad pass that came with the paper to attend the 1884 Republican National Convention, where he hobnobbed with better-known journalists and supported the presidential nominee, former Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Harding returned from Chicago to find that the paper had been reclaimed by the sheriff. During the election campaign, Harding worked for the Marion Democratic Mirror and was annoyed at having to praise the Democratic presidential nominee, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the election.

5|$|Friedrich {{began his}} formal study {{of art in}} 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city, at which the art {{department}} is now named Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, who taught that nature was a revelation of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich {{to the work of}} the German 17th-century artist Adam Elsheimer, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen, where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life. Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallery's collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen and the landscape painter Jens Juel. These artists were inspired by the Sturm und Drang movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of <b>the</b> <b>budding</b> Romantic aesthetic and the waning neo-classical ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda, the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology.|$|E

5|$|The {{tendency}} to portray animals as having human traits was not new; Aesop's moralistic animal tales were still popular with {{readers of the}} day, and inspired such works as Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics. Anna Sewell's Black Beauty, for example, {{told the story of}} a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against animal cruelty. <b>The</b> <b>budding</b> animal welfare movement helped establish a climate for wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them in a positive light. One popular nature writer of the day, Mabel Osgood Wright, told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.|$|E
