5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue and Cry (1947), Against the Wind (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) and her husband, {{state senator}} Robert (Jack Coleman), welcome their new baby, also named Phillip. Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Gabe all visit Angela at the hospital. According to Angela, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> prematurely, {{but due to}} the size, Oscar deduces that Angela lied about the date of conception. Angela admits that the baby was {{conceived}} a month before her wedding, and makes them promise not to tell anyone. Suspecting that Dwight is the real father, Oscar breaks his promise and tells him when he arrives at the hospital in search of Gabe. Dwight barges in on Angela and her husband and begins thoroughly examining the child. When the senator leaves, Dwight confronts Angela about the child, claiming that it is his. She refutes his claim, but Dwight leaves satisfied, telling the attending nurse to call off the baby's circumcision, which the nonplussed nurse refuses to do. Upon returning to Dunder Mifflin he drops his dispute with Jim, since his self-assumed fatherhood has given him a new appreciation for the duties of parenthood. The episode ends with Dwight putting a decal on his car, {{in honor of his}} covert new family member.|$|E

25|$|As {{they were}} getting ready to move Mrs. White learned she was pregnant, and as the early months were {{difficult}} for her it was decided that she would remain in Newark until after <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born.</b> In September White moved to New York with his two sons and his widowed mother, who cared for the boys until their mother arrived. Their third son, Clarence Hudson White, Jr., was born in January, 1907. Due to the difficulty of the pregnancy Mrs. White remained in Newark until June of that year.|$|E
25|$|However, the Records of the Grand Historian {{also claimed}} that the first emperor was not the actual son of Prince Yiren but that of Lü Buwei. According to this account, when Lü Buwei {{introduced}} the dancing girl to the prince, she was Lü Buwei's concubine and had already become pregnant by him, and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> after an unusually long period of pregnancy.

5000|$|While {{locked in}} the chapel, Hannah's labour begins.

500|$|Fegelein's {{wife was}} {{then in the}} late stages of {{pregnancy}} (<b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born</b> in early May). Hitler considered releasing him without punishment or assigning him to Mohnke's troops. Junge—an eye-witness to bunker events—stated that Braun pleaded with Hitler to spare her brother-in-law and tried to justify Fegelein's actions. He {{was taken to the}} garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April, and was [...] "shot like a dog". Rochus Misch, who was the last survivor from the Führerbunker, disputed aspects of this account in a 2007 interview with Der Spiegel. According to Misch, Hitler did not order Fegelein's execution, only his demotion. Misch claimed to know the identity of Fegelein's killer, but refused to reveal his name.|$|E
500|$|When Cotton left England, Anne Hutchinson {{described}} it as a [...] "great trouble unto her," [...] and said that she [...] "could not be at rest" [...] until she followed her minister to New England. [...] Hutchinson believed that the Spirit instructed her to follow Cotton to America, [...] "impressed by the evidence of divine providence". [...] She was well into her 14th pregnancy, however, so she did not travel until after <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born.</b> [...] With the intention of soon going to New England, the Hutchinsons allowed their oldest son Edward to sail with Cotton before the remainder of the family made the voyage. [...] In 1634, 43-year-old Anne Hutchinson set sail from England with her 48-year-old husband William and their other ten surviving children, aged about eight months to 19 years. They sailed aboard the Griffin, the same ship that had carried Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier.|$|E

The king had already sired two daughters—a nameless princess {{stillborn}} in 1620, and then the first princess Christina, who {{was born in}} 1623 and died the following year. Excited expectation surrounded Maria Eleonora's third pregnancy in 1626. When <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> it was first thought to be a boy as it was [...] "hairy" [...] and screamed [...] "with a strong, hoarse voice."

When logistical difficulties convinced Oppenheimer to abandon this plan, he advised Desi that as head writer, he would have Lucy Ricardo give birth to a boy. Desi agreed, telling Oppenheimer that Lucy had given him one girl, and might give him another—this might be his only chance to get a son.
