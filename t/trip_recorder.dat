5000|$|The Twingo I {{electronic}} centrally-mounted {{instrument panel}} had a speedometer, fuel gauge, clock, odometer and <b>trip</b> <b>recorder</b> controlled via a stalk-located button. A strip of warning lights was located behind the steering wheel. The rear seat featured a sliding mechanism to enable either increased boot space or rear seat legroom. The boot parcel shelf {{was attached to}} the inside of the tailgate and lifted with the tailgate [...] - [...] or could clip back against the rear window when not required.|$|E
50|$|Instruments {{included}} a speedometer and <b>trip</b> <b>recorder.</b> To reduce noise and vibration, {{the engine was}} rubber mounted, and the pressed steel frame was lined with soundproofing felt. The water-cooled engine was well silenced, and riders reported that sometimes they only knew the engine was running by checking the ignition light. Carrying capacity was boosted by quickly detachable panniers and a glove compartment {{in front of the}} petrol tank. All this made the MkI LE expensive, however, at £126 compared with the BSA Bantam at £76. The odd looks also meant that it did not appeal to the usual motorcycle buyer.|$|E
40|$|This study {{offers a}} {{definition}} of incorporating a maximum speed clause into insurance terms and conditions. This is defined further in terms of scope, effectiveness, and feasibility in relation to current legislation and existing insurance terms and conditions. The consequences for the liability of various groups of insured parties are also more closely studied. It was concluded that there are numerous reasons why the practical application of the envisaged means would not be feasible at present. In addition, alternatives for influencing speeding behaviour are offered. An example is the 'black box' application in vehicles. Two types of this electronic apparatus are: (1) the accident reconstruction recorder; and (2) the journey data or <b>trip</b> <b>recorder...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fuel oil is {{generally}} {{used as an}} energy source. The most absorbing sector is transportation, especially road transport. Meanwhile road transport also produce huge amount of pollutant like CO 2 which is lead to global warming. Smart Driving is a program to decrease fuel consumption with easy, safe, and comfort method. It is aim to change driving behavior of driver so they can drive at the optimum use of fuel and saving nature together. One way is using high gear position and controlling in vehicle speed. 	The experiment test runs to find the correlation between speed and gear position with fuel consumption and emission levels. It was taking placed at Efficiency and Energy Conservation Laboratory, Mechanical Engineering of Diponegoro University. This experiment using a Honda CRV and Toyota Limo as objects, and dynamometer to measure power. The other instruments is gas analyzer and engine scanner which using to a few parameters such as engine speed, vehicle speed, fuel consumption, etc. Both can be connecting to computer {{so we can see}} the parameters at real time or playback. The other experiment is road test, in this test we carried the car on the road to see the actual condition and we using additional tool like GPS <b>trip</b> <b>recorder</b> to find out the actual condition of road, where they straight, curved, or incline. 	The results showed that correlation between vehicle speed on fuel consumption and CO 2 level is parabolic with cubic equation at the both cars for every gear. If we ignore gears position it has high error value, until 50...|$|E
