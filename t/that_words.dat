5|$|In {{order to}} build their vocabularies, infants must learn about the {{meanings}} <b>that</b> <b>words</b> carry. The mapping problem asks how infants correctly learn to attach words to referents. Constraints theories, domain-general views, social-pragmatic accounts, and an emergentist coalition model have been proposed {{to account for the}} mapping problem...|$|E
5|$|In word learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world <b>that</b> <b>words</b> could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E
5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement <b>that</b> <b>words</b> exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E

5|$|Writing systems {{represent}} language using visual symbols, {{which may}} or may not correspond to the sounds of spoken language. The Latin alphabet (and those on which it is based or that have been derived from it) was originally based on the representation of single sounds, so <b>that</b> <b>words</b> were constructed from letters that generally denote a single consonant or vowel in the structure of the word. In syllabic scripts, such as the Inuktitut syllabary, each sign represents a whole syllable. In logographic scripts, each sign represents an entire word, and will generally bear no relation to the sound of that word in spoken language.|$|E

6000|$|... 3. And, more particularly, {{this word}} strive is {{expressed}} by several other terms; as, (1.) It is expressed by <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> [...] "So run that ye may obtain." [...] (1 Cor 9:24,25) (2.) It is expressed by <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> [...] "Fight {{the good fight}} of faith, lay hold on eternal life." [...] (1 Tim 6:12) (3.) It is expressed by <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> [...] "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life." [...] (John 6:27) (4.) It is expressed by <b>that</b> <b>word,</b> [...] "We wrestle--with principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world." [...] (Eph 6:12) Therefore, when he saith, Strive, it is as much as to say, Run for heaven, Fight for heaven, Labour for heaven, Wrestle for heaven, or you are like to go without it.|$|R

25|$|Some factions argue <b>that</b> <b>words</b> {{in these}} spoken tongues should simply be written {{the way they}} are pronounced, while others insist that the purity of {{language}} demands that the transformation remain visible when the words are imparted to paper.|$|E
25|$|When a given word {{class is}} subject to {{inflection}} in a particular language, there are generally one or more standard patterns of inflection (the paradigms described below) <b>that</b> <b>words</b> in that class may follow. Words which follow such a standard pattern {{are said to be}} regular; those that inflect differently are called irregular.|$|E
25|$|In both dialects, phonological elision {{often takes}} place in colloquial speech and writing and orthographic rules take these contractions into account. The orthographic rules of Papiamentu in {{particular}} discourage the use of contractions, recommending <b>that</b> <b>words</b> be spelt out in full as much as possible. The most common contractions involve the words ta (to be), pa (to, for), di (of), no (no, not) and e (him/her/it, the).|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>words</b> like {{unpleasant}} and grating {{are often used}} to explain the sound of dissonance, all music with a harmonic or tonal basiseven music perceived as generally harmoniousincorporates some degree of dissonance. The buildup and release of tension (dissonance and resolution), which can occur on every level from the subtle to the crass, is partially responsible for what listeners perceive as beauty, emotion, and expressiveness in music.|$|E
25|$|These {{groups are}} treated equally. Interslavic {{vocabulary}} has been compiled in such way <b>that</b> <b>words</b> are understandable {{to a maximum}} number of Slavic speakers. The form in which a chosen word is adopted depends not only on its frequency in the modern Slavic languages, {{but also on the}} inner logic of Interslavic, as well as its form in Proto-Slavic: to ensure coherence, a system of regular derivation is applied.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the componential model, {{construction}} grammar {{denies any}} strict {{distinction between the}} two and proposes a syntax-lexicon continuum. The argument goes <b>that</b> <b>words</b> and complex constructions are both pairs of form and meaning and differ only in internal symbolic complexity. Instead of being discrete modules and thus subject to very different processes they form the extremes of a continuum (from regular to idiosyncratic): syntax>subcategorization frame>idiom>morphology>syntactic category>word/lexicon (these are the traditional terms; construction grammars use a different terminology).|$|E

25|$|Information from {{religious}} sources {{is limited by}} a system of traditional restrictions on what they could describe and depict. The murder of the god Osiris, for instance, is never explicitly described in Egyptian writings. The Egyptians believed <b>that</b> <b>words</b> and images could affect reality, so they avoided the risk of making such negative events real. The conventions of Egyptian art were also poorly suited for portraying whole narratives, so most myth-related artwork consists of sparse individual scenes.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} this theory, the {{emergence}} of speech becomes theoretically impossible. Communication of this kind just cannot evolve. The problem is <b>that</b> <b>words</b> are cheap. Nothing about their acoustic features can reassure listeners that they are genuine and not fakes. Any strategy of reliance on someone else's tongue— perhaps the most flexible organ in the body— presupposes unprecedented levels of honesty and trust. To date, Darwinian thinkers have {{found it difficult to}} explain the requisite levels of community-wide cooperation and trust.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian, {{like its}} distant {{relative}} Finnish, {{has the same}} system of front, back, and intermediate (neutral) vowels but {{is more complex than}} the one in Finnish, and some vowel harmony processes. The basic rule is <b>that</b> <b>words</b> including at least one back vowel get back vowel suffixes (karba – in(to) the arm), while words excluding back vowels get front vowel suffixes (kézbe – in(to) the hand). One vowel words including only the neutral vowels i, í or é are unpredictable (not in case of e which surely gets front vowel suffix).|$|E
