40|$|The <b>flux</b> <b>trapping</b> {{that occurs}} {{in the process of}} cooling down of the superconducting cavity is studied. The {{critical}} fields B_c 2 and B_c 1 depend on a position when a material temperature is not uniform. In a region with T≃ T_c, B_c 2 and B_c 1 are strongly suppressed and can be smaller than the ambient magnetic field, B_a. A region with B_c 2 B_a is in the Meissner state. As a material is cooled down, these three domains including the vortex state domain sweep and pass through the material. In this process, vortices contained in the vortex state domain are trapped by pinning centers distributing in the material. A number of <b>trapped</b> <b>fluxes</b> can be evaluated by using the analogy with the beam-target collision event, where beams and a target correspond to pinning centers and the vortex state domain, respectively. We find a number of <b>trapped</b> <b>fluxes</b> and thus the residual resistance are proportional to the ambient magnetic field and the inverse of the temperature gradient. The obtained formula for the residual resistance is consistent with experimental results. The present model focuses on what happens at the phase transition fronts during a cooling down, reveals why and how the residual resistance depends on the temperature gradient, and naturally explains how the fast cooling works.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is developed {{for the assessment of}} low altitude <b>trapped</b> proton <b>fluxes</b> for future space missions. Low altitude fluxes are dependent on solar activity levels due to the resulting heating and cooling of the upper atmosphere. However, solar activity levels cannot be accurately predicted far enough into the future to accommodate typical spacecraft mission planning. Thus, the approach suggested here is to evaluate the <b>trapped</b> proton <b>flux</b> as a function of confidence level for a given mission time period. This is possible because of a recent advance in trapped proton modeling that uses the solar 10. 7 cm radio flux, a measure of solar cycle activity, to calculate <b>trapped</b> proton <b>fluxes</b> as a continuous function of time throughout the solar cycle. This trapped proton model is combined with a new statistical description of the 10. 7 cm flux to obtain the probabilistic model for low altitude <b>trapped</b> proton <b>fluxes.</b> Results for proton energies ranging from 1. 5 to 81. 3 MeV are examined as a function of time throughout solar cycle 22 for various orbits. For altitudes below 1000 km, fluxes are significantly higher and energy spectra are significantly harder than those predicted by the AP 8 model...|$|R

The {{potential}} {{application of}} bulk high temperature superconductor (HTS) magnets has {{attracted much attention}} {{because of the potential}} high <b>trapped</b> <b>flux</b> in HTS magnets. This paper focuses on the magnetization method design of bulk multi-seeded HTS magnets for obtaining their better flux-trapping performance. Firstly, three different magnetization methods were carried out based on the current experimental setup to find a better way of magnetizing a bulk melt-texture three-seeded YBaCuO superconductor. The experimental results indicated that when the three domains of this three-seeded YBaCuO bulk were magnetized in order, the maximum <b>trapped</b> <b>flux</b> was higher than that when only one domain was magnetized. However, this method costs about three times of the magnetization time than the other two methods and the increasing ratio was only about 11. 11 %. It has been found that another method of magnetizing only the middle domain could also get a good result such as the uniformity of <b>trapped</b> <b>flux</b> is good. In order to improve the current experimental magnetization conditions for further improvement, two sheets of iron were designed to attach two poles of the electromagnet (Lakeshore, Model EM 4 -CV) for increasing the magnetizing area, and that all domains of a bulk multi-seeded HTS can be magnetized in one time.

This model reproduces most of the observed interannual variability in phytoplankton production and generates seasonal Trichodesmium biomass and N 2 -fixation cycles similar to those observed at BATS.
