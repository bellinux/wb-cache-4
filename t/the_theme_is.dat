5|$|In January 2016, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah {{started to}} use a {{modified}} version of the show's previous theme, composed by Timbaland and King Logan. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> a remix of the old theme with the addition of rock.|$|E
5|$|The first romance, in A major, has as {{an opening}} theme an {{uncomplicated}} melody with Mendelssohnian syncopations. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> presented {{first in the}} higher {{and then in the}} middle register, before flowing evenly to its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The section {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} social behaviour in different taxa. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> that evolution is progressive, with four pinnacles of social evolution, namely the colonial invertebrates such as corals, the social insects, mammals other than humans, and finally humans. The last chapter argues that natural selection has made humans far more flexible in social organisation than any other species.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> 2005 {{exhibition}} <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Printmaking and the multiple". In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> [...] "From Life." [...] In 2008, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Man Made". <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> for 2010 <b>was</b> [...] "Raw". In 2011, {{the selection}} committee {{agreed to have}} no specific theme.|$|R
2500|$|Six {{pieces of}} <b>theme</b> music <b>are</b> {{used for the}} series: three opening and three ending themes. For episodes 1–25, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by mihimaru GT while <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by Golden Bomber. For episode 26–49, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by Kanan while <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by DaizyStripper.

50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>theme</b> song <b>was</b> called Tunteisiin {{and performed}} by Anna Hanski but in 2001, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> {{changed to a}} version performed by Jore Marjaranta. In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> song <b>was</b> replaced by an electronic version of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> music. In 2014, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> song <b>was</b> switched {{back to the original}} one, first heard on 1999.|$|R
5|$|The orchestral exposition, 99 {{measures}} long, presents {{two groups}} of thematic material, one primary and one secondary, both in the tonic of C minor. The orchestra opens the principal theme in unison, but not powerfully: the dynamic marking is piano. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> tonally ambiguous, not asserting the home key of C minor until its final cadence in the thirteenth measure. It is also highly chromatic: in its 13 measures it utilises all 12 notes of the chromatic scale.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> art as a subject, but rather than reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year the}} event has a theme, and {{includes}} a cocktail hour and a formal dinner. During the cocktail hour, guests arrive {{to walk on the}} red carpet, tour the year's special themed exhibition, and be seated before the dinner party that includes entertainment from the preeminent entertainers of the day. The theme not only sets the tone for the annual exhibit, but also for the guests who attempt to dress to uphold the theme of the year, oftentimes causing runs on certain fashion themes among the world's leading fashion retailers. Sometimes, such as in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> a bit befuddling because it does not provide a clear stylistic directive, while at other times, such as 2014 the theme may be far more challenging to one gender than the other.|$|E
5000|$|Hughes Hall holds a May Ball each year, {{often with}} a global or {{international}} <b>theme.</b> In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Around <b>the</b> World in 12 Hours", and in 2014 <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> [...] "Terra do Brasil".|$|R
50|$|Initially Eric Clapton and Vic Flick {{were asked}} to write and perform <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> song to Licence to Kill. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> {{said to have been}} a new version based on <b>the</b> James Bond <b>Theme.</b> <b>The</b> guitar riff heard in the {{original}} recording of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> played by Flick.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first season}} uses {{two pieces of}} theme music: one opening theme and one ending <b>theme.</b> <b>The</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by Ultra-Prism with Hisako Kanemoto and <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by Kanae Itō. For the second season, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "High Powered" [...] by Sphere, and <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by Kanemoto. For the OVAs, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by Ultra-Prism, <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> for <b>the</b> first two OVAs is [...] by Itō, and <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> for <b>the</b> third OVA is [...] by Itō.|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} renewal, Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons seventh season {{originally}} {{aired on}} the Fox network between September 17, 1995 and May 19, 1996. The show runners {{for the seventh}} production season were Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein who would executive produce 21 episodes this season. David Mirkin executive produced the remaining four, including two hold overs that were produced for the previous season. The season was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Animated Program and won an Annie Award for Best Animated Television Program. The DVD box set was released in Region 1 December 13, 2005, Region 2 January 30, 2006 and Region 4 on March 22, 2006. The set was released in two different forms: a Marge-shaped box and also a standard rectangular-shaped box in which <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> a movie premiere.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> tune <b>was</b> by Inspiral Carpets: a rewrite {{of their}} single [...] "Find Out Why". An early edition had {{a feature of}} how <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> recorded.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} season, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Crowds" [...] by White Ash whilst <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Innocent Note" [...] by Maaya Uchida. For the second season, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "insight" [...] by White Ash whilst <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "60 Oku no Tsubasa" [...] (6 Billion Wings) by Angry Frog Rebirth.|$|R
50|$|All <b>the</b> <b>themes</b> <b>are</b> 8 {{measures}} long.|$|R
5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in seven movements, framed as the earlier chorale cantatas by a chorale fantasia and a chorale four-part setting, {{of the first}} and the twelfth stanza in the original words by the reformer Speratus, published in the First Lutheran hymnal. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> salvation from sin by God's grace alone. An anonymous librettist paraphrased the content of ten inner stanzas to alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for a chamber ensemble of four vocal parts, flauto traverso, oboe d'amore, strings and continuo. He gave all three recitatives to the bass, like a sermon interrupted in reflection by a tenor aria with solo violin and a duet of soprano and alto with the wind instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{engravings}} are mirror {{images of}} the paintings (since the engraved plates are copied from the paintings the image is reversed when printed), which leads to problems ascertaining the times shown on the clocks {{in some of the}} scenes. The images are sometimes seen as parodies of middle class life in London at the time, but the moral judgements are not as harsh as in some of Hogarth's other works and the lower classes do not escape ridicule either. Often <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> one of over-orderliness versus chaos. The four plates depict four times of day, but they also move through the seasons: Morning is set in winter, Noon in spring, and Evening in summer. However, Night—sometimes misidentified as being in September—takes place on Oak Apple Day in May rather than in the autumn.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> {{used in the}} 1983 {{video game}} Snake Pit.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> only {{released}} in USA.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> song <b>is</b> {{used in the}} Action Pack opening sequence, sponsorships, as well as {{the full}} version of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> used in promos for the TV movies. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} by Velton Ray Bunch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music for}} the series, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> <b>was</b> written and composed by Scottish folk musician Phil Cunningham. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> tune <b>is</b> a composition entitled [...] "Manus Lunny's Terracotta Plower Pop".|$|R
25|$|Small {{groups are}} given guided tours. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> basic {{concepts}} of ecology and biodiversity of the Uruguay River Forest.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> {{followed}} by 14 variations. The variations {{spring from the}} theme's melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, and the extended fourteenth variation forms a grand finale.|$|E
25|$|Elgar's {{personal}} {{identification with}} <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> evidenced by {{his use of}} its opening phrase (which matches the rhythm and inflection of his name) as a signature in letters to friends.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{features}} two {{opening and}} ending <b>themes.</b> For <b>the</b> first eleven episodes, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Abnormalize" [...] by Ling Tosite Sigure whilst <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] by Egoist. For episode 12 onwards, <b>the</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Out of Control" [...] by Nothing's Carved in Stone whilst <b>the</b> ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "All Alone With You" [...] by Egoist.|$|R
50|$|Mid-1980s—A big-band {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> used.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>theme</b> song <b>was</b> {{composed}} by Alan Thicke. Original recordings of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>were</b> presumed {{to have been}} lost until 2012, when they were discovered by the Museum of Television Production Music.|$|R
25|$|Fast food outlets {{have been}} banned from the {{development}} as <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> 'aspirational but accessible', trying to avoid it being seen as a shopping centre but more like Covent Garden.|$|E
25|$|While Seneca's {{doctrine}} {{appears to}} be close to the doctrine of Athenodorus's De Tranquillitate it is basically different. In De Otio 3.5 Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in De Tranquillitate <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> peace of mind.|$|E
25|$|Scattered {{all over}} England, {{sometimes}} in remote churches, is similar {{evidence of the}} designs, motifs and techniques used in the past. Two churches, St Neot's in Cornwall and Fairford in Gloucestershire, are of particular interest. Fairford escaped the depredations of the Puritan era and, uniquely in England, retained its complete medieval cycle of glass. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> that of the east window of York, the Salvation of Mankind, {{but in this case}} <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> spread across all the windows of the church, large and small. The west window, of seven lights, shows a single narrative incident, the Last Judgment. This scheme and these particular windows provided a rare source for the designers of narrative windows for parish churches.|$|E
50|$|Despite its name, {{the capital}} of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> not Nicopolis, {{which at the time}} lay in ruins either due to the Slavic invasions or due to Arab raids, but Naupaktos. <b>The</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> {{regularly}} divided into tourmai, each under its own tourmarches. In addition, as <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> a major base for Byzantine operations across the Adriatic into southern Italy, and hosted a contingent of Mardaites marines, probably under their own katepano. Warren Treadgold conjecturally estimates its military strength at some 1,000 infantry and marines in the 9th-10th centuries.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> opening <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> Kodō＊Ambitious (Kodō＊Anbishasu) by B-Project while <b>the</b> first ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> Hoshi to Tsuki no Sentence (星と月のセンテンス) by Kitakore. <b>The</b> second ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> [...] "STARLIGHT" [...] by THRIVE. <b>The</b> third ending <b>theme</b> <b>is</b> Yume Miru Power (夢見るPOWER) by MooNs.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> show's opening <b>theme</b> music <b>was</b> {{composed}} by Ben Vaughn, {{and for the}} first three seasons, it was originally a 1950s-style rock-and-roll instrumental piece; <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> extended slightly in season three, when Simbi Khali, Elmarie Wendel, and Wayne Knight were officially made series regulars and added to the opening credits. There is only one alternate version of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> used during <b>the</b> course of the show's run. For Christmas episodes, jingle bells <b>were</b> added to <b>the</b> <b>theme.</b> For <b>the</b> sixth and final season, a modern jazz underline version of <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> used during that season. The only major change to <b>the</b> <b>theme</b> <b>was</b> in season four through five, when the original Ben Vaughn version was replaced by a big band cover of <b>the</b> <b>theme,</b> performed by <b>the</b> group Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and was only used during that season. During season one, James Earl Jones provided a voice introduction describing the crew.|$|R
