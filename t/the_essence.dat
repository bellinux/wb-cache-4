5|$|Sarah Siddons {{starred in}} John Philip Kemble's 1794 {{production}} at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and offered a psychologically intricate portrait of Lady Macbeth {{in the tradition of}} Hannah Pritchard.

Siddons and Kemble furthered the view established by Pritchard and Garrick that character was <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of Shakespearean drama.|$|E
5|$|Sculptural {{fragments}} to Rodin were autonomous works, and {{he considered}} them <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of his artistic statement.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the Ethics of Baruch Spinoza through {{three of the}} most important concepts presented in <b>the</b> work: <b>essence,</b> knowledge, and blessedness. By thoroughly exploring and reexamining these concepts and the role they play in Spinoza’s ethical project, it becomes clear that it is knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>essences</b> of singular things that is key to the life of blessedness. This exploration is approached from a perspective that intends to unify the metaphysical, epistemological and moral projects presented in the Ethics. This paper will argue that knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>essences</b> of singular things involves the relations of finite modes, both insofar as they actually exist and insofar as they exist sub specie aeternitatis. Therefore, it is not merely reason and adequate knowledge of eternity that lead the philosopher to blessedness, but knowledge of finite modes and their relations to one another that constitutes knowledge of the third kind, viz. scientia intuitiva, the highest good of the Mind...|$|R
5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that he is speaking with the attributes of God.|$|E

5000|$|The Ein Sof (literally: [...] "Without End"/Limitless/Infinite) is the Kabbalistic {{term for}} <b>the</b> Divine <b>essence.</b> Kabbalah {{describes}} 10 Sephirot (The 10 Divine emanations or attributes), that reveal the unknowable Godhead to the creations and channel the creative life-force to {{all levels of}} existence. However, these 10 attributes of God do not represent <b>the</b> Divine <b>essence.</b> <b>The</b> Kabbalists differentiated between the manifestations of God (forms of [...] "light"), and their origin in <b>the</b> Divine <b>essence</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "Luminary"). This difference overcame the criticism that they were introducing plurality into the pure Monotheism of Judaism. Kabbalistic texts take great care to emphasise this difference, and warn against anthropomorphising the subtle descriptions of Kabbalah in human terms. To avoid such heresies, the historical transmission of Kabbalah was traditionally restricted to direct teaching in close circles.|$|R
5|$|A 113-page guidebook titled To Heart 2: Master Guide was {{published}} by MediaWorks on January 15, 2005. The book contains poster artwork, the 'face patterns' of each character, selected CG scenes and a guide on how to play through each character's scenarios. Voice actress interviews are also included, {{as well as a}} brief guide on how to play through each scenario in To Heart. This was followed by another 192-page guidebook for the visual novel titled <b>The</b> <b>Essence</b> of To Heart 2: To Heart 2 Official Guidebook, which {{was published}} by Enterbrain on March 4, 2005. The book contains detailed character descriptions, a complete walk through to every heroine in the game, computer graphics, and interviews with the game's development staff. Enterbrain also released a 223-page guidebook entitled <b>The</b> <b>Essence</b> of To Heart 2 Portable: To Heart 2 Portable Official Guidebook for the PlayStation Portable version of the game on August 18, 2009. The guidebook is based on the original Essence for the PlayStation 2 game, but contained new and revised content for the PSP version. A guidebook for the PSP spinoff To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers, named To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers Official Complete Guide, was released by Enterbrain on August 11, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{new game}} is set within a {{well-established}} franchise, Starbreeze tried to retain <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> {{of the world}} and rebuild these elements. The game's story was written by British science-fiction writer Richard K Morgan, whom the team approached after they read his book Altered Carbon. Syndicate was Morgan's second video-game script after 2011's Crysis 2; he used the original game for reference and included elements that those who had played it would immediately recognize. He preserved the original's dystopian setting and theme, and hoped to use these elements to build a powerful story. Morgan traveled to Sweden to meet Starbreeze's game designers to ensure the game's story would not contradict its overall design.|$|E

She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the fates of the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E

5|$|During the Edo period Noh {{continued}} to be aristocratic art form supported by the shogun, the feudal lords (daimyōs), as well as wealthy and sophisticated commoners. While kabuki and joruri popular {{to the middle class}} focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic authenticity and remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.|$|E
5|$|Games in {{the series}} have been praised as being among the best modern {{role-playing}} games.

The games also won awards from several gaming publications. In March 2014, Bandai Namco reported that the series had sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much heavier and so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was heavier and you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. <b>The</b> <b>essence</b> of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
