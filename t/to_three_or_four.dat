5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Borders Railway, there have been many {{complaints}} about lack of seats, provision of ticket machines and lack of parking, especially at Tweedbank. The high demand has led ScotRail to increase some services <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> carriage trains. However this and the general opening of the line have also contributed to there being a general shortage of train carriages across the ScotRail network, leading to them hiring extra trains.|$|E
5|$|Martin runs an {{official}} website and administers a lively blog {{with the assistance}} of Ty Franck. He also interacts with fandom by answering emails and letters, although he stated in 2005 that their sheer numbers might leave them unanswered for years. Since there are different types of conventions nowadays, he tends to go <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> science-fiction conventions a year simply {{to go back to his}} roots and meet friends. He does not read message boards anymore, so that his writing will not be influenced by fans foreseeing twists and interpreting characters differently from what he intended.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client {{to be a part of}} the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.|$|E

5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & will no doubt increase <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
5|$|The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is {{the fifth}} heat in which the {{remaining}} four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semifinal (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four.</b> Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semifinal. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semifinals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Bowlines {{run from}} the leech (outer {{vertical}} edges) of a sail forward (towards the bow) and are used to control the weather leech, keeping it taut and thus preventing it from curling back on itself.

When a hydraulic lift is used on the plow, the hydraulic hoses will also usually uncouple automatically when the plow uncouples.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} {{there must be}} a minimum of two wrestlers ranked at sekiwake. If {{circumstances}} require, this can rise typically <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four.</b> The minimum of two requirement means that a certain amount of luck can lead to wrestlers achieving this rank on occasion, if the performance of other wrestlers leaves no obvious candidates to fill the rank. This luck factor is less common than it is for komusubi promotions.|$|E

Students can acquire professional experience after their initial bachelor's degree at any European institution and later complete their masters in any other European institution via the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System.|$|E
25|$|At {{any time}} {{there must be}} a minimum of two wrestlers ranked as komusubi.

However, this is relatively rare. The minimum of two requirement means that a certain amount of luck can lead to wrestlers achieving this rank on occasion, if the performance of other wrestlers leaves no obvious candidates to fill the rank.|$|E
25|$|In {{an area of}} Sichuan {{province}} {{incorporating the}} traditional Tibetan areas Kham and Amdo, Tibetan monks and police clashed on March 16 in Ngawa county after the monks staged a protest, killing at least one policeman, and setting fire <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> police vans. The India-based Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy claimed at least seven people were shot dead; however, the claim could not be independently confirmed. There are claims that police shot between 13 and 30 protesters after a police station was set on fire; however, reports of the deaths were impossible to verify because of restrictions on journalists.|$|E

25|$|The zoos of the Old World breed Acheta domesticus, Gryllus bimaculatus, and Gryllus assimilis. Their cricket farms usually rotate four {{generation}} ("four crates") of insects. One {{generation or}} one physical crate {{is used for}} mating and incubation of eggs, which takes from seven to twelve days. One male usually mates <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> females. Females are discarded (and fed to zoo animals) immediately after laying the eggs: their life span is too short {{to give them a}} second chance. Three other generations, spaced by the same seven to twelve days, are for raising the larvae, which takes 4–5 weeks. Thus the zoos restock their live food supply practically every week.|$|E
25|$|Many {{publishers}} in the 1950s and '60s {{refused to}} publish {{more than one}} or two books a year by the same author. Louis's editor at Gold Medal supported his writing up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> but the heads of the company vetoed that idea even though Louis was publishing books with other houses. Louis had sold over a dozen novels and several million copies before Bantam Books editor-in-chief Saul David was finally able to convince his company to offer Louis a short term exclusive contract that would accept three books a year. It was only after 1960, however, that Louis's sales at Bantam would begin to surpass his sales at Gold Medal.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} diagnostic tools {{will include}} the use of LED microscopes and DNA-based diagnosis. Using LEDs rather than standard phosphorescent lights in microscopes forms a clearer image and improves TB detection rates in patients' sputum from 50 to 65 per cent. And DNA testing, which can determine which strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are present in sputum has 98 per cent accuracy and can be used to detect drug-resistant strains in as little as a day. DNA-based diagnosis is also cost-effective. As well as diagnosis, new management methods such as mobile phone text messaging and medicine kits with built-in reminder alarms will be used to enhance patients' drug compliance. Drug combinations — where different drugs are combined in the same pill — will also be used {{to reduce the number of}} pills a patient has to take from around 13 <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> a day.|$|E

25|$|Spawning grounds are {{the areas}} of water where aquatic animals spawn, or produce their eggs. After spawning, the spawn {{may or may not}} drift to new grounds which become their nursery grounds. Many species {{undertake}} migrations each year, and sometimes great migrations, to reach their spawning grounds. For example, lakes and river watersheds can be major spawning grounds for anadromous fish such as salmon. These days, it is often necessary to construct fish ladders and other bypass systems so salmon can navigate their way past hydroelectric dams or other obstructions such as weirs on their way to spawning grounds. Coastal fish often use mangroves and estuaries as spawning grounds, while reef fish can find adjacent seagrass meadows that make good spawning grounds. Short-finned eels can travel anything up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> thousand kilometres to their spawning ground in deep water somewhere in the Coral Sea.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were {{motivated}} by money, as the fighters competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> rounds, scoring is computed by points {{based on the number}} of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts. Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an Automated Boxing Scoring System, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin protein {{components}} must assemble into holotoxin complexes to function. In {{order for}} LF and EF to function inside a target cell, they must localize {{to the cell}} and enter its cytoplasm. Through a series of steps, PA can translocate EF and LF into the cell (Fig. 2). This process starts when the 83-kDa form of PA, called PA83, binds to an anthrax toxin receptor. There are two known homologous receptors, which bind to PA83, called tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Then a 20 kDa fragment (PA20) is cleaved off PA83's amino terminus by membrane endoproteases from the furin family. When PA20 dissociates, the remaining receptor-bound portion of PA, called PA63, may assemble into either a heptameric or octameric ring-shaped oligomer. This ring-shaped oligomer {{is often referred to}} as the pre-pore (or pre-channel) form of PA, since later in the pathway it will become a translocase pore (or channel). The surface of the pre-pore oligomer, which was exposed upon release of the PA20 moiety, can then bind to LF and EF. The heptameric and octameric forms of the PA oligomer may then bind with up <b>to</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> molecules of EF and/or LF, respectively. The cell then endocytoses these assembled complexes and carries them to an acidic compartment in the cell. The low pH encountered in the endosome causes the PA63 pre-channel to convert into a cation-selective channel. EF and LF are driven through the channel by a pH gradient, allowing the enzyme factors to enter the cytosol.|$|E
