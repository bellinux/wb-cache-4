50|$|The {{tape path}} then carries the tape around the {{spinning}} head drum, wrapping it {{around a little}} more than 180 degrees (called the omega transport system) in a helical fashion, assisted by the slanted <b>tape</b> <b>guides.</b> The head rotates constantly at approximately 1800 rpm in NTSC machines, exactly 1500 in PAL, each complete rotation corresponding to one frame of video.|$|R
50|$|One {{significant}} advantage {{offered by}} DASH recorders over the analog recorders {{of the day}} was that 'proper' tape biasing was unimportant, as there is no means for the tape to 'color' the sound of the recorded data.

Due to this fact, the formulation of tape does not change the sound quality, unlike analog machines which must be set for specific formulae.|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) is {{a mobile}} Robot used in {{industrial}} applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or a warehouse. An AGV {{can also be}} called a laser guided vehicle (LGV) or self-guided vehicle (SGV). In Germany the technology is also called Fahrerlose Transport system (FTS). AGV’s are extensively adopted in Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS), AGV’s Navigate on Their own {{with the help of}} various guiding mechanisms; broadly these mechanisms are classified as wired & wireless guidance mechanisms. In this project we mainly concentrate on wireless guidance mechanism which makes use if <b>guide</b> <b>tape</b> (colored in this case) for navigation.

5000|$|The [...] "tape" [...] can be {{made from}} many {{different}} materials including steel, fiberglass, and nylon.

5000|$|DLT uses linear {{serpentine}} recording {{with multiple}} tracks on half-inch (12.7 mm) wide tape. The cartridges contain a single reel and {{the tape is}} {{pulled out of the}} cartridge by means of a leader tape attached to the take-up reel inside the drive. The drive leader tape is buckled to the cartridge leader during the load process. Tape speed and tension are controlled electronically via the reel motors; there is no [...] capstan.

50|$|AGVs (some {{known as}} {{automated}} guided carts or AGCs) use <b>tape</b> for the <b>guide</b> path. The <b>tapes</b> {{can be one}} of two styles: magnetic or colored. The AGC is fitted with the appropriate guide sensor to follow the path of the tape.One major advantage of tape over wired guidance is that it can be easily removed and relocated if the course needs to change. Colored tape is initially less expensive, but lacks the advantage of being embedded in high traffic areas where the tape may become damaged or dirty. A flexible magnetic bar can also be embedded in the floor like wire but works under the same provision as magnetic tape and so remains unpowered or passive. Another advantage of magnetic <b>guide</b> <b>tape</b> is the dual polarity. small pieces of magnetic tape may be placed to change states of the AGC based on polarity and sequence of the tags.|$|R
50|$|Rod blanks can be {{purchased}} with guide locations preset for the individual rod or placed by hand. Rod sections tend to be directional, wanting to flex in a certain direction over others. Rod builders usually test each rod section to find the point of greatest flex (aka spining the rod) so that guides can be aligned along it. With the placement around the rod determined, the rod builder next determines where {{along the length of}} the rod to place the guides. This is usually done by <b>taping</b> the <b>guides</b> onto the rod, stringing the rod, flexing it and moving each guide to achieve the best fit to the rod's natural flex.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "bedstead" [...] was {{a system}} of pulleys around which two {{continuous}} loops of tape were driven in synchrony. Initially this was {{by means of a}} pair of sprocket wheels on a common axle. This was changed to drive by friction pulleys with the sprocket wheels maintaining the synchrony when it was found that this caused less damage to the tapes. Speeds of up to 2000 characters per second were achieved for shorter tapes, but only 1000 for longer tapes. The <b>tapes</b> were <b>guided</b> past an array of photo-electric cells where the characters and other signals were read. Possible tape lengths on the bedstead were from 2000 to 11,000 characters.|$|R
40|$|Lateral tape motion (LTM) is {{the motion}} of a tape {{perpendicular}} to the tape transport direction. It {{is a problem in}} magnetic tape recording technology that limits the track density on a tape. To reduce LTM, it is important to characterize the main sources of LTM in tape transports. In this dissertation, the effect of tape edge contact as well as tape tension transients on LTM is investigated. An optical non-contact tension sensor is developed and a correlation between LTM and tension transients is observed. Additionally, a method based on acoustic emission is established to measure tape edge contact. Tape edge contact is observed to cause high frequency LTM, and the magnitude of the impact is shown to be function of the tape pack size. The dynamics of a tape as it moves over a cylindrical guide are studied theoretically and validated experimentally. Good agreement between theory and experiments is observed. In the experimental analysis, the tape/guide friction coefficient is observed to be function of different operating and design parameters. A model for the friction coefficient between a tape and a cylindrical guide is presented and evaluated with experimental data. Finally, the use of laser surface texturing (LST) for improved <b>tape</b> <b>guiding</b> is proposed and investigated both experimentally and numerically. LST guides are observed to create an air bearing at low tape speeds and thus reduce the transition speed between boundary lubrication and full fluid lubrication. Additionally, the design of a dual stage actuator tape head for increased bandwidth track-following is introduced, as a means to enable increased track density on a tape for future high performance tape drive...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} depression suggest the use of guided self-help for patients with mild to moderate disorders. However, there is little consensus concerning the optimal form and delivery of this intervention. To develop acceptable and effective interventions, a phased process has been proposed, using a modelling phase to examine and develop an intervention prior to preliminary testing in an exploratory trial. This paper (a) describes the modelling phase used to develop a guided self-help intervention for depression in primary care and (b) reports data from an exploratory randomised trial of the intervention. Methods A guided self-help intervention was developed following a modelling phase which involved a systematic review, meta synthesis and a consensus process. The intervention was then tested in an exploratory randomised controlled trial by examining (a) fidelity using analysis of <b>taped</b> <b>guided</b> self-help sessions (b) acceptability to patients and professionals through qualitative interviews (c) effectiveness through estimation of the intervention effect size. Results Fifty eight patients were recruited to the exploratory trial. Seven professionals and nine patients were interviewed, and 22 tapes of sessions analysed for fidelity. Generally, fidelity to the intervention protocol was high, and the professionals delivered the majority of the specific components (with the exception of the use of feedback). Acceptability to both professionals and patients was also high. The effect size of the intervention on outcomes was small, and in line with previous analyses showing the modest effect of guided self-help in primary care. However, the sample size was small and confidence intervals around the effectiveness estimate were wide. Conclusion The general principles of the modelling phase adopted in this study are designed to draw on a range of evidence, potentially providing an intervention that is evidence-based, patient-centred and acceptable to professionals. However, the pilot outcome data did not suggest that the intervention developed was particularly effective. The advantages and disadvantages of the general methods used in the modelling phase are discussed, and possible reasons for the failure to demonstrate a larger effect in this particular case are outlined. </p...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{properties}} {{of a standard}} compact - cassette tape system are measured and software techniques devised to configure a low - cost,direct digital recording system. Tape - velocity variation is typically ± 10 % of standard speed over tape lengths of 5 µm. with occasional variations of ± 40 %. Static tape - skew can result due to axial movement of the tape reel when it spools. Dynamic tape skew occurs and is primarily caused by tape - edge curvature with a constant contribution due to the transport mechanism. Spectral skew components range from 0. 32 Hz to 8 Hz with magnitude normally within one 10 kbit/ sec- bit cell. The pinch roller works against the friction of the <b>tape</b> <b>guides</b> to cause <b>tape</b> deformation. Average values of tape deformation are 0. 67 µm, 0. 85 µm and 1. 08 µm for C 60,C 90 and C 120 tape respectively. Parallel,software encoding / decoding algorithms {{have been developed for}} several channel codes. Adaptive software methods permit track data rates up to 3. 33 k bits/sec in a rnultitrack system using a simple microcomputer. For a 4 - track system,raw error rates vary from 10 ˉ⁷ at 500 bits/sec/track to 10 ˉ⁵ at 3. 33 kbits/sec/track. Adaptive software reduces skew - induced errors by 50 %. A skew - correction technique has been developed and implemented on an 8 - track system at a track data rate of 10 k bits/sec. Real - time error correction gives a theoretical corrected error rate of 10 ˉ¹¹for a raw error rate of 10 ˉ⁷. Multiple track errors can cause mis - correction and interleaving is advised. Software algorithms have been devised for Reed - Solomon code. With a more powerful microprocessor this code m ay be combined with the above techniques in a layered error-correction scheme. The software techniques developed may be applied to N tracks with an N - bit computer. Recording density may be increased by using thin - film,multitrack heads and a faster computer.

It may happen that the default physical organization does not meet directly the visitor's expectations, possibly making it difficult to build a personal route.
