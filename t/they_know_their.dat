25|$|In {{the last}} days, Terry lets {{it be known}} that he knows the ending to The Story. But the tale he tells during the final recess is {{different}} from the one Kennan outlined in his letter: Raul successfully breaks into the Wizard fortress, but half-frozen and overwhelmed by their technology, cannot overcome them. He is forced to escape aboard one of their flying craft. Dobby manages to wrench one arm free, but no more, while Gernisavien is securely fastened. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> only course of action with Raul's defeat is to have Dobby smash some chemicals together. The resulting explosion levels the mountain. Raul is safely away when it happens, but he knows that the explosion means that the quest is dead, for his friends perished with the key and knowledge necessary to reactivate the farcaster.|$|E
500|$|Mascherino and Rubano (who both {{attended}} jazz college) were, {{according to}} Lazzara, [...] "really schooled {{in music and}} <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> instruments really well." [...] When they joined the band, they [...] "cleaned up and tightened our sound." [...] The new lineup's first song was [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt. II." [...] They began writing new material, {{and in a few}} months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new. We really wanted to grow musically with this [...]" [...] They pushed themselves, trying to write the best songs they could. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because some of us were new." ...|$|E
500|$|Upland and hill farms provide grazing for hardy breeds {{of cattle}} like Welsh Blacks and for Welsh Mountain sheep. The cattle are {{normally}} housed {{in winter and}} may graze the open hillside in summer. The trampling of their hooves helps control bracken and they feed {{on a wide range}} of vegetation and on coarse tufts of grass that sheep cannot tackle. The sheep are mostly [...] "hefted" [...] on the unfenced open hillside all year round. Here <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> way around, know where to graze at different times of year and where to shelter. The male lambs are used for meat and most of the females are retained on the hill as flock replacements. Aged ewes are moved to lower elevations and crossed with lowland rams to produce Welsh mule ewes, which are then used for breeding.|$|E

5000|$|They were {{assisted}} {{greatly in}} this by East Timorese pro-Indonesian militias. The militia groups for each district of East Timor {{were even more}} ruthless than the Indonesian military in most cases. Often, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>their</b> victims, and in many well-documented cases <b>they</b> had <b>known</b> <b>their</b> victims their entire lives, usually coming from the same villages or neighborhoods.|$|R
500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those kinds of stories help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Herald Star {{noted that}} [...] "He {{considers}} {{the impact of}} his votes...choosing carefully without regard for what the political impact might be on him personally" [...] ("Voinovich setting good example" [...] from July 26, 2007). Government Executive praised him saying, [...] "no matter what anyone thinks of George Voinovich or Daniel Akaka's politics in general, no one can deny that <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> federal employee issues cold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Starting with season 9 of the U.S. {{version and}} recent seasons of most foreign {{versions}} feature a challenge which tests the contestants on their time spent during the race, {{such as the}} locations they visited and/or how well <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> partner. Such task usually appears as the second-to-last or last challenge. Such a challenge is usually a [...] "Route Info" [...] task, but it sometimes appears as a [...] "Roadblock" [...] task.|$|E

2500|$|During {{a three-year}} period until 1993, the number of {{applications}} submitted to Strake Jesuit doubled. Fr. Brian Zinnamon, the school President, said during the year that there were two times the number of applicants compared to available spots. At the time, tuition was $4,700 per year, described by Stephanie Asin of the Houston Chronicle as being steep. Father Zinnamon said, [...] "Certainly {{what is going on in}} the public schools is a factor. Parents are choosing a safe environment where <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> children are getting Christian values." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Rape {{victims are}} blamed more when they resist the attack {{later in the}} rape {{encounter}} rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth & Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard & Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they have gone along with the sexual experience thus far. Finally, rape victims are blamed more when they are raped by an acquaintance or a date rather than by a stranger (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, & Lottes, 1994; Bridges, 1991; Bridges & McGr ail, 1989; Check & Malamuth, 1983; Kanekar, Shaherwalla, Franco, Kunju, & Pinto, 1991; L'Armand & Pepitone, 1982; Tetreault & Barnett, 1987), which seems to evoke the stereotype that victims {{really want to have}} sex because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> attacker and perhaps even went out on a date with him. The underlying message of this research seems to be that when certain stereotypical elements of rape are in place, rape victims are prone to being blamed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens has mixed {{views on}} the UK Independence Party. He has mocked UKIP as being [...] "a fantasy and a Dad's Army organisation" [...] that is [...] "without {{political}} importance", a [...] "rickety jalopy bolted together in a garden shed", and he has criticised UKIP leader Nigel Farage, calling him a [...] "charming charlatan", and Farage's personal support for drug decriminalisation, viewing UKIP itself also as [...] "not a conservative formation, but Thatcherism in exile." [...] However, he also said of the 2015 general election, [...] "If you feel for some odd reason that voting is a duty, vote for UKIP", and he has defended UKIP from [...] "smear" [...] attempts and has called Nigel Farage [...] "in fact England's answer to Alex Salmond." [...] He has also said that [...] "only a UKIP breakthrough offers the poor, betrayed British people any hope of real change. The [...] must lie, because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> real aims are hateful to us." ...|$|E

60|$|The Stuarts only contended for prerogatives which <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>their</b> {{predecessors}} enjoyed, {{and which}} they saw their contemporaries enjoying; but these prerogatives were inimical to {{the happiness of}} a nation {{and the rights of}} subjects.|$|R
30|$|Only 10 % of {{the survey}} {{participants}} (n =  31) reported that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>their</b> underage children had gambled with people other than their parents and family members. Majority (90 %) believed their children had never done so.|$|R
2500|$|Invalid Channel said, [...] "Bajo and Hex are hilarious to watch, {{they have}} so many funny moments. You can tell <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> shit, too, they've been around the block {{when it comes to}} games and they use {{terminology}} without it sounding super lame and out of place. At the same time, they make it easy for non-gamers, or people who wish they were gamers (ie: me) to understand. Bits and pieces feel really awkward though, and I know they put in awkward moments for comedic effect sometimes, but I find that these don't always have the comedic effect that they're probably going for, and end up going full circle just being plain awkward". It argues the [...] "small size and down-to-earth-ness" [...] of the show adds to its charm, by saying [...] "a commercial version of the show would be way too polished and just wouldn't feel right". It ended its review by saying [...] "all in all, Good Game is a good show [...] the reviews are quite good". While it thought there was room for improvement, it said [...] "the show's got it's [...] niche and it should stick to it".|$|E
2500|$|Edwards went on {{to define}} the two Americas he claimed to exist, one {{for the rich and}} one for the poor, and {{repeated}} several times that [...] "It doesn't have to be that way." [...] He called for one health care system, equal in quality to the coverage received by Senators and other elected officials, and promised to establish a Patients' Bill of Rights. Edwards proposed one public school system for all, arguing that [...] "None of us believe that the quality of a child's education should be controlled by where they live or the affluence of their community." [...] He appealed {{for the end of the}} two economies, [...] "one for people who are set for life, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>their</b> kids and grandkids are going to be just fine, and then one for most Americans, people who live paycheck to paycheck." [...] Edwards also stated how the Democrats expected to pay for their agenda: [...] "We're going to roll back – we're going to roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. And we're going to close corporate loopholes. We're going to cut government contractors and wasteful spending. We can move this country forward without passing the burden to our children and our grandchildren." ...|$|E

50|$|Charles Dunbar {{taught his}} sons {{to play the}} pipes, though none {{attained}} his mastery of the instrument. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>their</b> father {{as a man of}} discipline.

60|$|One {{hopes that}} she was; for certainly, if any men ever {{needed to be}} in the right, lest they should be of all men most miserable, it was these same old hermits. Praying and preaching continually, they lived on food which dogs would not eat, in dens in which dogs ought not to live. They had <b>their</b> reasons. Possibly <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>their</b> own {{business}} best. Possibly also <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>their</b> neighbour's business somewhat; <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> that such generations as they lived in could not be taught, save by some extravagant example of this kind, some caricature, as it were, of the doctrines which were to be enforced. Nothing less startling, perhaps, could have touched the dull hearts, have convinced the dull brains, of fierce, ignorant, and unreasoning men.|$|R
50|$|Modeled on The Newlywed Game, three {{couples and}} their {{children}} answered questions to win (as the title says) a second honeymoon. The kids were asked a series of multiple-choice questions {{in the style of}} Newlywed to see how much <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>their</b> parents.|$|R
