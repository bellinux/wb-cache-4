5|$|Departure from Beirut {{was delayed}} by about one hour. Originally {{scheduled}} to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> aircraft using explosives {{that had been}} hidden in the first class cabin (and which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of Black September were not released from the German prison.|$|E
5|$|In Dead or Alive 4 (2005), Ayane {{has pledged}} {{her life to}} her {{half-brother}} and Mugen Tenshin clan leader Hayate, in his cause to destroy the DOATEC for the suffering the company has caused the ninja clans. Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E
5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E

Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E
5|$|In February 1973 Abu Daoud {{was arrested}} in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name Al-Iqab ("the Punishment"); on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and {{threatened}} <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud {{was released from prison}} two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.|$|E

5|$|On January4, 1973, a Pacific Western Airlines Convair {{turboprop}} airliner {{preparing to}} take off from Vancouver, British Columbia, for a flight to Penticton with 18 people on board was hijacked by 26-year-old passenger Christopher Kenneth Nielson, who drew a gun and demanded $2 {{million in cash and}} to be flown to North Vietnam, threatening <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> airliner if his demands were not met. During negotiations at Vancouver International Airport, Nielson allowed the other 13 passengers and one crew member to disembark, leaving three crew members aboard the plane with him. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) then stormed the plane and arrested Nielson, finding that he was armed only with two toy guns. There were no fatalities in the incident.|$|E
5|$|Tequila {{finds the}} last {{baby in the}} {{maternity}} unit, and carries it to safety while fighting off {{the last of the}} gangsters. Alan and Tequila meet up again and are confronted by Wong, who has set bombs <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> building. Alan pursues Wong as Tequila escapes the hospital with the last baby, the hospital exploding around him. Outside, Wong suddenly appears holding Alan at gunpoint. After watching Wong humiliate Tequila, Alan grabs Wong's pistol. In a struggle, Alan shoots himself through the stomach giving Tequila enough time to shoot Wong dead. Later at the police station, Pang and Tequila burn Alan's police file. Alan then sails away from Hong Kong in his boat.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{ultimately}} decided when {{the rising tide}} lifted Rhett's sloops free while temporarily leaving the Royal James stranded. Bonnet was left helpless, watching while the enemy vessels repaired their rigging and closed to board his paralysed vessel. Outnumbered almost three to one, Bonnet's men would have had little hope of winning a boarding action. Bonnet ordered his gunner, George Ross, <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Royal James's powder magazine. Ross apparently attempted this, but was overruled by {{the remainder of the}} crew, who surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and returned to Charles Town with his prisoners on 3October.|$|E

50|$|A {{natural way}} to resolve {{singularities}} is <b>to</b> repeatedly <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> some canonically chosen smooth subvariety. This runs into the following problem. The singular set of x2 = y2z2 is the pair of lines given by the y and z axes. The only reasonable varieties <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> are <b>the</b> origin, {{one of these two}} axes, or the whole singular set (both axes). However the whole singular set cannot be used since it is not smooth, and choosing one of the two axes breaks the symmetry between them so is not canonical. This means we have <b>to</b> start by <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> origin, but this reproduces the original singularity, so we seem to be going round in circles.|$|R

5|$|The {{ruins of}} both Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 {{as part of}} an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker. Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E
5|$|Wallenberg started {{sleeping}} in a different house each night, to guard against being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by Adolf Eichmann's men. Two days before the Soviet Army occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with Eichmann and with Major-General Gerhard Schmidthuber, the supreme commander of German forces in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member Pál Szalai to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest by threatening to have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for wearing their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, the British forces {{landed on}} the island and told the keeper's wife, Thankful Stone, that they had nothing to fear as long as they kept the light burning. Later, the keeper, Solomon Stone, had to put the light out per order of the New London customs inspector. The British {{threatened}} <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lighthouse, and Stone got an order to relight the lighthouse. In 1856, the light was upgraded from the twelve lamps to a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The light's new characteristic was a fixed light with a flash every two seconds. Around 1976, a GE 1000-watt bulb was used. When the lighthouse was repaired after the fire and automated in 1978, a modern optic replaced the Fresnel lens. The lighthouse currently uses a VRB-25 lens. The lighthouse switched to solar power in 1988. The light's characteristic is a flash of white light every ten seconds. It continues to operate as a navigational aid to the nearby Intracoastal Waterway.|$|E

5|$|Group Two, {{under the}} command of Captain Burn, would land at the old {{entrance}} to the St Nazaire basin. Their objectives were to destroy the anti-aircraft positions in the area and the German headquarters, <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> locks and bridges at the old entrance into the basin and then to guard against a counter-attack from the submarine base. Group Three was {{under the command}} of Major William 'Bill' Copland, who was also the Commandos' second in command. They were to secure the immediate area around Campbeltown, destroy the dock's water-pumping and gate-opening machinery and the nearby underground fuel tanks. All three groups were subdivided into assault, demolition and protection teams. The assault teams would clear the way for the other two. The demolition teams carrying the explosive charges only had sidearms for self-defence; the protection teams, armed with Thompson submachine guns, were to defend them while they completed their tasks.|$|E

5|$|Police {{arrived at}} the embassy almost {{immediately}} after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Dellow arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the Royal School of Needlework further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of D11, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, and officers with specialist surveillance equipment. Police negotiators made contact with Oan via a field telephone passed {{through one of the}} embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA's first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Khūzestān, and threatened <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> embassy and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.|$|E

The Tanis scenes were filmed in nearby Sedala, a harsh place due to heat and disease. Several cast and crew members fell ill and Rhys-Davies defecated in his costume during one shot. Spielberg averted disease by eating only canned foods from England, but {{did not like the}} area and quickly condensed the scheduled six-week shoot to four-and-a-half weeks.
