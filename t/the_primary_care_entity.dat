40|$|Background: Heart disease {{remains the}} number one killer of Americans with an {{estimated}} 599, 413 deaths in 2013 attributed to this condition and its treatment has inflated to an annual cost of $ 190 billion. This mortality is partially attributed to ineffective outpatient triage, management, and treatment of patients with acute chest pain. Methods: The purpose of this newly proposed acute chest pain triage and management guideline was: (1) to decrease inappropriate wait times and incongruous office appointments resulting in delay of care, patients being referred {{to the emergency room}} (ER) or, direct admissions to the hospital from <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> office setting, and (2) to increase appropriate management for those patients experiencing the symptom of chest pain in <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> setting by increasing the skill and comfort level of staff and providers in triaging and managing those patients in <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> office setting. Results: Problem resolution was accomplished via employment of a multi-step acute chest pain guideline. This quality improvement plan (QIP) was successful in decreasing patients presenting to <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> office with acute chest pain by 30. 5 %. Office staff and providers acquired a valuable resource and increased personal comfort level when triaging and managing acute chest pain in <b>the</b> outpatient <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> office setting. Conclusions: Sustainable use of the new guideline will promote cost savings for <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> office and, more importantly, reduced delay of care and will reduce mortality rates for patients with acute chest pain...|$|R

40|$|Background The use of non-surgical {{treatment}} {{in patients with}} hip and/or knee osteoarthritis is not optimal as studies show a poor referral to physical therapy, overuse of radiological assessments, poor prescription of medication to relieve pain, and inadequate referral to secondary care. To improve use of non-surgical treatment, <b>the</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>Care</b> Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis was developed and implemented in the Julius Healthcare Centres. Aim To compare health care use and sequence of care in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis before and after pilot implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>Care</b> Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis. Methods A pilot evaluation was conducted after implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>Care</b> Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis within four primary healthcare centres, using a retrospective analysis of medical records. Data on health care use and sequence of care were extracted from medical records of general practitioners and physical therapists. Newly diagnosed patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis were included before and after pilot implementation. Results The current study included 28 patients: 11 before and 17 after pilot implementation. After pilot implementation, {{a higher proportion of}} patients received physical therapy and medication to relieve pain. A lower proportion of patients received radiological assessments and secondary care. A higher proportion of patients received correct sequence of care before referral to physical therapy and medication according to the correct sequence after pilot implementation. Conclusion The results suggest that implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>Care</b> Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis might positively influence health care use and sequence of care in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis. Clinical Relevance Implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>Care</b> Stepped Care Strategy Osteoarthritis might improve use of non-surgical care and decrease referral to secondary care in patients with hip and/or knee osteoarthritis.

The education as a training, cultivation and tutoring is emphasized lately as the self-evident part of the professional nurse occupation. The educational nurse activity in <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> has own particularities which are described in detail in the theoretical section of this bachelor´s work.
