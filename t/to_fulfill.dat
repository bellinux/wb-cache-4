5|$|Development of Space Race began {{soon after}} the {{founding}} of Atari in Summer 1972 under the name Asteroid. Co-founders Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney had the initial idea for the game while developing the 1971 Computer Space, the first arcade video game, but felt the more complicated Computer Space was a better first game. After leaving Nutting Associates and founding Atari in May 1972, Bushnell spent a few days designing Asteroid, but soon had to drop the project to focus on running the company. After the release of Pong, Atari's first game, development resumed on the title in Spring 1973. Dabney has claimed credit for the game's final design, though Pong designer Allan Alcorn has stated that he and Bushnell {{may have been involved}} as well. Asteroid, codenamed VP-2, was designed to be a racing game that would be simple to create <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> an earlier contract with Bally Midway; Atari had initially offered Pong during its development <b>to</b> <b>fulfill</b> the contract, but had been rejected. The company was also interested in producing a very different game from their previous success, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games.|$|E
