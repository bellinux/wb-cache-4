5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
25|$|Neurological-developmental delay This is {{the most}} common cause of {{bedwetting}}. Most bedwetting children are simply delayed in developing the ability to stay dry and have no other developmental issues. Studies suggest that bedwetting may be due to a nervous system that is slow to process <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full bladder.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} is {{cast as a}} broad rondo in two main sections: ABAB–CADA. The {{first half of the}} movement sets up the expectation of an ABABA pattern. The interruption of this pattern with new music just before its expected conclusion gives the rest of the movement <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vast extension. This extended leave-taking acts as a coda for the suite as a whole.|$|E

25|$|The {{district}} is interesting {{because of the}} large number of wood-framed outbuildings still remaining from the district's main period of significance (1855–1930). The {{district is}} also significant for the large number of mid-19th-century vernacular homes and commercial buildings which remain intact and retain a large amount of their architectural integrity. The buildings contribute {{to the understanding of the}} agricultural, social, and commercial history of late-19th-century and early-20th-century northern Illinois. Together the structures and their lots convey <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small and active pre-Great Depression farming community. The Scales Mound Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 5, 1990.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} plot, or perhaps more {{accurately}} plot device, Plautus {{served as a}} source of inspiration and also provided the possibility of adaptation for later playwrights. The many deceits that Plautus layered his plays with, giving the audience <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> genre bordering on farce, appear in much of the comedy written by Shakespeare and Molière. For instance, the clever slave has important roles in both L'Avare and L'Etourdi, two plays by Molière, and in both drives the plot and creates the ruse just like Palaestrio in Miles Gloriosus. These similar characters set up the same kind of deceptions in which many of Plautus' plays find their driving force, which is not a simple coincidence.|$|E
25|$|Pollokshields was {{established}} by the Stirling-Maxwell family in 1849, and was set out or 'feued' by the Edinburgh architect David Rhind. Many well-known Glaswegian architects contributed to its development and, amongst others, it contains villas by Alexander 'Greek' Thomson. There are several contributions by contemporaries of Charles Rennie Mackintosh including a series of good 'Glasgow style' tenements by the architect H. E. Clifford, who was also responsible for the 'A' listed Pollokshields Burgh Hall, in Scottish Baronial style which was inaugurated in 1890, with Maxwell Park. The ground for Maxwell Park was given by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell of Nether Pollok in 1888, and the park was formally opened at the same time. Such was its early population growth Pollokshields attained 'burgh' status in 1876. However, this ended in 1891 when after being offered favourable tax terms {{the residents of the}} burgh agreed to it becoming a suburb of the growing city of Glasgow. The Victorian and Edwardian architecture and the parks of this area have remained almost untouched, leaving <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> leafy Victorian suburb, while being well within the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene has}} been {{described}} as overly intimate. [...] Both the arrangement of the furniture and the lighting contribute to this intimacy. [...] Deborah Solomon describes the scene as having [...] "some of <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French interior, with lovely haut-art touches. Bruce Cole of The Wall Street Journal stated [...] "This reference to the war is so specific that it conveys little about fear or Roosevelt's plan for universal disarmament. Rockwell just could not get his hands around these airy abstractions." ...|$|E
500|$|Where You Go I Go Too {{comprises}} three tracks, roughly 30, 10, and 15 {{minutes in}} duration, which seamlessly flow {{into each other}} in transitions that were described as [...] "gradual and subtle". The songs grow and develop independent musical traits, such as motifs, polyrhythms, and melodies. According to The Guardian, some musical changes are pronounced, such as {{the introduction of a}} synthesizer, while others, such as small tempo changes, remain [...] "almost insensible". Some critics have noted the album conjures <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> journey.|$|E

[...] Marc Altman compared it to other similarly-themed episodes such as [...] "The Man Trap", which featured a shape-changing alien and a lost love, and said [...] "the shape-changing alien is a familiar genre (and Trekkian trope), the romantic twist in which the Vendorian spy betrays his Romulan masters for love is a nice surprise." ...|$|E

"Lunch Time Cypher" [...] {{was meant}} to give <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high school cypher, {{complete}} with beatboxing, random, crazy lyrics from Hopsin, and featured artists Passionate MC and G-Mo Skee. The song [...] "What's My Purpose" [...] is, according to Hopsin, [...] "about a human born into this current dark society. How everybody {{is doing the same}} thing. Nobody is really different. And the government has us here to just make money." [...] He also touches on his race-related arrest after a concert in Orlando, Florida. The album's outro [...] "Caught In the Rain" [...] discusses about how Hopsin is soul-searching and needing to find himself.|$|E
500|$|The opening chase scene, {{involving}} Gosling's character, {{was filmed}} primarily by Refn within the car's interior. In an interview, he revealed {{the idea for}} this scene was to emulate <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "diver in an ocean of sharks," [...] never leaving the vehicle during a car chase so that the audience can see what's happening from the character's point of view. Tight on money and time, he shot the scene in two days. With two different set-ups prepared in the car, the director {{found it difficult to}} have mobility with the camera, so he would switch the camera to two additional set-ups nearby. As downtown Los Angeles had been rejuvenated, Refn avoided certain areas to maintain the novel's gloomy atmosphere, which was helped by the scene being shot at low-angles with minimal light.|$|E
500|$|Producer Harve Bennett was {{exhausted}} by {{his work on}} the previous three Star Trek films and wanted to move on, feeling that he {{was not part of the}} Star Trek [...] "family" [...] and that he had been mistreated by Nimoy. When Shatner tried to convince Bennett to reconsider, the producer insisted on a meeting at his home. After several hours of discussion Bennett agreed to return. Bennett disagreed with several elements of Shatner's story, feeling that because no one could assuredly answer the question of God's existence, the ending of the film would never be satisfying. Bennett also told Shatner that the film had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tone poem rather than an adventure story. The studio agreed with Bennett, reasoning that the subject matter could be too weighty or offensive to theatergoers.|$|E

500|$|Scholarship {{since the}} 1970s {{has tended to}} move away from a pure study of iconography, instead {{emphasizing}} the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time. According to Craig Harbison, [...] "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about what kind of people these were." [...] Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a [...] "prayer book mentality" [...] available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} agreed that Ensemble re-created the Halo universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: [...] "It's not just the geek thrill of seeing a Scarab in action—it's that you understand what the Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles." [...] Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave Halo Wars <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> generic science-fiction title. While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments {{went a long way}} to integrating the game {{with the rest of the}} series. Wilcox commented that with the Halo-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, [...] "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is still very much a Halo game." [...] Overall, Halo Wars was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.|$|E
500|$|Sharky Extreme praised FreeSpace 2 {{for having}} the {{enormous}} capital ships, as this burst the [...] "trapped in a bubble" [...] trend in Wing Commander- and - type games. Instead of the action simply coming to the player, it flows all around, and the player {{is the one who}} has to go and seek it. The scenes of these giant ships duking it out, with many gnat-like fighters swarming around in their little dances of death, have led reviewers to feel a sense of epicness, comparable to reliving battles in science fiction series like Babylon 5 and Star Wars. Similarly, PC Gamer praised the scaling of ships and battles and said that they [...] " [...] as close to creating <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> World War II naval battle in space as any game has ever come" [...] and that [...] "That's what fighter combat, in space or on Earth, should be all about.".|$|E
50|$|Many {{instances}} of interpersonal emotion regulation, {{such as those}} described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whole group <b>of</b> followers {{to make them feel}} more enthusiastic and motivated. Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence <b>the</b> <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.|$|R

500|$|Digital rights advocates, {{including}} the Free Software Foundation, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle, {{have criticized the}} iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with GigaOM, was quoted by National Public Radio as saying, [...] "With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [...] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you." [...] But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> safe neighborhood, saying, [...] "Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too." [...] Laura Sydell, the article's author, concludes, [...] "As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community." [...] The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.|$|E
500|$|The song {{features}} a Motown sound-style [...] "telegraph key" [...] rhythm, which gave it <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pop song. This and the [...] "baby, baby" [...] refrain gave the song a throwaway quality that {{fit in with}} Achtung Babys mission of deconstructing U2's image. Paradoxically, the arrangement also featured U2's 1980s [...] "repeato-riff" [...] guitar style {{and the rest of}} the lyric was a serious love song that dealt with themes of anxiety and despair. [...] Bono has described [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] as [...] "an epic U2 song [...] the key of it left my voice in a conversational place and allowed a different kind of lyric writing." [...] Producer Eno wrote that a combination of opposites within each song was a signature characteristic of Achtung Baby and that as part of that, [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] had a [...] "helicopterish melancholy". [...] In Achtung Babys album package, [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] is presented next to a photograph of a crumbling Berlin building that has a Trabant parked in front of it.|$|E
500|$|With {{the season}} reinventing the series again, {{composer}} Bear McCreary expanded {{the sound of}} the score [...] "in a big way". In addition to introducing new themes for the characters of Lash and Rosalind Price, McCreary made some changes to the orchestra: [...] "To represent Lash, I brought in larger percussion: merciless pounding taikos that I digitally compressed and distorted. This new, mangled percussion sound is horrific, and will become increasingly important as the season progresses." [...] McCreary also brought in trombones [...] "to get the scariest sound possible," [...] which resulted in the recording space being reconfigured when they were recorded. For Price, her scenes with Coulson [...] "give the series <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dense political thriller...I really leaned into that, musically. I introduce light acoustic percussion, mostly egg shakers, to give the pulsing synths a softer edge. And I used an acoustic piano to play the [...] "Rosalind Theme" [...] at key moments in her scenes...her music is meant to add intrigue and suspicion, and simultaneously allow us to have some fun with their witty banter." [...] For [...] "Maveth", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.|$|E
