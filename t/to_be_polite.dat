5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Drew (Drew Carey) {{and his friends}} Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) in their local bar, the Warsaw Tavern, {{discussing}} Brad Pitt. The following day, Drew's best friend Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) tells him that she has broken up with her boyfriend, who then fired her from {{her job as a}} receptionist at his body shop. Desperate for a job, Kate asks Drew to hire her at the Winfred-Louder department store where he is the assistant director of personnel. Drew insists that he cannot hire his friends. At Winfred-Louder, Drew's boss Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak) asks him to hire someone for a position at the cosmetics counter. While conducting interviews, Drew meets Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney), a hostile woman who wears too much eye shadow. Drew tries <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> but Mimi soon realizes {{he is not going to}} give her the job and accuses Drew of being sexist. Mimi complains to Mr. Bell about Drew, getting him into trouble.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds that she should be tested for herpes.|$|E
5|$|The group {{intentionally}} avoids {{any area}} where crime rates {{could result in}} frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> and are warned {{to stay away from}} illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. There also settle away from military of police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandoes are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or an decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as Manteca for firearms or Libretas for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.|$|E
50|$|Negative affectivity {{can produce}} several {{interpersonal}} benefits. It can cause subjects <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>polite</b> and considerate with others. Unlike positive mood, which causes less assertive approaches, negative affectivity can, in many ways, cause a person <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>polite</b> and elaborate when making requests.|$|R

25|$|The {{courtesy}} campaign {{conducted by}} the STPB was meant to teach Singaporeans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> only to tourists {{for the benefit of}} the tourist industry. Then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's had followed the courtesy campaigns by the STPB with 'interest and amusement: interest because most people were responsive to the campaign; amusement because no one protested that it was absurd to teach Singaporeans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to tourists’.|$|E
25|$|Delgado's {{portrayal}} of the Master {{was that of a}} suave and charming sociopathic individual, able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> and murderous at almost the same time. His design is homage to the classic Svengali character: a black Nehru outfit with a beard and moustache.|$|E
25|$|Basil Fawlty, {{played by}} John Cleese, is a cynical and snobbish misanthrope who is desperate {{to belong to}} a higher social class. He sees a {{successful}} hotel as a means of achieving this ("turn it into an establishment of class...") yet his job forces him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to people he despises.|$|E

25|$|The Stationmaster and The Postmaster – Both {{officials}} {{attend the}} Gayevs' party in Act III. Although they both play minor roles (the Stationmaster attempts to recite a poem, and the Postmaster flirts with Dunyasha), they are mostly {{symbols of the}} deprecation of the aristocracy in 1900s Russia – Firs comments that, whereas once they had barons and lords at the ball, now it's the postman and the stationmaster, and even they come only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite.</b>|$|E
25|$|German {{soldiers}} were ordered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to the islanders, {{and in the}} beginning, they were. There were no rules against them fraternising {{so long as they}} behaved like gentlemen. Soldiers were punished for crimes against civilians. As the war progressed and {{soldiers were}} rotated out to other war zones, however, the quality of soldiers decreased, affecting their manners and attitudes. Serious problems started to arise {{in the last year of}} occupation when food was in short supply.|$|E
25|$|Harvey and Bryant's {{father were}} now dead, {{and he became}} {{increasingly}} lonely. From 1993 to late 1995, he visited various overseas countries fourteen times and a summary of his domestic airline travel filled three pages. He hated the destinations he travelled to, as he found that people there avoided him {{just as they did}} in Tasmania. However, he enjoyed the flights, as he could speak to the people sitting adjacent to him who had no choice but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite.</b> Bryant later took great joy in describing some of the more successful conversations he had with fellow passengers.|$|E

25|$|While Genie {{lived with}} the Riglers her mother usually met with her once {{a week at a}} park or restaurant, and their {{relationship}} continued to grow stronger. Although the Riglers never expressed antipathy towards Genie's mother their efforts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to her inadvertently came off as condescension, and years later Marilyn said she was uncomfortable acting as a mother to Genie in her house with Genie's real mother present. With the exception of Jay Shurley, who felt the other scientists did not treat her as an equal, Genie's mother did not get along well with the other researchers, some of whom disliked her due to her apathy during Genie's childhood. The scientists speculated Genie's mother gave them a mostly cool reception because they reminded her of her earlier inaction on behalf of her children, and David Rigler also thought she was in denial about Genie's condition and the hand she had in causing it. Curtiss wrote that Genie's mother often gave conflicting statements about her married life and Genie's childhood, seemingly saying what she thought people wanted to hear, which the research team believed was out of fear of reprobation or ostracism for telling the truth.|$|E
500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> and all it did was get me picked on. I fucking hate that man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis. Munky said the band were going to send it to the radio as a joke because they [...] "knew they wouldn't play it, then follow up about a week later with the real thing". [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an Acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex". Davis explained the background behind [...] "Good God": [...] "Ass Itch" [...] is about Davis' difficulty with songwriting. [...] "Kill You" [...] is about Davis' ex-stepmother. Davis explained: ...|$|E
2500|$|Mary Baldwin, a 70-year-old fellow-internee, {{did not get}} on {{well with}} Agnes, suspecting that she was [...] "too ready <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> and {{co-operative}} with the Japanese guards and their officers in return for favours — notably food and medicine for her infant son." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1861, Okita became Head Coach (Jukutou) at the Shieikan. Even {{though he}} <b>was</b> often commented <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest, <b>polite,</b> and good-natured by those around him, he <b>was</b> also known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a strict and quick-tempered teacher to his students.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} no {{difficulties}} with Don Jose Santierra," [...] he said, somewhat coldly ignoring her hilarity, [...] "but perhaps he <b>is</b> not inclined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as <b>polite</b> <b>to</b> the friend of the husband as he <b>is</b> <b>to</b> the wife." ...|$|R
50|$|William Shatner, Michael J. Fox and Catherine OHara came {{onto the}} stadium floor and {{delivered}} comedic monologues playing on stereotypes of Canadians. OHaras section involved {{the tendency of}} Canadians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overly <b>polite</b> and apologetic. Shatners section involved beer. Foxs section involved urban areas and terrain.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Cuccinelli stated [...] "homosexuality is wrong." [...] During his 2009 {{campaign}} for attorney general, he stated [...] "My {{view is that}} homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong. They’re intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural law based country it’s appropriate to have policies that reflect that. ... They don’t comport with natural law. I happen {{to think that it}} represents (to put it politely; I need my thesaurus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite)</b> behavior that is not healthy to an individual and in aggregate is not healthy to society." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{siege of}} Run {{was unable to}} succeed, however, {{for more than a}} year, as An was one of Huainan's most capable officers. [...] Yang thus sought, in vain, to persuade An to submit to him again. [...] By spring 905, however, Wang was able to {{penetrate}} Run's defenses by digging tunnels under the city walls. [...] An personally took position up in a tower, and initially the Huainan troops were still hesitant to attack him there. [...] As the officer Li Decheng continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite</b> to An during the siege, however, An surrendered to Li Decheng and was subsequently executed.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason for}} slow sales was styling and concept. [...] The Berlina's styling was, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> not happy and that {{reflected}} in the especially poor sales for this model. While most Alfa Romeo sedans in the marque's history outsold the more specialised sporting models in the same range, the 2600 Berlina did not outsell the 2600 Sprint or Spider. [...] The 2600 Spider had styling which was seen to be derivative of that of its smaller stablemate, the Giulietta Spider: certainly handsome, but lacking the smaller car's grace and balance. [...] The larger car's handling also suffered perhaps unfair comparison {{with that of the}} Giulietta Spider, and this {{is an important factor in}} a car with sporting pretensions. One sales point in its favor was that it was a four-seater convertible, though the two rear seats were fairly cramped.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} enough room at the party you may take part in folk dances. In these dances and at the table men ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gentlemen and try <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>polite</b> and respect the ladies. Of course, no songs and dances {{accepted}} at “khelehi” (funeral banquets).|$|R
50|$|Two ruffians {{approached}} Jong-nam and Jeong-an {{while they}} {{rested on the}} rock. The ruffians talked harshly, and Jong-nam ordered them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>polite.</b> The ruffians tried to Jeong-an, and Jong-nam put up a struggle with the ruffians as Jeong-an ran and hid {{at the back of}} the tree.|$|R
6000|$|She forced {{down her}} upper lip, as if afraid that <b>to</b> smile <b>was</b> not <b>polite.</b> [...] "He <b>was</b> a funny gentleman; he made us laugh. I {{think he is}} very clever." ...|$|R
2500|$|Former New Age {{practitioner}} Karla McLaren {{has spoken}} about developing {{a system of}} cold reading without realising, saying in a 2004 interview that [...] "I didn't understand that I had long used a form of cold reading in my own work! I was never taught cold reading and I never intended to defraud anyone; I simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis." [...] McLaren has said that since she was always very perceptive, she could easily figure out {{many of the issues}} that people brought into sessions with them. In order to reduce the appearance of unusual expertise that might have created a power differential, she posed her observations as questions rather than facts. This attempt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> she realized, actually invited the other person, as McLaren has said, to [...] "lean into the reading" [...] and give her more pertinent information.|$|E
2500|$|The Tungans, {{more than}} Han, are {{the enemy of}} our people. Today our people are already free from the oppression of the Han, but still {{continue}} live under Tungan subjugation. We must still fear the Han, but cannot not fear the Tungans also. The reason, we must be careful to guard against the Tungans, we must intensively oppose them, cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>polite,</b> since the Tungans have compelled us to follow this way. Yellow Han people have not the slightest {{thing to do with}} Eastern Turkestan. Black Tungans also do not have this connection. Eastern Turkestan belongs to the people of Eastern Turkestan. There is no need for foreigners to come be our fathers and mothers...From now on we do not need to use foreigner's language or their names, their customs, habits, attitudes, written languages and etc. We must also overthrow and drive foreigners from our boundaries forever. The colours yellow and black are foul...They have dirtied our Land for too long. So now it's absolutely necessary to clean out this filth. Take down the yellow and black barbarians! Live long Eastern Turkestan! ...|$|E

50|$|Mary King - Jack's younger sister, she pilots Texas Mack's Hat Machine. Mary tends <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>polite</b> {{and speaks}} much better Japanese (though still {{with a heavy}} Texan accent and strange emphasis). She and Shou are good friends. Mary handles the more {{technical}} operations for Texas Mack, allowing Jack to focus on fighting.|$|R
60|$|We feel {{as much at}} home now, {{in these}} {{continental}} railroad stations, as in our own--nay, more so.

50|$|A kind-hearted {{priest who}} enjoys {{drinking}} tea. He teaches orphaned {{children how to}} read and write before they are adopted by new parents.

Glenn often reminds Fern <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more <b>polite,</b> particularly towards Merleawe.|$|R
