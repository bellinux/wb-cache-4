5|$|Although still {{billed as}} having been the most {{extensive}} television coverage of the Pan American Games ever broadcast in the country, <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> faced criticism {{for the amount of}} coverage it produced and broadcast from the 2015 Pan American Games. Only condensed, tape-delayed highlights of events aired on CBC Television, drawing comparisons to the similar practices imposed by NBC's coverage of the Olympics. Most events were streamed online, and pay television channel Sportsnet aired the soccer tournaments on TV, but events in some sports received only limited online coverage, or were not broadcast at all. Part-way through the Games, <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> expanded its primetime coverage block, while broadcasts of a semi-final game in men's basketball on Sportsnet and the baseball finals online were added at the last minute. Critics perceived these last-minute changes as signs that <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> had underestimated viewer interest in the Pan-Am Games.|$|E

5|$|Adam Gopnik was {{selected}} to deliver the 2011 Massey Lectures, the annual week-long series of lectures on a political, cultural or philosophical topic given in Canada by a noted scholar. Gopnik was chosen by the panel of representatives from Massey College, House of Anansi Press and <b>the</b> <b>CBC,</b> the organizations responsible for coordinating the lectures. This would be the 50th anniversary of the Massey Lectures and coincide with the 75th anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>CBC.</b> Ideas executive producer Bernie Lucht contacted Gopnik by email to inform him of the panel's decision and {{to ask if he}} would accept. At the time Gopnik was living in New York City, working as a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He had previously authored several books on different topics, the most successful being Paris to the Moon, a collection of essays published in 2000. Gopnik read Lucht's email while waiting for a bus on Madison Avenue. Gopnik later stated {{that by the end of}} the 20-minute bus ride he had already selected a topic and had a good idea of the issues he would address.|$|E

25|$|CBC Sports {{suffered}} {{another major}} blow {{when it was}} announced that after the 2007 season, the CFL regular season games and the Grey Cup would be moving to TSN, ending <b>the</b> <b>CBC's</b> tenure with <b>the</b> CFL. It has been stated that the CFL was not happy with <b>the</b> <b>CBC's</b> lackluster production during <b>the</b> <b>CBC's</b> 2005 union lockout, which forced the network to use CBC management to work the behind the scenes telecast and use stadium public address announcers in place of their regular announcer crew.|$|R
5|$|As of 2014, live {{coverage}} of the rodeo and Rangeland Derby competitions are broadcast by <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> Sports website and Sportsnet One.

5|$|In 2001, Canadian sketch comedy troupe Royal Canadian Air Farce {{featured}} Riel in its send-up of <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> {{documentary series}} Canada: A People's History.

5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> had superior market placement (with respect to geographic coverage and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> 2005 lock-out. <b>The</b> <b>CBC</b> also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly higher price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E
5|$|Opinions {{criticizing the}} site rapidly spread {{throughout}} the blogosphere around early 2007. Schlafly appeared on radio programs Today on BBC Radio 4 and All Things Considered on NPR to discuss the site around that time. In May 2008, Schlafly {{and one of his}} homeschooled students appeared on <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> program The Hour for the same purpose.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, {{the game}} drew strong ratings {{on both sides}} of the border.

In the United States, Versus averaged 608,000 viewers, and peaked above 700,000. For Versus, it represented the fourth-most watched regular season game in the network's history, and was the highest rated all-Canadian NHL game on an American cable channel since Nielsen began tracking such ratings.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper {{issued a}} formal apology, {{on behalf of}} the sitting Cabinet, in front of an {{audience}} of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on <b>the</b> <b>CBC,</b> for the past governments' policies of assimilation. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a Committee of the Whole was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led to calls for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> Ombudsman into the veracity of the claims {{and the way in which}} they were presented.|$|E
5|$|A Short History of Progress is a non-fiction {{book and}} lecture series by Ronald Wright about {{societal}} collapse. The lectures were delivered {{as a series}} of five speeches, each taking place in different cities across Canada as part of the 2004 Massey Lectures which were broadcast on <b>the</b> <b>CBC</b> Radio program, Ideas. The book version was published by House of Anansi Press and released {{at the same time as}} the lectures. The book spent more than a year on Canadian best-seller lists, won the Canadian Book Association's Libris Award for Non-Fiction Book of the Year, and was nominated for the British Columbia's National Award for Canadian Non-Fiction. It has since been reprinted in a hardcover format with illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Fox's {{family lived}} in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father's career. The family finally moved to the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, British Columbia, when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack. Fox {{attended}} Burnaby Central Secondary School, and now has a theatre named for him in Burnaby South Secondary. At age 15, Fox starred in the Canadian television series Leo and Me, produced by <b>the</b> <b>CBC,</b> and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided {{to move back to}} Vancouver. Fox is one of four members of the Leo and Me cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role.|$|E
