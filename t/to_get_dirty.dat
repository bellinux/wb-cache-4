500|$|Buttercup (voiced by E. G. Daily) is {{the toughest}} of the three. Her {{personality}} ingredient is spice, her signature color is green, and she has short black hair in a flip. She is a fun-loving tomboy who loves <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dirty,</b> fights hard and plays rough; she does not plan and is all action. Buttercup is the only Powerpuff Girl without a unique super power (aside {{from being able to}} curl her tongue as shown in the episode [...] "Nuthin' Special"). McCracken originally wanted to name the character [...] "Bud" [...] until a friend suggested the name Buttercup.|$|E
500|$|Double Dare revitalized {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} a game show for children. Less than a year after the program launched, NBC had premiered I'm Telling!, Lorimar Television had announced plans for Fun House, and Nickelodeon's Finders Keepers began airingall shows based on competition between teams of children. During Double Dares first year on television, junior versions of established game shows including Hollywood Squares and The Cross-Wits were developed for syndication, but ultimately were not produced. Game show executive and producer Bob Boden noted that Double Dare [...] "allowed kids <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dirty</b> {{and have a good time}} in ways that really were not acceptable before that show". Double Dare remains the longest-running game show produced by Nickelodeon.|$|E
500|$|Four years later, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] {{was added}} to the set list of the 2008-09 Sticky & Sweet Tour, where it was used as a video interlude. It {{featured}} Madonna as a boxer on screen, while two of her dancers performed a faux boxing match. The video also showed Madonna in a technical knockout match, spraying her blood across the screen. Madonna's DJ Enferno remixed the song and the performance ended with the singer falling down {{on the ground in the}} video, as she emerged from beneath the stage while jump-roping. Paul Schrodt from Slant Magazine felt that the video emphasized the singer's [...] "already-muscular arms", adding that [...] "nlike your run-of-the-mill diva, Madonna is willing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dirty</b> for her art, and she sometimes gets lost in her backup dancers' routine, though she's quick to remind the audience, 'I'm still the one in control'". Ben Kaplan from Canada.com noted that [...] "Die Another Day", along with the performances of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] and [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] are re-imagined as [...] "parts of larger medleys, with Madonna giving shout-outs to techno, flamenco and old-school R influences". This performance was included on the Sticky & Sweet Tour live CD and DVD release, recorded during Madonna's shows in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in December 2008.|$|E

60|$|The last {{preliminary}} to {{be noticed}} is the slowness with which the printer's ink hardens on the slab, and the rapidity with which it dries on paper. While serviceable for hours in the former case, in the latter it will be dry in a very few seconds. The drying or hardening of this oily ink has nothing whatever {{to do with the}} loss of moisture in the ordinary sense of the word, that is to say, of the loss of the contained water: it is wholly due to oxidisation of the oil. An extremely thin oxidised film soon forms {{on the surface of the}} layer on the slab, and this shields the lower-lying portions of the layer from the air, and retards further oxidisation. But paper is very unlike a polished slab; it is a fine felt, full of minute interstices. When a printed period (.) is placed under the microscope it looks like a drop of tar in the middle of a clean bird's-nest. The ink is minutely divided among the interstices of the paper, and a large surface being thereby exposed to the air, it oxidises at once, while a print from the finger upon glass will not dry for two or three days. One effect of oxidisation is to give a granulated appearance to the ink on rollers which have been allowed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>dirty.</b> This granulation leaves clots on the slab which are fatal to good work: whenever they are seen, the roller must be cleaned at once.|$|E
