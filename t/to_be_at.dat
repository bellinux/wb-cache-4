5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid.

Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, are considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some authorities to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E

5|$|In the lowcountry {{region of}} coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{was the most}} common horse for most of the breed's history.

Today there are 276 living animals recognized by the breed registry, including 153 mares and 123 stallions and geldings. The Equus Survival Trust considers the breed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> critical/nearly extinct levels, meaning that there are fewer than 100 breeding mares in existence. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers the Marsh Tacky (which they consider a strain of the Colonial Spanish horse) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> critical levels, meaning that there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and an estimated global population of less than 2,000. Representatives of the ALBC state that the breed numbers will have to increase to an estimated 1,000 members to ensure permanent survival. On June 11, 2010, a bill was signed into law that made the Carolina Marsh Tacky the state heritage horse of South Carolina.|$|E
