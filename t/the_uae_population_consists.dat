40|$|This is {{the first}} study to {{demonstrate}} significant differences between two natural Trinidadian guppy populations in susceptibility to a pathogenic monogenean parasite, Gyrodactylus turnbulli. Following experimental infection with an isogenic laboratory culture of G. turnbulli, fish from <b>the</b> Upper Aripo (<b>UA)</b> lost parasites more slowly and carried up to {{three times as many}} parasites at peak infection than did those from the Lower Aripo (LA). <b>The</b> <b>UA</b> <b>population</b> appeared to be more susceptible than the LA fish, even though fish of both populations were naïve to this particular laboratory strain of G. turnbulli and had not encountered any gyrodactylid infection for at least 65 days. The parasite infection reduced the feeding response and feeding activity of UA and LA fish to a similar extent. Our findings suggest that this ectoparasite may have an important impact on the evolutionary biology of guppies (and possibly of other teleosts), particularly as the prevalence of Gyrodactylus infection in natural populations may be as high as 50 %. We discuss the role of parasite infections on natural and sexual selection, the good genes model and the implications for immunogenetics in small genetically isolated host population...|$|R

Methods MRI was performed on the head and neck of a healthy young male participant in the axial, coronal and sagittal planes to acquire images of <b>the</b> <b>UA.</b> <b>The</b> level set method was used to segment the boundary of <b>the</b> <b>UA.</b> <b>The</b> boundaries in the three scanning planes were regis-tered according to the positions of crossing points and anatomical characteristics using a Matlab program.
