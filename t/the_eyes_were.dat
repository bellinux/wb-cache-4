5|$|Compsognathus were small, bipedal {{animals with}} long hind legs and longer tails, which they used for balance during locomotion. The forelimbs were {{smaller than the}} hindlimbs and {{featured}} three digits equipped with solid claws suited for grasping prey. Their delicate skulls were narrow and long, with tapered snouts. The skull had five pairs of fenestrae (skull openings), the largest of which was for the orbit (eye socket). <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> large {{in proportion to the}} rest of the skull.|$|E
5|$|Some figurines {{have been}} defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols. In December 2008, for example, a {{fiberglass}} Baby Jesus valued at US$375 {{was stolen from}} a Eureka Springs, Arkansas park and later recovered, but had been defaced by racial slurs, a swastika, and a Hitler mustache. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> also blacked out and pieces had been broken off, rendering it damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat was}} a uniform bluish-grey, with a pale whitish belly, {{which was not}} contrasted on the flanks. The limbs had a faint dark line along their front surface. The {{forehead}} was brown, darker than the face, and the upper lip and patch in front of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> lighter than the body. The neck-mane was directed forwards and not as developed as in the roan and sable antelopes, and the throat-mane was almost absent. Other differences between the bluebuck and its extant relatives included its shorter and blunter ears not tipped with black, a darker tail tuft (though little darker than its general colour), and smaller teeth. The bluebuck also lacked the contrasting black and white patterns seen on the heads of its relatives.|$|E

50|$|The {{relative}} {{strength of}} these two forces depends on which way <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> looking. When <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> adducted (looking toward the nose), the force of depression increases. When <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> abducted (looking away from the nose), the force of intorsion increases, while the force of depression decreases. When <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> primary position (looking straight ahead), contraction of the superior oblique produces depression and intorsion in roughly equal amounts.|$|R
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a marionette act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E
5|$|The {{blunt and}} short claws of Deinocheirus {{are similar to}} those of the therizinosaur Alxasaurus, which {{indicates}} the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as Tarbosaurus, but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for display behaviour. Deinocheirus was likely diurnal (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the foramen magnum (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> {{believed}} to <b>be</b> expressive, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> portrayed in Maitum jars are given high regard in describing <b>the</b> dead. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> classified to four major shapes: (1) Almond, (2) Ovaloid, (3) Round, and (4) Rectangular.|$|R
5000|$|For Series 13 <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>was</b> exactly <b>the</b> {{same shape}} and size as the {{previous}} series.

40|$|The method {{involves}} visually {{following a}} three-dimensional moving object (2). Simultaneously, {{the position of}} the viewing angle of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> measured and <b>the</b> movement of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> determined. <b>The</b> measured <b>eye</b> movement <b>is</b> compared with the object movement. Preferably, the three-dimensional moving image is generated using a three-dimensional computer display (1). The position of the angle of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> measured using <b>the</b> reflected images of a light source (3) on <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> surfaces. USE - E. g. for determining ability of stereoscopic view, testing reactions. ADVANTAGE - Does not require analysis of patient's reactions...|$|R
5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E
25|$|Fish were mummified in mass {{quantities}} as {{offerings to}} the god. They were wrapped in linen and {{held together by}} bands of cloth soaked in sticky resin, permanently encasing the mummies. Many times, black circles representing <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> painted on the hardened linen. Several species of fish have been identified, but due to the deteriorating condition of the mummies, scientists are unable to conclude if the organs were typically removed {{during the process of}} mummification.|$|E
25|$|The Gemarah of the Babylonian Talmud {{contains}} homiletic {{descriptions of}} the importance of the practice, including an argument that washing before meals is so important that neglecting it is tantamount to unchastity, and risks divine punishment in the form of sudden destruction or poverty. The discussion of mayim acharonim, washing after meals, contains a suggestion that washing after meals, as a health measure, is the more important of the two washings, on grounds that the salt used as a preservative in food could cause blindness if <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> rubbed without washing.|$|E
25|$|A diving mask (also half mask, {{dive mask}} or scuba mask) is {{an item of}} diving {{equipment}} that allows underwater divers, including, scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When <b>the</b> human <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{in direct contact with}} water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> refracted by a different angle and <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> unable to focus the light. By providing an air space in front of <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> light enters normally and <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> able to focus correctly.|$|R

25|$|The ostracoderm armour {{consisted}} of 3–5mm polygonal plates that shielded {{the head and}} gills, and then overlapped further down the body like scales. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> particularly shielded. Earlier chordates used their gills for both respiration and feeding, whereas ostracoderms used their gills for respiration only. They had up to eight separate pharyngeal gill pouches {{along the side of}} the head, which were permanently open with no protective operculum. Unlike invertebrates that use ciliated motion to move food, ostracoderms used their muscular pharynx to create a suction that pulled small and slow moving prey into their mouths.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other therapsids, dicynodonts {{had very}} short snouts and no teeth {{except for the}} tusk-like upper canines. Dicynodonts are {{generally}} thought to have had horny beaks like those of turtles, for shearing off pieces of vegetation which were then ground on a horny secondary palate when the mouth was closed. The jaw joint was weak and moved backwards and forwards with a shearing action, instead of the more common sideways or up and down movements. It is thought that the jaw muscles were attached unusually far forward on the skull and took {{up a lot of}} space on the top and back of the skull. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> set high and well forward on the skull, and the face was short.|$|E
25|$|The {{laughing}} owl's plumage was yellowish-brown striped {{with dark}} brown. There were white straps on the scapulars, and occasionally the hind neck. Mantle feathers were edged with white. The wings and tail had light brown bars. The tarsus had yellowish to reddish-buff feathers. The facial disc was white behind {{and below the}} eyes, fading to grey with brown stripes towards the centre. Some birds were more rufous, with a brown facial disk; this was at first attributed to subspecific differences, but is probably better related to individual variation. There are indications that males were more often of the richly coloured morph (e.g. the Linz specimen OÖLM 1941/433). <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> very dark orange. Its length was 35.5–40cm (14-15.7") and wing length 26.4cm (10.4"), with males being smaller than females. Weight was around 600grams.|$|E

40|$|A Drowsy Driver Detection System is an Image {{processing}} based system. This {{system is}} developed using a non-intrusive machine vision based concepts. In this system, {{there is a}} camera that will be continuously monitoring the driver’s face to detect fatigue. In case the driver is detected as fatigue, the system issues an alarm. This system detects drowsiness by checking {{the amount of time}} <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> closed. <b>The</b> first five consecutive frames of the camera <b>is</b> checked, if <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> found closed in all the five frames, then the system issues alarm. Before determining whether <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open or closed, it is required to determine eye location. To determine <b>eye</b> location, <b>the</b> images captured from the camera are binarized. This binary version of the image help to find the edges of the face, which narrows the area of where <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> may exist. Once the face area <b>is</b> found, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> found by computing the horizontal averages in the area.

25|$|Ichthyosaur species {{varied from}} one to over sixteen metres in length. Ichthyosaurs resembled both modern fish and dolphins. Their limbs had been fully {{transformed}} into flippers, which sometimes contained {{a very large number}} of digits and phalanges. At least some species possessed a dorsal fin. Their heads were pointed, and the jaws often were equipped with conical teeth to catch smaller prey. Some species had larger, bladed teeth to attack large animals. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> very large, probably for deep diving. The neck was short, and later species had a rather stiff trunk. These also had a more vertical tail fin, used for a powerful propulsive stroke. The vertebral column, made of simplified disc-like vertebrae, continued into the lower lobe of the tail fin. Ichthyosaurs were air-breathing, bore live young, and were probably warm-blooded.|$|E
25|$|The Natural History of Horses by 19th-century author Charles Hamilton Smith also {{described}} tarpans. According to Smith, the herds of wild horses numbered {{from a few}} to hundred individuals. They often were mixed with domestic horses, and alongside pure herds there were herds of feral horses or hybrids. The color of pure tarpans was described as constantly brown, cream-colored or mouse-colored. The short frizzy mane {{was reported to be}} black, as were the tail and legs. The ears either were of varying size, but set up high at the skull. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> small. According to Smith, tarpans made stronger sounds than domestic horses and the overall appearance of these wild horses was mule-like. A tarpan herd survived in the Zoo of Zamość until 1806, when the reserve had to sell them because of economic problems. They were dispersed onto the local farms at the Biłgoraj region, tamed and bred to domestic horses. According to Kozmian, wild horses had been exterminated in the Polish wilderness shortly before, because they damaged hay collected for livestock.|$|E
25|$|In 1747, the Durrani kingdom was {{established}} by a Pakhtun general, Ahmad Shah Abdali, and included Balochistan, Peshawar, Daman, Multan, Sindh, and Punjab. In the south, a succession of autonomous dynasties (the Daudpotas, Kalhoras and Talpurs) had asserted the independence of Sind, {{from the end of}} Aurangzeb's reign. The first time Ahmad Shah invaded Hindustan, the Mughal imperial army checked his advance successfully. Yet subsequent events led to a double alliance, one by marriage and another politically, between the Afghan King and the Mughal Emperor. The battle of Panipat was the effect of this political alliance. After the victory of Panipat, Ahmad Shah Durrani actually was Shahan Shah not only of Afghanistan but even of Hindustan, when the lawful Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II could not strike coin bearing his name nor order the Khutba to be read in his name before Ahmad Shah allowed him to do so. The influence of Durrani monarch continued in Northern India up to his death. All <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> always turned towards Afghanistan whenever a new danger appeared on the political sky of Hindustan.|$|E
50|$|According to Liem et al., the {{organogenesis}} of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> {{pointed out}} {{as an example of}} a developmental cascade of inductions. <b>The</b> <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> essentially a derivative of the ectoderm from the somatic ectoderm and neural tube, with a succession of inductions by the chordamesoderm.|$|R
50|$|Pupillary {{diameter}}. Light {{falling in}} one <b>eye</b> affects <b>the</b> {{diameter of the}} pupils in both eyes. One can easily see this by looking at a friend's eye while he or she closes the other: when <b>the</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> open, <b>the</b> pupil of <b>the</b> first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> small; when <b>the</b> other <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> closed, <b>the</b> pupil of <b>the</b> first <b>eye</b> <b>is</b> large.|$|R

25|$|Eye {{tracking}} device {{is a tool}} created to help measure eye and head movements. The first devices for tracking eye movement took two main forms: those that relied on a mechanical connection between participant and recording instrument, and those in which light or some other form of electromagnetic energy was directed at the participant's eyes and its reflection measured and recorded. In 1883, Lamare {{was the first to}} use a mechanical connection, by placing a blunt needle on the participant's upper eyelid. The needle picked up the sound produced by each saccade and transmitted it as a faint clicking to the experimenter's ear through an amplifying membrane and a rubber tube. The rationale behind this device was that saccades are easier to perceive and register aurally than visually. In 1889, Edmund B. Delabarre invented a system of recording eye movement directly onto a rotating drum by means of a stylus with a direct mechanical connection to the cornea. Other devices involving physical contact with the surface of <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> developed and used {{from the end of the}} 19th century until the late 1920s; these included such items as rubber balloons and eye caps.|$|E
25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. <b>The</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>were</b> opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E
500|$|The lion was {{constructed}} for the prototype. 3D Studio Max {{was used to}} build the wire-mesh frame, and then Adobe Photoshop was used to skin the creature.
