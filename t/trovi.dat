5000|$|A {{program called}} [...] "Conduit Search Protect", {{better known as}} [...] "Search Protect by conduit", can cause severe system errors upon uninstallation. It claims to protect browser {{settings}} but actually blocks all attempts to manipulate a browser through the settings page; in other words, it makes sure the malicious settings remain unchanged. Search Protect has an option to change the search homepage from the [...] "recommended" [...] search home page <b>Trovi,</b> however, users have reported it changing back to <b>Trovi</b> {{after a period of}} time. The uninstall program for Search Protect can cause Windows to be unbootable because the uninstall file not only removes its own files, but also all the boot files in the root of the C: drive. and leaves a BackGroundContainer.dll file in the start-up registry. Conduit is associated with malware, spyware, and adware, as victims of this hijacker have reported unwanted pop-ups and embedded in-text advertisements, on sites without ads.|$|E

For example, aŭti to listen (for), aŭdi to hear; trofi to look for, <b>trovi</b> to find; prufi to argue (a point), pruvi to prove. Traces of this remain in a few pairs of words such as pesi to weigh (an item) and pezi to weigh (have weight) (cf. their derivatives pesilo scales & pezilo a weight).|$|E
50|$|Only one man, Johnny Wendt, has {{returned}} from the first expedition to Mars. Efforts to determine {{what happened to the}} others are in vain; four pages of the ship's log are missing, and Johnny's companion, Doug Laughlin, apparently wandered off to die in the desert. Johnny's girlfriend, Lisa <b>Trovi,</b> and a psychiatrist named Phil Kutler try to cure Johnny by luring him to the Moon and getting him to grapple with whatever happened on Mars. Johnny reacts so badly that they return to Earth as quickly as possible.|$|E
