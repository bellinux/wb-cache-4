5|$|In 1829, the {{legislature}} appointed commissioners <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> canal and layout the surrounding town. The commissioners employed James Thompson to survey and plat {{the town of}} Chicago, {{which at the time}} had a population of less than 100. Historians regard the August 4, 1830, filing of the plat as the official recognition of a municipalitely known as Chicago. Block 37 is one of the city's original 58 blocks in the layout of the town,.|$|E

5|$|In June 1838 Barry {{and colleagues}} {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} Britain <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> supply of stone for the building, eventually choosing Magnesian Limestone from the Anston quarry of the Duke of Leeds. Work started on building the river frontage on 1 January 1839, and Barry's wife laid the foundation stone on 27 April 1840. The stone was badly quarried and handled, and with the polluted atmosphere in London {{it proved to be}} problematic, with the first signs of deterioration showing in 1849, and extensive renovations required periodically.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton (1687) refined van Roomen's solution, so {{that the}} solution-circle centers were located at the intersections of a line with a circle. Newton formulates Apollonius' problem as a problem in trilateration: <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> point Z from three given points A, B and C, such that the {{differences}} in distances from Z to the three given points have known values. These four points correspond {{to the center of}} the solution circle (Z) and the centers of the three given circles (A, B and C).|$|E
5|$|The Albert Dock {{was officially}} re-opened in 1988 by The Prince of Wales, the great-great-great-grandson of Prince Albert, {{the man who}} had {{originally}} opened the docks. It was timed to coincide {{with the opening of the}} newly finished Tate Liverpool, which was dubbed the 'Tate of the north' and at the time the only one outside London. The decision <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> Tate gallery in Liverpool was seen as a major success for the city, as it made Liverpool home to the National Collection of modern art in the North of England.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Storm Dorothy moved {{further into}} the Caribbean Sea, it began a gradual {{weakening}} trend initiated by a persistent tropical upper tropospheric trough, {{as well as the}} presence of strong wind shear and a lack of inflow. Hurricane Hunter flights late on August21 and early on August22 failed <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> closed low-level circulation, and as a result the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression. After another flight into the system could not detect a circulation, the NHC discontinued advisories on Dorothy to the south of Hispaniola late on August22. Around the same time, thunderstorms increased in association with the cyclone, and forecasters remarked the potential for re-intensification over the western Caribbean Sea. However, the storm became more disorganized, and on August23 Dorothy degenerated into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|As life in Armenia grew {{relatively}} more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> {{woman he had}} met several years earlier, Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in Nakhichevan with her family, had been married to an Armenian officer {{who had been killed}} during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who {{went on to become a}} painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Galena {{remained}} on the James River after the battle and returned to City Point. She shelled Confederate soldiers along the river banks and bombarded City Point to cover a landing force which {{set fire to the}} depots. On 27 June, Major General McClellan came aboard the ship <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> new camp which was later established near Harrison's Landing. On 30 June, McClellan was compelled to withdraw down the James, covered by gunfire from Galena and the other gunboats. They continued to support his forces until they were transferred to Northern Virginia. Galena patrolled the river to defend transports and supply ships against Confederate raids and ambushes until she was detached from the James River Flotilla in September 1862 Galena and Monitor were retained at Newport News, Virginia, in case the Confederate ironclads building at Richmond sortied into Hampton Roads.|$|E

30|$|Meeting {{localization}} efficiency requirement: the localization efficiency {{comes for}} the fact that a sensor is able <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> itself anywhere anytime and <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>an</b> incident when detected. Efficiency also depends on the control of the errors made on the computation of the location. As we show later in Section 5, a sensor is able <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> itself anywhere anytime within predefined error threshold and this error threshold applies also on <b>locating</b> <b>an</b> incident when detected.|$|R
5|$|Much of Bloodlines {{criticism}} {{focused on}} technical problems {{when it was}} released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed the game and typographical errors in on-screen text. Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized {{while waiting for the}} player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants standing still, unable <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was Bloodlines greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's strong suit, features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Abby {{originated}} {{from an area}} of enhanced convective activity southeast of Guam on July31. While moving south of Guam, the area failed to organized significantly until August3, when thunderstorm activity increased in coverage. Based on this, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued at 2300UTC. Initially, the system struggled to develop a closed atmospheric circulation. However, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the system early on August5 and was able <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> closed surface circulation. Based on this, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Following an increase in organization, both agencies upgraded the system into a tropical storm.|$|E

Scott Burnett (1) demonstrated the feasibility of using acoustic sensors <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>an</b> object without information about speed of sound. The algorithms of triangulation and pose measurement, which were introduced in his paper to fulfill the goal of using acoustic sensors <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>an</b> object, are reviewed in this thesis. Moreover, some discussion on how to improve the algorithm's accuracy is also mentioned in this thesis. This work will attempt to improve the accuracy of using acoustic sensors <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>an</b> object without information about speed of sound. A numerical method will be used to study the relationship between error and the location of sensors. To know how the location of sensors will affect the accuracy of the result, different sets of acoustic sensors will be modeled. With different combinations of acoustic sensors, we are looking to find the relationship between the accuracy of predicted transmitters' positions and the locations of acoustic sensors...|$|R

The terrorists try <b>to</b> <b>locate</b> <b>a</b> radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E
