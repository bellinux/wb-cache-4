There was a total of 100days on which disturbances, depressions, storms, or cyclones were active, compared to the average of 68. There were 12named storms, above the normal of 9. Five intensified into tropical cyclones, also above the normal of 4. The season was the longest on record, with the first depression in August 1996 and the final depression in July 1997. Despite the long season, there was minimal activity from March to May, which usually represents about 25% of <b>total</b> <b>activity.</b> In addition, February was relatively quiet despite being the climatological peak.

25|$|Cells are {{the basic}} unit of {{structure}} in every living thing, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells by division. Cell theory was formulated by Henri Dutrochet, Theodor Schwann, Rudolf Virchow and others during the early nineteenth century, and subsequently became widely accepted. The activity of an organism depends on the <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> of its cells, with energy flow occurring within and between them. Cells contain hereditary information that is carried forward as a genetic code during cell division.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this effect {{is the use of}} nuclear fuels with thorium. Th-232 is a fertile {{material}} that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile U-233. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term activity curve of the SNF around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types {{can be seen in the}} figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and Mixed Oxide fuel (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around a million years can be seen. This has an effect in the <b>total</b> <b>activity</b> curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed. Nuclear reprocessing can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see Long-lived fission product#Actinides).|$|E
40|$|Objective. : This study {{describes}} the <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> and {{the contribution of}} work to <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> among Dutch workers. The {{study was conducted in}} the Netherlands in the years 2000 - 2002. Methods. : 2, 417 respondents of a cross-sectional survey representing the Dutch adult working population were included. Physical activity was measured by the proportion meeting the current public health physical activity recommendations and by <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> (in minutes per week). Seven occupational groups and 28 sectors were distinguished. Unadjusted analyses were carried out using chi-square test and one-way analysis of variance. Results. : On average, 53. 7 % was sufficiently active according to the recommended levels. Work contributed for 30 % to <b>total</b> physical <b>activity.</b> There were significant differences between the occupations and sectors in <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> levels {{as well as in the}} amount of work-related physical activity. Those in policy and higher executive functions were least active at work with work contributing for 19. 5 % to <b>total</b> physical <b>activity,</b> whereas those working in agricultural occupations were most active at work with work contributing for 55. 1 % to <b>total</b> physical <b>activity.</b> Conclusions. : Work is still an important source of <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> among workers.

40|$|The {{free and}} <b>total</b> <b>activities</b> of four acid hydrolases were assayed {{in the liver}} of young rats during the 3 days period {{following}} the end of a lysine and threonine deficiency. There is a slight decrease at 15 h in the <b>total</b> <b>activities</b> of deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, β‐glycerophosphatase and β‐glucuronidase, on a wet weight tissue basis. These activities get back to starting values later on, except for deoxyribonuclease which has risen by a factor of 1. 8 after 3 days. Free activities expressed as percentages of <b>total</b> <b>activities</b> increase more or less rapidly and steadily during the recovery period. The free activity of deoxyribonuclease has augmented after 2 and 3 days; that of β‐glucuronidase rises already after 15 h and stays elevated for 3 days; that of the other hydrolases is above the starting level only {{at the end of the}} first day. These data suggest a labilization of the lysosomes and a net synthesis of acid deoxyribonuclease. The possible effects of these modifications of hepatic lysosomes on the first mitotic wave and on the other cellular alterations which follow the end of protein malnutrition are discussed.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} screen for the most {{inactive}} individuals in the population and target health-related interventions where they are most needed {{it is important to}} assess different forms of physical activity in population-based studies. The aims were (1) to identify the most inactive individuals in the population by assessing two dimensions of physical activity, (2) to investigate the correlation between exercise and <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> and (3) to investigate the association between exercise, <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> and good self-rated health. Methods A simple random sample of the Swedish population aged 25 – 64 years were interviewed about their living conditions, health and lifestyle in a survey performed by Statitics Sweden. In total 1876 women and 1880 men completed the survey during 1999 (response rate 76. 6 %) when two different questions about physical activity assessed exercise and <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> in all domains (e. g. transportation, exercise, and at work). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios. Results The most inactive individuals (no exercise and <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> ≤ 2 hours per week) constituted 4. 3 % of the sample. The correlation between exercise and <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> was low (gamma = 0. 4, p = 0. 02). There were significant associations between higher levels of exercise, <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> and good self-rated health after adjustment for age, gender, country of birth, education, employment, marital status, housing tenure, smoking and BMI. Conclusion Both exercise and <b>total</b> physical <b>activity</b> were independently associated with good self-rated health.
