5|$|Parallel {{computers}} {{based on}} interconnected networks need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> kind of routing {{to enable the}} passing of messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors {{is likely to be}} hierarchical in large multiprocessor machines.|$|E
5|$|After the Stuxnet attack, Kaspersky {{proposed}} that the Internet needed more regulation and policing. One idea was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> parts of the Internet anonymous, while more secure areas require user identification. He argued that anonymity mostly benefited cybercriminals and hackers. For example, accessing {{a nuclear power plant}} network could require a verified identity through a digital passport.|$|E

5|$|Back on the ward, {{a father}} and his two daughters have been brought in, one with a stab wound and one badly burnt. The father only has minor {{injuries}} but the police seem to believe {{he had something to}} do with the incident. Maddy tries to find out what is happening from the father, who is not talking to the police. She seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> connection with him but can't seem to put her finger on what it is.|$|E
5|$|Commonsense {{knowledge}} and reasoning. Many important artificial intelligence applications like vision or natural language require simply {{enormous amounts of}} information about the world: the program needs <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> idea of what it might be looking at or what it is talking about. This requires that the program know most of the same things about the world that a child does. Researchers soon discovered that this was a truly vast amount of information. No one in 1970 could build a database so large and no one knew how a program might learn so much information.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, {{it was named}} in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It {{is one of three}} or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{and is one of the}} easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely}} to be blown away in a wind than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the game}} was noted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> flaws. The game was criticized for its uneven {{difficulty}}. Reviewers have also noted some difficulty in getting the game to recognize the correct Celestial Brush patterns, as well as excessive amounts of dialog, particularly at the introduction, which was also hampered by the computer-generated voices used instead of voice acting.|$|E
5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and the other parent <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to {{only one of the}} parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.|$|E
5|$|Marion Little {{examines}} theoretical frameworks {{related to}} NVC. The influential interest-based model for conflict resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard Negotiation Project in the 1980s appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct {{evidence of a}} connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{characters}} from other games were meant <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> of their moves changed or removed in order to balance them with KOF's new characters. However, designers focused in adjusting the imbalance of certain characters without removing any move. In the end, creators of the series noted that the Art of Fighting characters were the strongest ones in the game. Nevertheless, other characters such as Terry and Andy Bogard became the ones who got the designers' utmost attention and were given new moves.|$|E

5|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have noted that}} personal identity is a strong theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Clifton Maybank corridor, built in the 18th century from stone obtained from another house then undergoing alteration, allowed the principal ground- and first-floor rooms <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> privacy from the servants' areas and linked the two staircases. It also allowed the house to be turned around by creating a new entrance fa√ßade facing west.|$|E
5|$|The first St. John's dog {{was said}} to be brought to England in or around 1820, but the breed's {{reputation}} had already spread to England; there is a story that the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury saw a St. John's dog on a fishing boat and immediately made arrangements with traders <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> of these dogs imported to England. These ancestors of the first labradors so impressed the Earl with their skill and ability for retrieving anything within the water and on shore that he devoted his entire kennel to developing and stabilising the breed.|$|E

Squidward soon gets bored, and tells SpongeBob a scary story <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> fun with him. After scaring SpongeBob, Squidward tells him that the story is fictional. However, when Squidward and SpongeBob are alone, the events in Squidward's story begin to occur.|$|E
