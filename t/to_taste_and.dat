5|$|Vanilla, {{originally}} a crop endemic to South America, {{was introduced in}} French Polynesia in 1848 by Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, a French commander in the Pacific. The admiral delivered several dozen specimens of the plant to the Tahitian Governor's garden in Papeete. A new variety of vanilla was subsequently developed {{in the area and}} came to be popularly known as Tahitian vanilla. This has special characteristics compared to the varieties such as Vanilla planifolia grown {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in respect <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> scent. It has resulted in greater demand for the Tahitian variety.|$|E

Molecular mixture analysis during food processing {{has the potential}} to help us understand the molecular mechanisms involved, thus enabling better cooking of the analyzed foods. To date, there has been no web-based tool focusing on accumulating Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra from various types of food processing. Therefore, we have developed a novel web-based tool, FoodPro, that includes a food NMR spectrum database and computes covariance <b>and</b> correlation spectra <b>to</b> <b>tasting</b> <b>and</b> hardness. As a result, FoodPro has accumulated 236 aqueous (extracted in D 2 O) and 131 hydrophobic (extracted in CDCl 3) experimental bench-top 60 -MHz NMR spectra, 1753 tastings scored by volunteers, and 139 hardness measurements recorded by a penetrometer, all placed into a core database. The database content was roughly classified into fish and vegetable groups from the viewpoint of different spectrum patterns. FoodPro can query a user food NMR spectrum, search similar NMR spectra with a specified similarity threshold, and then compute estimated <b>tasting</b> <b>and</b> hardness, covariance, <b>and</b> correlation spectra <b>to</b> <b>tasting</b> <b>and</b> hardness. Querying fish spectra exemplified specific covariance spectra <b>to</b> <b>tasting</b> <b>and</b> hardness, giving positive covariance for tasting at 1. 31 ppm for lactate and 3. 47 ppm for glucose and a positive covariance for hardness at 3. 26 ppm for trimethylamine N-oxide...|$|R

25|$|Chemical senses {{include the}} use of chemoreceptors, related <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> smell, {{affecting}} mating, habitat selection, feeding and parasite-host relationships. Taste is usually located on the mouthparts of the insect but in some insects, such as bees, wasps and ants, taste organs can also be found on the antennae. Taste organs can also be found on the tarsi of moths, butterflies and flies. Olfactory sensilla enable insects to smell and are usually found in the antennae. Chemoreceptor sensitivity related to smell in some substances, is very high and some insects can detect particular odours that are at low concentrations miles from their original source.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of filter is a rapid sand filter. Water moves {{vertically}} through sand which often has a layer of activated carbon or anthracite coal above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute <b>to</b> <b>taste</b> <b>and</b> odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest suspended particles, so simple filtration is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles. Effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.|$|E

500|$|Around 100 {{tracks were}} used on [...] "Schoolin' Life"; they were roughly split with 50 {{for the music}} and 50 for the vocals. As stated by Swivel, musically {{the aim of the}} mix was to take a large number of tracks and create a perfect balance. So, he used Waves’ Metaflanger on the {{percussion}} and some of the snares, and spent some time EQ’ing. Swivel explained that there was much parallel processing on the lead vocal. The lead-vocal bus was multed to a second bus, {{and one of them was}} entirely crushed on a 50:1 compression ratio which was totally limited and with a very low threshold. He elaborated, [...] "It creates a very gritty distorted sound in there, really low <b>to</b> <b>taste,</b> <b>and</b> it fills in the lead vocal very nicely. The crushed vocal runs quietly underneath." ...|$|E

[...] Other reviewers predicted commercial television would be forced to improve its children's programming, something that did not substantially occur until the 1990s. [...] Sesame Street won a Peabody Award, three Emmys, and the Prix Jeunesse award in 1970.

2500|$|Initially, some {{physicists}} {{suggested that}} the new theory was a fundamental theory of membranes, but Witten was skeptical {{of the role of}} membranes in the theory. In a paper from 1996, Hořava and Witten wrote [...] "As it has been proposed that the eleven-dimensional theory is a supermembrane theory but there are some reasons to doubt that interpretation, we will non-committally call it the M-theory, leaving to the future the relation of M to membranes." [...] In the absence of an understanding of the true meaning and structure of M-theory, Witten has {{suggested that the}} M should stand for [...] "magic", [...] "mystery", or [...] "membrane" [...] according <b>to</b> <b>taste,</b> <b>and</b> the true meaning of the title should be decided when a more fundamental formulation of the theory is known.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gadamer, in {{contrast}} to the [...] "wealth of meaning" [...] that Vico and Shaftesbury brought from the Roman tradition into their humanism, Kant [...] "developed his moral philosophy in explicit opposition to the doctrine of [...] "moral feeling" [...] that had been worked out in English philosophy". The moral imperative [...] "cannot be based on feeling, not even if one does not mean an individual's feeling but common moral sensibility". For Kant, the sensus communis only applied <b>to</b> <b>taste,</b> <b>and</b> the meaning of taste was also narrowed as it was no longer understood as any kind of knowledge. Taste, for Kant, is universal only in that it results from [...] "the free play of all our cognitive powers", and is communal only in that it [...] "abstracts from all subjective, private conditions such as attractiveness and emotion".|$|E
