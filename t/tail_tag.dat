40|$|The <b>tail</b> <b>tag</b> and the tagging method are described. A {{total of}} 711 harp and hooded seals have been tagged {{in the years}} 1951 - 1963. Excepting {{experimental}} tagging of one adult and 18 immature harp seals in the Barents Sea in 1963, all seals have been tagged as pups, at Newfoundland in 1951 - 1952, in the Jan Mayen area in 1951 - 1963, and in the Barents Sea in 1963. Of the tagged seals, 54 have been recaptured within the first six weeks after tagging. Early recoveries in 1953 and 1955 illustrate the dispersion of weaned harp seal pups in the Jan Mayen area. Recoveries after one or more years amount to 14, {{and most of these}} are from the tagging areas. One recovery indicates a connection between hooded seals breeding at Newfoundland and the moulting hoods in the Denmark Strait. One other recovery suggests some contact between the Jan Mayen and the White Sea harp seal populations. Recaptures of one harp and one hooded seal have provisionally verified the ageing method bascd on dentine growth zones for these species. Finally, some factors that may influence the number of recoveries are discussed, and means of improving the tagging method are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Four {{cationic}} amphiphilic fluorescent probes were synthesized {{and fully}} characterized. All amphiphiles feature a pyrrolidinium headgroup and a hydrocarbon <b>tail</b> <b>tagged</b> with a pyrene residue, and {{differ in the}} connection between the headgroup and the <b>tagged</b> <b>tail,</b> and in the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, two being single tail surfactants and the others twin type surfactants. The aggregation features were investigated by electrical conductivity, fluorescence, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy experiments. The obtained results show that changes in the molecular structure of the monomer, by affecting the aggregation behavior, have a strong influence on the conformation of the fluorophore inside the aggregate, and hence on its fluorescence features in aggregating conditions. In particular, the formation of pyrene dimers and/or excimers was observed only for the twin type surfactants, thus suggesting that a second alkyl chain is crucial for warranting a specific orientation of the pyrene moiety suitable for dimers or excimers formation. Moreover, the different linkage of the pyrene moiety to the alkyl chain in the twin type surfactants results in a remarkable difference in the organization of the aggregates they form, in fact only in the aggregates formed by one of the two surfactants the pyrene moiety is exposed at the lipid-water interface...|$|R
40|$|In 1960 - 1968, 2 705 {{harp seal}} pups and 55 adult female harp seals were tagged in the White Sea.

40|$|Abstract Tagging is an ever-growing {{feature of}} online systems. As {{more and more}} content is tagged by users, the {{resulting}} ?folksonomies? grow and can become unwieldy. The design of tagging systems {{must take into account}} how the resulting networks of tags are composed, and what motivated the taggers, in order to best use those tags as an aid toward search on the system. A literature review was carried out on the topics of folksonomies in general, how they compare with more formal ontologies and how folksonomies can be improved. Studies categorising folksonomy tags were analysed, with particular attention paid to those studies using the resulting categorisation information as a means to infer tagger motivation. A specific strand of the literature review focussed on studies of book-tagging systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} take a particular tagging system, the book website LibraryThing, and analyse the tags on fifty sample books. Long <b>tail</b> <b>tags</b> with a frequency of 2 or less, were ignored for reasons detailed in the research methodology, leaving a total of 13, 358 tags to be viewed and categorised. The tag frequency distribution was shown to demonstrate the Zipfian power law. The tag categorisation model indicated that booksonomy taggers generally tag within the categories of ?genre/style?, ?subject? and ?personal task-based?. Users are motivated mainly by their own personal organisational needs, but also by some social impulses towards the other users of the site. As a further component of the study, tags on two specific book genres (non-fiction and young adult) were analysed separately. Patterns such as higher-than-average tagging in the ?target reader? category on young adult books became apparent. The original research and datasets generated for this study provide further source material as a contribution to the evolving discussion on folksonomies in general, and on booksonomies in particular...|$|R

We describe the con-struction of enzyme-overproducing strains and show how to simplify downstream processing, increase product quality and process profitability, improve diagnostic enzyme proper-ties, and adjust enzymes to harsh assay conditions. We also consider some safety and environmental aspects of enzyme production.

40|$|Background: In {{the last}} 5 years, the rapid pace of {{innovations}} {{and improvements in}} sequencing technologies has completely changed the landscape of metagenomic and metagenetic experiments. Therefore, {{it is critical to}} benchmark the various methodologies for interrogating the composition of microbial communities, so that we can assess their strengths and limitations. The most common phylogenetic marker for microbial community diversity studies is the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene and in the last 10 years the field has moved from sequencing a small number of amplicons and samples to more complex studies where thousands of samples and multiple different gene regions are interrogated. Results: We assembled 2 synthetic communities with an even (EM) and uneven (UM) distribution of archaeal and bacterial strains and species, as metagenomic control material, to assess performance of different experimental strategies. The 2 synthetic communities were used in this study, to highlight the limitations and the advantages of the leading sequencing platforms: MiSeq (Illumina), The Pacific Biosciences RSII, 454 GS-FLX/+ (Roche), and IonTorrent (Life Technologies). We describe an extensive survey based on synthetic communities using 3 experimental designs (fusion primers, universal <b>tailed</b> <b>tag,</b> ligated adaptors) across the 9 hypervariable 16 S rDNA regions. We demonstrate that library preparation methodology can affect data interpretation due to different error and chimera rates generated during the procedure. The observed community composition was always biased, to a degree that depended on the platform, sequenced region and primer choice. However, crucially, our analysis suggests that 16 S rRNA sequencing is still quantitative, in that relative changes in abundance of taxa between samples can be recovered, despite these biases. Conclusion: We have assessed a range of experimental conditions across several next generation sequencing platforms using the most up-to-date configurations. We propose that the choice of sequencing platform and experimental design needs to be taken into consideration in the early stage of a project by running a small trial consisting of several hypervariable regions to quantify the discriminatory power of each region. We also suggest that the use of a synthetic community as a positive control would be beneficial to identify the potential biases and procedural drawbacks that may lead to data misinterpretation. The results of this study will serve as a guideline for making decisions on which experimental condition and sequencing platform to consider to achieve the best microbial profiling...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} of DNA base mismatches is of considerable interest {{for both the}} {{diagnosis and treatment of}} mismatch repair-deficient cancers. Two new mismatch recognition complexes have been synthesized. The first, [Rh(bpy) 2 (phzi) ] 3 + (phzi=benzo[a]phenazine- 5, 6 -quinone diimine), recognizes DNA mismatches with high specificity and affinity, 1 x 107 Mm- 1, two orders of magnitude stronger than [Rh(bpy) 2 (chrysi) ] 3 + (chrysi=chrysene- 5, 6 -quinone diimine), the parent complex that binds single thermodynamically-destabilized base-mismatch sites in duplex DNA. The second, [Rh(bqdi) 2 (chrysi) ] 3 +, is able to recognize more stable mismatches such as the G-G mismatch. These complexes have been applied in a variety of ways. A method has been developed for the discovery of new single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, within a sequence of interest amplified from pooled genomic DNA. SNPs are readily detected using these mismatch selective molecules without false positives; allele frequencies as low as 0. 05 can be detected. Upon photoexcitation, the rhodium(III) diimine complexes cleave DNA by hydrogen atom abstraction from the sugar to yield 3 '-phosphate terminated DNA that is inactive for enzymatic modification. This 3 '-phosphate can be removed using T 4 -polynucleotide kinase opening up the possibility of enzymatic modification at the site of rhodium cleavage. The cleavage site can be fluorescently labeled. Terminal transferase {{can also be used to}} attach a homopolymer <b>tail</b> <b>tagging</b> the damage site, allowing the amplification of the DNA up to the damaged site. This assay can also be employed towards the development of early cancer diagnostics. Some cancers are deficient in the repair of DNA base mismatches. As a consequence, these cells have an increased number of mismatches within their genome. These mismatches in extracted genomic DNA were cleaved using mismatch-specific rhodium complexes. The cleavage sites were labeled with radioactivity, allowing the number of mismatch sites to be quantitated. A significant number of sites were cleaved in the mismatch repair deficient DU 145 cell line, 1 base/ 3000 bp, while no sites were cleaved in the mismatch repair proficient cell line SW 620. This method may present a new method for the detection of mismatch repair deficiency. These mismatch-specific complexes also are shown to have an antiproliferative effect on mismatch repair deficient cell lines. Mismatch repair deficiency is a contributing factor in both hereditary and sporadic human cancers. Both [Rh(bpy) 2 (chrysi) ]Cl 3 and [Rh(bpy) 2 (phzi) ]Cl 3 show a stronger antiproliferative effect against MMR deficient cells than proficient cells. Effects of stereoisomers, incubation time, and UV irradiation are also demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|Across {{more than}} 200 km² of {{hillside}} currently more than six-hundred horses roam freely in fourteen droves, {{referred to in}} Galician as bestas (mares) and garañones (stallions). The festival involves bringing the horses down from the hillside, gathering them into an enclosure, cutting their manes and <b>tails,</b> and <b>tagging</b> them, nowadays with a microchip. The curro in Sabucedo is the most renowned of all and is set {{apart from the rest}} by unique characteristics, the most important of which is that neither ropes, sticks, nor other such instruments are used to subdue the animals.The aloitadores, those responsible for restraining the horses whilst the rapa takes place, use only their body strength and raw skill to complete the job. Another interesting feature of the rapa is the Bajada- the process of rounding up the horses and leading them into Sabucedo - a part of the celebration joined by hundreds of local residents and visitors from further afield. Another element of the tradition is the celebration of a poignant mass, held very early on the Saturday morning, before going up the hill. During the mass, the congregation pray to San Lorenzo, the patron saint of Sabucedo, to keep those participating from any harm.|$|R
40|$|To {{make the}} most of a global network effect and to search and filter the Long <b>Tail,</b> a {{collaborative}} <b>tagging</b> approach to social search should be based on the global activity of tagging, rating and filtering. We take a further step towards this objective by proposing a shared conceptualization of both the activity of tagging and the organization of the tagosphere in which tagging takes place. We also put forward the necessary data standards to interoperate at both data format and semantic levels. We highlight how this conceptualization makes provision for attaching identity and meaning to tags and tag categorization through a Wikipedia-based collaborative framework. Used together, these concepts are a useful and agile means of unambiguously defining terms used during tagging, and of clarifying any vague search terms. This improves search results in terms of recall and precision, and represents an innovative means of semantics-aware collaborative filtering and content ranking...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Transfer {{learning}} {{as a new}} machine learning paradigm has gained in-creasing attention lately. In situations where the training data in a target domain are not sufficient to learn predictive models effectively, transfer learning leverages auxiliary source data from related domains for learning. While most of the exist-ing works {{in this area are}} only focused on using the source data with the same representational structure as the target data, in this paper, we push this boundary further by extending transfer between text and images. We integrate documents, tags and images to build a heterogeneous transfer learn-ing factor alignment model and apply it to improve the performance of tag rec-ommendation. Many algorithms for tag recommendation have been proposed, but many of them have problem; the algorithm may not perform well under cold s-tart conditions or for items from the long <b>tail</b> of the <b>tag</b> frequency distribution. However, with the help of documents, our algorithm handles these problems and generally outperforms other tag recommendation methods, especially the non-transfer factor alignment model. ...|$|R

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allow {{cells to}} respond to {{extracellular}} stimuli and are involved in virtually all major physiological processes in eukaryotes. Consequently, aberrant GPCR signalling can lead to disease, making them attractive candidates for research {{and the development of}} pharmacological interventions. However, GPCR signalling responses in higher eukaryotes are complex, with the presence of multiple signalling pathways hindering the isolation and study of specific signalling components. The model organism, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, provides a simplified system with which to investigate GPCR signalling in the pheromoneresponse pathway. Pheromone stimulation in Sz. pombe causes the production of proteins necessary for the mating process, including the carboxypeptidase Sxa 2. This study utilises Sz. pombe reporter strains in which sxa 2 has been replaced with the bacterial reporter lacZ, thus enabling quantification of the level of signalling through the pheromoneresponse pathway. Using this system, the pheromone-responsive Mam 2 receptor was investigated, with specific focus on the large intracellular C-terminal tail. Truncating Mam 2 to remove the C-terminal tail altered signalling by increasing the level of ligand-independent signalling and decreasing the level of maximal signalling. Similar effects were observed when a regulator of G protein signalling, Rgs 1, was removed from strains containing the full-length Mam 2 receptor. This suggested a relationship between these two signalling components, which was confirmed through yeast 2 -hybrid analysis. Using this approach, an 8 -residue section of the Mam 2 C-terminal tail was found to be necessary for a direct interaction with Rgs 1. Further characterisation of the Mam 2 tail revealed an additional role for this region in receptor sensitivity to pheromone stimulation. Mutational analysis implicated three serine residues in receptor sensitivity, suggesting that the C-terminal tail of Mam 2 may contribute to receptor internalisation from the plasma membrane therefore enabling desensitisation to prolonged pheromone stimulation. Similar techniques applied to the study of Rgs 1 revealed that two conserved DEP domains in the N-terminus of Rgs 1 are important for the interaction with the Mam 2 C-terminal <b>tail.</b> Fluorescent <b>tagging</b> of Rgs 1 and subsequent microscopic analysis indicated that Rgs 1 localises to endomembranous structures surrounding the nucleus, contrary to predictions made by mathematical models developed by this group, which suggest that Rgs 1 requires plasma membrane-localisation in order to function. A better understanding of the action of Mam 2 and Rgs 1 in the Sz. pombe pheromone response can inform mathematical models and future studies involving the more complex mammalian signalling cascades.

40|$|The reverse {{vaccinology}} {{approach to}} the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome, {{one of the largest}} known mammalian viral genome with a coding potential of more than 166 proteins, led to the identification of 94 potential membrane-associated or secreted proteins. Many of the selected proteins have no assigned functions but share a high degree of conservation among different strains. These designed ORFs have been synthesized as eukaryotic codon-optimized sequences in frame with both hexa-histidine <b>tail</b> and c-myc <b>tag</b> coding elements. A more detailed analysis was performed on a certain number of these tagged proteins in both epithelial and fibroblast human derived cell lines, natural targets of HCMV. As starting point 12 hCMV proteins with antigenic properties were chosen for further characterization in terms of structural and functional features. This work was aimed to the identification and functional characterization of two new HCMV surface exposed glycoproteins. The study is divided in two parts: first the identification and characterization of ORFX*; second the identification and characterization of a novel HCMV Fc binding protein. Regarding the first part, we focused our attention on ORFX gene product, a putative ORF identified by in silico analysis. Biochemical analysis on both ORFX viral protein product or transient expressed single gene allowed us to conclude that ORFX is: a) heavily glycosylated protein; b) expressed as late product during infection; c) present in the assembly complex, the cellular site of virus assembly; d) present on the HCMV virion envelope and e) secreted in transient expression as by in silico prediction. These observations led us to search for ORFX partners among other HCMV envelope exposed glycoproteins. We found that gH was efficiently transported to plasma membrane only when coexpressed with ORFX. Moreover, co-expression of gH (and gH/gL) with ORFX and coimmunoprecipitation experiments, carried on both transfected and infected cells, showed that ORFX is part of a gH-based complex. These results suggest that ORFX could function as both gH “escort” protein but also be part of a cellular recognizing complex and invite to a deeper analysis of both its functions and immunological properties. Regarding {{the second part of the}} study, we were able to identify two novels Fc binding protein coded by CMV: RL 12 and RL 13. The latter was also further characterized as recombinant protein in terms of cellular localization, Fc binding site and IgG internalization ability. *Names and protein sequences are, actually, under revision of NVD Intellectual property offic...|$|R
40|$|Pain is a {{phenomenon}} that is physical and emotional. There is growing {{evidence to support the}} idea that emotional neural systems in the brain drive future behaviour. The behavioural reactions accompanying the pain experience are highly varied, which suggests multiple functions. Pain-related behaviour often doesn’t occur in isolation. Instead, it is observable by other animals, thus providing access to information about the emotional state of the animal. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate pain-related behaviour within a social context. In the simplest terms, animal interactions occur in a dyad, where the animal displaying a particular repertoire of behaviours is the actor and another viewing and potentially responding to the actor’s behaviour is the observer. Each individual can be an actor and observer simultaneously. Domestic sheep are a good model species for studying pain from a social perspective. They are a social species with a strong tendency to form groups. Sheep provide us with an opportunity to evaluate the social infl uences on pain within the context of painful husbandry procedures normally undertaken in New Zealand such as <b>tail</b> docking, ear <b>tagging</b> and castration. There is also some evidence that the social context affects the behaviour and emotional state of sheep. The social infl uences on pain perception and expression have only just begun to be investigated and the studies contained in this thesis add a great deal to this research area. Therefore, the literature review was presented {{at the end of the}} thesis and made reference to the fi ndings of the previous experimental chapters of this thesis and introduced a social/communicative function for pain related behaviour. This other chapters then provided evidence for the social function of pain behaviour, by investigating both sides of the actor-observer dyad. Two chapters focussed on the actor lamb. One, which is presented as two papers, investigated novel ways pain may be expressed by lambs. These are the fi rst studies to demonstrate changes in the ear posture and facial expression of lambs associated with the negative experience of pain. The other chapter, presented as another two papers, investigated what factors affect pain expression by lambs. One study of this chapter demonstrates that the ontogeny of pain processing appears to differ between male and female lambs, and the other demonstrates that expression of pain behaviour depends on the relationship between the actor and observer lamb and previous experience of the test environment. There is also one chapter, comprised of one paper, which focussed on the observer lamb. This paper investigated how pain expression by the actor lamb affected the behavioural expression of the observer. This study demonstated socially facilitated behaviour of lambs, possibly indicative of empathy, in response to conspecifi c pain using quantitative behavioural methods, and a novel qualitative assessment technique. This thesis culminates in a general discussion chapter which assesses the methodologies used and their limitations, as well as drawing together the research presented in this thesis and analyzing it in the context of the social communicative function of pain...|$|R
