The research discusses potential sources of DGT-measured labile metals in water and seasonal variations. Our results demonstrate the application of DGT for identifying and measuring labile metal concentrations in contrasted climate conditions (cold snowy winter and hot summer) and appropriateness of such a tool for continuous water monitoring with the presence of an ice cover. Results show that DGT-measured concentrations of most of trace metals were much higher downstream of the wastewater treatment plants discharges than upstream; thus wastewater treatment plants seemed not able to reduce or to remove trace metals' contaminations and become major sources of pollutants in the studied rivers. The calculation of the average metal fluxes based on the DGT-measured concentrations confirmed that the urban wastewater discharges significantly contribute to the metal fluxes into the Udy and the Lopan rivers during both low-flow and high-flow periods. Compared to the wastewaters inputs to the rivers, the <b>transboundary</b> <b>effect</b> is limited, but should be taken into account as the origin of some metals is from sources located on the adjacent Russian territory...|$|E
40|$|United States {{commercial}} fisheries are managed by regional councils whose jurisdictions are circumscribed by political boundaries. Species range often spans management borders, linking fishing regions by participation. On the East Coast, individuals commonly prosecute several fisheries managed by different councils. This study tests both {{the existence and}} magnitude of policy-induced transboundary impacts on fishery participation, {{with the goal of}} providing a quantitative starting point for further investigation into the economic and social impact of spillover fishing effort. Regulatory structures vary across a spectrum from open access to individual harvest rights. In 2010, the New England Fishery Management Council expanded a cooperative rights-based management program – “sectors” – to enhance stock sustainability and economic efficiency in the groundfish fishery. Groundfish sector management altered the deployment of fishing effort in New England. Newly idled groundfish fishers possess the potential to increase participation in regulated open access Mid-Atlantic fisheries characterized by low entry barriers. This study utilizes econometric methods to estimate the <b>transboundary</b> <b>effect</b> of sector management on Mid-Atlantic fisheries. The use of a difference-in-differences estimation strategy allows the author to evaluate the causal link between New England sector management and altered fishing effort directed towards Mid-Atlantic managed species. Econometric methodology is employed to control for exogenous factors that may also affect fishing effort and to assess the unobservable policy counterfactual of present day Mid-Atlantic effort levels in the absence of New England groundfish sectors. The study finds that the establishment of groundfish sectors does affect Mid-Atlantic fisheries, but impacts are not uniform across species nor are they uniform across the 17 groundfish sectors. Further, effort redirection can be more or less pronounced when looking at the behavior of enrolled sector members, or looking only at those sector members who are now inactive in New England fisheries. Certain sectors are identified as redirecting more effort towards Mid-Atlantic species. While cumulative effort spillover {{does not seem to be}} pushing Mid-Atlantic fisheries perilously close to capacity limits, the identified influx can impact profitability in effort-receiving fisheries and could potentially have a negative effect on socioeconomic outcomes in the greater regional fishing economy...|$|E

In order to achieve this purpose, we determine this issue from a political, economical and societal perception, which seem to be the most influencing factors in the case of the euro crisis. By assembling the crucial findings of these separate categories, we gain a broader perspective and hence a generalized evaluation and understanding of the German leadership style. ...|$|R

In this paper we consider air pollution as a multi [...] level phenomenon within a Bayesian hierarchical model. We examine different scales of variation in pollution concentrations ranging from large scale <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> to more localised effects which {{are directly related to}} human activity. Specifically, in the first stage of the model, we isolate underlying patterns in pollution concentrations due to global factors such as underlying climate and topography, which are modelled together with spatial structure. At this stage measurements from monitoring sites located within rural areas are used which, as far as possible, are chosen to reflect background concentrations. Having isolated these global effects, in the second stage we assess the effects of human activity on pollution in urban areas. The proposed model was applied to {{concentrations of}} nitrogen dioxide measured throughout the EU for which significant increases are found to be associated with human activity in urban areas.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{generated by}} vegetation fire smoke (VFS) {{is a phenomenon}} that has influenced the global environment in prehistoric and historic time scales. Although historic evidence of the impacts of VFS on societies is scarce, {{there are indications that}} VFS has been a factor that influenced society significantly since the Middle Ages. In recent decades, increasing application of fire as a tool for land-use change has resulted in more frequent occurrence of extended fire and smoke episodes with consequences on human health and security. Some of these events have been associated with droughts that are attributed to inter-annual climate variability or possible consequences of regional climate change. In metropolitan or industrial areas, the impacts of VFS may be coupled with the emission burden from fossil fuel burning and other technogenic sources, resulting in increasing adverse affects on the human population. We review the character, magnitude, and role of pyrogenic gaseous and particle emissions on the composition and functioning of the global atmosphere, human health, and security. Special emphasis is given on radioactive emissions generated by fires burning in peatlands and on terrain contaminated by radionuclides.

40|$|Hydropower {{developments}} {{along the}} main stem of the Mekong River and its tributaries cause <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> within the Mekong Basin Region, which comprises parts of six countries. On the one hand, the provision of hydropower triggers economic development and helps to meet the rising energy demand of the Mekong riparian countries, especially China, Thailand, and Vietnam. On the other hand, {{the negative impact of}} dam construction, mainly altered water flow and sediment load, has severe impacts on the environment and the livelihoods of the rural Mekong population. Several discrepancies exist in the needs, demands, and challenges of upstream versus downstream countries. Against the common apprehension that downstream countries are powerlessly exposed to mainly negative impacts whereas upstream countries unilaterally benefit from hydropower, the authors argue that upstream–downstream relations are not really clear-cut. This conclusion is based on a consideration of the complex power play between Mekong riparians, with a focus on recent power trade interactions. The article investigates the consequences of hydropower dams for the Mekong region as well as the role of supranational players, such as the Mekong River Commission and the Greater Mekong Subregion Initiative, on the hydropower debate.

40|$|European {{environmental}} law {{consists of a}} large number of directives and regulations dealing with environmental domains such as air, water, or waste, or with issues such as greenhouse gases, chemicals or industrial emissions. These directives and regulations do not form a comprehensive system of {{environmental law}}. Particularly those subjects which have <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> or affect the internal market are regulated at the EU level. In view of the subsidiarity principle (Article 5 (3) TEU), other parts of environmental law are left to the Member States. Member States each have their own existing national system of environmental law. Directives have to be transposed into those national systems by the Member States. It is in this process of transposition that flaws in or discrepancies between directives are likely to be felt. In order to facilitate their implementation, it is important that directives form a coherent system: provisions from different directives should not clash, and preferably the same terms and definitions should be used. This enables the Member States to implement the directives in a general act in the field of environmental law, and moreover does not force them to differentiate between terms coming from different directives. This chapter will first pay attention to the implementation of environmental directives (Section 1). Then, several environmental directives will be used as an illustration of the problems which may arise when there is a lack of coherence between directives (Section 2) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} principles governing international law are changing dramatically. International law, which traditionally has regulated the conduct {{between and among}} countries, has had as its core the respect for state sovereignty. However, {{the latter part of}} the twentieth century witnessed fundamental changes to the way in which the international community operates that are based upon a deep interdependence among states and their openness to international actors. This is often labeled the process of globalization. This process has had a significant impact on states' sovereignty and on the way in which international law regulates the interaction among states. This phenomenon includes the way in which international trade law (spearheaded by the World Trade Organization) dictates how member states' trade policies may operate; the way in which international financial law (led by the International Monetary Fund) determines financial policies of member states; and the way in which international environmental law regulates actions with <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> Thus, international law is no longer restricted to areas of interstate concern but it has also come to regulate states' domestic actions as well. Opponents to this view may hold that states are still sovereign in that they are not forced to take part in these international legal regimes. However, this view fails to take account of the political and economic realities of international relations where the voluntary nature of this regulation for most states (particularly weaker or poorer states) is a legal fiction.

40|$|The {{judgment}} of the International Court of Justice in the Pulp Mills (Argentina v. Uruguay) case makes a very important contribution to international law relating to shared international water resources and to international environmental law more generally. It does much to clarify the relationship between procedural and substantive rules of international environmental law. The Court linked interstate notification of new projects {{to the satisfaction of}} the customary due diligence obligation to prevent significant transboundary harm. It found that environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an essential requirement of customary international law in respect of activities having potential <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> The real significance of the judgment is that it held that the duty to notify, and the related duty to conduct an EIA taking account of transboundary impacts, exist in customary international law and thus apply to all states, not just those that have concluded international agreements containing such obligations. The Court confirmed that for shared international water resources, the principle of equitable and reasonable utilisation, universally accepted as the cardinal rule of international water law, is virtually synonymous with the concept of sustainable development, and suggests that considerations of environmental protection are absolutely integral to the equitable balancing of interests involved. The judgment makes it clear that the principle of equitable utilisation ought to be understood as a process, rather than a normatively determinative rule. This ought to help to address widespread confusion {{about the nature of the}} key rules and principles of international water resources law and its role in the resolution of water resources disputes and in environmental diplomacy more generally...|$|R

40|$|For some decades, {{there has}} been a growing {{emphasis}} on the importance of intellectual property rights in general, and patents in particular, as a tool of economic strategy and competitiveness. More than 90 % of the patents granted in industrialized countries originate from employee inventors. This reality has prompted legislators in most European Member States to promulgate laws that regulate the matter of employee inventions. This paper aims, in a first part, at describing the characteristics of the legislative regime in several EU Member States. It is shown that, save for university inventions, the legislative landscape has not undergone fundamental changes during the past decades. In today’s globalized world economy the issue of employees’ inventions is, however, no longer a mere national issue. Also in Europe, more and more research takes place in a multinational setting and the <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects</b> of the currently diverging national solutions are important. Hence, the lack of harmonized European rules governing the issue of employee inventions is not only surprising but also unfortunate. The paper discusses some attempts that {{have been made in the}} past all of which have failed at an early stage. Possibly, because the issue of employee inventions is legally situated at the intersection between patent law and labour law, it revealed itself as too tricky to handle. The paper criticizes the current reticence demonstrated by the European legislator. The viewpoint that existing differences between member states' laws on employees' inventions are not likely to have an impact on innovation or on the conditions of competition seems short-sighted. The paper shows that a coherent regulatory framework that takes the trend towards Europeanization is not illusive and may have many benefits for intra-European relationships. It is argued that such a goal is feasible even though the specific details of the current statutes vary from Member State to Member State. status: publishe...|$|R

The scope of the Draft Articles encompasses the activities involving a low probability of causing disastrous transboundary harm or a high probability o f causing significant transboundary harm. International liability arises only when there is a physical link between such an activity and its <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects.</b> Art. 3 of the Prevention Draft imposes a general obligation to take all appropriate measures to prevent significant transboundary harm, or at any event, to minimize the risk thereof.

40|$|Nowadays, {{science has}} been {{evolving}} in {{faster and more}} effective ways {{in order to find}} innovative solutions to reduce the impact that every human activity and new technology have on the environment. This scenario should be the same in the field of environmental law. However, the evolution of environmental laws and policies has been different. Particularly, the harmonization of laws to assess risks of damage to the environment has developed significantly compared to the existing liability systems to address environmental damage. Traditionally, the actions of liability for environmental damage at an international level have been governed by civil liability provisions which have led to unnecessary complexity, overlap of jurisdictions and an unsuccessful restoration of the environment in some cases. This is shown in the efforts of the International Law Commission (ILC) to develop international law to address environmental damage by effective response measures for restoration in addition to compensation. Some other examples followed the same tendency to the administrative approach to liability by means of response measures. The Protocol on Civil Liability and Compensation for Damage Caused by the <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Effects</b> of Industrial Accidents on Transboundary Waters included the concept of response measures following an industrial accident notwithstanding the civil liability nature of the protocol. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty rephrases a similar procedure to the administrative approach to liability implementing response actions in case of an environmental emergency. However, the first legal instrument addressing environmental damage via an administrative approach to liability is the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (The Nagoya Protocol). This paper will analyze the Nagoya Protocol as an example of administrative approach to liability in case of damage to biodiversity and will examine the challenges to implement this Protocol in domestic legislation. Key issues will be explored such as the distinction between administrative approach to liability and administrative liability in the sense of State liability, the concept of operator linked to causality, and a clear distinction between, regulatory measures targeted to minimizing risk; and, liability measures applicable after the damage has occurred, in order to provide for restoration or compensation...|$|R
40|$|After {{discussing}} ownership {{issues related}} to tropical forests, theauthor develops a simple general equilibrium model to represent - {{at least in a}} stylized way - the salient aspects of the deforestation process. He uses the model to generate first- and second-best policy options for controlling deforestation and, later, to assess the environmental consequences of government policies often cited in the literature on deforestation. Property rights, though important for understanding the process of tropical deforestation, do not necessarily point to a simple or straightfoward fix for environmental problems, particularly in developing countries. The sheer size, communal nature of service flows, and pervasiveness of individual access to tropical forests make monitoring and enforcement costly in some situations and unimaginable in others. Redefining nominal rights in ways that appear to correct inefficiencies may yield gains in some cases, but an approach to environmental protection that leans heavily on this prescription seems aimed more at symptoms than at causes, says the author. Moreover, policy approaches based on the use of Pigovian taxes or marketable permit schemes may yield efficiency gains in some cases, but such approaches generally involve the same monitoring and enforcement problems that prevent the market from solving allocation problems. Simple, direct solutions to deforestation and other environmental problems are unavailable, but an ability to understand the environmental and welfare consequences of policies adopted for other reasons is useful - if only to help policymakers avoid mistakes that would otherwise go unrecognized. The model the author develops for this purpose is highly stylized and intended primarily to provide a systematic way of thinking about the environmental and welfare effects of government policy - for example, by considering patterns of substitution among inputs and outputs, in cases where an environmental resource to which people have free access is exploited. If the use of first-best policies is infeasible - whether because of monitoringcosts, <b>transboundary</b> <b>effects,</b> or other reasons - then it becomes important to have detailed knowledge of patterns of substitution and complementarity among ordinary inputs and environmental resources, and information on the use of various environmental resources in the production of specific goods and services. Knowledge of such factors can permit policymakers to pursue policy goals in situations where first-best instruments are unavailable.

40|$|This {{case book}} has been {{compiled}} {{within the framework of}} Phase III of the programme on Regional Air Pollution in Developing Countries (RAPIDC) funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and coordinated by the Stockholm Environmental Institute (SEI). This work has been produced by the International Institute of Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University with input from the programme’s National Implementing Agencies (generally research organisations, pollution control boards, etc.) in Asia and Africa. This document generally focuses upon, and is primarily directed towards the eight signatory countries to the Malé Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and Its Likely <b>Transboundary</b> <b>Effects</b> for South Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Iran, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) but is in essence relevant to most developing countries. The casebook is to serve as a decision support information resource for air pollution related policy formulation. It is also intended to support the implementation of mitigation options that promote pollution prevention and control. The casebook has a number of key components. • Background that provides context for the developing countries in focus. This seeks to highlight many parameters of particular relevance to the creation of, and relative impacts of air pollution. • A presentation of the social and economic form of a number of major pollution sources. This content is intended to provide examples and substance to discussions of both why such developing countries are structurally vulnerable to the formation of conditions that can generate excessive air pollution challenges, and also where key leverage points for addressing the underlying causes of air pollution can be. • A discussion of the different forms that policy interventions can take and delineation of guidelines for the implementation of the range of possible air pollution interventions in the context of such developing countries. • The provision of a broad suite of policy intervention case studies drawn from other countries. These present successful examples of legal, fiscal and other policy measures that have been put in place in a range of jurisdictions around the globe. The contents of this resource case-book have been presented, discussed and worked with at a series of RAPIDC programme workshops on policy development and have been successively developed in the period 2006 to 2008 in order to tailor them to the situations of the Malé countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{development}} and implementation of a three-dimensional, numerical pollutant transport model, which is based on an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system in the horizontal direction and a sigma coordinate system in the vertical direction, is delineated. An efficient as well as simple open boundary condition is employed for pollutant transport in this mathematical model. It is then applied to model the distribution and transport of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE). The results from the numerical simulations illustrate that the <b>transboundary</b> or inter-boundary <b>effects</b> of pollutants, between the Guangdong Province and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region due to the wastewater discharged from the Pearl River Delta Region, are quite strong...|$|R
