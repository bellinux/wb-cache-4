40|$|Plant root exudates affect root-knot {{nematodes}} egg hatch. Chemicals in root exudates {{can attract}} nematodes {{to the roots}} or result in repellence, motility inhibition or even death. However, until recently little was known {{about the relationship between}} tomato root exudates chemicals and root-knot nematodes. In this study, root exudates were extracted from three <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> with varying levels of nematode resistance: Baliya (highly resistant, HR), RS 2 (moderately resistant, MR) and L- 402 (highly susceptible, T). The effects of the root exudates on Meloidogyne incognita (M. incognita) egg hatch, survival and chemotaxis of second-stage juveniles (J 2) were explored. The composition of the root exudates was analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) prior to and following M. incognita inoculation. Four compounds in root exudates were selected for further analysis and their allopathic effect on M. incognita were investigated. Root exudates from each <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> (HR, MR and T strains) suppressed M. incognita egg hatch and increased J 2 mortality, with the highest rate being observed in the exudates from the HR plants. Exudate from HR variety also repelled M. incognita J 2 while that of the susceptible plant, T, was demonstrated to be attractive. The relative amount of esters and phenol compounds in root exudates from HR and MR <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> increased notably after inoculation. Four compounds, 2, 6 -Di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, L-ascorbyl 2, 6 -dipalmitate, dibutyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate increased significantly after inoculation. The egg hatch of M. incognita was suppressed by each of the compound. L-ascorbyl 2, 6 -dipalmitate showed the most notable effect in a concentration-dependent manner. All four compounds were associated with increased J 2 mortality. The greatest effect was observed with dimethyl phthalate at 2 mmol·L- 1. Dibutyl phthalate was the only compound observed to repel M. incognita J 2 with no effect being detected in the other compounds. Each of the four compounds were correlated with a reduction in disease index in the susceptible cultivar, T, and tomato seedlings irrigated with L-ascorbyl 2, 6 -dipalmitate at 2 mmol·L- 1 showed the best resistance to M. incognita. Taken together, this study provided a valuable contribution to understanding the underlying mechanism of nematode resistance in tomato cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Wilt {{damage on}} tomato plants caused by Ralstonia solanacearum has been {{increased}} as {{the areas of}} tomato cultivation increased during the warm seasons. Also, the <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> used to prevent the disease occurrence are not effective in the highly prevailing regions. Therefore, bacterial wilt resistant eggplant rootstock EG 203, collected from AVRDC, was tested for its effect to deter the Ralstonia solanacearum wilt disease in the greenhouses at Buyeo Tomato Experiment Station from 2003 to 2005, and at Gumi, Kyungpook province from 2009 − 2011. Planting of eggplant rootstock EG 203 should be done {{three weeks before the}} planting of tomato scions so that they can have similar stem diameter (2. 5 − 3. 0 mm) and can be easily grafted. Both insertion and inarching grafting showed 93 − 96 % success rates. In the greenhouse tests at Buyeo Tomato Experiment Station from 2003 to 2005, eggplant rootstock EG 203 -grafted tomatoes showed the disease occurrence of 4. 3 %. On the other hand, non-grafted or other commercial rootstock-grafted tomatoes showed disease occurrence of 58. 0 % and 25. 0 − 36. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Soil {{contamination}} {{by heavy}} metals negatively affects crop productivity, besides representing {{serious threat to}} human health. Grafting tomato onto appropriate rootstocks may raise Ni tolerance through limiting heavy metal uptake by roots and/or its translocation to the shoot and by detoxification. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to {{determine the influence of}} long-term Ni exposure (0, 25, or 50 mM) on crop productivity, fruit quality, leaf chlorophyll content, fluorescence, electrolyte leakage, catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activities in leaf, proline content, membrane lipid peroxidation, and mineral composition of tomato plants cv. Ikram, either self-grafted or grafted onto three rootstocks: Black Beauty, Unifort, and Maxifort. Significant reduction in yield was observed in response to an increase in Ni concentration with more detrimental effects at 50 mM Ni. The fruit dry matter and total soluble solids content increased under severe Ni stress. The depression of crop performance under Ni toxicity was attributed to a decrease in leaf pigments (SPAD index), efficiency of PSII, macro and microelements, and increase in lipid peroxidation and membrane damage. Plants grafted onto <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> Maxifort and Unifort exhibited higher chlorophyll content, photochemical activity of PSII, antioxidant activity of APX and GPX, lower accumulation of MDA, and a better nutritional status (higher Ca and Fe, and lower Ni) in the leaf tissues in comparison with selfgrafted plants and those grafted onto Black Beauty. Plants grafted onto <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> Unifort and especially Maxifort could minimize the nickel toxicity by improving nutritional status and detoxification processes...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effect of primig treatments (2 % KNO 3, 1 % NaCl, 500 ppm GA 3) on seedling emergence and seedling growth of two <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstock</b> seeds for two experimental runs.

40|$|In April 2010, the {{research}} program ‘Green Breeding’ {{started in the}} Netherlands, which is subsidized by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) and several private breeding companies. With this program, the Dutch government stimulates breeding research, which contributes to a more sustainable agriculture and horticulture. As part of this research program, this <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstock</b> project was granted for the period April 2010 to April 2013. It is aimed at identifying the key physiological traits that are characteristic of a vigorous rootstock, thus providing breeding companies with an effective selection method to breed robust rootstocks for both the conventional and organic production of tomatoes. Breeding for vigorous rootstocks is still a matter of trial and error. Practical selection tools like genetic markers are lacking because the knowledge about the physiology behind a successful rootstock (root-shoot interaction) is limited. In addition, the desired root traits studied in this project, nutrient-uptake efficiency, salinity and suboptimal-temperature tolerance, are complex and the identified Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have hardly any value for practical breeding purposes. This project will therefore not focus on the identification of single allele-specific markers for traits that are expressed in a particular hybrid combination. Instead, it aims to identify biomarkers (particular physiological traits) as generic tools to develop a reliable screening method which supports the selection of vigorous rootstocks.

40|$|Two {{years of}} field trials {{conducted}} in a Meloidogyne incognita-infested field evaluated grafting and Paladin Pic- 21 (dimethyl disulfide:chloropicrin [DMDS:Pic] 79 : 21) for root-knot nematode and weed control in tomato and melon. <b>Tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> evaluated were; 'TX 301 ', 'Multifort', and 'Aloha'. 'Florida 47 ' was the scion and the nongrafted control. A double crop of melon was planted into existing beds following tomato harvest. Melon rootstocks, C. metulifer and 'Tetsukabuto', were evaluated with nongrafted 'Athena' in year 1. In year 2, watermelon followed tomato with scion variety 'Tri-X Palomar' as the control and also grafted onto 'Emphasis' and 'Strongtosa' rootstocks. Four soil treatments were applied in fall both years under Canslit metalized film; Paladin Pic- 21, methyl bromide:chloropicrin (MeBr:C 33, 67 : 33), Midas (iodomethane:chloropicrin 50 : 50), and a herbicide-treated control. M. incognita J 2 in soil were highest in herbicide control plots and nongrafted tomato. All soil treatments produced similar tomato growth,which was greater than the herbicide control. All treatments reduced M. incognita J 2 in roots compared to the herbicide control. 'Multifort' rootstock produced the largest and healthiest roots; however, the number of M. incognita isolated from roots did not differ among the <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> tested. Galling on tomato was highest in herbicide control plots and nongrafted plants. In melon, M. incognita J 2 in soil did not differ among melon rootstocks, but numbers isolated from melon rootstocks increased in 'Tetsukabuto' compared with C. metuliferus. 'Tetsukabuto' were larger root systems than nongrafted 'Athena'. All fumigants provided protection for all melon rootstocks against galling by M. incognita compared to the herbicide control. Galling on C. metuliferus rootstock was less in all fumigant treatments compared with nongrafted 'Athena' and 'Tetsukabuto'. In watermelon, M. incognita in soil and roots did not differ among soil treatments or watermelon rootstocks, and yield was lower in both grafted rootstocks compared with the nongrafted control. All soil treatments increased average fruit weight of watermelon compared with the herbicide control, and provided effective weed control, keeping the most predominant weed, purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.), density at or below 1 /m row.

40|$|Grafting is {{regarded}} as a promising tool to broaden the temperature optimum of elite tomato cultivars. However, suitable low-temperature tolerant <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> are not yet available and its breeding is hampered by a lack of variation in low-temperature tolerance within the cultivated tomato. In this study, therefore, the impact of grafting tomato (Solanum lycopersicum Mill. cv. Moneymaker, Sl) onto the rootstock of a cold-tolerant high-altitude accession of a related wild species (Solanum habrochaites LA 1777 Humb. & Bonpl., Sh) was examined at different combinations of optimal (25 degrees C) and/or suboptimal (15 degrees C) air/root-zone temperatures (RZT), i. e. 25 / 25, 25 / 15, 15 / 25 and 15 / 15 degrees C. Self-grafted tomato plants were used as controls. Both scion/rootstock combinations, Sl/Sl and Sl/Sh, were grown hydroponically and compared for biomass production and partitioning, plant morphology, carbohydrate partitioning and leaf C and N status. Grafting tomato onto Sh increased the relative growth rate of shoots with 26 and 11 % at 25 / 15 and 15 / 15 degrees C, respectively. This increase could be attributed to stimulation of the leaf expansion rate. Graft combinations with Sh rootstocks were characterized by higher root mass ratios, particularly at 15 degrees C RZT. Suboptimal RZT strongly reduced the relative growth rate of Sl roots but not of Sh. This was correlated to differences in inhibition of root elongation. In contrast to tomato grafted onto Sh, leaf total C and total N concentrations increased in self-grafted tomato plants in response to 15 degrees C RZT. The increase in leaf total C concentration of Sl/Sl graft combinations at 15 degrees C RZT could be ascribed largely to starch accumulation. This study illustrates that growth of vegetative tomato plants at suboptimal temperature is for a significant part inhibited by its poor root development. Grafting tomato onto a low-temperature rootstock provides an alternative tool to reduce, in part, the grow-limiting effects of suboptimal RZ temperature on the shoot.

The {{objectives of the}} present investigation were to evaluate the productivity of grafted tomato plants (Solanumlycopersicum cv. Santa Adélia) grown organically in Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil, and to assess scion/rootstock compatibility under organic growth conditions. The Solanum species employed as rootstocks were S. gilo (jiló), S. lycocarpum (jurubebão), S. stramonifolium (jurubeba vermelha) and S. viarum (joá), while the susceptible S. lycopersicum cultivar Santa Adélia was the scion. Ungrafted tomato plants and tomato grafted on <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstock</b> were employed as controls. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized block design with six treatments and five repetitions of five plants each. Data were submitted to analysis of variance and the significance of differences between treatments were determined using the Tukey test (P< 0. 05). All ungrafted tomato plants and those comprising tomato grafted on S. lycopersicum rootstock became infected by brown rot and perished. The total numbers of fruits, numbers of marketable fruits, mean masses of fruits, total productivities and productivities of marketable fruits associated with tomato grafted on S. gilo, S. lycocarpum and S. stramonifolium rootstocks were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than the equivalent values obtained with tomato grafted on S. viarum rootstock. S. gilo exhibited the best compatibility index (1. 11) of all rootstock/scion combinations studied.

The highest incidence of infection (60 - 100 %) {{was observed in}} tomatoes grafted on Beaufort DRS <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstock.</b> Since the symptoms were similar to those described for Tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), detection assays for these viruses were used. In DAS-ELISA positive results were obtained with a abroad-spectrums reagent combination (distributed by Bioreba AG) detecting TYLCV, TYLCSV, and other begomoviruses. When DNA probes were used in tissue print assays, positive reactions were obtained for TYLCSV, but not for TYLCV. The two probes consisted of digoxigenin-labelled DNAs representing the coat protein gene of either TYLCSV or TYLCV. Attempts to isolate the viral agent by mechanical inoculation failed, except in few cases where Potato virus Y and Tobacco mosaic virus were identified following transmission from symptomatic plants to herbaceous indicatorpplants. By contrast, grafting onto tomato seedlings always successfully transmitted the disease. In the Castrovillari area TYLCSV was not reported before. The rootstocks that nurseries used for grafting were obtained from Sicily, where the disease is endemic and both TYLCSV and TYLCV are widespread. Probably the grafted plantlets represented the primary source of infection from which subsequent diffusion by way of the vector Bemisia tabaci followed. In fact the vector had previously been detected in both the glasshouse-grown and open field tomato crops in Calabria region. TYLCV was previously reported in a different area of Calabria in 1991, but apparently it was an occasional outbreak, and B. tabaci was not detected. Since in the Castrovillari area surveyed in the present study tomato is grown throughtout the year in protected crops, the whitefly vector of the virus is present, and some natural hosts of the virus are found, it is feared that TYLCSV may become endemic, as already happened in Sicily, Sardinia, and Spain several years ago. In Spain and Sicily TYLCV, together with TYLCSV, was reported as the causal agent of very severe tomato crop losses.

Cucumber rootstocks meeting for the greater part these requirements are 64 - 10, 64 - 12 and Harry. However, seed production of these rootstocks was recently discontinued by the seed companies. Interbreedings between Cucurbita maxima and C. moschata are not sufficiently resistant against M. species. In <b>tomato</b> best performing <b>rootstocks</b> are PG 76, Brigéor and Big Power.

40|$|In organic {{greenhouse}} vegetable production, significant {{yield loss}} occurs due to root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). Soil steaming is effective; however, {{it is not}} preferred, since beneficial soil micro organisms are eliminated. An inclusion of resistant hosts within the crop rotation {{is complicated by the}} broad host range of the nematode and the high level of specialization of companies towards production of fruit vegetables. Nearly all species of fruit vegetables are susceptible to a varying degree and complete resistance is absent. Even when rootstocks show partial resistance, this is broken down at high temperatures and with an increase in nematode densities. In addition, a lack of compatibility between the rootstock and graft is reported. The objective of the research was to find a rootstock with a high resistance against the most important Meloidogyne species in greenhouses in the Netherlands, M. incognita and M. hapla. Secondly, rootstocks should combine resistance with high yield and quality. In five experiments, 16 to 28 rootstocks per vegetable crop were tested for susceptibility, based on the number and size of root-knots and degree of nematode reproduction. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), one of the best performing rootstocks was ‘PG 76 ’; in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) ‘RZ 64 - 10 ’ and ‘Harry’ performed well.

40|$|Grafting is {{an easier}} and faster {{approach}} than plant breeding {{to take advantage}} of both existing resistant plants, especially wild cultivars, and high-bred cultivars. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the changes in leaf photosynthetic capacity of a hybrid eggplant Solanum melongena L., cv. Rima (R), widely used in Greece] when grafted on <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> known for their resistance to nematodes and diseases. For this purpose, a hybrid egg-plant has been used as a control and has been self-grafted (grafting of a scion on its own roots used as rootstock) RR and also as a scion on two hybrid tomatoes rootstocks, as follows: Primavera (RP) and Heman (RH). Leaf photosynthetic capacity was estimated by measuring the leaf gas exchanges under several light levels at ambient CO(2) concentration to approximate the leaf light response curve. The measurements performed control plant R and self-grafted eggplants RR show that the leaf respiration per unit leaf area is not altered by the scion/rootstock combination. These elements point out a scion controlled respiration, independent of the rootstock. The leaf photosynthetic capacities of the R and RR treatments were not different, while one of the scion/rootstock combinations (RH) showed a significant change with respect to the control treatments. The rootstock therefore seems to be able to modify the scion leaf photosynthetic capacity, but this may not be true for some scion/rootstock combinations (RP in our case). Leaf stomatal conductance and transpiration were not modified by the grafting, so that the water use efficiency was only altered by the modifications of the net assimilation...|$|E

5000|$|Grafting <b>tomatoes</b> with {{tolerant}} <b>rootstocks</b> {{has been}} highly effective at producing a saline-tolerant plants. Research indicates that several rootstocks prevent the translocation of sodium and chloride into the shoot. [...] Many {{of the most}} economically important vegetable crops like tomato, squash, cucumber, and watermelon are highly sensitive to thermal stress in the roots throughout vegetative development and reproduction. Whether using rootstock tolerant of hot or cold temperatures, the use of temperature tolerant rootstocks often leads to {{the extension of the}} growing season in either direction, resulting in better yield and economic stability through the year.2 [...] Although the vegetable grafting is typically associated with reduction of disease or abiotic stress, yield is often increased without the presence of these identified sources of stress. In tomatoes, increases in fruit yield are typically the results of increased fruit size. [...] Research has shown that possible mechanisms for increased yield are likely due to increased water and nutrient uptake among vigorous rootstock genotypes. Conductance through the stoma was improved in tomato plants when grafted onto vigorous rootstock.7 [...] Nutrient uptake for the macronutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, were enhanced by grafting.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{limitations}} on agricultural development in many countries is the high salinity of the groundwater used in irrigation. Grafted plants may exhibit phenotypic variations from scion and rootstock plants in terms of abiotic stress tolerance, and be a method for improvement of tolerance in agricultural practices. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate response of Solanum lycopersicum L. ('Elaziğ') grafted on Nicotiana tabacum L. ('Samsun') and Nicotiana rustica L. ('Hasankeyf'), namely "Tomacco" plant (patent nr TR- 2008 - 05391 -B), to 10 -d high NaCl irrigation. Physical development, chlorophyll a and b, total chlorophyll, total carotenoid, and anthocyanin levels were evaluated. Proline, lipid peroxidation, and electrolyte leakage levels were assayed in roots and leaves together with ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) activities. Considering alterations in chlorophyll contents, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), and conductivity levels, and antioxidant enzyme activity levels scion and self-grafted plants seem to be more affected by salt treatments than tobacco and rootstock grafted plants. Tobacco roots seem to have better adaptive responses against salt stress in comparison to tomato as supported by changes in proline, APX, and CAT levels. Self-grafting experiments further supported grafting <b>tomato</b> onto tobacco <b>rootstocks</b> enhanced salt tolerance and adaptive response of scions and these changes seem to be dependent on rootstock rather than graft-induced changes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that previously defined graft unions of tomato on tobacco, which have increased fruit yield, had also enhanced tolerance to high salt stress and a promising technique for the cultivation of more salt tolerant varieties...|$|R

RivardAs {{populations of}} cities {{continue}} to increases, {{communities in the}} United States are implementing urban food systems including locally-cultivated produce. Urban and peri-urban farmers apply intensive production systems, including high tunnels, to better utilize limited space. Grafting tomato with vigorous rootstocks provides the potential for higher yields. Our first objective was to identify <b>tomato</b> <b>rootstocks</b> that improve productivity in high tunnel environments with no soilborne diseases in the Central U. S. Eight replicated high tunnel trials were conducted at four sites in northeastern Kansas in 2013 and 2014. We selected 'BHN 589 ' scion for all sites and evaluated seven rootstocks. Grafting with ‘Maxifort’, ‘Multifort’, ‘Arnold’, ‘DRO 131 ’, and ‘Colosus’ rootstocks resulted in significant increases in total fruit yield, which ranged from 40 % to 73 % when compared to nongrafted plants (P< 0. 05). No significant increases in yield were observed for ‘RT- 1028 ’ and ‘RST- 04 - 106 ’ rootstocks. Our results suggested that tomato growers that utilize high tunnels should be strategic when selecting rootstocks. Our second objective was to develop simple propagation techniques that yield high quality grafted transplants for small-batch propagators. Formation of adventitious roots (AR) from the scion can result in poor quality plants and loss of rootstock function/benefit. Greenhouse studies were designed to investigate how leaf removal (LR) affects AR formation and plant growth post-grafting. We applied three treatments, 0 % LR, 50 % LR, and 90 % LR, to the ‘BHN 589 ’ scion and then grafted them onto ‘Maxifort’ rootstock. The experiment included 4 replicated blocks and was conducted in three different healing chambers. Our results indicate that both 50 % and 90 % LR significantly decreased AR formation in the low humidity chamber, but only 90 % LR reduced AR formation in the chambers with high humidity (P< 0. 05). We measured plant growth 24 to 52 days post-grafting to understand how leaf removal affects transplant quality, growth, and development. Plants with 90 % LR had significant growth reduction at day 24 but at day 52, only had reduced stem diameter and height compared to 0 % LR. Total flower count was {{the same for all}} treatments.
