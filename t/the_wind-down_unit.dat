5000|$|Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank S.p.A. {{also known}} as HBI is an Italian bank based in Tavagnacco, in the Province of Udine, Friuli - Venezia Giulia region. The {{registered}} office of the bank was located in Udine. In the past the bank was a subsidiary of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International, which was planned to wind-down as [...] "bad bank" [...] and separate saleable assets in 2013 as [...] "good bank". In 2014 the subsidiary was spin-off from the bad bank as a separate <b>wind-down</b> <b>unit.</b> As at 31 December 2014, Hypo Italy was a subsidiary HBI-Bundesholding A.G., a Vienna-based sub-holding company for the government of Austria.|$|R
50|$|The {{roadster}} had removable plastic {{side windows}} instead of <b>wind-down</b> <b>units,</b> {{and a short}} top which eliminated the need for rear quarter windows. More permanent swing-out vent windows were available as an option. However, Californian regulations on hand signalling meant that roll-down windows had to be added quick and retro-fitted to Californian market vehicles. This happened in September, after which the roll-down windows became a rarely selected delete-option. A roadster with a rumble seat was even tested (with a bottom-hinged trunk lid), but the opening {{would have had to}} be moved and the cost of tooling up for such an option meant that it was soon dropped.|$|R

[...] This was {{followed}} by eleven more of the Band's most popular songs, including [...] "The Shape I'm In", [...] "This Wheel's on Fire" [...] and [...] "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down". They were backed by a large horn section with charts arranged by Allen Toussaint and other musicians.|$|R
50|$|The {{second half}} of the {{development}} was launched in 1990-92 with 49, 94 and 31 lots opened respectively in those three years, as the residential section advanced to the south down the steeper slopes and west across Ratcliffe Road. This permitted construction of the last nine holes, 1, 3-8, 17 and 18 of the golf course and new clubhouse facility and the covered tennis courts. During <b>the</b> <b>wind-down</b> of <b>the</b> construction of the {{second half of}} development, CRC brought in Burrard International Holdings Inc. as a 50% equity partner.|$|R
500|$|By {{early summer}} 1953, {{thanks in part}} to <b>the</b> <b>wind-down</b> of {{hostilities}} in the Korean War, the French command had [...] "sufficient reserves" [...] at hand to begin clearing the Viet Minh back from Route One. They assembled 30 battalions, two armored regiments and two artillery regiments for one of the largest operations of the conflict. Called Operation Camargue, it was named for the sandy marshland to the west of Marseille, France. The difficult terrain was to prove the decisive factor and gave a major advantage to the one Viet Minh regiment tasked with defending Route One.|$|R
50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>wind-down</b> of <b>the</b> Second Congo War, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1399 {{was adopted}} {{unanimously}} on March 19, 2002. Stressing that no party {{would be allowed}} to make military gains during the peace process, the UN demanded that the RCD-Goma immediately withdraw from Moliro and Pweto and for all other parties to withdraw to defensive positions called for in the Harare disengagement sub-plans.On 21 June 2002, child soldiers of the pro-government Mai Mai militia entered the town, and RDC officials hastily left.Later that month the Rwandan-backed RDC-Goma forces again took control of Pweto, threatening the peace agreement under which Pweto was declared a demilitarized zone.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{ended its}} {{assignment}} to France Field on 23 March 1944 and, with <b>the</b> gradual <b>wind-down</b> of Sixth Air Force, {{was one of}} the units slated to be disbanded. The unit was subsequently disbanded on 25 May 1944.|$|R
50|$|On 18 February 1943 the 45th Bomb Squadron was {{transferred}} to Seymour Field, Galapagos Islands. In May it moved back to Panama, being assigned to Howard Field, Panama Canal Zone.

5000|$|Gerassi {{marks the}} {{sentencing}} of Melvin Dir on January 21, 1957, following a probation violation as {{the conclusion of}} the scandal. Along with the public unease over the Baker incident and the embarrassment of the Time publicity, Gerassi suggests that the crackdown was getting too close to people entrenched within the same power elite that had pushed the investigation in the first place. Boise police sergeant Don Jerome, speaking several years after <b>the</b> <b>wind-down,</b> concurred in this assessment. [...] "The 1955-1956 scandal boomeranged. Too many people were hurt. The city's reputation was too drastically damaged." [...] However, some of the men convicted in the crackdown dispute this interpretation. One stated, [...] "The real big shots I knew as homosexuals never were arrested." [...] Another agreed: [...] "And they knew who that millionaire 'Queen' was. They knew all about him before they picked me up, because they asked me about him. And...I confirmed it." [...] By the end of the investigation, 1,472 people had been interviewed.|$|R
50|$|During World War II the U.S. Navy {{had built}} up a team of {{engineers}} to build codebreaking machinery for both Japanese and German electro-mechanical ciphers. A number of these were produced by a team dedicated to the task working in the Washington, D.C., area. With <b>the</b> post-war <b>wind-down</b> of military spending, the Navy grew increasingly worried that this team would break up and scatter into various companies, and it started {{looking for ways to}} covertly keep the team together.|$|R
50|$|Later, when Treasury {{officials}} {{were looking for}} a chief counsel for the Office of Financial Stability, Silvers recommended Massad. Massad left Cravath in May 2009 to take the position. Following the departure of Herbert M. Allison, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability, Massad was named acting Assistant Secretary beginning in September 2010. The U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment as Assistant Secretary in June 2011. In this role he has supervised <b>the</b> gradual <b>wind-down</b> of TARP.|$|R
50|$|In late 1944, the Bureau of Ships {{consulted}} {{with a group}} of submarine officers chaired by COMSUBPAC Admiral Charles A. Lockwood on specifications for a future submarine. Several designs were considered. The submarine officers wanted a deeper test depth, more torpedo tubes, and a higher speed, but got only part of what they wanted. The final design merged ambition with realism. Known as Design B, it was developed by May 1945. It was to be 336 ft long, 1960 long ton t surfaced displacement (2990 long ton t submerged), with larger engines (12-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse with two-stage supercharging) for a speed of 22.5 kn surfaced. Armament was to be twelve 21 in torpedo tubes (six forward, six aft), with six short 21 in external torpedo tubes in the superstructure for the Mark 27 acoustic homing anti-escort torpedo. The external tubes would be arranged with three each firing to port and starboard. Test depth would be increased to 500 ft. <b>The</b> <b>wind-down</b> of submarine production in 1945 brought an end to this project. Had SS-551 through SS-562 not been cancelled, it is possible they would have been built to the new design.|$|R

In 1966 Rolls-Royce {{purchased}} Bristol Siddeley, but the financial pressures and eventual bankruptcy because of cost overruns of the RB211 project led to <b>the</b> slow <b>wind-down</b> and eventual disappearance of Whittle's [...] "turbo-drill". The concept eventually re-appeared in {{the west in the}} late 1980s, imported from Russian designs. [...] (Russia needed the technology because it lacked high strength drill pipe.) ...|$|R
50|$|Public {{transport}} and vital transport services are closed-down on Christmas day (December 25) and remain closed for essential maintenance work until New Year. <b>The</b> Christmas <b>wind-down</b> starts early, with last trains {{running out of}} the major cities as early as 19:00 on December 24. Bus, night bus, and underground services are also unavailable from about 21:00 hours. Individual transport companies start make announcement from as early as October, and while one train operating company may choose to run no trains on Boxing Day another may run a limited Saturday service but totally close major stations.|$|R

50|$|Score {{revenues}} declined 41% in {{the first}} quarter of 2009, and operating losses at Score increased from $3.7 million {{in the first}} quarter of 2008 to $17.6 million {{in the first quarter}} of 2009, inclusive of restructuring charges. At the end of March 2009, the Washington Post Company approved a plan to offer tutoring services, previously provided at Score, in Kaplan test prep centers. In conjunction with this plan, 14 existing Score centers will be converted into Kaplan test prep centers and the remaining 64 Score centers will be closed. The plan is expected to be substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2009. Washington Post recorded $11.5 million in asset write-downs, severance and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets {{in the first quarter of}} 2009, including a $9.2 million write-down on Score’s software product. Additional operating losses of approximately $19.2 million are expected to be recorded during the remainder of 2009; these estimated losses are related to <b>the</b> <b>wind-down</b> period of <b>the</b> 64 Score centers to be closed, including $15.0 million related to lease obligations, severance and accelerated depreciation of fixed assets. Poor upper regional management and internal weak structures eventually led to a class action lawsuit for violating labor laws brought on by Score! employees which settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.|$|R
5000|$|By November 1944, {{the unit}} had finally started {{benefiting from the}} {{production}} of transport types in the United States, and could finally approach some semblance of standardization in its fleet. The {{last year of the}} war, with <b>the</b> general <b>wind-down</b> of <b>the</b> size and breadth of Sixth Air Force, saw a gradual reduction in the previously hectic flight schedules for 20th crews. By this time, the Squadron had also received some Curtiss C-46 Commandos. [...] Routine transport operations within Panama, South and Central America continued, with a C-47 aiding a forest fire in the Peten region of Guatemala.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 {{the bank}} was re-privatized, with the {{formation}} of a bad bank Società per la Gestione di Attività (SGA), as well as <b>wind-down</b> <b>the</b> subsidiary ISVEIMER; 60% stake of {{the bank was}} acquired by Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni (INA) and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) via an intermediate holding company (INASSIT, later Banco di Napoli Holding).|$|R
5000|$|Bank size, complexity, and {{interconnectedness}} {{with other}} banks may inhibit {{the ability of}} the government to resolve (<b>wind-down)</b> <b>the</b> bank without significant disruption to the financial system or economy, as occurred with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008. This risk of [...] "too big to fail" [...] entities increases the likelihood of a government bailout using taxpayer dollars.|$|R
5000|$|Saskatchewan Development Fund Corporation is a crown {{corporation}} {{established by}} the Government of Saskatchewan in Canada to provide residents with a low risk investment fund. Established in 1973, shares were sold {{to the general public}} in Saskatchewan until 1983. [...] The fund continues to operate, however new shares are not offered for sale. The fund had also offered RRSP, Deferred Profit Sharing Plans and term-certain annuities. By 1982, the combined fund reached a value of $42 million; since that point the board has concentrated on the remaining clients and on <b>the</b> orderly <b>wind-down</b> of <b>the</b> fund; by 2007, the funds assets were reduced down to $3.2 million.|$|R
5000|$|John Walker of MTV {{wrote that}} the song is [...] "literally <b>the</b> perfect end-of-summer, <b>wind-down</b> anthem," [...] and that it {{effectively}} captures the [...] "nihilistic, live-for-the-moment dance pop" [...] sensibilities of contemporary pop singles. Sam Lansky of Idolator called the song [...] "great," [...] praising its [...] "less slick" [...] production (compared to Joy) and its [...] "mix of pop sensibility and an unbratty punk edge," [...] which he wrote was [...] "quintessentially Dobson." ...|$|R
