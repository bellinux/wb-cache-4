25|$|While an inexperienced rider {{may feel}} more secure with a {{slightly}} too-short stirrup, in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a stabilizing agent, much {{in the same way}} the long pole of a <b>tightrope</b> <b>walker</b> balances the acrobat. Obviously, a stirrup leather so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a stirrup length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the stirrup until the rider feels they will not lose the stirrup is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the stirrup is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct stirrup length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|E

2500|$|... "Clown Stops" [...] or [...] "interludes" [...] are {{the brief}} {{appearances}} of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically {{made up of}} a few gags or several bits. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called [...] "reprises" [...] or [...] "run-ins" [...] by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of [...] "business" [...] usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a <b>tightrope</b> <b>walker</b> the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the artiste by trying to walk between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.|$|E
2500|$|A huge crowd {{attraction}} at {{the gardens}} was the well-known <b>tightrope</b> <b>walker</b> Charles Blondin, who first {{performed at the}} gardens in August 1860. The previous year he had caused a sensation by crossing the Niagara Falls on a tightrope. In May, at the Crystal Palace, he had carried across a stove on the rope, then, still suspended on the wire, proceeded to cook omelettes, which he distributed to the audience below. On the evening of 23 August 1860, however, as the crowd packed the gardens, the tightrope broke, {{which led to the}} supporting scaffolding collapsing. [...] Blondin was not injured, but two workers who were on the scaffolding fell to their deaths. [...] Although they appeared as witnesses at an initial investigation, Blondin and his manager failed to appear at a further one (they were in the USA) and a warrant was issued for their arrest. [...] However, things must have been ironed out, because August of the following year found the [...] "far-famed unambulist performing his arduous and daring exploits" [...] at the gardens, followed by [...] "Madame Veroni's magic exploits".|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a <b>tightrope</b> <b>walker,</b> you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He {{knew exactly what he was}} doing."

2500|$|These {{include an}} {{inscription}} on the tower {{to the memory}} of Robert Cadman, a <b>tightrope</b> <b>walker</b> who was killed in 1739. Also in the tower is a recumbent effigy by Richard Westmacott junior depicting Col C. R. Cureton who was killed in India in 1848. Inside the west entrance of the nave is a brass upon marble plaque memorial to men of the 85th Regiment of Foot who died serving in the Afghan War of 1879-80. In the north transept is a wall memorial to Rev John Brickdale Blakeway, vicar of the church, and a local historian, who died in 1826. Also in the north transept are memorials to Nicholas Stafford, who died in 1473, and Admiral Benbow who died of wounds in 1702. The oldest memorial in the church stands in the arch between the chancel and Trinity Chapel. It is a tomb chest with the effigy of a knight, and probably dates from the 1340s. In the south aisle is a grave slab from about 1100 carved with a cross and interlacing. [...] Trinity Chapel contains separate stone tablets to men of the Shropshire Yeomanry who died in the World Wars, besides a roll of honour listing names of those who died in the Second, and a sandstone parish war memorial headed by a crucifix to parishioners who died during World War I, with a list of names that include VC recipient W.N. Stone [...] Katherine Mary Harley (1855-1917), a committed Christian and Suffragist, is also commemorated on the memorial, she was killed at Monastir in 1917 aged 61, while nursing Serbian refugees. Katherine trained at the Salop Infirmary adjacent to St Mary's; she was the sister of both Field Marshal Sir John French and the Irish Nationalist Charlotte Despard.|$|E
2500|$|Dozens {{of experts}} such as Matthew Digby Wyatt and Owen Jones were hired {{to create a}} series of courts that {{provided}} a narrative {{of the history of}} fine art. Amongst these were Augustus Pugin's Mediaeval Court from the Great Exhibition, as well as courts illustrating Egyptian, Alhambra, Roman, Renaissance, Pompeian, and Grecian art and many others. [...] During the year of re-opening 18 handbooks were published in the Crystal Palace Library by Bradbury & Evans as guides to the new installations. Many of these were written by the specialists involved in creating and curating the new displays. So the 1854 guide to the Egyptian Court, destroyed in the 1866 fire, was entitled: 'The Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace. Described by Owen Jones, architect, and Joseph Bonomi, sculptor'. That which included a description of the dinosaurs was entitled: 'Geology and Inhabitants of the Ancient World. Described by Richard Owen, FRS. The animals constructed by B.W.Hawkins, FGS'. In the central transept was the 4,000-piece Grand Orchestra built around the 4,500-pipe Great Organ. [...] There was a concert room with over 4,000 seats that hosted successful Handel Festivals for many years. The performance spaces hosted concerts, exhibits, and public entertainment. The Centre Transept of the Crystal Palace also once housed a circus and was the scene of daring feats by world-famous acts such as the <b>tightrope</b> <b>walker</b> Charles Blondin. Over the years many famous leaders visited the Crystal Palace, and were accorded special festivals, with extended published programs. That for Garibaldi was entitled [...] "General Garibaldi's Italian Reception and Concert Saturday April 16, 1864"; and that for the Shah: [...] "Crystal Palace. Grand Fête in [...] honour of His Majesty The Shah of Persia KG. Saturday July 6th" [...] (1889). [...] From the beginning general programs were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So for instance that for the summer of 1864 [...] "Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864" [...] included the Shakespeare Tercentenary Festival and [...] a course by designer Christopher Dresser. The daily [...] "Programme for Monday October 6th (1873) included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia, NZ; and grand military fete was also on offer. Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans, that is Charles Dickens jnr., Dickens' son working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans. [...] Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for instance Harry Lemon's 'Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat. Crystal Palace Christmas 1869–70' (London 1869).|$|E
