From at least the reign of PhilipII, the king was assisted by the royal pages (basilikoi paides), bodyguards (somatophylakes), companions (hetairoi), friends (philoi), an assembly that included members of the military, and (during the Hellenistic period) magistrates. Evidence is lacking regarding the extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> of these groups shared authority with the king or if their existence had a basis in a formal constitutional framework. Before the reign of PhilipII, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The first Championship {{was awarded}} at a Cardiff show in 1928, to {{a red and}} white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds {{continued}} to be judged together until 1934, when The Kennel Club recognised each breed separately. In that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who were free to choose whichever they felt was the most appropriate. The first dog to be named Best in Show at an open conformation show was Ch. Bowhit Pivot.|$|E

Before the reign of Philip II, the only institution supported by textual evidence is the monarchy. In 1931, Friedrich Granier {{was the first to}} propose that by the time of Philip II's reign, Macedonia had a constitutional government with laws that delegated rights and customary privileges to certain groups, especially to its citizen soldiers, although the majority of evidence for the army's alleged right to appoint a new king and judge cases of treason stems from the reign of Alexander III of Macedon. Pietro de Francisci was the first to refute these ideas and advance the theory that the Macedonian government was an autocracy ruled by the whim of the monarch, although this issue of kingship and governance is still unresolved in academia.|$|E

25|$|Trogons feed principally on insects, other arthropods, and fruit; to {{a lesser}} extent some small {{vertebrates}} such as lizards are taken. Among the insect prey taken one of the more important types are caterpillars; along with cuckoos, trogons {{are one of the few}} birds groups to regularly prey upon them. Some caterpillars are known to be poisonous to trogons though, like Arsenura armida. The extent <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> food type is taken varies depending on geography and species. The three African trogons are exclusively insectivorous, whereas the Asian and American genera consume varying amounts of fruit. Diet is somewhat correlated with size, with larger species feeding more on fruit and smaller species focusing on insects.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{its primary}} rival mobile {{operating}} system, Apple's iOS, Android updates typically reach various devices with significant delays. Except for devices within the Google Nexus brand, updates often arrive {{months after the}} release of the new version, or not at all. This is partly due to the extensive variation in hardware in Android devices, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> upgrade must be specifically tailored, a time- and resource-consuming process. Manufacturers often prioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind. Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers that, after receiving updates from manufacturers, further customize and brand Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the upgrade out to users. There are also situations in which upgrades are not possible due to one manufacturing partner not providing necessary updates to drivers.|$|E
25|$|The Maxwell–Cremona {{correspondence}} {{has been}} used to obtain polyhedral realizations of polyhedral graphs by combining it with a planar graph drawing method of W. T. Tutte, the Tutte embedding. Tutte's method begins by fixing one face of a polyhedral graph into convex position in the plane. This face will become the outer face of a drawing of a graph. The method continues by setting up a system of linear equations in the vertex coordinates, according <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> remaining vertex should be placed at the average of its neighbors. Then as Tutte showed, this system of equations will have a unique solution in which each face of the graph is drawn as a convex polygon. The result is almost an equilibrium stress: if one assigns weight one to each interior edge, then each interior vertex of the drawing is in equilibrium. However, it is not always possible to assign negative numbers to the exterior edges so that they, too, are in equilibrium.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, many local {{telephone}} companies, {{as well as}} the North American Numbering Plan of 1947, prescribed telephone number formats that included the name of the central office <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>each</b> telephone was connected. Traditionally, these names were often the names of towns, villages, other locally significant names, but larger communities that required more than one central office, may have used other names for each central office, such as Main, East, West, Central. Names were convenient to use and reduced errors when telephone numbers were exchanged verbally between subscribers and operators. When subscribers could dial themselves, the initial letters of the names were converted to digits as displayed on the rotary dial. Thus, telephone numbers contained one, two, or even three letters followed by up to five numerals. Such numbering plans are called 2L-4N, or simply 2-4, for example, as shown in the photo of a telephone dial of 1939 (right). In this example, LAkewood 2697, indicates that a subscriber dialed the letters L and A, then the digits 2, 6, 9, and 7 to reach this telephone in Lakewood, NJ (USA).|$|E
