500|$|Once September begins, younger moviegoers are {{preoccupied with}} {{starting}} {{the school year}} and thus less likely <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> on weeknights {{than they were in}} summertime. As with the winter months, football also has an impact at the box office as not only NFL teams but college and high school teams resume play, all on weekends. [...] "e are left with a series of movies competing for box office scraps in a month when Hollywood assumes no one goes to the movies," [...] says a Yahoo critic.|$|E
500|$|Spending is low {{to begin}} with since many {{consumers}} are cutting back and repaying debts incurred during the preceding holiday season, as well as having less free time, Jeremy Kirk of Firstshowing.net, when asked to explain the dearth of good films in January, notes that moviegoers are returning to their work and school routines during the month. C. Robert Cargill of Ain't It Cool News adds that only those over 35, [...] "who have savings accounts and weren't tapped out by Christmas," [...] can afford <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> regularly then. He attributes the early-year success of Taken and its sequels to that market, {{as well as that}} of many of Clint Eastwood's recent films, to that older market.|$|E

500|$|The {{sequences}} on the Grid were wholly shot in 3D, utilizing cameras {{specifically designed}} for it, and employed a 3D technique that combined other special effects techniques. The real-world sequences were filmed in 2D, and eventually altered using the three-dimensional element. Bailey stated {{that it was a}} challenge shooting Tron: Legacy in 3D because the cameras were bigger and heavier, and variations needed to be taken into account. Despite these concerns, he opined that it was a [...] "great reason <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> because it's an experience you just can't recreate on an iPhone or a laptop". In some sequences the image shows a fine mesh pattern and some blurring. That is not interference or a production fault, but indicates that that sequence is a flashback and to simulate an older form of video representation technology. Stunt work on the film was designed and coordinated by 87Eleven, who also designed and trained fight sequences for 300 and Watchmen. Olivia Wilde described it as an honor to train with them.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the advent}} of television, people {{no longer had to}} pay <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies.</b> [...] They could watch this new form of {{entertainment}} right in their living room. [...] With shrinking audiences and without the support of the studios, the big movie palaces were too expensive to maintain. [...] In the effort to attract audiences back, the movie industry tested a host of novelties that could not be seen on the television screen: 3-D movies, cinemascope, and stereophonic sound. [...] Even drive-in movies were an attempt to draw new audiences. [...] In spite of the attempts many movie palaces closed, just like the opera houses and vaudeville houses had earlier in the century. [...] Once again, Tibbits Opera House's fate was uncertain, and thanks to the efforts of several in the community (see below, Restoration), Tibbits was saved for generations to come.|$|E
