5|$|Sy Sperling, the {{president}} of hair restoration company Hair Club for Men, appeared in the ring before the next match. He {{announced that he was}} at WrestleMania to introduce one of his latest clients, ring announcer Howard Finkel. Finkel came to the ring wearing a <b>toupée,</b> showing off his new hair while the crowd applauded. The match then began, as Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon came to the ring to face Doink the Clown and Dink. Bigelow attacked Doink {{at the beginning of the}} match with a dropkick and a powerslam. When Dink entered the match, the rules stated that Bigelow had to tag Vachon into the match. Dink ran around the ring avoiding Vachon, but she eventually caught him. She kicked him and powerslammed him, but she then missed a moonsault attempt. Doink and Bigelow re-entered the match, and Doink performed a DDT on Bigelow. Bigelow reversed the momentum to win the match after a diving headbutt on Doink. Bigelow pinned Doink to win the match, and he and Vachon then attacked Dink.|$|E
5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the explosion of the Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy's <b>toupée</b> off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E

2500|$|In the 20th century, <b>toupées</b> were {{a source}} of humour in {{virtually}} all forms of media, including cartoons, films, radio and television.

2500|$|By 1959, total U.S. {{sales were}} {{estimated}} by Time magazine to be $15 million a year.

[...] <b>Toupées</b> continued to be advertised in print, likely with heavier media buys (Advertising media selection) taking place in magazines with the appropriate male demographic. [...] A typical [...] "advertorial" [...] can be found in [...]|$|R
25|$|Other trends {{leading to}} the decline in <b>toupée</b> use include a rise in {{acceptance}} of baldness by those men afflicted with it. Short haircuts, in fashion since the 1990s, have tended to minimize the appearance of baldness, and many balding men choose to shave their heads entirely.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} diacritical marks, {{a number of}} (usually French) loanwords are {{sometimes}} spelled in English with an acute accent as used in the original language: these include attaché, blasé, canapé, cliché, communiqué, café, décor, déjà vu, détente, élite, entrée, exposé, mêlée, fiancé, fiancée, papier-mâché, passé, pâté, piqué, plié, repoussé, résumé, risqué, sauté, roué, séance, naïveté, <b>toupée</b> and touché. Retention of the accent is common only in the French ending é or ée, as in these examples, where its absence would tend to suggest a different pronunciation. Thus the French word résumé is commonly seen in English as , with only one accent (but also with both or none).|$|E
25|$|Zindler made {{local and}} {{national}} headlines when he and reporter Larry Conners closed the Chicken Ranch in Fayette County, Texas, near La Grange, after he reported on it in 1973. The Chicken Ranch story was featured in a 1973 edition of Texas Monthly magazine, two 1974 issues of Playboy magazine, {{was the basis for}} the Broadway and film musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and served as the basis of the song La Grange by ZZ Top. The closing did not go well with the sheriff of Fayette County, Jim T. Flournoy, who later attacked Zindler in a fight that left Zindler with two fractured ribs, along with a snatched <b>toupee.</b> Reportedly, Flournoy waved the hairpiece in the air {{as if it were a}} prized enemy scalp and threw it in the street.|$|E

25|$|Though Crosby {{did want}} {{more time to}} tend to his other {{business}} and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the microphones his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio {{since the beginning of}} the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated <b>toupee</b> on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name Minute Maid. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.|$|E
500|$|Deangelo {{comes to}} the branch the next day, {{and most of the}} staff is eager to make a good first impression.

Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) is not pleased that he was not selected to replace Michael, believing that Michael put in a good recommendation for him. Michael becomes disturbed, however, when Deangelo wants to make some changes, such as how Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) answers the phone.|$|E
500|$|The 1967 satire Casino Royale {{featured}} {{not one but}} two Ms. The {{first is}} played by John Huston, who also co-directed. [...] In this film, M's real name is McTarry and he is accidentally killed when, in order to get Bond out of retirement, he orders the military to fire mortars at Bond's mansion when the retired spy refuses to return to duty. The first quarter of the film features Bond's subsequent visit to McTarry Castle in Scotland, on a quest to return the only piece of M's remains recovered after the attack—his bright red <b>toupée.</b> Subsequently, Bond—played by David Niven—becomes the new M and proceeds to order that all MI6 agents, male and female, be renamed [...] "James Bond 007" [...] in order to confuse the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|By 1970, Time {{magazine}} {{estimated that}} in the U.S., <b>toupées</b> were worn by more than 2.5 million men out of 17 - 20 million balding men.

50|$|Men {{typically}} wear <b>toupées</b> after {{resorting to}} less extreme methods of coverage. The first tactic {{is to make}} remaining hair appear thick and widespread through a combover.

500|$|... "Dinosaur" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} most music critics. Ian Gittins of The Guardian {{called it a}} [...] "bitchy put-down of ageing suitors". Doug Rule of Metro Weekly criticized the song's chorus, which according to him is [...] "spelt out like a [...] "modern-day Toni Basil", saying: [...] "Are we supposed to think that's cute, even clever? It's neither." [...] The UrbanWire's Cheryl Chia was critical of the song, saying that it [...] "has {{the potential to be}} very annoying after a few rounds." [...] Billboards Monica Herrera also gave a negative review. She used the song as an example of one of the album's [...] "missteps", stating that it could [...] "only appeal to the most heartless of teens". Ailbhe Malone of NME stated that [...] "Dinosaur" [...] contains the pay-off [...] "Honey, your <b>toupee</b> is falling to the left side/Get up and go bro/Oh wait, you’re fossilized".|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of George III in 1820, Pistrucci {{prepared}} the coinage bust of the new King, George IV. The King despised Pistrucci's work for its bloated expression—according to Clancy, [...] "its full features implying something of the appetites of the monarch". The King and Pistrucci also came into conflict over the Coronation medal, with the King objecting to being placed {{on the same level}} as the allegorical representations of his kingdoms. Pistrucci stated, [...] "I shall elevate His Majesty", and did so. The King's <b>toupee</b> also caused difficulty in the engraving process. On the coinage, the sovereign was modified to remove its garter, and the saint's broken spear was replaced by a sword. Thus, it became very similar to the design used on modern-day sovereigns but for the lack of a streamer on Saint George's helmet. This version of the reverse was struck from 1821 to 1825, but Pistrucci's design would be thereafter absent from the sovereign from 1825 to 1874, after his death.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene, {{outside of a}} club, Kesha is hit on by comedian Bret Ernst. He tries to {{convince}} Kesha that they {{would make a good}} couple, meanwhile Kesha texts someone, describing the man as a [...] "major douchemaster". The next scene has Kesha at a bar playing pool near a man, where she duct-tapes him, later pulling down his pants, after describing him as a [...] "tool bag" [...] in a text message. In an arcade, Kesha pushes a man away who is making conversation with her. The third suitor attempts to serenade Kesha with a guitar, to which Kesha replies by stuffing paper in his mouth. In the final sequence, a man tries to talk to Kesha in a bowling alley. She loses interest when his <b>toupée</b> falls off his head and she shoves the hairpiece into his mouth, in vein of the previous arcade scene. The video ends with Kesha and 3OH!3 singing and dancing together in the bowling lanes.|$|E

5000|$|During its heyday, Plato's Retreat was {{considered}} the world's most infamous sex club, popular with many celebrities, porn stars, and well-to-do couples.

The fabrics can then be sheared or embossed to create a closer resemblance to fur. The heat-sensitivity of modacrylic also allows wigs and hairpiece to be curled and heat styled without damage.|$|R
