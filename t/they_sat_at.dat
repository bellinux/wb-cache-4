25|$|The Grand Salon on {{the first}} floor is the most ornate room in the building. The Knights used it for {{business}} discussions, and as a refectory and banqueting hall, where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> long tables according to seniority.|$|E
25|$|The 33rd-floor {{boardroom}} {{contained a}} massive oval {{table with a}} Macassar ebony veneer. The hallway leading to the boardroom and solarium contained coat hooks {{for each of the}} board members and senior officers. The foyer had a chart listing the presidents and board members of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society through the years and where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the boardroom table. The foyer also featured a sketch of the old Walnut Street Headquarters and a list of bank offices and the dates they opened. The board room was decorated with portraits of the bank's founders and its presidents. The chairs around the board table each have a plaque on the back that showed the number of the chair and the names of the current and previous board members who sat there.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat,</b> <b>at</b> midnight, on {{the steps}} of the house in Tavistock Place.|$|E
60|$|Ernshaw {{produced}} some books {{from his pocket}} and <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> the table.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} alone <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> the table, and opened the deed.|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} him obediently and <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> {{a small table}} in the station refreshment-room.|$|R
60|$|They went in {{some little}} time afterwards. While <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> supper together, one of Leland's distant {{neighbours}} came in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncommon bad mutton chops these are," [...] said Staveley, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> their meal in the coffee-room of the Imperial Hotel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heard {{you say you}} was goin' for a walk this morning, Cynthy," [...] Jethro remarked, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> breakfast {{the next}} morning.|$|E
60|$|So Maria Port sat in {{her room}} and the ladies sat in the parlor below; and <b>they</b> <b>sat,</b> and <b>they</b> <b>sat,</b> and <b>they</b> <b>sat,</b> and <b>at</b> last it began to grow dark.|$|R
60|$|Some {{minutes later}} <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> a small table: behind a pillar in a spacious room, and Scott {{took out a}} bundle of documents.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{leave this}} house to-day,--immediately after breakfast," [...] {{she said to}} Miss Biggs, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> disconsolately <b>at</b> {{the table with the}} urn between them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope you've {{not come}} home {{after all these}} years to make things unpleasant?" [...] he remarked presently, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "What plan do {{you intend}} to follow out, uncle?" [...] asked Alphonse Vandervell, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> supper that night round the kettle.|$|E
6000|$|Penny {{for your}} thoughts, uncle," [...] said Miss Drewitt, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> dinner {{an hour or}} two after the {{departure}} of Mr. Vickers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{be angry}} with me for asking," [...] said Mrs. Wragge, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> {{together}} <b>at</b> the tea-table. [...] "Are you troubled, my dear, in your mind?" ...|$|R
60|$|The giant, having {{enjoyed his}} laugh, now {{introduced}} the Prince to his wife, and as dinner {{was ready to}} serve <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> the table together.|$|R
60|$|Leaving the building, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> {{the foot}} of a rock which kept the drizzle off them. Andrew breathed the clean {{fragrance}} of the pines with delight.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> a table, and {{the bloated}} monster yelped and {{scrambled}} {{at the end}} of his leash to get at the café cat.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Lammle {{bestowed}} a {{sweet and}} loving smile upon her friend, which Miss Podsnap returned as she best could. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> lunch in Mrs Lammle's own boudoir.|$|E
6000|$|The Kaiser alone, {{and the old}} old Balt, [...] <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{the cedar}} board; And round them served on the bended knee [...] Full many a Roman lord.|$|E
60|$|Entering, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> a table {{together}} {{near the}} kitchen fire, and North, {{pulling out of}} his pocket a small loaf, cut it in two and offered Sam half.|$|R
60|$|Adam did {{not speak}} immediately. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> each other in delicious silence--for the first sense of mutual love {{excludes}} other feelings; it will have the soul all to itself.|$|R
60|$|Outside, the sea-mist was {{travelling}} {{thicker and}} thicker inland. Their lodging {{was not far}} from the bay. As <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> together <b>at</b> tea, Siegmund's eyes dilated, and he looked frowning at Helena.|$|R
60|$|So <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin {{told his}} mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and {{have nothing to do}} with devils.|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s nice to {{have money}} come to us in our old age," [...] said Mrs. Gribble, timidly, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> tea. [...] "It takes a load off my mind." ...|$|E
60|$|So Umslopogaas ate, {{and little}} by little his health {{returned}} to him--every day a little. And afterwards, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> night by {{the fire in the}} cave they spoke together.|$|E
60|$|Lena {{rose and}} {{passed to the}} right of Ricardo, who lowered his glance for a moment. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> the table. The {{enormous}} gorilla back of Pedro swayed out through the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{have got}} some news for you," [...] said Lydia, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> table. [...] "What do you think? It is {{excellent}} news--capital news--and about a certain person we all like!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They were indeed, Ham. What did Em'ly do?' 'Says Em'ly, [...] "Martha, is it you? Oh, Martha, {{can it be}} you?"--for <b>they</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> work together, many a day, at Mr. Omer's.' ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> dinner, {{in their}} cottage, he was dazed by {{the chill of}} {{antagonism}} from her. She {{did not know why}} she was so angry. But she was incensed.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> {{the table}} again, and Herman and Mattie tried to restore {{something}} of the brightness which had been lost. Allen sat grimly eating, his chin pushed down like a hog's snout.|$|E
6000|$|... "The food {{is not so}} bad if it {{were only}} served decently," [...] said Jennie, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> the table eying the heavy china chipped and maimed in the savage process of washing.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>sat</b> staring <b>at</b> {{each other}} in a silence which neither of them broke, and which promised to last indefinitely. They were still in their daze when Putney's voice came through the open hall door.|$|R
60|$|So Grace went to call them, {{and they}} came; and, after salutation made, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down {{together}} <b>at</b> the table.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{changing}} her tone again, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> the fire, she went on, [...] "You {{know we are}} glad, Jack, Harry and I, more glad than we can say, that needs no telling between us, does it?" ...|$|R
