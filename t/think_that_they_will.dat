25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to honouring journalists, Lindsey Hilsum, the Channel 4 News International Editor {{who was the}} host of the 2014 awards, emphasises that the Amnesty Awards play a very important role in encouraging editors to allow journalists to cover more obscure stories that are far away and expensive. She said that when: “you point out that you won an Amnesty Award for a similar story a couple of years ago. It makes editors <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> get some sort of kudos from this, and that it matters within the industry. So I think it’s tremendously important and I think Amnesty is doing a tremendous job by giving us these awards so that we can use them to say: ‘Yes, we’ve got to carry on reporting human rights, it really matters’." ...|$|E

50|$|Anna {{is happy}} {{when her parents}} {{announce}} to her <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are having a baby. She sees this as her opportunity to show that she is grown-up and {{can take care of}} the family. But Ben's birth is overshadowed {{by the fact that he}} is born with hydrocephalus. At first, Anna finds it extremely hard to cope with the new situation, but she really loves Ben and does her very best to take care of him. At school, she has problems explaining to people what is wrong with her brother because she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> not understand and she doesn't want their sympathy.|$|R

5000|$|The Finch {{house is}} a {{parallel}} universe to the home Burroughs came from. It is filthy, with cockroaches roaming around the uncleaned dishes, Christmas trees left up year-round, stairs up which Burroughs is afraid to walk because he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> collapse under him, and nothing off limits. Eventually, Finch comes to believe that God is communicating with him through his feces and develops a form of divination to try and decipher these messages. When Hope, Finch's second oldest daughter, believes her cat is dying, she keeps it in a laundry basket for four days until it dies: [...] "Hope said Freud died of kitty leukemia and old age, I thought it was because Freud was stuck under a laundry basket with no food or water for 4 days." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Out {{through that}} window, {{three years ago}} to a day, her husband and her two young {{brothers}} went off for their day’s shooting. They never came back. In crossing the moor to their favourite snipe-shooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it.” Here the child’s voice lost its self-possessed note and became falteringly human. “Poor aunt always <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> come back some day, they and the little brown spaniel that was lost with them, and walk in at that window just as they used to do. That is why the window is kept open every evening till it is quite dusk. Poor dear aunt, she has often told me how they went out, her husband with his white waterproof coat over his arm, and Ronnie, her youngest brother, singing ‘Bertie, why do you bound?’ as he always did to tease her, because she said it got on her nerves. Do you know, sometimes on still, quiet evenings like this, I almost get a creepy feeling <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> all walk in through that window—” ...|$|R

50|$|The {{experiment}} which Dr. Feltham (an eccentric {{science teacher}} who organises the fair) has chosen for child development is 'Flour Babies'. Each boy {{is given a}} six-pound bag of flour, in rags to form {{the look of a}} baby, and he must care for it at all times, {{as if it were a}} real baby. They must also write a diary explaining how they cope with this responsibility. Needless to say, the boys are not happy with this experiment, and neither is their teacher. But Simon misunderstands a conversation he overhears between Dr. Feltham and Mr. Cartright, and <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> get to kick the flour babies to bits at the end. Mr. Cartright decides to pick another topic, but Simon has already mistakenly informed the class about kicking the babies to bits; they like the idea and press gang him into letting them do the experiment. Simon becomes fond of his flour baby, while the others complain. Simon reflects on his own childhood: his Dad left home when Simon was just six weeks old, and never came back. His relationship with his mother has always been precarious, and Simon now begins to learn about the pressures of parenthood.|$|R

All the waggons in the town and country round have been fetched in to carry their stores and baggage and a convoy of ammunition. I should say that you could not do better than go on with the waggons.
