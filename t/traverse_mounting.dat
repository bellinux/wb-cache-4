50|$|Mount Orient, 955 feet (291 meters), is a south-facing {{high point}} on an upland plateau {{overlooking}} the Connecticut River Valley in Pelham, Massachusetts (near Amherst, Massachusetts). Although the summit is wooded, a lower, south-facing ledge of exfoliating metamorphic rock provides {{views of the}} Holyoke Range and the east-central Pioneer Valley. Both the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and the Robert Frost Trail (Massachusetts) <b>traverse</b> <b>Mount</b> Orient. The ledge is a popular hiking destination among college students and residents of nearby Amherst.

25|$|Putilov factory {{developed}} Vavasseur mounting {{for the gun}} in 1886 {{that had}} the central pivot at {{the centre of the}} mount and a circular base plate allowing 360° <b>traverse.</b> This <b>mounting</b> was used on deck gun installations. In 1887 Vavasseur-Dubrov or simply Dubrov mount was developed. For casemate guns a Krel mounting was developed in 1886 that had the central pivot {{at the front of the}} mount with the rear of the <b>mounting</b> <b>traversing</b> on steel rollers.|$|R
5000|$|In 1903 she and {{two other}} women, became the first women to cross Copland Pass. Whilst they were successful, their guide Jack Clarke {{declared}} the route [...] "unfit for ladies". In 1915, while based for a summer holiday at the Hermitage, Mount Cook Village, she began a two-year climbing partnership with the Austrian guide Conrad Kain. They ascended many peaks, including Maunga Ma, Mt Jeannette, Malte Brun, and two unnamed peaks. In 1916, aged 57, with Conrad Kain she became the second woman, after Freda Du Faur, to <b>traverse</b> <b>Mount</b> Cook. Aged 68, she made her first ascent of the low peak of Mount Rolleston in Arthur's Pass National Park. Aged 80, she travelled to Kashmir to visit Nanga Parbat.|$|R

There are many other examples, such as the chocobo racing theme from FFVII, the Boss theme being borrowed from Final Fantasy VI, Irma's house is a rendition of the Final Fantasy IV sorrow music, and the end credits feature the airship theme from Final Fantasy VIII. Music from Final Fantasy III has also been borrowed, such as the crystal room theme and Gysahl theme.|$|R

The eastern portion of the {{mountain}} {{are part of the}} Westfield Watershed lands, owned by the City of Westfield, with public access provided under a Conservation Easement to the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. These areas are open to hunting, hiking and other forms of non-motorized recreation. There are a few in-holdings of privately owned land. A number of unofficial trails and woods roads <b>traverse</b> <b>Mount</b> Tekoa, however, no officially designated or maintained trails exist.

5000|$|Mount Rose is {{the highest}} {{mountain}} in Washoe County, within the Carson Range of Nevada, United States.

It {{is located in the}} Mount Rose Wilderness of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. An extinct volcano, the mountain is in between Lake Tahoe and Reno. State Route 431 <b>traverses</b> <b>Mount</b> Rose Summit southeast of Mount Rose. Due to the high elevation, most of the precipitation that falls on the mountain is snow.

50|$|The {{traditional}} route up Mount Coot-tha, and {{now one of}} {{the main}} access roads, is Sir Samuel Griffith Drive. Originally people walked up Mount Coot-tha and from this a track developed. By the 1870s some adventurous people were driving up with horses and carriages. When the area became a public park in 1880, the track was improved to become a steep and windy road that <b>traversed</b> <b>Mount</b> Coot-tha in a circular route, a popular route for walkers, buggies and the occasional motorist. This track formed the basis of Sir Samuel Griffith Drive, named after one of the more eminent trustees, Sir Samuel Griffith, twice Premier of Queensland, from 1883 to 1888 and then again from 1890 to 1893. By the 1920s it was a favoured scenic circuit regularly utilised by motoring day-trippers and for car rallies and in the early 1930s was dedicated as a public road.|$|R

Its northern terminus is at US 20, 4 mi east of Fairfield at an approximate elevation of 5030 ft.|$|R
50|$|The north {{border with}} Serbia and Kosovo is 221 {{kilometers}} in length. The border was made after World War II, between SR Macedonia and SR Serbia. But in 2008 when Kosovo declared independence {{the border with}} it was remarked again. Rather {{more than half of}} the boundary separates Macedonia from Kosovo. From the tripoint with Albania, the boundary trends north-eastwards along the watershed of Šar Mountain. It describes a curve to the south across the River Lepenec and then turns to north-east to <b>traverse</b> <b>Mount</b> Crna before taking a course slightly to the north of east across the landscape features to the tripoint with Bulgaria.The east border with Bulgaria has length of approximately 148 km. The settled boundary from Yugoslavia and the People's Republic of Bulgaria was accepted after the independence in 1992. The boundary starts from the tripoint with Greece, the boundary runs north, crossing the River of Strumica and then rising to the watershed which it follows northwards and then north-westwards to the tripoint with Serbia.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} units, the Sturmgeschütz III Ausf A, {{arrived in}} 1940 mounted with the 75 mm StuK 37L/24 gun and increased frontal hull armor (from 30 mm to 50 mm). The main armament, {{which had a}} limited lateral <b>traverse,</b> was <b>mounted</b> directly in a casemate-style hull. This created the lowest possible profile {{in order to reduce}} the vehicle's height, making the StuG more difficult to hit and easier to protect in hull defilade.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} the sign of {{rotation}} on {{the stability of the}} Stewartson layer formed by a rotating disc in a rotating fluid is investigated experimentally and numerically. A discrepancy exists between two earlier studies. Ref. [1] found the sign of Ro to have no influence, while Ref. [2] found a strong asymmetric behaviour. Numerical investigations in Ref. [3] suggested a difference in the boundaries along the disc as a possible cause of the discrepancy between the studies. In the current study experimental work is performed on the large scale facility at the University of Warwick (overall height 5. 7 m and 1. 4 m diameter), with a single disc inside a movable end-wall. The size of the facility allows a much larger height to radius ratio than in previous experiments. A fully automated, <b>traverse</b> <b>mounted</b> 3 D PIV system is used to allow data- acquisition over the length of the Taylor column without the need for recalibration.

50|$|The first {{method of}} {{traverse}} is to rely entirely on movement along a curved section of track or on a turntable with no provision to traverse {{the gun on}} its mount. The second is to traverse the rail car body on its trucks, known as a car-traversing mount. Generally this {{is limited to a}} few degrees of traverse to either side unless an elaborate foundation is built with a centre pivot and traversing rollers. The design of the foundation is the only limit to the amount of traverse allowed in this latter case. The third choice is to allow the separate gun mount to rotate with respect to the rail car body, known as a top-carriage <b>traversing</b> <b>mount.</b> This usually requires the gun to be mounted on a central pivot which, in turn, is mounted on the car body. With few exceptions these types of mounts require some number of outriggers, stabilisers, or earth anchors to keep them in place against the recoil forces and are generally more suitable for smaller guns. The American post-World War I assessment of railway artillery considered that the utility of even a small amount of traverse for fine adjustments was high enough that either of the two latter traversing methods is preferable to a fixed mount.|$|R
