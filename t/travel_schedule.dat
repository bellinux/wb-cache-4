40|$|We {{present a}} {{graph-based}} semi-supervised approach for learning user-preferred <b>travel</b> <b>schedules.</b> Assuming a {{setting in which}} a user provides {{a small number of}} labeled <b>travel</b> <b>schedules,</b> we classify schedules into desirable and non-desirable.

It is further complicated by the fact that each schedule is comprised of multiple components or aspects which are different in nature. For instance in our case arrival times are modeled by probability distributions to account for uncertainty, while other aspects such as waiting times are given by a feature vector. Each aspect can thought of as a different type of observation for the same schedule While existing label propagation approaches can exploit vast amounts of unlabeled data, they cannot handle multi-aspect data. We propose Multi-Aspect Label Propagation (MALP), a novel approach which extends label propagation to handle multiple types of observations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a minimum}} time path {{planning}} strategy is proposed for multi points manufacturing problems in drilling/spot welding tasks. By optimizing the <b>travelling</b> <b>schedule</b> {{of the set}} points and the detailed transfer path between points, the minimum time manufacturing task is realized under fully utilizing the dynamic performance of robotic manipulator. According to the start-stop movement in drilling/spot welding task, the path planning problem can be converted into a traveling salesman problem (TSP) {{and a series of}} point to point minimum time transfer path planning problems. Cubic Hermite interpolation polynomial is used to parameterize the transfer path and then the path parameters are optimized to obtain minimum point to point transfer time. A new TSP with minimum time index is constructed by using point-point transfer time as the TSP parameter. The classical genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to obtain the optimal <b>travelling</b> <b>schedule.</b> Several minimum time drilling tasks of a 3 -DOF robotic manipulator are used as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|We conduct video scene {{detection}} {{with the}} aids of web-based context, especially for travel videos captured by amateur photographers in journeys. Correlations between personal videos and predefined <b>travel</b> <b>schedules,</b> which are used to retrieve related data from general-purpose image/video search engines, are discovered. Because scene boundaries are clearly defined in <b>travel</b> <b>schedules,</b> we segment videos into scenes by checking the discovered cross-media correlation. To make different modalities comparable, keyframes extracted from videos and images retrieved from web are represented by visual word histograms, {{and the problem of}} correlation determination is then transformed as an approximate sequence matching problem. We prioritize different visual words according to statistics of retrieved data, and evaluate similarity between images based on the weighting scheme. To systematically determine scene boundaries after finding cross-media correlation, we introduce an energy minimization framework to jointly consider visual, temporal, and context information. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed idea, and show that it’s promising to utilize cross-media correlation and web-based context in media analysis...|$|R

Robinson accepted a contract for $400 per month. Although he played well for the Monarchs, Robinson was frustrated with the experience. He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college, and the Negro leagues' disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him. The hectic <b>travel</b> <b>schedule</b> also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum, with whom he could now communicate only by letter. In all, Robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the Monarchs, hitting [...]387 with five home runs, and registering 13 stolen bases.

Ross undertook a heavy <b>travel</b> <b>schedule,</b> visiting Mint facilities, making speeches backing Roosevelt, and campaigning for Democratic candidates in Wyoming. [...] This left O'Reilly running the Washington office as acting director.

[...] They are so much more direct and up to date than letters... my love to you and every good wish for the success of your visits to our beloved mint institutions." [...] Scheer suggests that O'Reilly would have found Ross's reports from the field valuable; they showed how the Mint recovered from the initial years of the Depression, when relatively few coins were produced, to the mid-1930s, when strong demand for coinage led the bureau to run the mints with two or even three shifts.|$|E

At the convention, she asked the leadership to recognize the Daughters of Ethiopia, an honorary group making contributions to racial improvement, as an official auxiliary of the UNIA. By gaining the organization's approval, women members of the UNIA gained recognition of their contributions. In 1925, Henrietta Vinton Davis organized {{a tour of the}} Caribbean and was accompanied by de Mena, who was to serve as both translator and organizer on the trip. De Mena proved successful in both fund raising and recruiting new members, and her language skills with Spanish were rewarded with a higher salary than Davis'. By the time the women returned, now enjoying a reputation as a motivational speaker, de Mena was asked to join Garvey on stage on July 5, 1925, to call for unity. Garvey lost his appeal on his fraud case that same year and was remanded to the Atlanta Penitentiary. Throughout the summer and fall of that year, de Mena accompanied Amy Jacques-Garvey on a speaking tour covering many major cities in the Midwest, along the Atantic coast and to New Orleans. The tour solidified her place in Garvey's inner circle. [...] At the emergency convention of 1926, de Mena was elected as assistant international organizer and the following year succeeded Davis as the fourth vice president general, becoming Garvey's official representative. She kept in close contact with him both through correspondence and visits despite her <b>travel</b> <b>schedule.</b> Upon Garvey's release from prison in 1927 and his deportation to Jamaica, de Mena led a celebratory UNIA parade through Kingston.

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{satellite tracking}} data {{to reveal the}} daily <b>travel</b> <b>schedules</b> of Hobbies Falco subbuteo migrating between northern Europe and southern Africa. By comparing movements during short-time intervals of 1 - 8 h {{at different times of}} the day between the three different regions Europe, Sahara Desert and tropical Africa, we found significant higher hourly speeds in the Sahara compared to the other two regions. The migration started {{early in the morning and}} continued throughout the day, resulting in daily travel time exceeding that of typical thermal soaring migrants. Due to fast hourly speeds in combination with the long travel days during Sahara crossings, the Hobbies exceeded daily travel distances recorded for soaring migrants. In Europe and tropical Africa, the speed was highly variable during the day, and lower flight speeds, especially during afternoons, suggest a fly-and-forage strategy, Our predictions about regular occurrence of nocturnal flight especially across geographical barriers as the desert were not fulfilled. In the Sahara, the Hobbies restricted their movement to diurnal migration. Nevertheless, 10 % of the flight segments in tropical Africa were partly or completely during night hours and Hobbies often started their daily flight before or at sunrise. We attribute the special characteristics of the daily <b>travel</b> <b>schedules</b> of Hobbies primarily to their use of a fly-and-forage strategy, possibly in combination with preparedness for exploiting thermals during the daily thermal time window. Further studies are needed to understand why Hobbies do not increase daily travelling hours to include regular nocturnal flight in the Sahara Desert. We suggest that the daily <b>travel</b> <b>schedules</b> of the Hobby, which were distinctly different from those of other diurnal migrants like large raptors (which mainly exploit thermal soaring migration) or pipits, wagtails, finches and pigeons (which mainly travel during the morning hours) may be typical for bird species that primarily use a fly-and-forage migration strategy...|$|R
