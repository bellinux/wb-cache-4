5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered {{over what he}} has learned, and Kain says his actions are justified due to his being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the evening, key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included Bahias sister , the aging cruiser , and the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their potential power, however, was dwarfed by the dreadnoughts—each of which outgunned all of the warships alone—and was severely tempered by personnel issues. First, naval officers were suspicious of even the enlisted men who remained loyal to the government. Officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat, and the numbers of enlisted men were reduced wherever possible. Further complicating matters were missing weapon components, such as the destroyer's torpedoes, which could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> caps were finally located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes carried by the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only two days after the rebellion began.|$|E

5|$|Key {{warships}} {{that remained}} in government hands included the old cruiser , Bahias sister , the eight new destroyers of the Pará class. Their crews {{were in a}} state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's torpedoes. These could not be fired without firing caps, yet the caps were not where they were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.|$|E

25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Alhambra telling us of her {{conception}} in ‘the town’s only cinema’. We then come to “The Beginning”, {{which consists of}} a third-person narration focused first on Astrid, then Magnus, then Michael, then finally Eve. Through each character we obtain {{a different view of}} how Amber came into their lives, and who they believed her <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>when</b> she arrived unannounced and uninvited at their Norfolk holiday home, claiming her car had broken down. Through “The Beginning”, we learn of Astrid’s obsession with video-taping her life, seemingly as proof it existed; of Magnus’ involvement in a school prank which resulted in the suicide of one of his classmates; of Michael’s affairs with his students (he is a university lecturer); and of Eve’s writer’s block.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, the Rivers Committee, {{which had}} managed the site since its inception, ceased <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>when</b> water and sewage {{treatment}} became {{the responsibility of}} the newly formed North West Water Authority. The organisation was subsequently privatised, and became part of United Utilities in 1995. In order to meet demands for better water quality, a pilot Biostyr plant was built in 1992, and a much larger one was completed in 1998. Innovation continued, with the commissioning of the world's largest thermal hydrolysis plant in 2013, using a new process to break down sludge, which generates methane as a by-product, enabling the site to be self-sufficient for gas and electricity. An upgrade to the Activated Sludge plant began in 2014, and is expected to be completed in 2018.|$|E
25|$|RolePlay was {{the play}} written as the afterthought, but {{turned out to}} be the most {{successful}} play of the three. The play centres on a dinner party held by Justin Lazenby and Julie-Ann Jobson, where they intend to announce their engagement. Before the dinner begins, there are already signs of tension: Julie-Ann gets overly frantic about making the meal perfect for her parents (her father, it later turns out, is a right-wing bigot), and Justin's alcoholic mother is clearly going to arrive paralytic. However, the biggest complication turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> Paige Petite climbs onto the balcony, on the run from her violent boyfriend. Trapped in the flat by her minder, Justin and Julie-Ann are forced to keep up appearances during the dinner whilst the stand-off is played out.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} telling {{would appear}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> {{the story was}} set out by Eadburg, the third abbess at Thanet. There is no text dating to that time, but Hollis and Rollason both contend that the Caligula A text has a strong claim to representing the 'Thanet' version of the story. Written in Old English, with considerable uncertainty about its author and date, it recounts {{the foundation of the}} Abbey in ways that may be much closer to a mid-8th century account than the other surviving texts. The themes, on that basis, are to chronicle a history of the Abbey, to set out its legal claim to the land, to talk up the Mercian links of the founder (Domne Eafe) and the saint (Mildrith), at a time when Kent was under Mercian rule, and to provide a 'Life of Mildrith' to accompany the translation of her remains from St Mary's Church to Eadburg's new church of St Peter and St Paul, Thanet.|$|E
25|$|Curry {{is another}} popular {{imported}} dish and is ranked {{near the top}} of nearly all Japanese surveys for favorite foods. The average Japanese eats curry at least once a week. The origins of curry, as well many other foreign imports such as pan or bread are linked to the emergence of Yoshoku, or western cuisine. Yoshoku can be traced {{as far back as the}} late Muromachi period (1336-1573) during a culinary revolution called namban ryori (南蛮料理), which means “Southern barbarian cooking”, as it is rooted in European cuisine. This cuisine style was first seen in Nagasaki, which served as the point of contact between Europe and Japan at that point in time. Food items such as potatoes, corn, dairy products, as well as the hard candy kompeito (金平糖), spread during this time. This cuisine became popular in the Meiji period, which is considered by many historians <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> Japan first opened itself to the outside world. Today, many of these imported items still hold a heavy presence in Japan.|$|E

500|$|The {{design as}} a whole tried to create {{technology}} that could be built in the 1940s, though with the added Cube technology in Hydra's case.

Writing on the programme's accessibility to an audience, Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian calls it [...] "talkative in the way television plays used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> they had something to say.

The episode also contained numerous references to the 1960s television crime drama Dragnet,. This was because Larry Charles, who wrote the episode, watched a lot of reruns of the show when he was writing for Seinfeld.
