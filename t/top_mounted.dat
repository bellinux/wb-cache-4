25|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives did {{not show}} the pressure of steam in the boiler, but {{it was possible to}} estimate this by the position of the safety valve arm which often extended onto the firebox back plate; gradations marked on the spring column gave a rough indication of the actual pressure. The promoters of the Rainhill trials urged that each contender have a proper mechanism for reading the boiler pressure, and Stephenson devised a nine-foot vertical tube of mercury with a sight-glass at the <b>top,</b> <b>mounted</b> alongside the chimney, for his Rocket. The Bourdon tube gauge, in which the pressure straightens an oval-section coiled tube of brass or bronze connected to a pointer, was introduced in 1849 and quickly gained acceptance, and is still used today. Some locomotives have an additional pressure gauge in the steam chest. This helps the driver avoid wheel-slip at startup, by warning if the regulator opening is too great.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{optimization}} technique for optimizing the damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> characteristics to improve vehicle ride comfort and harshness is developed. The proposed {{optimization technique}} employs a new combined objective function based on ride comfort, harshness, and impact harshness evaluation. A detailed and accurate damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> mathematical model is implemented inside a validated quarter vehicle model {{to provide a}} realistic simulation environment for the optimization study. The ride comfort and harshness of the quarter vehicle are evaluated by analyzing the body acceleration in different frequency ranges. In addition, the <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> deformation is considered as a penalty factor for the system performance. The influence of the ride comfort and harshness weighting parameters of the proposed objective function on the optimal damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> characteristics is studied. The dynamic stiffness of the damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> is {{used to describe the}} optimum damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> characteristics for different optimization case studies. The proposed optimization routine is able to find the optimum characteristics of the damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> which improve the ride comfort and the harshness performances together...|$|R

40|$|The current dynamic {{ride comfort}} {{mathematical}} models don’t use Maxwell arrangement of vehicle suspension occurring due to <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> and the discomfort weightings used {{are based on}} the shaker table tests which ignore the influence of vehicle dynamics, for example the effect of seat cushion. A refined integrated vehicle-occupant 10 degree of freedom model that includes <b>top</b> <b>mounts</b> is developed to estimate the occupant response to given harmonic input. The dynamic responses are combined with experimentally obtained in-situ discomfort indices for a car that incorporates the effects of features such as seat cushion. The Stevens power law parameters are estimated and compared with previous studies; the perception model is then used to predict discomfort index as a function of frequency. The influence of the relative stiffness of the <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> and suspension damping on the resonance frequencies is discussed. The acceleration in wheel hop mode can be ~ 3 times larger than that when <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> is not included. The influence of resonance frequencies suggests importance of not just using frequency average discomfort index while optimizing suspension and seat parameters...|$|R
