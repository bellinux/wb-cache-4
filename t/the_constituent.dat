A member of <b>the</b> <b>Constituent</b> Assembly, Bonifácio resorted to demagoguery, alleging the existence of a major Portuguese conspiracy against Brazilian interests—insinuating that PedroI, who had been born in Portugal, was implicated. The Emperor became outraged by the invective directed at the loyalty of citizens who were of Portuguese birth and the hints that he was himself conflicted in his allegiance to Brazil. On 12 November 1823, PedroI ordered the dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>Constituent</b> Assembly and called for new elections. On the following day, he placed a newly established native Council of State in charge of composing a constitutional draft. Copies of the draft were sent to all town councils, and the vast majority voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire.|$|E

40|$|Blending {{insertion}} compounds is a {{novel and}} promising approach to design advanced electrodes for future lithium-ion batteries. In spite of the considerable improvements regarding safety issues and power density, the understanding of basic interactions between <b>the</b> <b>constituents</b> of <b>the</b> blend and differences towards common single compound insertion electrodes is still ongoing. Herein we explore and verify the effect of temperature induced compositional redistribution of lithium-ions between <b>the</b> <b>constituents</b> of a blended insertion electrode for the first time. A model-like blend electrode and a special experimental setup is {{used to measure the}} compositional redistribution current between <b>the</b> <b>constituents</b> when subjected to a temperature change. The amount of lithium exchanged between <b>the</b> <b>constituents</b> of <b>the</b> blend is also derived theoretically based on the thermodynamic properties of <b>the</b> pure <b>constituents,</b> showing excellent agreement to the experimental results. Theoretical and experimental results proof that significant amounts of lithium are exchanged between <b>the</b> <b>constituents</b> without any cycling of the battery, suggesting that this effect may intrinsically reduce the cycle life of batteries with blended insertion electrodes...|$|R

5|$|Despite of the {{internal}} opposition of Fernando de la Rúa, Alfonsín got his party to approve the pact. He reasoned that Menem would be supported by the eventual referendum, that many legislators would turn to his side, and he would eventually be able to amend the constitution reinforcing presidential power rather than limiting it. Still, as both sides feared a betrayal, all {{the contents of the}} pact were included as a single proposal, not allowing <b>the</b> <b>Constituent</b> Assembly to discuss each one separately. The Broad Front, a new political party composed of former Peronists, led by Carlos Álvarez, grew in the elections for <b>the</b> <b>Constituent</b> Assembly. Both the PJ and the UCR respected the pact, which was completely approved. Duhalde made a similar amendment to the constitution of the Buenos Aires province, in order to be re-elected in 1995. Menem won the elections with more than 50% of the vote, followed by José Octavio Bordón, and Carlos Álvarez. The UCR finished third in the elections for the first time.|$|E
