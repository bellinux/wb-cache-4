5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of <b>the</b> <b>children,</b> <b>for</b> example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill {{was married}} to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909 to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. (1910–1950). In 1917, O'Neill met Agnes Boulton, a {{successful}} writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey after their marriage. The years of their marriage—during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona—are described vividly in her 1958 memoir Part of a Long Story. They divorced in 1929, after O'Neill abandoned Boulton and <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> the actress Carlotta Monterey (born San Francisco, California, December 28, 1888; died Westwood, New Jersey, November 18, 1970). O'Neill and Carlotta married {{less than a month}} after he officially divorced his previous wife.|$|E
25|$|In {{marriage}}, {{there are}} three types of assets: those of the husband, those of the wife, and the common assets that pertain to both. Land and houses in a marriage {{continue to be the}} property of the person who brought them to the marriage, but in order to sell them, both the husband and wife must sign. In the case of divorce, both the man and woman are entitled to ownership of the marital home. In the case of the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse, regardless of gender, has equal inheritance rights to the marital home. If there is no will when the husband dies, the wife is given an equal category as <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> inheritance. Before marriage, a couple can sign a legal document separating all assets so that the woman and man each administer her or his own; in this case, the husband cannot control his wife's assets.|$|E
25|$|A Medical Civic Action Program (MEDCAP) station {{manned by}} medical {{personnel}} from an American unit, aided by Vietnamese interpreters, and a dentist was brought along {{to provide health}} check-ups and treatment for the villages. The medical treatment was mainly symptomatic and for minor problems, such as aspirin for pains, soap and medication for skin diseases, and extraction for toothaches. Where more serious medical issues were diagnosed, they were referred to other facilities outside the military channels for proper treatment or corrective surgery. The Youth Service Activity entertained the children so that their parents were free {{to talk to the}} government officials present about more serious matters such as government policy. Games were played, songs were sung, candy and toys were handed out to the children, and movies were shown. At one point Colonel Ba joined <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> ballgames. The Vietnamese Agricultural Service provided information to the elders about farming and government initiatives designed to assist farmers. The American military personnel present reported that the villagers appeared to be very pleased with the information session and the free social services.|$|E

25|$|Five {{days after}} the wedding, Jim {{received}} his draft notice. He was sent to France and became part of a military touring group that entertained the armed forces after World War I. When Jim came home from France, he and Marian decided to try their luck with a vaudeville act. They had two children, Kathryn Therese Jordan (1920–2007) and James Carroll Jordan (1923–1998), both born in Peoria. Marian returned home {{for the birth of}} Kathryn but went back to performing with Jim, leaving her daughter with Jim's parents. After Jim Jr. was born in 1923, Marian stayed with <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> a time, while Jim performed as a solo act. Marian and the children joined him on the road for a short time, but the couple had to admit defeat when they found themselves in Lincoln, Illinois in 1923 with two small children and no funds. The couple's parents had to wire them money for their return to Peoria. Jim went to work at a local department store but still felt the attraction of being in show business. He and Marian went back into vaudeville.|$|E
25|$|In {{the film}} , taking place two years {{following}} {{the resolution of the}} Individual Eleven incident, the Major has left Section 9, and Togusa is now field commander, leading an investigation into several deaths of refugees from the Siak Republic, which results in the discovery of a government computer system coordinating the kidnappings of 20 thousand abused children who have had their cyberbrains replaced and placing them under the care of several senior citizens made comatose by another government program that takes care of all of their bodily needs. Their investigation, which brings the Major out of hiding, reveals an entity known as the Puppeteer behind the kidnappings, but the Puppeteer is a rhizome formed by the collective will of the senior citizens, and it was only the Siak Republic's intent to use the kidnapped children in their plans that led to their downfall. However, the investigation further reveals that a member of the House of Representatives is also using <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> his nationalistic purposes, and Section 9 with the Major infiltrates a welfare center where the MP brainwashes the children, resulting in the Puppeteer revealing his own identity that the senior citizens wished to give the children free will in their future, with the politician interfering in that new plan.|$|E
500|$|Families {{send the}} {{children}} into other households, exchanging their labor for upbringing. [...] Impoverished rural parents hope {{for education and}} {{a better life for}} their children in the city, sending them to wealthier (or at least less poor) households. Increasingly, children enter domestic servitude when a parent dies. [...] Paid middlemen may act as recruiters, fetching <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> the host families. [...] Unlike slaves in the traditional sense, restaveks are not bought or sold or owned, could run away or return to their families, and are typically released from servitude when they become adults; however, the restavek system is commonly understood to be a form of slavery.|$|E

500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festival and the departure of the guests, Wagner and Cosima left with <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> Venice, where they remained until December. The festival had accumulated a large financial deficit; this, and Wagner's deep artistic dissatisfaction, precluded the possibility of any repeat in the near future. Wagner's mood was such that he seriously contemplated giving up the entire Bayreuth project; he was distracted from such thoughts by an invitation to conduct a series of concerts in London. Leaving the children behind, he and Cosima enjoyed a two-month break in England where, among others, Cosima met the novelist George Eliot, the poet Robert Browning, and the painter Edward Burne-Jones (who made a number of sketches of Cosima from which no finished painting emerged). [...] On 17 May both Wagners were received by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle.|$|E
500|$|To {{keep the}} {{children}} complacent, Mr. Black informs the campers that Krusty has finally come, {{but it is}} actually Barney dressed as Krusty. Bart leads the campers in rebellion, driving out Mr. Black and the bullies, and changing the camp's name to Camp Bart. Kent Brockman reports on the revolt, where Bart explains the camp's deplorable conditions that caused him and the campers to rebel in the first place. The stress of seeing Bart {{as the leader of}} the rebellion during the report on TV causes Homer to immediately lose the hair he grew and regain the lost weight. Krusty is called away from his vacation, and arrives at the camp where the kids at first don't believe its him, until a rough search reveals his iconic pacemaker scar. Krusty apologizes to <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> the poor conditions, saying that he was bribed to approve the camp. As compensation, Krusty takes them to [...] "the happiest place on Earth", Tijuana, Mexico.|$|E

He was the third of four sons born to Jack Matthews, a local boxer who was {{also known as the}} [...] "Fighting Barber of Hanley". In the summer of 1921, Jack Matthews took six-year-old Stanley to the Victoria Ground, home of the local club Stoke City, for an open race for boys under the age of 14, with a {{staggered}} start according to age. His father placed a bet on his son winning, and he did. Matthews attended Hanley's Wellington Road School, and later described himself as [...] "in many respects a model pupil". He also said the kickabout games the children played helped to improve his dribbling, and prepared <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> future life by giving them [...] "a focus, a purpose, discipline, and in many respects an escape".

500|$|Although {{he wrote}} his second set of hymns, Hymns [...] for the Amusement of Children, for a younger audience, Smart cares more about {{emphasizing}} the need for children to be moral instead of [...] "innocent". These works {{have been seen as}} possibly too complicated for [...] "amusement" [...] because they employ ambiguities and complicated theological concepts. In particular, Mark Booth questions [...] "why, in this carefully polished writing.... are the lines sometimes relatively hard to read for their paraphrasable sense?" [...] Arthur Sherbo disagreed with this sentiment strongly and claims the Hymns [...] "are more than mere hack work, tossed off with speed and indifference. They were written when Smart was in prison and despairing of rescue. Into these poems, some of them of a bare simplicity and naiveté that have few equals in literature of merit anywhere..." [...] However, he does admit some of the argument when he claims that [...] "Generosity", along with a handful other hymns, was [...] "not so simple and surely proved too much for <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>for</b> whom they were bought." ...|$|E
