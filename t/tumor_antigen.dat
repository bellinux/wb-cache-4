25|$|MPyV {{contains}} three proteins extensively {{studied for}} their ability to induce neoplastic transformation (that is, carcinogenesis); these proteins are expressed from the early region of the viral genome and are known as large, middle, and small <b>tumor</b> <b>antigen.</b> Murine polyomavirus and its close relative hamster polyomavirus are historically the only two known viruses whose genomes contain middle <b>tumor</b> <b>antigen,</b> by far the most efficient of the three early proteins at inducing carcinogenesis. In 2015 the genome sequence of a rat polyomavirus was reported to contain middle <b>tumor</b> <b>antigen</b> as well, consistent with expectations that it evolved uniquely in the rodent lineage of the polyomavirus family. Expression of MT from a transgene or introduction in cell culture can be sufficient to induce transformation. Studies using MT have played key roles in understanding host-cell oncogenes and their effects on carcinogenesis, particularly {{in the study of the}} Src family of tyrosine kinases. Transgenic mice expressing MT are widely used as models for cancer progression and metastasis, particularly of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) {{comprise}} an antibody, {{drug and}} a linker between them. The antibody will be targeted at a preferentially expressed protein in the tumour cells (known as a <b>tumor</b> <b>antigen)</b> or on cells that the tumor can utilise, such as blood vessel endothelial cells. They bind to the <b>tumor</b> <b>antigen</b> and are internalised, where the linker releases the drug into the cell. These specially targeted delivery vehicles {{vary in their}} stability, selectivity, and choice of target, but, in essence, they all aim to increase the maximum effective dose that can be delivered to the tumor cells. Reduced systemic toxicity means that {{they can also be}} used in sicker patients, and that they can carry new chemotherapeutic agents that would have been far too toxic to deliver via traditional systemic approaches.|$|E

2500|$|Tumor protein p53, {{also known}} as p53, {{cellular}} <b>tumor</b> <b>antigen</b> p53 (UniProt name), phosphoprotein p53, [...] tumor suppressor p53, antigen NY-CO-13, or transformation-related protein 53 (TRP53), is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as TP53 (humans) and Trp53 (mice). This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor. As such, p53 {{has been described as}} [...] "the guardian of the genome" [...] because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. Hence TP53 is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. (Italics are used to denote the TP53 gene name and distinguish it from the protein it encodes.) ...|$|E

40|$|AS {{a part of}} our ongoing {{search for}} a safe and {{efficient}} anti-tumor vaccine, we attempted to determine whether the molecular nature of certain <b>tumor</b> <b>antigens</b> would influence immune responses against tumor cells.

This response appears to be initiated by strong activation of the antigen-presenting cells, which may recognize heat-denatured protein antigens. Upon recognition of the heat-denatured <b>tumor</b> <b>antigens,</b> macrophages and dendritic cells were found to acutely upregulate the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as B 7. 2, as well as the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL- 12 and TNF-α.

5000|$|Like all polyomaviruses, TSPyV has a {{circular}} double-stranded DNA genome of around 5.2 kilobases.

5000|$|The middle <b>tumor</b> <b>antigen</b> (also {{called the}} middle T-antigen and {{abbreviated}} MTag or MT) is a protein encoded in the genomes of some polyomaviruses, which are small double-stranded DNA viruses.

In MPyV, MTag is an efficient oncoprotein that can be sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation in some cells.|$|E

In process of time, <b>tumor</b> <b>antigens</b> were gradually localized to the corium and muscle layer. Atypical large cells were recognized in the intermuscular bundles 15 days after inoculation, stained with strong, brilliant fluorescence. Histomorphologically they were identified with tumor cells originated from immature nerve-supporting cells which corresponded to muscle spindles or motor endplates. 2, Intraperitoneal inoculation Viral antigens could not almost be found 4 - 5 hours after injection, followed by appearance of <b>tumor</b> <b>antigens</b> 12 - 24 hours later.

40|$|SummaryThe {{generation}} of tumor-directed cytotoxic T lymphocytes is considered {{crucial for the}} induction of antitumor immunity.

Here we show that CD 169 + macrophages phagocytose dead tumor cells transported via lymphatic flow and subsequently crosspresent <b>tumor</b> <b>antigens</b> to CD 8 + T cells. Subcutaneous immunization with irradiated tumor cells protects mice from syngenic tumor. However, tumor antigen-specific CD 8 + T cell activation and subsequent antitumor immunity are severely impaired in mice depleted with CD 169 + macrophages. Neither migratory dendritic cells (DCs) nor lymph node-resident conventional DCs are essential for the crosspresentation of <b>tumor</b> <b>antigens.</b> Thus, we have identified CD 169 + macrophages as lymph node-resident APCs dominating early activation of tumor antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells...|$|R
