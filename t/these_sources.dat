Furthermore, while <b>these</b> <b>sources</b> might be seen as biased due to national origin and underlying romantic and heroic narrative constructions of the battle for each side, some of the sources, such as the Chronicle work as points of reference to the more lyrical constructions presented in other popular narrative formats.

5|$|Recently, however, {{scholars}} such as David Christian and Constantine Zuckerman {{have suggested}} that the Schechter Letter's account is corroborated by various other Russian chronicles, and suggests a struggle within the early Rus' polity between factions loyal to Oleg and to the Rurikid Igor, a struggle that Oleg ultimately lost. Zuckerman posited that the early chronology of the Rus' had to be re-determined in light of <b>these</b> <b>sources.</b> Among Zuckerman's beliefs and those of others who have analyzed <b>these</b> <b>sources</b> are that the Khazars did not lose Kiev until the early 10th century (rather than 882, the traditional date), that Igor was not Rurik's son but rather a more distant descendant, and that Oleg did not immediately follow Rurik, but rather that there is a lost generation between the legendary Varangian lord and his documented successors.|$|E

30|$|The Bir M’Cherga basin (North-east Tunisia), {{with about}} 600  km 2 area, had {{recorded}} four Middle Cretaceous source rocks well stratigraphically {{correlated with the}} four known oceanic anoxic sub-events: OAE 1 a, OAE 1 b, OAE 1 c, and OAE 1 d. Variety of lithology, thickness and organic richness had characterized <b>these</b> <b>source</b> rocks. The sedimentary tectonic analysis, the petrology and geochemistry study established the petroleum system of <b>these</b> <b>source</b> rocks. Basin formation began early in the Barremian–Aptian interval by synsedimentary tectonics reactivating old basement faults. During the Aptian–Albian, the formed basin had a depocenter that recorded thicker black shales while its NW and SE edges remained raised under the Triassic halokinetic activities. The evolution of the sedimentary filling during this period generated two sedimentary cycles corresponding to two filling second-order fining and thickening upwards sequences. The black shales that constitute <b>these</b> <b>source</b> rocks are formed between subtidal and external platform environment and are interbedded with juxtaposed high organic rich layers and poor ones. The rich organic facies consists of dark shale that constitutes the source rock. The poor organic beds formed by light grey and nodular limestones constitute an intra host reservoir. Thereby, petroleum system consists in an “unconventional oil shale hybrid systems {{with a combination of}} juxtaposed organic-rich and organic-lean intervals associated to open fractures”. The kerogen is essentially amorphous, with marine planktonic origin and low ligneous organic matter contribution. This organic material of dark facies had been well preserved in an anoxic environment with little or no energy. Light grey limestones were of oxic-to-sub-oxic environment. The stage of the thermal evolution for <b>these</b> <b>source</b> rocks provided by IH/Tmax diagram is of the “oil window”. The average transformation ratio (TR) is estimated as 45 % suggesting thus black shales are oil shale resources which still close about untransformed 55 % of its hydrocarbon generating potential. The expulsion and release of oil into <b>these</b> <b>source</b> rocks are proven by the observation of hydrocarbons filling micro-cracks and by the variable values of the oil saturation index OSI ranging from 0 to 138 %. The latter exceeds 100 % near the paleo-high reliefs indicating two “oil crossover” areas attributed to the high degree of oil source rock saturation and accumulation of hydrocarbons considered ideal for hydraulic fracturing. This oil crossover is a consequence of secondary migration into black shale source rock, achieved by various faults created during the distensive phase that were reactivated again several times.|$|R

5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less {{abundant in the}} crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts.

There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions.
