5|$|The Battle of Hampton Roads, often {{referred}} to as either the Battle of the Monitor and Merrimack (or Virginia) or the Battle of Ironclads, was the most noted and arguably most important naval battle of the American Civil War from <b>the</b> <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development of navies. It was fought over two days, March 8–9, 1862, in Hampton Roads, a roadstead in Virginia where the Elizabeth and Nansemond rivers meet the James River just before it enters Chesapeake Bay adjacent to the city of Norfolk. The battle {{was a part of the}} effort of the Confederacy to break the Union blockade, which had cut off Virginia's largest cities, Norfolk and Richmond, from international trade.|$|E
5|$|Although Domnall {{had earlier}} opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong {{familial}} {{connections with the}} Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach. In fact, the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals {{that at least two}} apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann. As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother's family. From <b>the</b> <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uí Briain, the union of Domnall's parents would, therefore, seem to have been orchestrated in the context of extending Uí Briain authority into the Isles. In 1096, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, lost his life on Mann, apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles. This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles, but suggests that Domnall {{and the rest of the}} Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there, possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents. The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From <b>the</b> <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For the leaders in the administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E

25|$|From <b>the</b> <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then current aether models, the {{experimental}} results were conflicting. The Fizeau experiment and its 1886 repetition by Michelson and Morley apparently confirmed the stationary aether with partial aether dragging, and refuted complete aether dragging. On the other hand, {{the much more}} precise Michelson–Morley experiment (1887) apparently confirmed complete aether dragging and refuted the stationary aether. In addition, the Michelson–Morley null result was further substantiated by the null results of other second-order experiments of different kind, namely the Trouton–Noble experiment (1903) and the Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902–1904). These problems and their solution {{led to the development}} of the Lorentz transformation and special relativity.|$|E
25|$|Deeper {{analysis}} is needed {{before we can}} understand why these distinctions should result in {{a difference in the}} twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.2‑11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From <b>the</b> <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the path integral) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.|$|E

25|$|Boltzmann {{accomplished}} the feat of {{showing that the}} second law of thermodynamics is only a statistical fact. The gradual disordering of energy {{is analogous to the}} disordering of an initially ordered pack of cards under repeated shuffling, and just as the cards will finally return to their original order if shuffled a gigantic number of times, so the entire universe must some-day regain, by pure chance, the state from which it first set out. (This optimistic coda to the idea of the dying universe becomes somewhat muted when one attempts to estimate the timeline which will probably elapse before it spontaneously occurs.) The tendency for entropy increase seems to cause difficulty to beginners in thermodynamics, but is easy to understand from <b>the</b> <b>standpoint</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory of probability. Consider two ordinary dice, with both sixes face up. After the dice are shaken, the chance of finding these two sixes face up is small (1 in 36); thus one can say that the random motion (the agitation) of the dice, like the chaotic collisions of molecules because of thermal energy, causes the less probable state to change to one that is more probable. With millions of dice, like the millions of atoms involved in thermodynamic calculations, the probability of their all being sixes becomes so vanishingly small that the system must move to one of the more probable states. However, mathematically the odds of all the dice results not being a pair sixes is also as hard as the ones of all of them being sixes, and since statistically the data tend to balance, one in every 36 pairs of dice will tend to be a pair of sixes, and the cards -when shuffled- will sometimes present a certain temporary sequence order even if in its whole the deck was disordered.|$|E
