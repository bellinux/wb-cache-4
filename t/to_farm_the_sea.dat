5000|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, the National Cancer Institute {{carried out}} a wide-ranging program of {{screening}} plant and marine organism material. As part of that program extract from the sea squirt Ecteinascidia turbinata {{was found to have}} anticancer activity in 1969.Separation and characterisation of the active molecules had to wait many years for the development of sufficiently sensitive techniques, and the structure of one of them, Ecteinascidin 743, was determined by KL Rinehart at the University of Illinois in 1984. Rinehart had collected his sea squirts by scuba diving in the reefs of the West Indies. Recently, the biosynthetic pathway responsible for producing the drug has been determined to come from Candidatus Endoecteinascidia frumentensis, a microbial symbiont of the tunicate.The Spanish company PharmaMar licensed the compound from the University of Illinois before 1994 and attempted <b>to</b> <b>farm</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> squirt with limited success. Yields from the sea squirt are extremely low - it takes 1 tonne of animals to isolate 1 gram of trabectedin - and about 5 grams were believed to be needed for a clinical trial so Rinehart asked the Harvard chemist E. J. Corey to search for a synthetic method of preparation. His group developed such a method and published it in 1996. [...] This was later followed by a simpler and more tractable method which was patented by Harvard and subsequently licensed to PharmaMar. [...] The current supply is based on a semisynthetic process developed by PharmaMar starting from safracin B, an antibiotic obtained by fermentation of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. PharmaMar have entered into an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to market the compound outside Europe.|$|E

But when it comes <b>to</b> parasites, <b>farming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> {{is no different from}} farming on land.

6000|$|This {{determined}} upon, {{and young}} Neil a little repentant {{and a great}} deal ashamed, the rest was easy. The cronies were heavy stockholders in the P. C. Company. The P. C. Company owned fleets of river-steamers and ocean-going craft, and, in addition <b>to</b> <b>farming</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> exploited a hundred thousand square miles or so of the land that, on the maps of geographers, usually occupies the white spaces. So the P. C. Company sent young Neil Bonner north, where the white spaces are, to do its work and to learn to be good like his father. [...] "Five years of simplicity, close to the soil and far from temptation, will make a man of him," [...] said old Neil Bonner, and forthwith crawled back among his roses. Young Neil set his jaw, pitched his chin at the proper angle, and went to work. As an underling he did his work well and gained the commendation of his superiors. Not that he delighted in the work, but that it was the one thing that prevented him from going mad.|$|R

5000|$|Lapid's most {{well-known}} book Valley of Strength {{tells the story}} of the first immigrants to the modern land of Israel and the founders of the Rosh Pina Moshava. Its sequel Havat Haalmot stars the protagonists of Valley of Strength and others during the second Aliyah, who were part of Havat Haamlot to educate women <b>to</b> <b>farming</b> near <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> of Galilee <b>Farm.</b> Keheres Hanishbar, another book by Lapid, {{tells the story of}} an antiquities seller named Moses Wilhelm Shapira. Lapid wrote several children's books and the words for the song Rosa Marzipan, which was composed by Shlomo Gronich. Lapid's spy-themed literature is especially popular in Israel. She is the creator of the character Lizzy Bdihi, who is featured in six of Lapid’s thriller novels. Bdihi is a journalist at a Beersheba Local Newspaper called Hazman Darom (literally [...] "The Southern Times"), and in each book she stubbornly insists on dealing with a detective mystery no one asked her to solve. The first book in the series, Mekomon (published 1989), is a prominent Hebrew detective novel that helped the genre flourish in Israel. The main character of the series, Bdihi, solves several cases while tottering in her oversized shoes and wearing oversized earrings, as Lapid liked to describe her.|$|R
