40|$|For the TESLA Test Facility at DESY modulators, which {{generate}} high voltage, {{pulses of}} 130 kV with an electrical power {{of up to}} 16. 8 MW are used. The pulses have a repetition rate of up to 10 Hz and a width of 1. 7 ms. Since {{it is not possible}} to take the pulsed energy directly from the mains the required energy is stored in capacitor banks to be released during the pulse. Power supplies are needed to recharge the capacitor banks of the modulators without disturbing the mains. In particular the low repetition rate of the pulses has to be suppressed. Tobe independent from the repetition rate the power supplies have to operate in a constant power mode. The DC charging current into the capacitors decreases during the loading with the same factor with which the voltage increases. In this way the current taken from the <b>threephase</b> <b>mains</b> is constant. Different types of power supplies have been investigated at DESY and are described here. These types are antiductors with secondary diode bridges, switched mode power supplies, diode bridges plus series switched mode supplies, diode bridges with SCR bridges in sequential phase control...|$|E
