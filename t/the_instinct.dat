25|$|Genes are cogs in the machine, not gods in the sky. They are {{switched}} {{on and off}} throughout life, by external as well as internal events, {{their job is to}} absorb information from the environment at least as often as to transmit it from the past. Genes do more than carry information; they respond to experience. Susan Mineka illustrated this concept exceedingly well with her idea of prepared learning in monkeys, where she found the predisposition of genes largely affected the acquisition of fear responses to certain stimuli. Lab-reared monkeys, through vicarious experience, were easily able to acquire a fear response to a snake, but not a flower. Nature provides <b>the</b> <b>instinct,</b> and elements of nurture depend on whether <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> is expressed.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} suggests, Shelties can {{and have been}} used as sheepdogs and still {{participate}} in sheepdog trials to this day. Herding dogs conduct livestock {{from one place to another}} by causing fear-flocking and flight behavior. <b>The</b> <b>instinct</b> to herd is primarily a product of breeding. No amount of training can substitute this trait.|$|E

25|$|One {{story of}} solar eclipse danger was {{illustrated}} by the case of Mr. Tomososki, who damaged his eyesight when viewing a 1962 eclipse, leaving him with a pea-sized blind spot {{for the rest of}} his life. During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did. While some can recover, the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> to not look at the sun.|$|E
25|$|Church was a {{key figure}} in American foreign policy during the 1970s, and served as {{chairman}} of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations from 1979 to 1981. Following <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> that led him to ask questions early on (see above), Church {{was one of the first}} senators to publicly oppose the Vietnam War in the 1960s, although he had supported the conflict earlier. He was the co-author of two legislative efforts to curtail the war: the Cooper–Church Amendment of 1970, and the Case–Church Amendment of 1973.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} ways of defining terrorism {{and all are}} subjective. Most define terrorism as 'the use or threat of serious violence' to advance some kind of 'cause'. Some state clearly the kinds of group ('sub-national', 'non-state') or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> of most people when confronted with an act that involves innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory and grave problems {{with the use of}} the term persist.|$|E
5000|$|The entire {{theory is}} {{referred}} to as based on the idea of the Innate Structure of Mind. That is, the questions come from <b>the</b> <b>Instincts</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Instincts</b> are a result of a pre-existing structure that is the foundation of Mind itself. It is a concept considered logical because there must be a pre-existing order if all minds share essential similarities.|$|R

25|$|Richard Dawkins {{outlines}} in The Selfish Gene (1976) {{that humans}} are machines made of genes and genes are the grounding for everything we do. The gene-centric view outlines that natural selection, evolution and all behaviour must {{be traced back to}} the survival of competing genes as an extension of Darwin’s theory being the survival of competing individuals. The main goal of individuals, coming from <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> of our genes, is to reproduce and thrive, where thriving involves protection, conquering competition and future growth. Therefore, everything that we do relates to thriving in our environment above competition, including the way we consume as a form of survival in our environment when simply purchasing the basic physiological needs of food, water and warmth. We also consume to thrive above others, for example in conspicuous consumption where a luxury car represents money and high social status and the application of makeup makes the person and their genes seem more attractive and worthy of passing to offspring.|$|E
25|$|Rivers further {{asserted}} that all painful or un-useful instincts are naturally {{kept out of}} conscious awareness (i.e. in the unconscious) by suppression. Suppression—in this view—is a natural and “unwitting” (unintentional) method for removing painful instincts from consciousness and confining them in the unconscious. Neuroses, therefore, develop when something in the natural process of suppression is disrupted so that a suppressed instinct and its associated emotion are released from the unconscious. Rivers cites two possible reasons for the “escape” of such instincts from the unconscious: either <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> became too strong to contain, or the normal reserves which typically suppress it were weakened. It is important to note, however, that the etiology of war neuroses is not simply the escape of instincts from the unconscious and the ensuing conflict. More often than not, Rivers believed that {{the way in which}} such conflict is resolved (or is attempted to be resolved) also greatly influences the manifestation of the neuroses.|$|E

25|$|Veblen {{generalized}} {{the conflict}} between businessmen and engineers by saying that human society would always involve conflict between existing norms with vested interests and new norms developed out of an innate human tendency to manipulate and learn about the physical {{world in which we}} exist. He also generalized his model to include his theory of instincts, processes of evolution as absorbed from Sumner, as enhanced by his own reading of evolutionary science, and pragmatic philosophy first learned from Peirce. <b>The</b> <b>instinct</b> of idle curiosity led humans to manipulate nature in new ways and this led to changes in what he called the material means of life. Because, as per the pragmatists, our ideas about the world are a human construct rather than mirrors of reality, changing ways of manipulating nature lead to changing constructs and to changing notions of truth and authority as well as patterns of behavior (institutions). Societies and economies evolve as a consequence, but do so via a process of conflict between vested interests and older forms and the new. Veblen never wrote with any confidence that the new ways were better ways, but he was sure in the last three decades of his life that the American economy could, in the absence of vested interests, have produced more for more people. In the years just after World War I he looked to engineers to make the American economy more efficient.|$|E

500|$|After Ishqiya (2010), No One Killed Jessica (2011) and The Dirty Picture (2011), Kahaani was Vidya's fourth woman-centric film to win {{widespread}} {{praise for}} her unconventional approach to portraying strong female roles. According to Zee News, Kahaani is a woman's film about [...] "role reversals, breaking of stereotypes, turning clichés inside out, a woman's journey, {{and the way}} she carves a niche for herself in the male-dominated mentalscape of the society." [...] Trisha Gupta of The Indian Express also finds feminist themes in the film. For Ghosh, one aspect of his project [...] "is a study of motherhood"; <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> of a mother to protect her baby inspired him to develop the story.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{responses to}} the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper. In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to Jytte Klausen, [...] "most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. <b>The</b> <b>instinct</b> was to split the blame." [...] Berlingske-Tidende criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. Politiken attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem. On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.|$|E
500|$|Darwin was {{intrigued}} by his half-cousin Francis Galton's argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In The Descent of Man, Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> of sympathy, [...] "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a [...] "caste" [...] of [...] "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it [...] "the sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals. Francis Galton named this field of study [...] "eugenics" [...] in 1883.|$|E

25|$|Jung {{was fond}} of {{comparing}} {{the form of the}} archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given a priori. The representations themselves are not inherited, only the forms, and in that respect they correspond to <b>the</b> <b>instincts.</b> <b>The</b> existence of <b>the</b> <b>instincts</b> can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.|$|R
500|$|Of {{the five}} volumes, the second {{may be the}} most {{interesting}}: it dealt with more interesting times, and more consistent military operations. The army of the north was a [...] "bad army," [...] and the story of its command is one of [...] "honest and brave men hurried in turn to the guillotine, or of less honest men going over to the enemy." [...] Some of Phipps' own eccentricities also appear in volume two; he frequently lapses into sarcasm, revealing his disdain for civilian administration of military affairs, and there are points at which he fails to follow through fully on his criticism; for example, he holds back on his critique of Jean Victor Moreau despite his assertion that he wanted to demolish once and for all the myth that Moreau was as great a soldier as Napoleon. Phipps adeptly describes the game of cat and mouse that Moreau, Jean Baptiste Jourdan, and the Archduke Charles played with one another in the summer of 1796 as their armies criss-crossed south-western Germany; neither general came to grips with the other until October, and even then, after the Battle of Schliengen, Charles was content to chase Moreau and Jourdan over the Rhine, not to demolish the French army. They were lacking, Phipps postulated, <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> and nerves of Napoleon.|$|E

2500|$|Although Spielrein's {{paper was}} {{published}} in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. In The Ego and the Id (1923) he would develop his argument to state that [...] "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an instinct of destruction directed against the external world". The following year he would spell out more clearly that the [...] "libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct {{to a great extent}} outwards [...] <b>The</b> <b>instinct</b> is then called the destructive instinct, <b>the</b> <b>instinct</b> for mastery, or the will to power", a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.|$|E
