5|$|A {{security}} vulnerability {{was reported}} on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> {{number of the}} sender of an SMS message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using SMS spoofing. The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> number registered to their victim's account. Within {{a few weeks of}} this discovery, Twitter introduced an optional personal identification number (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.|$|E

5|$|Communications {{with the}} outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way to}} prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> lines.

5000|$|On February 26, 2014, in {{the wake}} of another suicide from the bridge, {{independent}} Rep. Joe Brooks of Winterport proposed emergency legislation to the Maine Legislature to require the installation of a suicide barrier on the bridge. [...] This proposal was rejected due to cost, as a barrier was estimated to cost between $500,000 and $1 million, plus additional costs for regular inspections. As an alternative, two solar-powered phones were installed on each end of the bridge in May of 2015 which connect users to a suicide hotline. <b>The</b> <b>phones</b> cost $30,000. State officials were aware of instances <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> were not functional, and increased inspections of them to weekly from the previous monthly.
