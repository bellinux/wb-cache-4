5|$|After Ueshiba's {{death in}} 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant {{controversy}} arose with {{the departure of}} the Aikikai Hombu Dojo's chief instructor Koichi Tohei, in 1974. Tohei left {{as a result of a}} disagreement with the son of the founder, Kisshomaru Ueshiba, who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ki development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido, and the organization <b>that</b> <b>governs</b> it, the Ki Society (Ki no Kenkyūkai).|$|E

5|$|Jordan is {{a unitary}} state under a {{constitutional}} monarchy. Jordan's constitution, adopted in 1952 and amended {{a number of}} times since, is the legal framework <b>that</b> <b>governs</b> the monarch, government, bicameral legislature and judiciary. The king retains wide executive and legislative powers from the government and parliament. The king exercises his powers through the government that he appoints for a four-year term, which is responsible before the parliament that is made up of two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The judiciary is independent according to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} <b>that</b> <b>governs</b> the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on the Olympic programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The {{goal was to}} apply a systematic approach to establishing the Olympic programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on the Olympic programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation <b>that</b> <b>governs</b> the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to the Olympic programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{planning}} for BART {{began with the}} setting up in 1957 of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a county-based special-purpose district body <b>that</b> <b>governs</b> the BART system. The district initially began with five members, {{all of which were}} projected to receive BART lines: Alameda County, Contra Costa County, the City and County of San Francisco, San Mateo County, and Marin County. Though invited to participate, Santa Clara County supervisors elected not to join BART in 1957, preferring instead to concentrate on building expressways. In 1962 San Mateo County supervisors voted to leave BART, saying their voters would be paying taxes to carry mainly Santa Clara County residents. The district-wide tax base was weakened by San Mateo's departure, forcing Marin County to withdraw a month later. Despite the fact that Marin had originally voted in favor of BART participation at the 88% level, its marginal tax base could not adequately absorb its share of BART's projected cost. Another important factor in Marin's withdrawal was an engineering controversy over the feasibility of running trains on the lower deck of the Golden Gate Bridge, an extension forecast as late as three decades after the rest of the BART system. The withdrawals of Marin and San Mateo resulted in a downsizing of the original system plans, which would have had lines as far south as Palo Alto and northward past San Rafael. Voters in the three remaining participating counties approved the truncated system, with termini in Fremont, Richmond, Concord, and Daly City, in 1962.|$|E
