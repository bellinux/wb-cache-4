5|$|At {{the time}} King Poniatowski decided {{to sue for}} peace, the Polish army was still in good {{fighting}} condition, not suffering from any major defeat nor from lack of supplies. King Poniatowski thought that due to Russian numerical superiority defeat was nonetheless imminent, and more could be gained through negotiations with the Russians, with whom he hoped a new alliance could be formed. Although subsequent events would prove him wrong, {{the question of whether}} <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been foreseen, and prevented through continued military resistance, has been subject to much debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been present because some species are mute.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, a {{new theory}} {{surfaced}} after the newspaper Crónica spoke to the police about {{the cause of the}} accident. The police source mentioned the possibility that Rodrigo's intensive routine might have increased the production of adrenaline in his body. The investigators explained that, if Rodrigo did not release the excess adrenaline through urination after his last concert, he could have lost his sense of distance in relation to Pesquera's Blazer. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> caused Rodrigo to apply the brake and turn the wheel violently.|$|E

5|$|One {{field study}} found that red wattlebirds foraged for longer periods when nectar {{concentrations}} in flowers were low, and consumed fewer insects at this time. However, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been because the temperature was lower and hence insects were less active. In Gingin, Western Australia, 97% of red wattlebirds at a site of two mixed kangaroo paw species were observed feeding on a single species at its peak flowering: cats paw in August and red-and-green kangaroo paw (A. manglesii) in September, with very few visits to the other species or hybrids.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{a number}} of irregularities. In the Toronto riding of St. Paul's, four Liberal workers were convicted of various {{offences}} for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register. One of the four was also convicted for two counts of perjury. While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate, former MP James Rooney, was not charged, Ontario Chief Justice James Chalmers McRuer, who investigated the matter, doubted that <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been done without the candidate's knowledge.|$|E

5|$|After direct American {{intervention}} in 1965, the increased presence of U.S. naval vessels in coastal waters Operation Market Time nullified the seaborne route. The alternative devised by Hanoi was ingenious. Following on the agreement between Sihanouk and the Chinese, an arrangement was also struck between the prince and the DRV government. In October military supplies were sailed directly from North Vietnam on communist-flagged (especially of the Eastern bloc) ships to the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville, where that nation's neutrality guaranteed their delivery. The supplies were unloaded and {{then transferred to}} trucks which transported them to the frontier zones that served as PAVN/NLF Base Areas. These Base Areas also served as sanctuaries for PAVN/NLF troops, who simply crossed the border from South Vietnam and then rested, reinforced, and refitted for their next campaign in safety. None of <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been accomplished without the acquiescence of Sihanouk.|$|E
5|$|During the 2014–15 season, {{a dismal}} run of form saw the team slip {{to the bottom}} of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant the Foxes {{finished}} the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest ever escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of their family members.|$|E

50|$|Along with Saul Kripke, David Lewis, and Alvin Plantinga, Stalnaker {{has been}} one of the most {{influential}} theorists exploring philosophical aspects of possible world semantics. According to his view of possible worlds, they are ways <b>this</b> world <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been, which in turn are maximal properties that <b>this</b> world <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> <b>This</b> view distinguishes him from the influential modal realist Lewis, who argued that possible worlds are concrete entities just like this world.|$|R
5|$|Sultan did not {{initially}} have any male heirs {{and it is}} possible that Usama expected to succeed him. He certainly singled him out among his brothers by teaching him, tutoring him in the ways of war and hunting. He even favoured him for personal missions and as a representative. However, after Sultan had his own son, he no longer appreciated the presence of Usama and Murshid's other sons. According to Usama, Sultan was jealous after a particularly successful lion-hunt in 1131 when he entered the town with a large lion head in his arms as a hunting trophy. When his grandmother saw this she warned him about the effect <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> on his uncle. However, despite this he still spoke well of his uncle on a few occasions in his autobiography and highlighted his noble actions. Usama ultimately left Shaizar temporarily in 1129 and after his father died in 1137 his exile became permanent.|$|E
5|$|The cyclometer {{comprised}} {{two sets}} of Enigma rotors, and {{was used to determine}} the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12–20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been increased to 90%.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Burnham-on-Sea {{is the history}} of the {{reclamation}} of the Somerset Levels from the River Severn and the Bristol Channel. The Romans were the first peoples to try to reclaim the Somerset levels, and it was their people who were probably the first settlers in the high sand dunes behind the River Parrett. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been in part to maintain navigational systems, to aid ships entering the River Parrett and what is now Highbridge. When the Romans left, the system of drainage they installed was not maintained, and the areas reverted to become a tidal salt flat during the Anglo Saxon period.|$|E

5|$|Warner Bros. {{considered}} shooting Superman Returns at Warner Roadshow Studios in the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. After filming, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{been used}} as an attraction for the adjoining Warner Bros. Movie World theme park, but the idea was scrapped for being too expensive. Set construction started in January 2005 at Fox Studios Australia for the film's 60 setpieces, while the start date was pushed back for two weeks. In an attempt to avoid public attention, Superman Returns carried the fake working title of Red Sun during filming. Starting in late March 2005, principal photography lasted until November. Filming of Superman Returns in New South Wales constituted hiring thousands of local workers, generating over $100 million into the local economy. 80% of filming took place at Fox Studios Australia, occupying all nine sound stages. Scenes set in Smallville were shot at Tamworth, while the Australian Museum doubled for the Metropolis Museum of Natural History.|$|E
5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach {{of that particular}} airframe, the centre of pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. <b>This</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been initiated, although he rules out the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E

5|$|Shark populations began declining. Since {{they are}} predators {{near the top}} of the marine food chain, an {{umbrella}} species, playing an important role in maintaining ocean ecosystems, <b>this</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> serious adverse environmental consequences for marine fisheries. Campaigns began in many nations to prohibit or greatly curtail finning in both territorial and international waters and work toward international agreements on the practice. In the U.S., President Bill Clinton signed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act (SFPA) into law in 2000 shortly before leaving office. It amended the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the primary statute regulating fisheries in the U.S.'s Exclusive Economic Zone up to 200 nautical miles offshore, to prohibit finning in U.S. territorial waters by any vessels, and the possession of fins by a U.S.-flagged vessel in international waters or the landing of any fins at a U.S. port without corresponding carcasses amounting to at least 20 times the weight of the fins. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) was charged with promulgating and implementing regulations to enforce the act.|$|E
