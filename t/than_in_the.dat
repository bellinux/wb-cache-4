40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} change and {{clinical}} significance of serum PG {{in patients with}} chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). Methods: ELISA was used to detect the peripheral blood PG level in patients confirmed with CAG, gastric polyps, and gastric cancer who were admitted in our hospital from January, 2015 to January, 2016. The normal individuals who came for physical examinations were served as the control group. The peripheral blood PG level in patients with various gastric diseases was observed. Results: The serum PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/PG Ⅱ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastritis group were significantly lower <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric polyps group and control group, but were significantly higher <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric cancer group; while PG Ⅱ expression was significantly higher <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric polyps group and control group, but was significantly lower <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric cancer group. PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric polyps group were significantly higher <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastritis group and gastric cancer group, while PG Ⅱ expression was significantly lower <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastritis group and gastric cancer group. PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric cancer group were significantly lower <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other three groups, while PG Ⅱ expression was significantly higher <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other three groups. The serum PG Ⅰ expression in patients with positive HP infection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastritis group and gastric cancer group was significantly higher <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> patients with negative HP infection, but the comparison of PG I/ PG Ⅱ was not statistically significant. The serum PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ in patients with negative and positive HP infection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastritis group were significantly higher <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> patients with negative and positive HP infection <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric cancer group; while PG Ⅱ expression was significantly was significantly lower <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric cancer group. Conclusions: PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ in patients with CAG are significantly reduced, but PG Ⅱ expression is significantly strengthened; while PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ are significantly higher <b>than</b> those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric cancer group, but PG Ⅱ expression is significantly lower <b>than</b> that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastric cancer group. It should {{pay attention to the}} changes of <b>the</b> above indicators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clinical treatment. If PG Ⅰ expression and PG I/ PG Ⅱ are significantly reduced, but PG Ⅱ expression is significantly strengthened, it should pay attention to the probability of condition deterioration...|$|R
