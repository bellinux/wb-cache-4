40|$|Background: Limited {{prospective}} {{data are}} available on the acquisition of viral, bacterial and parasitic diarrhoeagenic agents by healthy individuals during travel. Methods: To determine the frequency of travel associated acquisition of 19 pathogens in 98 intercontinental travellers, qPCR was used to detect 8 viral pathogens, 6 bacterial enteric pathogens and 5 parasite species in faecal samples collected immediately before and after travel. Results: We found high pre-travel carriage rates of Blastocystis spp. and Dientamoeba fragilis of 32 % and 19 % respectively. Pre-travel prevalences of all other tested pathogens were below 3 %. Blastocystis spp. (10 %), Plesiomonas shigelloides (7 %), D. fragilis (6 %) and Shigella spp. (5 %) were the most frequently acquired pathogens and acquisition of enteral viruses and hepatitis E virus in this relatively small group of travellers was rare or non-existent. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the role of viruses as the cause of persisting traveller's diarrhoea is limited and bacterial pathogens are more likely as a cause of traveller's diarrhoea. The substantial proportion of travellers carrying Blastocystis spp. and D. fragilis before <b>travel</b> <b>warrants</b> cautious interpretation of positive samples in returning travellers with gastrointestinal complaints.

40|$|During 30 days (d) of bedrest, the {{practicality}} {{of using}} Elec- troMyoStimulation (EMS) {{as a deterrent}} to atrophy and strength loss of lower limb musculature was examined. An EMS system was developed that provided variable but quantifiable levels of EMS, and measured torque. The dominant log of three male subjects was stimulated twice daily in a 3 -d on/ 1 -d off cycle during bedrest. The non-dominant leg of each subject acted as a control. A stimulator, using a 0. 3 ms monophasic 60 Hz pulse waveform, activated muscle tissue for 4 s. The output waveform from the stimulator was sequenced to the Knee Extensors (KE), Knee Flex- ors (KF), Ankle Extensors (AE), and Ankle Flexors (AF), and caused three isometric contractions of each muscle group per minute. Subject tolerance determined EMS Intensity. Each muscle group received four 5 -min bouts of EMS each session with a 10 -min rest between bouts. EMS and torque levels for each muscle action were recorded directly an a computer. Overall average EMS Intensity was 197, 197, 195, and 188 mA for the KE, KF, AF, and AE, respectively. Overall average torque development for these muscle groups was 70, 16, 12, and 27 Nm, respectively. EMS intensity doubled during the study, and average torque increased 2. 5 times. Average maximum torque throughout a session reached 54 % of maximal voluntary for the KE and 29 % for the KF. Reductions in leg volume, muscle compartment size, cross-sectional area of slow and fast-twitch fibers, strength, and aerobic enzyme activities, and increased log compliance were attenuated in the legs which received EMS during bedrest. These results indicate that similar EMS levels induce different torques among different muscle groups and that repeated exposure to EMS increases tolerance and torque development. Longer orien- tation periods, therefore, may enhance its effectiveness. Our preliminary data suggest that the efficacy of EMS as an effective countermeasure for muscle atrophy and strength loss during long duration space <b>travel</b> <b>warrants</b> further investigation...|$|R

50|$|According to PDKI In late November 1989 the Austrian courts {{issued a}} warrant for the arrest of the three Iranian representatives and the Austrian Government {{expressly}} accused the Iranian Government as having instigated the attack on Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou and the two other Kurds.The three Iranian representatives in the negotiations with the Kurdish leaders returned to Iran freely. One of them {{had never been in}} custody, one was escorted by Austrian police to the Vienna airport nine days after the assassination, and the third, after one night of arrest, spent a few months in the Iranian embassy in Vienna before he disappeared from Austria. One of the suspects was Mohamed Magaby, whom the Kurdish protesters in Vienna requested to be arrested and be put under <b>travel</b> ban. <b>Warrants</b> for their arrest were not issued until November 1989.

Unlike the German Mykonos trial for the assassination of Ghassemlou's successor Sadegh Sharafkandi in Berlin, the assassination in Vienna was never clarified by any court. The Mykonos verdict of 1 April 1997 put the responsibility on the Iranian government of the time for the murders in Berlin and in Vienna.|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionHypoxic {{challenge}} testing (HCT) is {{not readily}} available in all hospitals. It has recently been shown that resting oximetry does not reliably predict the results of HCT in patients with extrapulmonary restrictive lung disease. We assessed other clinical tests {{to see if they}} might be used as an alternative screen for HCT. MethodsPeople with primary thoracic scoliosis were recruited. Resting SpO 2, arterial blood gases (ABG’s), lung function and shuttle walking test (SWT) were measured. All subjects underwent HCT breathing an inhaled oxygen fraction of 15 % for 20  min, or until SpO 2 fell below 85 %, when ABG’s were taken. ResultsFourteen people (5 male) with thoracic scoliosis, Cobb angle 93 (31) °, aged 65 (8. 5) years, FEV 1 0. 86 (0. 4) L, FVC 1. 2 (0. 4) L were studied. The resting SpO 2 was 96 (2) %, PaO 2 9. 2 (1) kPa and PaCO 2 6. 1 (0. 4) kPa. HCT was positive in 11 subjects (PaO 2   95 %. Positive correlation was found between SpO 2 at SWT termination and PaO 2 following HCT (r =  0. 56, p =  0. 02). Those with saturations of 92 % or under at SWT termination had positive HCT. ConclusionsDespite normal resting SpO 2 subjects with thoracic scoliosis may have positive HCT. Current recommendations for air travel do not accurately identify these people. Desaturation following a SWT may provide a useful screening tool, however a low threshold for performing HCT on people with thoracic scoliosis prior to air <b>travel</b> is <b>warranted...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2009, Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir (‘President Bashir’) {{was indicted}} by the International Criminal Court (‘ICC’) {{on charges of}} war crimes and crimes against {{humanity}} over the confl ict in the western region of Darfur, Sudan. The following year the ICC charged President Bashir with genocide over events in Darfur, where allegedly more than 300 000 people have died and {{more than two million}} people have been displaced since 2003. Before the ICC can prosecute President Bashir, it has to obtain custody over him. As a judicial institution without power to arrest those it indicts, the Court relies on national authorities. States to which President Bashir has <b>travelled</b> since the <b>warrants</b> for his arrest have been issued have been reluctant to arrest and surrender President Bashir to the ICC justifying their refusal by the head of state immunity argument. By focusing on the specifi c response of the South African government to the ICC’s arrest warrant against President Bashir in June 2015, this article considers the question of whether states must cooperate with the ICC in instances of an arrest warrant against a sitting head of state of a non-state party and observes the broader implications of state responses similar to the South African case.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 Geometric design {{standards}} {{have not been}} developed specifically for low volume roads. Design standards and criteria are extrapolated from higher standard roadways that are often not relevant to low volume roads. Safety is a primary criterion used for selection of {{design standards}} along with economic, financial, social and environment factors. This study attempts to determine trade-offs of various design standards and designs based on safety and economic criteria. It also summarizes existing geometric design standards that are employed by federal, state and county governments. A methodology for selection of design standards for low volume roads employing safety criteria is developed. The study approach is based on data and relationships from previous research. Accident costs cited by National Safety Council are adopted for analysis. Procedures are developed to determine the balance between design standards and accident costs. Ten-foot lane width and two-foot shoulder width {{are found to be}} reasonable for low volume situations. Horizontal and vertical alignments affect safety, vehicle running costs and <b>travel</b> times. Guardrail <b>warrants</b> of low volume roads differ from that of high volume roads. The balance and trade-offs between guardrail installation cost and accident cost expected for a given embankment geometry are evaluated. The balance between a clear zone from the edge of pavement and the accident cost savings has also been developed. It is recommended that a comparison between the accident savings due to roadway improvement and the incremental construction cost must be made to evaluate safety and economy effectively. An approach to evaluate the level of safety relative to design is developed for decision making...|$|R
50|$|Sir Robert {{was one of}} {{the crown}} {{assessors}} for the trial of Lord Balmerino in 1634 and it was afterwards alleged without much foundation that he gave a partial and unfair aspect to the case. His attitude was so distinctly against the covenanters that, in 1638, when episcopacy was abolished by the general assembly, he was forced to flee to England, where he remained until Charles I made his second visit to Scotland. The dominant presbyterian party accused him of fomenting the discord between the king and the people and, when he appeared before the Scottish parliament on 17 August 1641, he was forthwith committed to the castle of Edinburgh. He was specially exempted from the act of oblivion proposed to parliament, but on 10 November, he obtained his liberty on condition that he should appear for trial when called upon. The intention of bringing him and the other 'incendiaries' to trial was at length abandoned, in deference to the king's wish, and Spottiswood returned with Charles I to England. When the Earl of Lanark, secretary of state, was apprehended in December 1643, the king gave the seals of office to Spottiswood at Oxford, and directed him to act as secretary. In this capacity, Spottiswood sealed several commissions, one being a warrant appointing Montrose to be his majesty's lieutenant in Scotland. Sir Robert set out from Oxford with this <b>warrant,</b> <b>travelled</b> through Wales to the Isle of Man, shipped thence to Lochaber, and, meeting Montrose in Athol, gave him the commission.|$|R
5000|$|Mudaliyar is a Tamil title, {{derived from}} the word முதல் - mudhal, meaning [...] "first", and the honorific suffix யார்- yar, meaning [...] "The first" [...] as {{in the person of}} the first rank. The {{position}} was created in the 17th century by the Portuguese to function as a link between the colonial administration and the local populace, as they had done in South India. Incumbents received payment in form of land grants and use of tenured service (Rajakariya) of the local population which they extracted for their own estates. [...] ==De Saram family== A De Saram family of Dutch and Malay ancestry had Sinhalised itself in the late 18th century by posing as the representatives of the masses and subsequently convincing the British rulers that they were from the numerous Govigama caste. This was a strategic move as it gave the British masters the impression that the De Saram family had the backing of a large body of natives. It was also the easiest route to Sinhalisation as the peasant community was widely dispersed, still unstructured and without inter-community networks or leaders. [...] The first notable ancestor of the De Saram family was an interpreter who accompanied the Dutch Embassy to Kandy 1731-1732. Despite his advanced age of 71 years, this early De Saram had to make the entire journey by foot as his social status did not <b>warrant</b> <b>travel</b> in a palanquin. From there, the De Saram family progressively gained power and position by loyalty, switching religions from Dutch Protestantism to British Anglicanism and benefitting from the preference of British rulers to appoint individuals of unknown ancestry to high positions. By respectively collaborating with the Dutch and British rulers, the De Sarams succeeded in marginalizing the traditional ruling class. Governors Maitland (1805-1811), Gordon (1883-1890) and others effectively used divide and rule policies and created caste animosity among the native elite. The De Saram family eventually had a strong and exclusive network of relatives as Mudaliyars by the late 19th century. Later, through marriage alliances the network extended to the Obeyesekere, Dias-Bandaranaike, Ilangakoon, de Alwis, de Livera, Pieris, Siriwardena and Senanayake families.|$|R
