40|$|Whether {{there exist}} {{independent}} transverse electric (TE) and <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> (TM) modes in a metallic waveguide {{filled with an}} anisotropic medium is a fundamental question in electromagnetics waveguide theory, but so far no definitive answers have been published. This paper establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for having independent TE and TM modes in a waveguide filled with a homogeneous lossless anisotropic medium based on both waveguide theory in electromagnetics and basic knowledge in mathematics. Moreover, for the independent TE modes, we prove the propagation constants obtained from both the longitudinal scalar magnetic field stimulation and the transverse vector electric field stimulation are the same; for the independent TM modes, the propagation constants obtained from both the longitudinal scalar electric field stimulation and the <b>transverse</b> <b>vector</b> <b>magnetic</b> field stimulation are the same. This necessary and sufficient condition is a new theoretical result in electromagnetic waveguide theory, {{and is expected to}} be valuable for the design of waveguides filled with anisotropic media...|$|R

Many decades after their original prediction 1, 2, 3 and early observations in acoustic systems 4, such states have been demonstrated recently in photonic structures with engineered geometries 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Here, we put forward a mechanism, based on waveguiding structures that contain anisotropic birefringent materials, that affords the existence of BICs with fundamentally new properties. In particular, anisotropy-induced BICs may exist in symmetric as well as in asymmetric geometries; they may form in tunable angular propagation directions; their polarization may be pure transverse electric, pure <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> or full <b>vector</b> with tunable polarization hybridity; and they may be the only possible bound states of properly designed structures, and thus appear as a discrete, isolated bound state embedded in a whole sea of radiative states.

40|$|Abstract—Electron–positron pair {{production}} in vacuum {{by a single}} focused laser pulse and by two counterpropagating colliding focused pulses is analyzed. A focused laser pulse is described using a realistic threedimensional model based on an exact solution of Maxwell’s equations. In particular, this model reproduces an important property of focused beams, namely, the existence of two types of waves with a <b>transverse</b> electric or <b>magnetic</b> <b>vector</b> (e- or h-polarized wave, respectively). The dependence {{of the number of}} produced pairs on the radiation intensity and focusing parameter is studied. It has been shown that the number of pairs produced in the field of a single e-polarized pulse is many orders of magnitude larger than that for an h-polarized pulse. The pulse-intensity dependence of the number of pairs produced by a single pulse is so sharp that the total energy of pairs produced by the e-polarized pulse with intensity near the intensity IS = 4. 65 × 1029 W/cm 2 characteristic of QED is comparable with the energy of the pulse itself. This circumstance imposes a natural physical bound on the maximum attainable intensity of a laser pulse. For the case of two colliding circularly polarized pulses, it is shown that {{pair production}} becomes experimentally observable when the intensity of each beam is I ~ 1026 W/cm 2, which is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that for a single pulse...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of transverse Neel domain wall in a ferromagnetic nanostrip {{in the presence}} of driving field, current and <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is investigated by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert(LLG) equation with the adiabatic and non-adiabatic spin-transfer torques both analytically and numerically. The analytical expressions for the velocity, width, excitation angle and displacement for the domain wall are obtained by using small angle approximation along with Walkers trial function. The results show that the initial velocity of the domain wall can be controlled by the adiabatic spin-transfer torque and the saturated velocity can be controlled by the non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque and driving field. The large increase in the saturated velocity of the domain wall driven by current and field due to the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> field is identified through the presence of driving field. There is no impact in the saturated velocity of the domain wall driven by current from the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> field. For the domain wall driven by the current {{in the presence of}} the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> field, the saturated velocity remains constant. The <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> field along with current and driving field is more advantageous that the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetic</b> field along with current for increasing the saturated velocity of the domain wall.
