25|$|In 1999, {{former members}} Graham Oliver and Steven Dawson {{registered}} 'Saxon' as a trade mark. They then maintained {{that they had}} exclusive rights to the name and tried to prevent Biff Byford and Saxon's promoters and merchandisers from using the name. Byford applied to <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Registry to have <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> declared invalid. He applied {{on the basis that}} the registration had been obtained in bad faith and that he was entitled to prevent use of <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> by bringing an action for 'passing off', that is an action to stop others misrepresenting themselves as Saxon. In 2003, the High Court declared that it was Byford and the current members of the band who owned the name, and were therefore in a position to prevent Oliver and Dawson passing themselves off as Saxon. After this Oliver and Dawson renamed their band Oliver/Dawson Saxon.|$|E

40|$|At {{the core}} of every {{successful}} business are <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> <b>the</b> business uses to identify its goods or services. If properly protected, <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> can last forever; and can provide the business with a unique and immediately visible identification to its customers and the world beyond. A <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be protected by the law unless it is registered, since registration is considered as a basis of the legal protection. <b>The</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 together with its Rules organize all matters concerning registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> and provide <b>the</b> procedure to be followed in obtaining such registration. This thesis examines <b>the</b> registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in Sudan under <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969. Chapter One highlights {{the historical development of}} <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> laws in <b>the</b> Sudan and discusses the definition of <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> under both <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Ordinance 1931 and <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 and the various functions of <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> <b>The</b> discussion in Chapter Two is mainly about <b>the</b> registrability of <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Chapter Three concentrates on the procedure of registration. Since <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 has adopted the international registration system of <b>trade</b> <b>marks,</b> reference is made in this chapter to the international arrangements concerning this issue namely the Madrid Agreement and the Madrid Protocol. Chapter Four sheds lights on some essential matters concerning registration such as objection, cancellation, assignment and surrender. Lastly Chapter Five concludes the thesis with some recommendations hopefully to be adopted for better protection of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> achieved by registration...|$|R

The resulting bootleg, Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, was released shortly before Christmas 1969, mere weeks after the tour had finished, and in January 1970 received a rave review in Rolling Stone, who described the sound quality as [...] "superb, full of presence, picking up drums, bass, both guitars and the vocals beautifully... it is the ultimate Rolling Stones album".

2500|$|Wikis {{and their}} users {{can be held}} liable for certain {{activities}} that occur on the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that he could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, he may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities. In the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects sites that engage in [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing. However, it has also been argued that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks. When defamation occurs on a wiki, theoretically all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the [...] "publication." [...] It {{remains to be seen whether}} wikis will be regarded as more akin to an internet service provider, which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications' contents, than a publisher. It has been recommended that trademark owners monitor what information is presented about their trademarks on wikis, since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions.

60|$|But an Englishman {{may still}} make himself brave {{when he goes}} forth into the hunting field. Custom there allows him colour, and {{garments}} that fit his limbs. Strength is the outward characteristic of manhood, and at the covert-side he may appear strong. Look at men as they walk along Fleet-street, and ask yourself whether any outward sign of manhood or strength can be seen there. And of gentle manhood outward dignity should be <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> I will not say that such outward dignity is incompatible with a black hat and plaid trousers, for the eye instructed by habit will search out dignity for itself wherever it may truly exist, let it be hidden by what vile covering it may. But any man who can look well at his club, will look better as he clusters round the hounds; while many a one who is comely there, is mean enough as he stands on the hearth-rug before his club fire. In my mind men, like churches and books, and women too, should be brave, not mean, in their outward garniture.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} for the first time, a history of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia. Its {{focus is on the}} latter to middle part of the 19 th century and early into the 20 th century, predating <b>the</b> Commonwealth <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act. This is because it was during this period when the legislative framework for <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> protection was first established under <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime and <b>the</b> most important, characteristic features of modern <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law developed. With a specific focus on this critical period, the legal narrative and this thesis considers the inception of <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime, contextualising its genesis. It also examines the architecture of <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. <b>The</b> final part of the narrative focuses on the operation of <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. <b>The</b> key reason for this particular doctrinal focus is twofold. The primary reason relates to the lack of consideration given to the historical development of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia to date, and in particular, <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. <b>The</b> second ancillary reason relates to the potential importance of this thesis to modern debates about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, which often refer back to and rely upon the assumed traditional principles of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, without any inquiry or deep understanding as to what those traditional foundations actually are, at least from an Australian perspective. In taking a doctrinal and empirical approach, this thesis draws on the relevant legal archive, containing the limited primary and secondary sources available relating to <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. Here, particular attention is paid to <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registers, which have been examined in detail. However, the relevant legal archive also includes <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> statutes, <b>the</b> related Hansard reports, colonial newspapers and the case law reported as arising out of <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. This thesis further draws on the body of 19 th century British (and to a lesser extent American) <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and other treatises as the authoritative legal texts of the time, as well as the statutory protection afforded to <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in <b>the</b> United Kingdom and the extrinsic material concerning early British <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, so far as it relates to <b>the</b> colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime...|$|R

5000|$|The law of {{trademark}} in India before 1940 {{was based}} on the common law principles of passing off and equity as followed in England before the enactment of the first Registration Act, 1875. [...] The first statutory law related to trademark in India was <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act, 1940 which had similar provision like <b>the</b> UK <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act, 1938. In 1958, <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> and Merchandise <b>Marks</b> Act, 1958 was enacted which consolidated the provisions related to trademarks contained in other statutes like, the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Sea Customs Act. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Trade</b> and Merchandise <b>Marks</b> Act, 1958 was repealed by <b>the</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act, 1999 and is the current governing law related to registered trademarks. [...] The 1999 Act was enacted to comply with the provisions of the TRIPS. Though some aspects of <b>the</b> unregistered <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> have been enacted into the 1999 Act, but they are primarily governed by the common law rules based on the principles evolved out of the judgments of the Courts.
