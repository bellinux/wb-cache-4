50|$|The {{paperless}} {{computer system}} has substantially curtailed processing period which has in turn reduced {{cost of doing}} business. This has not only simplified a number of procedures, but also brought transparency (less interaction with the customs staff) and certainly more revenues for the exchequer. Needless to mention that in the redundant system each bill of entry (goods declaration) for imports required 34 signatures & 62 verifications. Furthermore, multiple copies and numerous mandatory documents were required to be attached with the GD. All these documents were carried from desk to desk by the importer. For shipping lines various documents had to be submitted to many customs offices.

40|$|For a small {{open economy}} {{importing}} its capital goods, a tariff increase may cause {{the price of}} machines to rise, leading to lower investment and slower productivity growth. This paper develops a structural dynamic programming model of investment and estimates the model using panel data on Chilean manufacturing plants for 1980 - 1996. The estimates are {{used to examine the}} impact of a <b>temporary</b> increase in <b>import</b> tariffs imposed in Chile taking account of endogenous initial conditions and both observed and unobserved heterogeneity across plants. The model replicates the observed investment patterns at both plant and aggregate levels well. The differences across trade-sectors and across plants differing in their use of imported materials are also well captured by the model. A counterfactual experiment suggests that Chile would have recovered from the economic crisis of 1982 - 1983 at a sub-stantially faster rate had there been no <b>temporary</b> increase in <b>import</b> prices associated with higher tariffs in the mid- 1980 s...|$|R

5000|$|The ATA Carnet is an {{international}} customs document that permits the tax-free and duty-free temporary export and import of goods for up to one year.

Failure to re-export all {{or some of the}} goods listed on the Carnet results in the payment of applicable duties and taxes. Failure to remit those duties results in a claim from the foreign customs service to the importer's home country.

5000|$|In 2008, {{traces of}} dioxine {{were found in}} samples of buffalo milk {{produced}} in Campania. [...] These, together with massive increase of cancers and malformations, were attributed to the illegal practise of burning toxic garbage in the territories of Caserta and Naples provinces controlled by Camorra (the so-called terra dei fuochi), and brought to a <b>temporary</b> <b>import</b> prohibition of mozzarella by some countries. In late 2013, declarations of a Camorra pentito held in 1997 {{in front of a}} parliament commission about the extent of these illegal practises brought to a massive decrease of Campania's Buffalo Mozzarella sales in Italy and abroad, pushing the Italian government to create a land register of polluted agricultural parcels in Campania. Although analyses of Campania's Buffalo Mozzarella held in Germany on behalf of Italian consumer associations in December 2013 found level of dioxine and heavy metals in the examined samples at most five times lower than the allowed maximum, the pollution problem in these zones remains.|$|E
