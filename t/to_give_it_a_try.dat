5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone {{and so is the}} demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
25|$|Kirkwood {{enlisted in}} the Air Force in 1958. The {{following}} year, Kirkwood learned of the Modern Pentathlon and determined <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> He expressed an interest with the Army and was given a tryout at the U.S. Modern Pentathlon Training Center at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas where {{the bulk of the}} U.S. pentathletes were training for the 1960 Summer Olympics. While he wasn't able to make that 1960 team he did attend the games in Rome as a spectator. Kirkwood showed enough promise that the Army allowed him to be permanently assigned to Fort Sam Houston to train for the next Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Harold is aghast, worried if {{the foreign}} police will believe the story {{both he and}} Elsie have to tell and that their 'relationship' is innocent. The {{evidence}} points to manslaughter at best and murder at worst. Mrs Rice suddenly has an idea and wonders if the hotel management and foreign police are open to bribery. Harold agrees <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> and wires for money but aside from that, and unable to speak the local language, leaves Mrs Rice {{to carry out the}} negotiations. All seems to go well and the next day Harold sees Mrs Rice speaking with a police officer and she tells him that the death has been declared as being from natural causes and that they are all in the clear. That is until the two Polish women approach Mrs Rice and speak to her. She translates for Harold and tells him that they know what really happened (their room being next to Elsie's) and that they are blackmailing the English people.|$|E

500|$|The elder Lajoie, {{who worked}} as a {{teamster}} and laborer, died not long into the younger Lajoie's childhood, which forced him and his siblings to work to support the family. Lajoie dropped out of school to work in a textile mill. He also began playing semi-professional baseball for the local Woonsocket team under the alias [...] "Sandy", because his parents did not approve of their son playing baseball. He earned money as a taxi driver with a horse and buggy and locally was called [...] "Slugging Cabby." [...] "When I told my father I had decided to take the job he was very angry. He shouted that ball players were bums and that nobody respected them, but I was determined <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> at least one season", Lajoie later said. He also received the nickname [...] "Larry" [...] from a teammate who had trouble pronouncing Lajoie. Lajoie admired baseball players such as King Kelly and Charles Radbourn.|$|E
500|$|While {{the roles}} of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already {{a part of the}} Tracey Ullman Show cast, the {{producers}} decided to hold casting for {{the roles of}} Bart and Lisa. Nancy Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa, but disliked the character's bland description—Lisa was described simply as the [...] "middle child"—and read for the role of Bart instead. Casting director Bonita Pietila brought Yeardley Smith in for an audition after seeing her performing in the play Living on Salvation Street. Smith was hesitant to audition for an animated series, but her agent had persuaded her <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> Smith originally auditioned for the role of Bart but Pietila believed her voice was too high. Smith later recalled: [...] "I always sounded too much like a girl, I read two lines as Bart and they said, 'Thanks for coming!'" [...] Pietila offered Smith the role of Lisa instead.|$|E
2500|$|Mrs. Garby {{offered to}} take care of the love {{interest}} and the romantic dialogue, and Smith decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> The sources of inspirations for the main characters in the novel were themselves; the [...] "Seatons" [...] and [...] "Cranes" [...] were based on the Smiths and Garbys, respectively. About one-third of The Skylark of Space was completed by the end of 1916, when Smith and Garby gradually abandoned work on it.|$|E

He concluded [...] "when a game comes out for the PC that manages to retain all the simplicity and energy of its console brother, then you owe it yourself <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try.</b> MDK 2 is definitely such a game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Ash, {{his friend}} David J. Haskins, and Haskins' younger brother Kevin, had played {{together}} in various bands since childhood. One of the longer-lived {{of these was}} a band called the Craze, which performed a few times around Northampton in 1978. However, The Craze still split up fairly quickly, and Ash once again tried to convince his old school friend Murphy to join him, simply because Ash thought {{he had the right}} look for a band. Murphy, who was working in a printing factory, decided <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try,</b> despite never having written any lyrics or music. During their first rehearsal, he co-wrote the song [...] "In the Flat Field".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1910, Leninists, {{followers}} of Bogdanov, and various Menshevik factions held {{a meeting of}} the party's Central Committee in Paris and tried to re-unite the party. Kamenev and Zinoviev were dubious about the idea, but were willing <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>try</b> under pressure from [...] "conciliator" [...] Bolsheviks like Victor Nogin. Lenin was adamantly opposed to re-unification, but was outvoted within the Bolshevik leadership. The meeting reached a tentative agreement. As one of its provisions, Trotsky's Vienna-based Pravda was designated as a party-financed 'central organ'. Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to Pravda's editorial board {{as a representative of the}} Bolsheviks in this process. The unification attempts failed in August 1910, when Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations.|$|E
