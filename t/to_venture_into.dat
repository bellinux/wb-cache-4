5|$|In 1824 Mendelssohn studied {{under the}} {{composer}} and piano virtuoso Ignaz Moscheles, who confessed in his diaries {{that he had}} little to teach him. Moscheles became a close colleague and lifelong friend. The year 1827 saw the premiere– and sole performance in his lifetime– of Mendelssohn's opera, Die Hochzeit des Camacho. The failure of this production left him disinclined <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> the genre again.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been trained to detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be trained to respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving through}} the Tongan islands, the {{remnants}} of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 {{people out of the}} water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues had to be made. Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, {{during the}} American {{occupation}} of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel {{were the first}} confirmed to have reached the summit Pico de Orizaba, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set {{what may have been}} a 50-year American alpine altitude record. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first government-sponsored expedition <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> the upper Yellowstone region that was later to become Yellowstone National Park. Heavy winter snowpack in the Absaroka Range of Wyoming prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau, forcing them to divert to the south and cross Union Pass at the northern end of the Wind River Range. After negotiating the pass the expedition entered Jackson Hole and surveyed the Teton Range, now within Grand Teton National Park.|$|E
5|$|Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American {{singer and}} songwriter. After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued {{a career in}} gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and {{released}} her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.|$|E
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E

25|$|In 1682 La Salle was {{the first}} French {{explorer}} <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> the southeast along the Mississippi River. His expedition did not meet with the Choctaw; it established a post along the Arkansas River. The post signaled to the English that the French were serious at colonization in the South. The Choctaw allied with French colonists as a defense against the English, who had been taking Choctaws as captives for the Indian slave trade.|$|E

25|$|The first {{non-native}} people <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> what {{is today}} considered the Kings Canyon backcountry or high country were likely John C. Fremont's party in 1844, which attempted {{to cross the}} Sierra Nevada {{by way of the}} Kings River. However, a snowstorm impeded their progress and they were forced to retreat to the Central Valley. In 1858, the J.H. Johnson party successfully crossed the Sierra via the route Fremont had intended to find, via Kearsarge Pass at the far eastern end of Kings Canyon.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the loss}} of habitat, more and more species of fauna have started <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> human {{habitation}} causing a conflict between humans and fauna. A typical species affected by this is the elephant which ventures out of the forest into human cultivations thereby eating or destroying the crops. In some cases, the elephants have also caused human deaths like an incident that happened in Hassan district where a villager was trampled to death. Precautionary measures (sometimes illegally) taken up by humans to prevent such mishaps like electric fencing have also led to disastrous consequences like electrocution of fauna.|$|E
25|$|During Kenneth Williams' second {{appearance}} in 1973, the talk turned to politics, {{and particularly the}} Carry On star's trenchant views against trade unions. Williams accepted an invitation to return three weeks later and discuss these with trade unionist Jimmy Reid. The abrasive nature of their debate turned an entertainment show into something more akin to a serious current affairs programme, and the then Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, directed that the programme was not <b>to</b> <b>venture</b> <b>into</b> that sort of territory again. However, Williams {{would become one of}} Parkinson's most celebrated guests, making a total of eight appearances over the years.|$|E
