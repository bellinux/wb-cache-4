5|$|Some {{species of}} anurans {{hybridize}} readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids.

5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – one small and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E

In addition, children of white-collar professionals were more likely than not to remain in that class.|$|E

Experimental studies also suggest that the nitrosterols are less likely to cause the side effects associated with glucocorticoids. Thus, to date, the nitrosterols do seem to be a step forward and from the steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. However, given that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of NO may be pro-inflammatory, further long-term studies are needed to determine whether the increased anti-inflammatory effects observed with short-term treatment with nitrosterols are maintained...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates whether foreign {{subsidiaries}} outperform <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> {{banks in}} terms of profitability and what determines this outcome. Using a large sample of multinational banks and their subsidiaries in {{a large number of}} countries, this study shows that, on average, foreign subsidiaries are less profitable <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> banks are. At the same time, however, foreign subsidiaries have higher net interest margins but also higher overhead costs relative to <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> banks. One explanation for the results is that parent banks transfer income banks using overhead costs, what may explain the existing results. Moreover, the results show that foreign subsidiaries tend to perform better <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> banks if the latter are underperforming in the home market. Finally, the results show that the determinants of the profitability of the subsidiary in relation to its parent bank are strongly determined by the origins of the parent bank and, to a lesser extent, by the host market’s characteristics as well as the distance to the home country of the multinational bank. international banking, foreign banks, subsidiary, performance...|$|R

2500|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) is commonplace in Somalia (typically {{in the form}} of infibulation) but is illegal in the UK. UNICEF estimates that 98 per cent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 in Somalia have experienced FGM. Three doctors working at Northwick Park Hospital in London, where a significant proportion of African women giving birth were Somali, warned in 1995 that due to growing Somali and Sudanese migrant populations, [...] "the problem of caring for infibulated women will be faced by most midwives and obstetricians at some stage". Also in 1995, Black and Debelle noted in the British Medical Journal [...] "evidence that the operation is being performed illegally in Britain...by medically qualified or unqualified practitioners and that children are being sent abroad for a 'holiday' to have it done". This latter practice continues, with children regularly taken to Somalia or Kenya in the school summer holidays for FGM to be undertaken. Estimates published in July 2014 suggest {{that the vast majority of}} Somali-born women in Britain have undergone FGM. The report, by Alison Macfarlane and Efua Dorkenoo, notes that some members of migrant groups continue to support FGM once in the UK, although younger generations are most likely to be opposed to it. A study published in 2004, based on research with a sample of young Somalis in London, found that 70 per cent of the females reported having been circumcised, two-third of these by infibulation. Of those who were already living in Britain before the usual age of FGM being performed, only 42 per cent had undergone the practice, whereas amongst those who moved to the UK after this age, the proportion was 91 per cent. The study also found that these younger people reported having less traditional views on FGM <b>than</b> <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> 18 per cent of the female respondents and 43 of the males said that they intended to circumcise any daughters that they had. Some Somali women in the UK, particularly of younger generations, have spoken out publicly and campaigned against the practice.|$|E
