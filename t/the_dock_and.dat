5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{served the}} mines well for almost 30 years, but <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> river were {{affected}} by silting. A new channel across the sands was created in 1797, but this too was affected by silting, and by 1809 navigation to Kymer's dock was becoming dangerous.|$|E

5|$|Portishead has a {{long history}} as a fishing port. As a Royal Manor it {{expanded}} rapidly during the early 19thcentury around the docks, with supporting transport infrastructure.

Portishead was also the telephone control centre used by British Telecom (BT) for non-direct dialled calls to maritime vessels, a service known as Portishead Radio.|$|E
5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable boats to reach tidal water by passing through <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> <b>and</b> a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal boats to enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side.|$|E
5|$|The Italians {{took control}} of the wreck, but they found her a total loss, and so began to {{dismantle}} Dunkerque. As part of this process, the ship was deliberately damaged to prevent the French from being able to repair her if she was recaptured; the Italians cut down the main battery guns to render them unusable. The partially scrapped hulk was in turn seized by the Germans when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943. In 1944, the Germans removed the ship's bow to float her out of the drydock to free up <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> continue the scrapping process. While in Axis possession, she was bombed several times by Allied aircraft. The hulk was condemned on 15 September 1955 and renamed Q56. Her remains, which amounted to not more than , were sold for final demolition on 30 September 1958 for 226,117,000 francs.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped under the door, requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings the groceries to <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> leaves them at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the blame. The two officers then get a call about the missing delivery boy and head to the dock to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus, {{named after}} the Greek hero Euryalus, was laid down on 18 July 1899 by Vickers, Sons & Maxim at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. She was {{launched}} 20 May 1901 in front of 30,000 spectators, and christened by Mrs. Douglas Vickers, wife {{of one of the}} directors of the company. On 11 June 1901, {{the south side of the}} Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire, and was practically destroyed before the flames could be extinguished. The recently launched Euryalus was laying alongside this wharf, and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser. Considerable damage was done to the ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of <b>the</b> <b>dock,</b> <b>and</b> her completion was severely delayed. Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs, the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged. While on sea trials, she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport. Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904, nearly two years after her sister ships.|$|E
5|$|In the 1790s, Boucherett {{began to}} rise through Lincolnshire's civic and mercantile circles, {{especially}} {{in the north of}} the County, where the family had their seat; his connexions helped him to become involved with a group of businessmen planning to reopen and expand Grimsby's harbour. His rise is charted in his appointments to several civic posts: to be High Steward of Grimsby from 1794 (he remained as such until his death), succeeding Christopher Clayton, and to be High Sheriff of Lincolnshire for 1795–6. As these plans for the harbour came to fruition, he was appointed chairman of the company tasked with performing the required work; it was the Grimsby Haven Company, which was created by an Act of Parliament in 1796 (36 Geo III, chap. 98) {{for the express purpose of}} building <b>the</b> <b>dock</b> <b>and</b> repairing the Haven. He secured the friendship and patronage of Charles Anderson Pelham, 1st Baron Yarborough, a prominent local land-owner involved in the Haven Company, and was returned as the Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby in 1796 owing to this friendship.|$|E
