2500|$|People with losses {{or other}} trauma, such as sexual abuse in {{childhood}} and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment and <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the following statements: [...] "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I {{find it difficult to}} trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|Securely {{attached}} people <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{the following}} statements: [...] "It {{is relatively easy}} for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me." [...] This style of attachment usually results from a history of warm and responsive interactions with their attachments. Securely attached people tend to have positive views of themselves and their attachments. They also tend to have positive views of their relationships. Often they report greater satisfaction and adjustment in their relationships than people with other attachment styles. Securely attached people feel comfortable both with intimacy and with independence.|$|E
2500|$|People with a dismissive {{style of}} avoidant {{attachment}} <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> these statements: [...] "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", [...] "It is [...] {{important to me}} to feel independent and self-sufficient", and [...] "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." [...] People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the defensive character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive–avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with rejection by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments).|$|E

One of {{the characters}} {{with a sense of}} reason, she often disagrees with and mocks her parents' political stances, about which she is usually better-informed. She serves as the show's chief foil by poking holes in Gerald's and Helen's world view.

2500|$|People with anxious-preoccupied {{attachment}} type <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{the following}} statements: [...] "I {{want to be}} completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and [...] "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value {{me as much as}} I value them." [...] People with this style of attachment seek high levels of intimacy, approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy {{to such an extent that}} they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared to securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often doubt their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, emotional dysregulation (ED), worry, and impulsiveness in their relationships.|$|E

50|$|This {{assumption}} {{proposes that}} in order to avoid becoming isolated and in order not to lose popularity and esteem, people constantly observe their environment very closely. They try to find out which opinions and modes of behaviour are prevalent, and which opinions and modes of behaviour are becoming more popular. They behave and express themselves accordingly in public. Then, they try to determine whether they are in the majority: whether the public opinion <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> them. If they feel they are in the minority, they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> remain silent.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{spatial competition}} when consumers are arbitrarily distributed on a compact metric space. Retailers can {{choose one of}} finitely many locations in this space. We focus on symmetric mixed equilibria which exist {{for any number of}} retailers. We prove that the distribution of retailers <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the distribution of the consumers when the number of competitors is large enough. The results are shown to be robust to the introduction of (i) randomness in the number of retailers and (ii) different ability of the retailers to attract consumers...|$|R
5000|$|This type of {{inversion}} {{occurs with}} a finite {{form of the}} copula be. Since English predominantly has SV order, it will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> view as the subject whichever noun phrase immediately precedes the finite verb. Thus in the second b-sentence, A concern is taken as the subject, and the objection as the predicate. But if one acknowledges that copular inversion has occurred, one can argue that the objection [...] is the subject, and A concern the predicate. This confusion has led to focused study {{of these types of}} copular clauses. Where there is a difference in number, the verb <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the noun phrase that precedes it: ...|$|R

It <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the radical wing of the Unidad Popular (the leftist majority of the Socialist Party and parts of the MAPU). After the 1973 coup, the party members were subject to arrest and torture, like people from other leftist groups. The party's militants continued operating together with and within left-wing groups. After democracy was restored in Chile in 1990, most of the militants joined the Socialist Party while others continued as the Christian Left party.|$|R
50|$|Antun's only foreign {{language}} was French and {{his experience in}} French was limited to 18th- and 19th-century literature. When reading French critique of Islam, he <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> their criticisms. He was largely affected by French intellectuals and philosophers of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Voltaire. He was also interested in French Romantics {{as well as the}} rationalist traditions of men like Auguste Comte, Ernest Renan and Jules Simon. From each, Antun took specific things and often inserted them into Al-Jami'ah.These ranged from the skeptical attitude of religious institutions of Renan to the ideas of the emancipation of women and educational reforms of Simon.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} {{between science and}} religion {{has been marked by}} historically constructed movements of proximity and conflict. We have investigated how high school biology teachers from three countries with different relationships between State and religion, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, conceive the science-religion relationship. Uruguay has consolidated secularism, Argentina has an official religion and Brazil calls itself secular, but its secularism is only relative. Fifty high school biology teachers from each country answered the European BIOHEAD-CITIZEN data collection questionnaire, which investigates teachers’ conceptions of biological evolution, health, sexuality, and other topics. The question used was “Should science and religion be separate?” Conflict, independence, dialogue and integration categories were considered in the analysis and the results were submitted to parametric testing. Most Uruguayan high school biology teachers <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the investigated question, with a lower ratio in Brazil, followed by Argentina. Uruguayan teachers <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be more assertive in their agreement. The main category was partially confirmed as teachers from Uruguay, the country with a greater secular tradition, <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the separation between science and religion. In Brazil and Argentina, the category was not confirmed. In Brazil, a self-proclaimed secular country, high school biology teachers were more opposed to the separation between science and religion, while in Argentina, a country with an official religion, they supported the possibility of dialogue and integration between them. We concluded that the respondents felt that science and religion should be separate, but trends varied according to the historical and cultural religiosity features of the selected countries, with a partial influence of secularism on the responses...|$|R

50|$|Maps {{prior to}} 1927 wildly {{disagreed}} {{on the actual}} position of the border, instead of agreeing upon marking the area as being disputed. Maps after 1927 <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the decision, but due to protests, some mapmakers in Quebec still disagreed. In the 60's, logos of the two biggest political parties of Quebec (PLQ & UN) both included {{the shape of the}} province as including all of Labrador. Disagreements persist even today (to a lesser extent), as Quebec insists on including the rest of the gulf's basin in its maps, separated with a dotted line saying 1927 border, non-final. Newfoundland complains in 2014, even though older electoral maps showed the same.|$|R
50|$|Newberg’s {{research}} has been criticized from two main perspectives. From the religious perspective, concerns have been raised {{that the study of}} practices such as meditation does not necessarily extrapolate to the broader array of religious and spiritual phenomena. However, Newberg <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> this concern and has argued that future studies are needed to elucidate the more complex elements of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg has maintained that science and brain imaging studies are only tools to evaluate the brain during such experiences but do not necessarily negate such experiences. Newberg has argued that the integration of science and religion is critical for {{a better understanding of how}} human beings think and behave in a global context.|$|R
2500|$|From the start, Coleman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the war in Iraq. In 2008, he was still a supporter of the war, and generally <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the positions of the Bush Administration on Iraq. He was in favor of the eventual removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, but did not believe in any kind of timetable for the removal of troops until the situation in Iraq became more stable. A Minneapolis Post article in August 2008 summarized his position as: [...] "He believes the prospects are good for a drawdown of U.S. troops, but it must be done based on conditions on the ground as reported by commanders in the field, not according to an 'arbitrary' timetable set for 'political' reasons in Washington." ...|$|R
5000|$|Anxious-preoccupied {{people tend}} to view {{themselves}} less positively than they view others.

5000|$|The Rockefeller-Wilson ticket {{defeated}} the incumbent Democrat W. Averell Harriman. After Wilson's election as Lieutenant Governor, {{he would go}} on to serve in that position for nearly 15 years. The Rockefeller-Wilson ticket was re-elected in 1962, 1966 and 1970. Throughout his tenure, he <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Rockefeller's liberal republicanism, with the notable exception of abortion, the legalization of which Wilson opposed. Wilson defined himself as [...] "an economic conservative and a human-rights liberal". During this time, another liberal Republican, Louis Lefkowitz, served as Attorney General.While governor, Malcolm Wilson greatly improved passenger rail service in New York State. Under his leadership, N.Y.C. -Albany-Montréal service and direct N.Y.C.-Buffalo-Detroit was revived; the latter service dropped under Democratic leadership as these are/were state supported passenger trains.|$|R

Tamura doesn't meet Seiwa's family until seven years in their relationship when both of them are 23 and already living together. Seiwa has been avoiding letting Tamura meet his family, not because he's afraid or even worried about revealing his sexuality to his family, but because he knows Tamura is a good catch and that his mother and sisters are huge flirts. Seiwa often doesn't feel like he deserves such a great guy like Tamura since he considers himself pretty stupid at times, and his family <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him. By this time in the story, Seiwa is employed in restaurant services and is a chef apprentice.|$|R
