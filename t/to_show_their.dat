5|$|At many of {{the early}} crucial battles of the Pacific, for {{instance}} Coral Sea and Midway, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>their</b> potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in Japanese pre-war planning.|$|E

E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go to bottom, etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May 1898 the Tower Theatre was opened, sited {{between the}} legs of the tower. Capable of {{accommodating}} an audience of 2,500, it was the largest theatre in England outside London.

Wrestling was hosted at the theatre as early as 1903, and had become a weekly event by 1937.
