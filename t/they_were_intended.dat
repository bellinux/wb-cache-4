5|$|The Imperator Aleksandr II-class battleships {{were two}} battleships {{built for the}} Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to counter the small armored ships of the other Baltic powers. Construction was very {{prolonged}} and the ships were virtually obsolescent when completed. They were optimized for ramming.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{paintings}} on {{the north and south}} walls depicting the Camoys family. Camoys was the lord of the manor and it appears he had the church built primarily for his family. This would explain the unusual detail in the paintings. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> as rich decoration rather than simply for educating an illiterate congregation.|$|E
5|$|In March 1862, a {{contract}} was placed with Laird & Son Co. by Captain James D. Bulloch, a naval {{agent for the}} Confederate States of America, for two double-turreted warships designed for ramming attacks {{at a cost of}} £93,750 each, exclusive of armament and ammunition. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended,</b> together with other warships, to break the Federal blockade of Confederate coastal cities and to hold some Northern cities for ransom.|$|E

5|$|The Kaiserliche Marine, {{the navy}} of the German Empire, built {{a series of}} battlecruisers {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. The battlecruiser type was an {{outgrowth}} of older armored cruiser designs; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to scout for the main battle fleet and attack the reconnaissance forces of opposing fleets. Kaiser Wilhelm II insisted that the new battlecruisers be able to fight in the line of battle with battleships to counter Germany's numerical inferiority.|$|E
5|$|The Nino Bixio {{class was}} a pair of {{protected}} cruisers built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1910s. The two ships, , and , were built in Castellammare between 1911 and 1914. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to serve as scouts for the main Italian fleet, and as such required a high top speed. They were overweight as built, which prevented them from reaching their intended maximum speed. They were a disappointment in service, especially compared to the earlierand fastercruiser , which cut their careers short.|$|E
5|$|The O-class battlecruisers were {{designed}} in 1937 {{to supplement the}} s then planned for the new German fleet. The three ships were armed with six 38cm guns in three twin turrets, similar to {{the arrangement of the}} main battery of the s. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> for use as long-range commerce raiders, with the goal of forcing Great Britain to disperse its battleships as convoy escorts. The ships were never laid down due to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939.|$|E

5|$|The SR class LN or Lord Nelson {{class is}} a type of 4-cylinder 4-6-0 steam {{locomotive}} designed for the Southern Railway by Richard Maunsell in 1926. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> for Continental boat trains between London (Victoria) and Dover harbour, but were also later used for express passenger work to the South-West of England. Sixteen of them were constructed, representing the most powerful (although not the most successful) Southern 4-6-0 design. They were all named after famous admirals.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> {{to carry}} a number of boats aboard, {{including}} two picket boats, two barges, two launches, two pinnaces, two yawls, and two dinghies. The ships were also to be equipped with a double catapult mounted between the two funnels, and four Arado Ar 196 seaplanes for maritime reconnaissance. The aircraft were stored in a main hangar just aft of the forward funnel, along with two smaller hangars, {{one on each side}} of the rear funnel.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on {{the similarity}} of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> as wings of a five-part polyptych altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 Altar of Holy Sacrament, whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment, he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right-hand wing, above the Adoration.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Braathens SAFE {{placed an}} order for three Boeing 737-200s, costing a total ofNOK100 million. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to do the main haul of the charter market. There had been an {{internal}} struggle {{as to whether the}} company should purchase the Fokker F-28 Fellowship or the Boeing 737-100, a shorter version of the 737-200. Having a single plane type would give a single pool of pilot and mechanic certifications, and would have saved the company NOK millions in costs. Following the decision to purchase the F-28, Bjørn G. Braathen, son of Ludvig G. and later CEO, left the company.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
5|$|Locomotive tenders {{were also}} changed as new, {{improved}} designs became available. Some {{examples of the}} second batch (70025–70029) were equipped with the BR1A tender, which had a higher water capacity of 5,000 gallons. Members of the third batch (70045–70054) were equipped with another tender design, the BR1D, which had 9 tons of coal and 4,750 gallons of water, {{due to the fact}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> for use on longer runs in the north of the railway network. This tender design also featured a steam-powered coal pusher, which eliminated the need for crew members to mount the tender to pull forward coal when the locomotive was at a stop.|$|E
5|$|The Palatine Gallery, {{the main}} gallery of Palazzo Pitti, {{contains}} a large ensemble of over 500 principally Renaissance paintings, which were {{once part of}} the Medicis' and their successors' private art collection. The gallery, which overflows into the royal apartments, contains works by Raphael, Titian, Perugino (Lamentation over the Dead Christ), Correggio, Peter Paul Rubens, and Pietro da Cortona. The character of the gallery is still that of a private collection, and the works of art are displayed and hung much {{as they would have}} been in the grand rooms for which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> rather than following a chronological sequence, or arranged according to school of art.|$|E

The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of confarreatio originated in the sharing of a cake.|$|R
5|$|The battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a type {{of capital}} ship {{of the first half}} of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and {{armament}} to battleships, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} for Rhein and Mosel was to {{use them}} to defend the railway bridges on the Rhine {{in the event of a}} French war of revenge after the Franco-Prussian War in 18701871. The ships were both built at the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen, under construction numbers 23 and 24, respectively. The Rhine Railway Company was compelled to contribute 300,000 Thalers to the construction of the ships, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to defend the railway bridges the company used at Rheinhausen. Both ships were laid down in 1872 and launched later that year; they were both commissioned into the Imperial Navy on 25 April 1874. They spent the first year of their career at Rheinhausen, until 7 April 1875, when they were transferred to the defenses of Coblenz.|$|E
5|$|The murder notes {{had been}} {{analyzed}} before at the extraordinary motion hearing. Handwriting expert Albert S. Osborn reviewed the previous {{evidence at the}} commutation hearing and commented, for the first time, that the notes were written {{in the third person}} rather than the first person. He said that the first person would have been more logical since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>intended</b> to be the final statements of a dying Phagan. He argued this was the type of error that Conley would have made, rather than Frank, as Conley was a sweeper and not a Cornell-educated manager like Frank.|$|E
50|$|While {{it is not}} a {{controlled}} substance under federal law in the United States, some states have considered it individually. Louisiana State Act 159 specifies that it is illegal to possess 40 or more plants if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> for consumption, but not if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>intended</b> for ornamental or landscaping use. Tennessee proposed {{a bill that would have}} made illegal this and many other plants classified as hallucinogenic, but when the bill was passed only Salvia divinorum was banned.|$|R
