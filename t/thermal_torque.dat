40|$|Thermally-driven spin-transfer torques have {{recently}} been reported in electrically insulating ferromagnet$|$normal-metal heterostructures. In this paper, we propose two physically distinct mechanisms for such torques. The first is a local effect: out-of-equilibrium, thermally-activated magnons in the ferromagnet, driven by a spin Seebeck effect, exert a torque on the magnetization via magnon-magnon scattering with coherent dynamics. The second is a nonlocal effect which requires an additional magnetic layer to provide the symmetry breaking necessary to realize a <b>thermal</b> <b>torque.</b> The simplest structure in which to induce a nonlocal <b>thermal</b> <b>torque</b> is a spin valve composed of two insulating magnets separated by a normal metal spacer; there, a thermal flux generates a pure spin current through the spin valve, which results in a torque when the magnetizations of the layers are misaligned.

40|$|Heat {{assisted}} {{magnetic recording}} (HAMR) {{is a new}} technology which uses temporary near field laser heating of the media during write to increase hard disk drive storage density. By using plasmonic antenna embedded in the write head, extremely high thermal gradient are created in the recording media (up to 10 K/nm). State of the art HAMR media consists of grains of FePtX ordered alloys exhibiting high perpendicular anisotropy separated by insulating grain boundaries. Nearby the plasmonic antenna, the difference of temperature between two 8 nm wide neighboring grains in the media can reach 80 K, representing a gigantic thermal gradient of ~ 40 K/nm across the grain boundary. Such situations with much weaker thermal gradient (~ 1 K/nm, already considered as very large) have already been studied {{in the field of}} spincaloritronics. There, it was shown that very large spin transfer <b>torques</b> due to <b>thermal</b> gradients can arise in magnetic tunnel junctions which can even yield magnetization switching. Considering that two neighboring grains separated by an insulating grain boundary in a HAMR media {{can be viewed as a}} magnetic tunnel junction and that the thermal gradients in HAMR are one to two orders of magnitude larger than those existing in conventional spincaloritronics, one may expect a major impact from these <b>thermal</b> <b>torques</b> on magnetization switching dynamics and therefore on HAMR recording performances. This paper combines theory, experiments aiming at determining the polarization of tunneling electrons across the media grain boundaries, and micromagnetic simulations of recording process.

40|$|Using linear {{perturbation}} theory, {{we investigate}} the torque exerted on a low-mass planet {{embedded in a}} gaseous protoplanetary disc with finite thermal diffusivity. When the planet does not release energy into the ambient disc, {{the main effect of}} thermal diffusion is the softening of the enthalpy peak near the planet, which results in the appearance of two cold and dense lobes {{on either side of the}} orbit, of size smaller than the thickness of the disc. The lobes exert torques of opposite sign on the planet, each comparable in magnitude to the one-sided Lindblad torque. When the planet is offset from corotation, the lobes are asymmetric and the planet experiences a net torque, the `cold' <b>thermal</b> <b>torque,</b> which has a magnitude that depends on the relative value of the distance to corotation to the size of the lobes ∼√(χ/Ω_p), χ being the thermal diffusivity and Ω_p the orbital frequency. We believe that this effect corresponds to the phenomenon named `cold finger' recently reported in numerical simulations, and we argue that it constitutes the dominant mode of migration of sub-Earth-mass objects. When the planet is luminous, the heat released into the ambient disc results in an additional disturbance that takes the form of hot, low-density lobes. They give a torque, named heating torque in previous work, that has an expression similar, but of opposite sign, to the cold <b>thermal</b> <b>torque.</b> Comment: In press, updated to match MNRAS corrected proof...|$|E

40|$|The {{predicted}} {{orientation of}} Venus' rotation axis relative to its orbit ran be uniquely determined given knowledge of its J 2 gravity coefficient and polar {{moment of inertia}} C if its free obliquity is fully damped. This assumption seems warranted given the dominant damping mechanism: turbulent fluid friction at a core mantle boundary (CMB). This skin friction results from differential obliquity of mantle and core spin axes, and the associated damping rate could be as short as 1 / 10 (exp 6) year. However, the observed pole orientation indicates a free obliquity amplitude epsilon approx. = 2. 1 deg compared with a nominal forced amplitude of 0. 5 deg. There are two plausible explanations. The most likely is that the observed obliquity is a tidally evolved end state in which core friction, modulated by CMB ellipticity and core obliquity amplitude, counterbalances solid and atmospheric tidal torques. This concept is similar to the explanation for the retrograde spin omega as an end state in which solid and atmospheric thermal tidal torques balance at the present spin rate because of the omega(sup - 1) dependence of the axial <b>thermal</b> <b>torque.</b> Weaker effects such as solid and thermal tides can then compete with core friction and for plausible models, their sum tends to increase free obliquity.

The twice per orbit impulsive disturbance torque is attributed to vehicle passage {{in and out of the}} Earth's shadow cone (umbra), during which large flexible appendages undergo rapidly changing thermal conditions. Flexible members, in particular solar arrays, experience rapid cooling during umbra entrance (Sunset) and rapid heating during exit (Sunrise). The thermal 'snap' phenomena has been observed during normal on-orbit operations of both the LANDSAT- 4 satellite and the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS).

40|$|The most {{striking}} feature of Venus rotational state is its slow retrograde rotation which is apparently maintained by {{a balance between}} solid tidal friction and <b>thermal</b> tidal <b>torques.</b> Solid tides tend to drive the spin toward synchronous rotation while thermal tides drive it away. A balance is achieved at a specific rate because of the inverse frequency dependence of the thermal tide to the semi-diurnal heating. Atmospheric models have been constructed to estimate the <b>thermal</b> tidal <b>torque</b> based on ground heating. The solid friction dissipation factor Q approximately equal to 50 can be deduced assuming rotation has achieved steady state. The most perplexing feature of Venus orientation is its non-zero free obliquity epsilon approximately equal to 1. 5 deg relative to its orbit. Although solid tides and perhaps atmospheric tides tend to increase the free obliquity on a time 1 /K(sub t) approximately equal to 1 x 10 (exp 8) yr, viscous friction (CMF) at a core-mantle boundary (CMB) resulting from the differential angular orientation Delta-epsilon of the core and mantle spin axes should have damped the free obliquity on a time scale as short as 10 (exp 6) yr. One means of achieving a balance similar to that controlling rotation is to introduce a comparatively large CMB ellipticity e(sub c) to reduce Delta-epsilon such {{that there is a}} balance between solid-thermal tides and CMF.
