5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these <b>two</b> <b>species</b> are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Horner {{differentiated}} the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> by {{details of}} the crest. He interpreted P. blackfeetensis as having a steeper, taller face than P. maximus, with the crest migrating backward toward the eyes during growth.

5|$|In western Madagascar, {{sympatric}} ring-tailed lemurs and red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) {{have been}} studied together. Little interaction takes place between the <b>two</b> <b>species.</b> While the diets of the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> overlap, they eat in different proportions since the ring-tailed lemur has a more varied diet and spends {{more time on the}} ground.|$|E
40|$|The diffuse {{coevolution}} between <b>two</b> moth <b>species</b> (Epicephala lativalvaris and E. mirivalvata) and <b>two</b> plant <b>species</b> (Breynia fruticosa and B. rostrata) {{is reported}} based on field observations and indoor experiments conducted in Hainan and Fujian, China. Study {{results showed that}} the <b>two</b> Epicephala <b>species</b> jointly pollinated the <b>two</b> Breynia <b>species,</b> which led to a unique obligate pollination mutualism of two-to-two species specificity. A single Epicephala larva exclusively fed on seeds of host plants and developed to maturity by consuming all six seeds of each fruit, whereas a fraction of intact fruits were left to ensure the reproduction of plants within the whole population. Larvae of the <b>two</b> Epicephala <b>species</b> are competitive for resources; the population of E. mirivalvata is much smaller than that of E. lativalvaris, which has resulted from the differences in the female ovipositor structures and oviposition mode. The life history of Epicephala species highly coincides with the phenology of Breynia plants, and different phenology of B. fruticosa resulted in the different life history of the <b>two</b> Epicephala <b>species</b> in Hainan and Fujian. The natural hybridization of two host plants, possibly induced by the alternate pollination of <b>two</b> Epicephala <b>species,</b> is briefly discussed...|$|R

5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living forms, as well as elephant birds and Malagasy hippopotamuses, among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and mongooses found in the same areas, suggesting that the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> may have been able to occur together.|$|E

5|$|H.non-scripta {{differs from}} H.hispanica, which occurs as an {{introduced}} {{species in the}} British Isles, {{in a number of}} ways. H.hispanica has paler flowers which are borne in radially symmetrical racemes; their tepals are less recurved, and are only faintly scented. The outer stamens are fused with the tepals for less than 75% of their length, and the anthers are the same colour as the tepals. These <b>two</b> <b>species</b> are thought to have diverged 8000 years ago. The <b>two</b> <b>species</b> hybridise readily to produce fertile offspring known as Hyacinthoides Ã— massartiana; the hybrids are intermediate between the parental species, forming a spectrum of variation which connects the two.|$|E
5|$|Information {{concerning}} the soft anatomy of Amphidromus is widely scattered and fragmentary.

Unfortunately, although {{it is clear that}} anatomical differences exist in the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> Jacobi dissected, unfortunately we do not know which forms he worked on, because he had incorrectly identified his material. In his paper he referred to the <b>two</b> <b>species</b> as Amphidromus chloris and the interruptus phase of A. perversus.

5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from <b>two</b> <b>species,</b> normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the <b>two</b> <b>species.</b> For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, and mules or hinnies have 63 chromosomes. Mules, hinnies, and other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|E
5|$|Leopoldii hybrids {{arose from}} the work of the British {{explorer}} and botanist Richard Pearce, an employee of James Veitch & Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of Hippeastrum leopoldii and Hippeastrum pardinum from the Andes. These <b>two</b> <b>species</b> were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical. Crossing these <b>two</b> <b>species</b> with the best of the Reginae strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape. The Veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of Hippeastrum leopoldii and other varieties up to {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development.|$|E
