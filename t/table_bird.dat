60|$|When I was in {{the young}} barbarian stage, and my playmates were gaucho boys on horseback on the pampas, they taught me to catch {{partridges}} in their simple way with a slender cane twenty to twenty-five feet long, a running noose at its tip made from the fine pliant shaft of a rhea's wing feather. The bird was not a real partridge though it looks like it, but was the common or spotted tinamou of the plains, Nothura maculosa, as good a <b>table</b> <b>bird</b> as our partridge. Our method was, when we flushed a bird, to follow its swift straight flight at a gallop, and mark the exact spot where it dropped to earth and vanished in the grass, then to go round the spot examining the ground until the tinamou was detected {{in spite of his}} protective colouring sitting close among the dead and fading grass and herbage. The cane was put out, the circle narrowed until the small noose was exactly over the bird's head, so that when he sprang into the air on being touched by the slender tip of the cane he caught and strangled himself. To make the bird sit tight until the noose was actually over his head, we practised various tricks, and a very common one was, on catching sight of the close-squatting partridge, to start plucking feathers from a previously-killed bird hanging to our belt and scatter them on the wind. Sometimes we were saved the trouble of scattering feathers when we were followed by a pair of big carrion hawks on the look-out for an escaped bird or for any trifle we throw to them to keep them with us. The effect was the same in both cases; the sight of the flying feathers was just as terrifying as that of the big hovering hawks, and caused the partridge to sit close.|$|E
6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the blue-winged teal, a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the ringed teal, with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the Brazilian teal, a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a shoveller duck, with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the upland geese from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or Coscoroba Swan, as good a <b>table</b> <b>bird</b> as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|E

They have rose-type combs and white earlobes. Their plumage is a mahogany hue with darker lacing around the edges. It is a hardy bird that does well in free range conditions as a <b>table</b> <b>bird</b> and a layer of white eggs. In the 21st century, the Old English Pheasant Fowl is extremely rare.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on a commercial organic <b>table</b> <b>bird</b> enterprise to investigate the impact of feeding a one hundred per cent organic feed ration to organic table birds. Performance of birds on the one hundred per cent diet was compared with that on a commercially available eighty per cent organic feed ration (and after a change in regulation an eighty-five per cent organic ration). In {{the first section of}} the trial the performance of two different bird strains (ISA 257 and colourpac) was investigated during the summer season, and in the second section the per-formance of a ISA 257 strain was investigated during the winter season. Agronomic and welfare factors as well as production traits were considered. The first section of the trial revealed no overall health, growth or welfare concerns or increases in production costs when comparing the two rations. Some minor differ-ences were identified between the two strains of bird. The second section of the investigation is still on going, but there are early indications of a increase in cost and larger differential in performance for birds on the one hundred per cent ration, when compared to the spring/summer trial...|$|E
40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. The aim of this project was to examine how rotations incorporating organic poultry use the cycling of nutrients between soil, crops and birds. Poultry studies have measured nutrient values of manure in slow growing meat birds at about day 81 when fed typical broiler rations versus “Label Rouge” rations. Nutrient (N, P, K) balances were constructed to assess the viability of integrating poultry production within a theoretical organic rotation. The readilyplant- available nitrogen in manure from Ross 308 birds fed either presumed non-limiting rations or Label Rouge rations was within the range reported for intensive broilers. For ISA 657 birds, the manure readily-plant-available nitrogen was similar to the mean value reported for broilers, when fed presumed non limiting rations, but towards the lower range when fed Label Rouge rations. As breed growth and feed intakes differ it is suggested that to optimise the utilisation of nutrients, the nutrient content of <b>table</b> <b>bird</b> manures should be checked prior to land application. The nutrient budgets were similar for N and P regardless of the length of rotation or form of poultry production. On average, there was a surplus of 85 kg/ha N over all the scenarios. There tended to be a deficit of K in all scenarios (average: 10 kg/ha) ...|$|E

40|$|Capsule: Providing peanuts on bird feeders {{was shown}} to attract more {{individuals}} and more species than providing cheese or bread. Aims: To investigate how the provision of different human-derived foods affected visit rates of urban birds at bird feeders. Methods: A fully replicated study design {{was set up in}} parkland, offering a binary choice from three food types (peanuts, bread and cheese) on <b>bird</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>Birds</b> were observed by using a scan-sample method. Results: Peanuts attracted more visits, and a greater diversity of bird species, than cheese or bread. This preference was strongest for Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus and Great Tits Parus major, whereas European Robins Erithacus rubecula visited all food types equally, and Blackbirds Turdus merula preferred cheese. Bread was the most consumed food type when measured by mass, but this could be linked to varying bite sizes. Conclusion: Our results indicate that birds preferred to visit feeding stations with the most protein- and energy-rich foods, but that some birds still chose the carbohydrate-rich bread. The findings indicate that peanuts, rather than household scraps like bread and cheese, attract the highest number of species and individuals to <b>bird</b> <b>tables.</b> The findings will be of interest to the public and to organizations providing information on bird feeding for recreational purposes...|$|R

40|$|In the United States {{there is}} a growing market for guinea fowl as <b>table</b> <b>birds,</b> and {{therefore}} it has seemed desirable to summarize the available data regarding them. At some of the American experiment stations studies have been made of the composition of the flesh and eggs of this class of poultry, but so far as can be learned no tests have been made of their food requirements, the comparative value of different rations, or the best systems of care and management. Standard poultry books and files of poultry journals contain some references to guinea fowl and methods of feeding and caring for them, but the information thus available is meager and widely scattered. In the present bulletin such data have been summarized, as well as information secured by correspondence and in other ways. The discussions of the preparation of guinea fowl and guinea eggs for the table, and the character and quality of the cooked products are in considerable part based on experiments especially undertaken for this bulletin by teachers of domestic science and others.

Five dietary treatments were fed in both experiments formulated to be iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous with Cottonseed Cake (CSC) replacing Soyabean Cake (SBC) at 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % respectively. The live weight of broilers in the phases differed significantly (p< 0. 05) with broilers in phase 2 being better. The dressed weight was higher in phase 2 than phase 1. Broilers fed CSC based diets from 4 weeks had better feed conversion ratio than those fed from day old. Similar trend was observed in haematological and serum biochemistry parameters in the different treatments of the two phases.

40|$|Poultry {{researcher}} Josie O’Brien and Lawrence Woodward {{present some}} {{results from a}} series of EFRC trials that are questioning the need for the conventional feed derogation in organic poultry production. Currently the use of up to twenty percent of non-organic components is allowed in the feed ration of organically certified <b>table</b> <b>birds.</b> Although this derogation is supposed to be removed in August 2005, there is mounting pressure to allow it to continue in some form. The derogation was introduced due to concerns that without it the bird’s nutritional needs could not be met by certified organic sources alone and therefore their health, welfare and growth would be compromised. The primary concern relates to amino acid levels and in particular methionine. There was and still remains a perception that the ingredients generally used by the sector to supply methionine do not have a suitable organic substitute; or at least one that is easily accessible at a reasonable price. This trial revealed no overall health or growth or welfare issues when comparing the two rations, contrary to suggestions that there might be due to the assumed nutritional inadequacy of the one hundred percent organic ration. Since the end of this trial we have undertaken further work that is confirming these findings...|$|R
