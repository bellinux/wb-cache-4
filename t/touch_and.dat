40|$|Abstract Character {{segmentation}} is {{a critical}} step of OCR system ． In this paper we discussed segmentation approaches of <b>touching</b> <b>and</b> kerned characters．A non-linear segmentation path-based algorithm for segmenting <b>touching</b> <b>and</b> kerned characters is put forward. First, <b>touching</b> <b>and</b> kerned characters are extracted and segregated with other characters by using character projections and recognition results．Then {{in order to find}} the non-linear segmentation path of <b>touching</b> <b>and</b> kerned characters, a heuristic method seeking minimal-penalty curved cut is used. Finally several regions belonging to the same character are merged. Experiment results show that the proposed method achieves high segmentation rate in documents written in both English and Japanese characters.

There is ample evidence of JSJ-like <b>touches</b> <b>and</b> holds being used in everyday life and the next steps in the research are to ascertain why these <b>touches</b> <b>and</b> holds are used and what they accomplish (Tobin et al. 2015).|$|R
5|$|Spiderland is {{the second}} and final studio album by the American rock band Slint. It was {{released}} on March 27, 1991, through <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Go Records. Featuring dramatically alternating dynamics and vocals ranging from spoken word to shouting, the album contains narrative lyrics that emphasize alienation. Spiderland was Slint's first release on <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Go, and the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.|$|E

5|$|A later {{development}} was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead tubing to operate pneumatic valves throughout the instrument. This allowed a lighter <b>touch,</b> <b>and</b> {{more flexibility in}} {{the location of the}} console, within a 50-foot (15-m) limit. This type of construction was used in the late 19th century to early 20th century, and has had only rare application since the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Butthole Surfers did {{not seek}} to replace her at the time, and opted to {{continue}} as a quartet. Following a final EP for <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Go—1989's Widowermaker—the band left their longtime recording partners to sign with longtime supporter Terry Tolkin at Rough Trade Records who had also brought them to <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Go, for a reportedly generous one-album deal. Prior to the new LP's debut, Rough Trade talked the band into first releasing 1990s The Hurdy Gurdy Man, which previewed material from the coming release. The same year, Rough Trade issued Digital Dump by The Jackofficers, Haynes and Pinkus's psychedelic house music side project.|$|E
5|$|Katy Perry {{chose to}} release her own {{signature}} fragrance, Purr, {{to add a}} personal <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> compete with other celebrities' perfumes; she cited Beyoncé and Kim Kardashian as examples.

5|$|Pianist McCoy Tyner, {{who grew}} up close to the Powell {{brothers}} in Philadelphia, was influenced by their relatively heavy keyboard <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> their liking of percussive piano sounds. Tyner also got some of his inspiration for chord voicings from hearing Richie's use of left-hand fourths. Tyner's voicings became the norm for young jazz pianists.|$|E
5|$|Plants are not passive, but {{respond to}} {{external}} signals such as light, <b>touch,</b> <b>and</b> injury by moving or growing towards {{or away from}} the stimulus, as appropriate. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost instantaneous collapse of leaflets of Mimosa pudica, the insect traps of Venus flytrap and bladderworts, and the pollinia of orchids.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, for an implant to look esthetic, {{a band of}} full, plump gingiva {{is needed}} {{to fill in the}} space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue {{complication}} is called a black-triangle, where the papilla (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2–4mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> bone is any greater.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the seventh {{generation}} {{was the beginning of}} direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, and increasingly powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod <b>Touch,</b> <b>and</b> the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes. Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.|$|E

5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences are due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various <b>touch</b> <b>and</b> vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E

Ted left her to return to his family and Gordon was adopted by Betty's sister Maggie (Irene Sutcliffe) and her husband Les Clegg (John Sharp). Betty celebrated {{the end of the war}} with her sweetheart Billy Williams (Frank Mills), to whom she had lost her virginity. The two lost <b>touch,</b> <b>and</b> in 1949, Betty married policeman Cyril Turpin (William Moore).|$|E
