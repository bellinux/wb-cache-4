40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} tax law doctrines designed to reduce tax shelters, such as <b>the</b> business purpose <b>doctrine,</b> and <b>the</b> economic substance <b>doctrine.</b> <b>The</b> article {{analyzes the}}se doctrines as changes to the marginal elasticity of taxable income. As these <b>doctrines</b> are strengthened, <b>the</b> elasticity of taxable income goes down (in absolute value). By reducing the marginal elasticity of taxable income, <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> increase <b>the</b> efficiency of the tax system. Because <b>the</b> <b>doctrines</b> cannot perfectly identify tax avoidance, however, they induce a distortionary response by taxpayers, who may structure shelters to avoid <b>the</b> <b>doctrines.</b> This distortionary effect reduces their efficiency. The net benefit should be set equal on the margin to the marginal administrative cost of <b>the</b> <b>doctrines...</b>|$|R

5|$|Parliament is {{not bound}} by the common law, {{and as a result}} several acts of {{parliament}} unwittingly create valid exceptions to <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> of privity. Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, motorists are obliged to take out third party liability insurance. This means that victims of car accidents can claim money from the insurer of the driver at fault, even though they {{are not part of the}} original contract.

However, laws passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom still had force in Australia, and laws passed by Australian parliaments would be invalid if they contradicted United Kingdom laws (<b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> of repugnancy).

5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region.

The historian Mark Gilderhus states that <b>the</b> <b>doctrine</b> also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children.

5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint.
