25|$|This type of rounding, {{which is}} also named <b>rounding</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{logarithmic}} scale, is <b>a</b> variant of <b>Rounding</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specified increment. <b>Rounding</b> on <b>a</b> logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal <b>rounding</b> <b>to</b> the nearest value on the log scale.|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{problems}} in radio channel assignment, {{we consider the}} vertex-labelling of graphs with non-negative integers. The objective is to minimise the span of the labelling, subject to constraints imposed at graph distances one and two. We show that the minimum span is (up <b>to</b> <b>rounding)</b> <b>a</b> piecewise linear function of the constraints, and give a complete specification, together with associated optimal assignments, for trees and cycles...|$|R
