5|$|Individual {{times to}} finish each stage are totalled to {{determine}} {{the winner of the}} general classification {{at the end of the}} race. The rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day wears the leader's jersey. Since 2010 <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> red jersey; previously it was gold. Other classifications have been calculated: those still in use are the points classification, in 2010 represented by a green jersey; the mountains classification, in 2010 represented by a blue dotted jersey; and the combination classification, in 2010 represented by a white jersey.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the church}} is the Church House, which {{is also known as}} the Old School Room. The upstairs room was the local school from the mid or early 15th century, with the village poorhouse below. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> venue for social {{activity}} in the village and in 1971 underwent major renovation. It is a Grade II* listed building. Also close {{to the church}} is Chew Court, which was originally a bishop's palace. It was largely rebuilt in 1656, from which a little survives as the Chew Court of today including an Elizabethan doorway with Doric pilasters. The room over the gatehouse {{is said to have been}} used as a court-room, with the turrets used for holding prisoners. Chew Court is a Grade II* listed building.|$|E

5|$|Old Members of {{the college}} who rowed when they were {{students}} can join the Cadwallader Club. The club, which was revitalised in 1974 and organises an annual dinner for members, also receives contributions for the Cadwallader Trust; <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> registered charity since December 1982 and supports rowing at the college both with capital expenditure and training costs. In the year ending 5 April 2008, the trust's expenditure was £19,001. Members of the Cadwallader Club have helped to provide new boats and blades for the men's and the women's 1st VIIIs, and on the Saturday of Eights Week 2008, the trust presented the boat club with a new coxed four, named Cadwallader. Cadwallader Club members are also non-voting members of the boat club.|$|E
5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams {{have gone into}} the bowl season undefeated. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> major {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, {{the choice of the}} top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E
5|$|The Bove Town Gospel Hall was {{registered}} for the solemnizing of marriages in 1964 <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{place of worship}} in the town since at least 1889, when it was listed as a mission of the Plymouth Brethren. Jehovah's Witnesses originally occupied a Kingdom Hall on Archer's Way from 1942. This transferred to Church Lane in 1964, and subsequently to its present site on Old Wells Road.|$|E

25|$|It is now {{recommended}} by the American Academy of Neurology that all cases of cerebral palsy of unknown origin undergo neuroimaging.

50|$|In 1906 Richard Swann Lull {{noted that}} the name Ceratops <b>had</b> <b>been</b> preoccupied by <b>a</b> bird, Ceratops Rafinesque 1815, but also that <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> undescribed nomen nudum, causing the name to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> still {{available}} in 1888.

25|$|Plautus {{was known}} {{for the use of}} Greek style in his plays, as part of the {{tradition}} of the variation on a theme. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> point of contention among modern scholars.

25|$|Arctic regions notably release {{more heat}} back into space {{than what they}} absorb, {{effectively}} cooling the Earth. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.|$|E
25|$|When the {{aluminium}} smelting operation closed in September 2009, it reduced its workforce from 450 to 80; <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> major {{blow to the}} island's economy, especially to Holyhead. The Royal Air Force station RAF Valley (Y Fali) {{is home to the}} RAF Fast Jet Training School and also 22 Sqn Search and Rescue Helicopters, both units providing employment for about 500 civilians. RAF Valley is now the headquarters of 22 Sqn Search and Rescue.|$|E

40|$|Over {{a period}} of 150 years the Kei Islands have {{undergone}} environmental change, from rainforest to dryland savanna woodland. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accompanied by <b>a</b> shift in starch staple from sago, tubers, and grain to cassava. We show how <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> effective ecological adaptation with social ramifications, not least the adoption of bitter cassava as a cultural identity marker. One {{of the problems of}} bitter cassava diets where people have become dependent upon them in poor parts of the Old World tropics are the effects of toxicity. We show how through a combination of factors and strategies <b>this</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> <b>a</b> major issue in the Kei Islands, and how through a government-assisted agricultural project, attempts are being made to build upon this successful transition. The viability of present trends are evaluated...|$|R
25|$|During the 20th century, Colombia {{became the}} number one {{producer}} and exporter of premium mild washed coffee in the world. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> very significant achievement, attained by the combined efforts of the private sector, the gremial organizations and the Federation's institutions. The successful model of Colombian coffee production and commerce is {{the outcome of a}} well balanced combination of efficient private enterprise and a well planned macroeconomic policy by the government. This economic model has become the organizational archetype for more than fifty coffee producing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the conflict, ethnic identity is now of much greater social importance in Bosnia than it was prior to 1992. From the 1960s until the beginning of the war, nearly twelve percent of marriages were mixed (between members of different communities), and young citizens would often refer to themselves as Bosnians rather than identifying their ethnicity. After the conflict it has been effectively mandatory to be identified as either Bosniak, Serb or Croat and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> problem for the children of rape victims as they come of age.|$|E
