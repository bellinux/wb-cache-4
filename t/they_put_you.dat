According to George Lang of The Oklahoman, [...] "Kittie's lyrics {{are full of}} spit and venom, {{directed}} at preppy cheerleaders, rich kids, rude boys and women who trade on their sexuality". According to the Sun-Sentinel, [...] "Raven" [...] is [...] "inspired by a death threat" [...] from another band. [...] "Jonny" [...] is reportedly a reaction to male domination of women, and [...] "Paperdoll", according to Morgan Lander, is about the degradation of women as objects. Fallon Bowman said that [...] "Choke" [...] is [...] "about someone telling you that they love you so much, and <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> up on a pedestal and make you feel great, then they {{turn around and say}} 'screw you. According to Morgan Lander, [...] "Do You Think I'm a Whore" [...] "is about not judging a book by its cover" [...] and the song's title was given [...] "basically to prove people wrong". [...] "Charlotte" [...] was inspired by a serial killer from the book Rites of Burial by Tom Jackman and Troy Cole. [...] "Brackish" [...] "is a commentary on a friend of" [...] Kittie [...] "and the relationship that she was in at the time".|$|E

He stated that Dick Cheney said it was [...] "beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship." [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country, Hitler, in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying September 11 was a U.S. plan or anything like that because, you know, that's how <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> in the nut-ball box — dismiss you." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{was not a}} question, but the cry of a new {{and wider}} vision of his task. Her face was transfigured. And her voice, low and vibrating, {{expressed}} no doubts. [...] "Oh, I am proud of you! And if <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>you</b> out and persecute you I shall always be proud, I shall never know why it was given me to have this, and to live. Do you remember saying to me once that faith comes to us in some human form we love? You are my faith. And faith in you is my faith in humanity, and faith in God." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must have}} been well within the enemy's lines now, for I heard {{a number of them}} {{shouting}} one of their rough drinking songs out of a house by the roadside, and I went round by the fields to avoid it. At another time two men came out into the moonlight (for by this time it was a cloudless night) and shouted something in German, but I galloped on without heeding them, and they were afraid to fire, for their own hussars are dressed exactly as I was.

I wonder whether she can sing! 'Polonaise in A flat major: Chopin'--what rot! As if working people cared about Chopin! Miss Elinor McQuinch is a fool, I see. 'Song: The Valley: Gounod.'

5000|$|Several {{characters}} are changed: the antagonist Bonzo Madrid replaces Pol Slattery as the commander who loses to Ender during an unfair battle, while Carn Carby is written as {{a much more}} supportive character.

5000|$|The last song, [...] "Reduced to Silence," [...] {{is about}} {{questioning}} the non-violence philosophy {{which is in}} the heart of the Tibetan philosophy.
