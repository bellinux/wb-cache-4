25|$|Group {{psychotherapy}} is a {{key component}} of milieu therapy in a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>community.</b> The total environment or milieu is regarded as the medium of therapy, all interactions and activities regarded as potentially therapeutic and are subject to exploration and interpretation, and are explored in daily or weekly community meetings. However, interactions between the culture of group psychotherapeutic settings and the more managerial norms of external authorities may create 'organizational turbulence' which can critically undermine a group's ability to maintain a safe yet challenging 'formative space'. Academics at the University of Oxford studied the inter-organizational dynamics of a national democratic <b>therapeutic</b> <b>community</b> over a period of four years; they found external steering by authorities eroded the community's therapeutic model, produced a crisis, and led to an intractable conflict which resulted in the community's closure.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the sudden}} {{death of her}} only sister Emilia from typhoid, Spielrein's mental health started to deteriorate, and at the age of 18 she {{suffered}} a breakdown with severe hysteria including tics, grimaces, and uncontrollable laughing and crying. After an unsuccessful stay in a Swiss sanatorium, where she developed another infatuation with one of the doctors, she was admitted to the Burghölzli mental hospital near Zurich in August 1904. Its director was Eugen Bleuler, who ran it as a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>community</b> with social activities for the patients including gardening, drama and scientific lectures. One of Bleuler's assistants was Carl Jung, afterwards appointed as deputy director. In the days following her admission, Spielrein disclosed to Jung that her father had often beaten her, and that she was troubled by masochistic fantasies of being beaten. Bleuler ensured that she was separated from her family, later requiring her father and brothers to have no contact with her. She made a rapid recovery, and by October was able to apply for medical school and to start assisting Jung with word association tests in his laboratory. Between October and January, Jung carried out word association tests on her, and also used some rudimentary psychoanalytic techniques. Later, he referred to her twice in letters to Freud as his first analytic case, although in his publications he referred to two later patients in these terms. During her admission, Spielrein fell in love with Jung. By her own choice, she continued as a resident in the hospital from January to June 1905, although she was no longer receiving treatment. She worked as an intern alongside other Russian students there including Max Eitingon, as well as expatriate psychiatrists who were studying with Bleuler, including Karl Abraham.|$|E

Objective: The aim {{of this study is to}} summarize available informations about adventure therapy (definition, history, characteristic features, etc.) and determine how <b>therapeutic</b> <b>communities</b> in the Czech Republic use adventure therapy in treatment of addictions, what are the views and attitudes of therapists who organize stressful programs, and what are the problems in organization of stressful programs.

40|$|This Bachelor {{thesis is}} a sub {{research}} of the wider project focused {{on the impact of}} ADHD on selected mental functions, life skills and quality of life of the clients recovering from an addiction in the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>communities.</b> ADHD is associated with inferior adaptability and as well with more serious psychopathological symptoms. The aim of the research is to determine whether ADHD occurs in clients of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>communities</b> and what is the prevalence. Furthermore, we search for connections with other serious clinical manifestations and evolution of these symptoms during treatment. We are also interested in retention of the clients with these symptoms in treatment process. The sample was compiled {{on the basis of the}} two-step procedure. Fundamental file in the first phase were all certified <b>therapeutic</b> <b>communities</b> for the addictions treatment. Among them were by computer randomly selected eight who participated in the research. At the second level was used a total choice of new coming clients and all of them were tested.

2500|$|Mentalization based treatment, {{developed}} by Peter Fonagy and Antony Bateman, {{rests on the}} assumption that people with BPD have a disturbance of attachment due to problems in the early childhood parent-child relationship. [...] Fonagy and Bateman hypothesize that inadequate parental mirroring and attunement in early childhood lead to a deficit in mentalization, [...] "the capacity to think about mental states as separate from, yet potentially causing actions"; in other words the capacity to intuitively understand the thoughts, intentions and motivations of others, and the connections between one's own thoughts, feelings and actions. Mentalization failure is thought to underlie BPD patients' problems with impulse control, mood instability and difficulties sustaining intimate relationships. Mentalization based treatment aims to develop patients' self-regulation capacity through a psychodynamically informed multi-modal treatment program that incorporates group psychotherapy and individual psychotherapy in a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>community,</b> partial hospitalization or outpatient context. In a randomized controlled trial, a group of BPD patients received 18 months of intensive partial-hospitalization MBT followed by 18 months of group psychotherapy, and were followed up over five years. The treatment group showed significant benefits across a range of measures including number of suicide attempts, reduced time in hospital and reduced use of medication.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{group therapy}} {{was first used}} around 1920 by Jacob L. Moreno, whose main {{contribution}} was the development of psychodrama, in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment {{under the direction of}} the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the USA, such as Paul Schilder, who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably Wilfred Bion and Rickman, followed by S. H. Foulkes, Main, and Bridger. The Northfield Hospital in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two [...] "Northfield Experiments", which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both social therapy, that is, the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>community</b> movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders. Today group therapy is used in clinical settings and in private practice settings.|$|E
