40|$|The {{research}} project {{discussed in this}} paper was designed to subject the rolling noise measuring method based on a single-axle trailer, which had been worked out in the {{research project}} 'Development of a measuring method for tyre-road noise' (Project No. 105 05 211) in 1990, to detailed practical testing. The necessary tyre-road noise measurements were performed on {{a representative sample of}} commercial car tyres (n = 143). Apart from summer tyres, a limited number of winter and cross-country tyres were included in the sample. Tests also included remoulds as well as new tyres. Measurements were made on two different surfaces, an 0 / 8 asphalt concrete and 0 / 11 mastic asphalt. The former surface corresponds to the requirements of ISO standard 10844 (surface for vehicle homologation tests); the latter is typical for roads outside built-up areas. The study showed that the trailer drive-by method is fundamentally suitable for determining sound emission from car tyres. To ensure an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, the <b>tractor</b> <b>vehicle</b> must, however, be fitted with especially low-noise tyres and additional screening in the tyre area. In certain cases (when very low-noise tyres are being measured) the above steps are insufficient to guarantee a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 dB(A) (minimum signal-to-noise ratio: 7 dB(A)). This problem was, however, solved by means of special 'calibration drives' with the <b>tractor</b> <b>vehicle</b> and by subtracting the <b>tractor</b> <b>vehicle</b> energy component. (orig.)

40|$|The Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) segments, {{which are}} part of the current Space Shuttle system and will provide the first stage of the Ares launch vehicle, must be transported from their {{manufacturing}} facility in Promontory, Utah, to a railhead in Corinne, Utah. This approximately 25 -mile trip on secondary paved roads is accomplished using a special transporter system which lifts and conveys each individual segment. ATK Launch Systems (ATK) has recently obtained a new set of these transporters from Scheuerle, a company in Germany. The transporter is a 96 -wheel, dual <b>tractor</b> <b>vehicle</b> that supports the payload via a hydraulic suspension. Since this system is a different design than was previously used, computer modeling with validation via test is required to ensure that the environment to which the segment is exposed is not too severe for this space-critical hardware. Accurate prediction of the loads imparted to the rocket motor is essential in order to prevent damage to the segment. To develop and validate a finite element model capable of such accurate predictions, ATA Engineering, Inc., teamed with ATK to perform a modal survey of the transport system, including a forward RSRM segment. A set of electrodynamic shakers was placed around the transporter at locations capable of exciting the transporter vehicle dynamics. Forces from the shakers with varying phase combinations were applied using sinusoidal sweep excitation. The relative phase of the shaker forcing functions was adjusted to match the shape characteristics of each of several target modes, thereby customizing each sweep run for exciting a particular mode. The resulting frequency response functions (FRF) from this series of sine sweeps allowed identification of all target modes and other higher-order modes, allowing good comparison to the finite element model. Furthermore, the survey-derived modal frequencies were correlated with peak frequencies observed during road-going operating tests. This correlation enabled verification of the most significant modes contributing to real-world loading of the motor segment under transport. After traditional model updating, dynamic simulation of the transportation environment was compared to the measured operating data to provided further validation of the analysis model.
