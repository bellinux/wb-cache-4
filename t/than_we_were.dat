500|$|Bungie and Microsoft first showed ODST in a playable form at E3 2009, {{where the}} game's release date and retail {{versions}} were finalized. Bungie initially marketed ODST as a title smaller in scope than previous numbered {{entries in the}} series. When the game's retail versions were announced, however, the game received a standard price of US$60, which Bungie and Microsoft attributed to the game growing beyond the planned scope. [...] "Over the course of development it got a lot bigger <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> anticipating," [...] said Bungie's Lars Bakken. [...] "We thought of it more as an expansion and then it grew well beyond that." [...] Creamer explained that since the development platform was stable, [...] "we were able to create {{quite a bit more}} content than we originally thought we would". The game's length increased from original estimates of 3–5hours to 8–10. The discrepancy was not discussed until E3 2009 when Microsoft decided it was a full game. Unlike the post-launch support for Halo 3, ODST does not have downloadable content.|$|E

The new campaign expands the North American territories and features 5 new playable factions: Iroquois, Cherokee, Huron, Pueblo and Plains Nations. New researchable technologies were also added, along with the new scout and shaman agents and new faction-specific objectives. Napoleon: Total War, released February 2010, focuses {{on the life of}} Napoleon Bonaparte, building upon the technology used for Empire: Total War. Napoleon was released as a standalone game rather than {{an expansion}} for a number of reasons, mostly to do with technical limitations; according to Mike Simpson [...] "the level of detail required to successfully depict the Napoleonic Wars is an order of magnitude greater <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working to with Empire: Total War". Empire and Napoleon Total War Collection - Game of the Year was then released on 1 October 2010 joining both games together, including all of the available downloadable content.|$|E

500|$|In March and April 2010, God of War III: Original Soundtrack {{from the}} Video Game, {{composed}} by Gerard K. Marino, Ron Fish, Mike Reagan, Jeff Rona, and Cris Velasco, was included as downloadable {{content in the}} God of War III Ultimate Edition and Ultimate Trilogy Edition. Its CD was released on March 30 by SCE and Sumthing Else. The soundtrack was recorded by the Skywalker Session Orchestra and the Czech National Symphony Chorus. Each composer provided a different aesthetic to the score: for example, Marino's approach was brooding, rhythmic, and percussive, and Fish set hopeless and somber moods. In an interview with Game Music Online, Mike Reagan said that although the composers might have used each other's themes, they did not collaborate with each other. Reagan said the real collaboration came from Clint Bajakian, Senior Music Supervisor at Sony, and his team. In scoring for God of War III, Reagan said that the composers were [...] "able to explore more melodic development <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on the first [...]" [...] The score was recorded under the new American Federation of Musicians video game agreement and because of Sony’s vision and support, the composers were able to record locally {{with some of the}} best musicians in the world. In an interview with PlayStation.Blog, Clint Bajakian described the different ensembles that recorded the score: the brass section is the [...] "lead guitar", the choir gives the game its epic feel, the strings are the body of the sound, and the percussion is the foundation.|$|E

They agreed to it, though, a problem ensued when they could not figure the prompter out, which resulted in Banks [...] "throwing fastballs at [...] and him battling them back as fast as possible and hoping they could cut it together faster <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> doing it." [...] Banks revealed to Ausiello that she had no intention on becoming a series regular, explaining that she has been having [...] "too much fun" [...] making movies to commit to a television show full-time.
