Some favored the latter design because it would have greater mass, allowing it to better withstand earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} World War II Germany {{introduced}} the V-1 cruise missile and V-2 ballistic missiles in combat against the Allied forces.

5|$|Between Kimberley and Mafeking, Maund {{learned from}} Shippard that Grobler {{had been killed}} by a group of Ngwato warriors while {{returning}} to the Transvaal, and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British-protected Ngwato chief, Khama III, in response. Maund volunteered to help defend Khama, writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed. Cawston tersely wrote back with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay, but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange required, and Maund had squandered his head start on Rudd. After ignoring a notice Lobengula had posted at Tati, barring entry to white big-game hunters and concession-seekers, the Rudd party arrived at the king's kraal on 21 September 1888, three weeks ahead of Maund.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after the recession of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
5|$|During his reign, he {{completed}} the conquest and expulsion of the Hyksos from the delta region, restored Theban rule {{over the whole}} of Egypt and successfully reasserted Egyptian power in its formerly subject territories of Nubia and Canaan. He then reorganized {{the administration of the}} country, reopened quarries, mines and trade routes and began massive construction projects of a type that had not been undertaken since the time of the Middle Kingdom. This building program culminated {{in the construction of the}} last pyramid built by native Egyptian rulers. Ahmose's reign laid <b>the</b> <b>foundations</b> <b>for</b> the New Kingdom, under which Egyptian power reached its peak. His reign is usually dated to the mid-16th century BC.|$|E

Her wedding was the only time that he wore his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties.
