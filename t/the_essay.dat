5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. <b>The</b> <b>essay</b> was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

Linguistic analysis determined that the author of <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> papers and the manifesto were almost certainly the same. When combined with facts gleaned from the bombings and Kaczynski's life, that analysis provided the basis for a search warrant.|$|E
5|$|Lambert's {{essay about}} metaphysics, Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote <b>the</b> <b>essay</b> {{himself as a}} boy, and – as in the novel – it was confiscated by an angry teacher. Lambert's genius and {{philosophical}} erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception. Similarly, some critics and biographers have suggested that Lambert's madness reflects (consciously or not) Balzac's own unsteady mental state. His plans to run for parliament and other non-literary ambitions led observers {{at the time to}} suspect his sanity.|$|E

5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a {{revised version of}} an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. <b>The</b> <b>essay,</b> published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>essay</b> was {{extensively}} {{discussed in}} the media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E
