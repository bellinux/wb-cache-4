5|$|Beauchamp {{arrived in}} Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans talked of Sharp's murder {{as the work}} of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills {{critical}} of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he had both political and personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.|$|E
5|$|Both {{articles}} {{address the}} issue of who the killer could alternatively have been, and both of them mention Carol's other lovers, and John Rapson, responsible for murdering Carol's sister. Both of the articles mention {{that he was in the}} Barrow area around <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> but both of them are careful to point out that they are not accusing him of being the murderer.|$|E
5|$|Alex Wiens (Russian: Алекс Винс, {{also known}} as Alexander Wiens) was born in 1980 in Perm, Russia. After leaving school, he {{completed}} a vocational training programme as a warehouseman. In 1999, after a medical examination for conscription, Wiens was exempted from compulsory military service in the Russian armed forces; it was stated that Wiens probably had suffered from a severe and chronic psychosis. In 2003, he immigrated to Germany and gained German citizenship {{as a result of}} his ethnic origin. In Germany, he worked as a builder and caretaker, but had been living on welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> In November 2009, at the time of sentencing, Wiens was 28 years old, unmarried and without children.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Hodgson's appeal, Operation Iceberg {{was created by the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) with the aim of using DNA {{evidence}} in pre-1990 rape or murder cases. This led to the review of 240 other convictions. The CCRC also requested that the Crown Prosecution Service identify and review similar murder cases from the time before DNA testing was available. In September 2009, on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body, police named David Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> had confessed to police in 1983 that he had raped and killed DeSimone, but officers refused to believe him. Lace committed suicide in December 1988.|$|E
5|$|Carty and Brown were, {{according}} to Brown, childhood friends who thought {{of each other}} as cousins. Carty lived with his grandparents in Burrows Road, Kensal Green, and Brown {{lived with his mother}} in Rosebank Avenue, Sudbury, northwest London. Carty had one conviction for assaulting a police officer when he was 16 years old, and a caution for possessing cannabis. Brown had no previous convictions. The pair were members of a violent gang calling itself the KG Tribe, taking part in the unlawful wounding of two commuters in December 2005 as well as other robberies. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> of Pryce, Carty and Brown were 18 and 17 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{was also}} wanted in San Francisco in the United States {{for the murder}} of {{homosexual}} prostitute Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was chopped up and drained of blood; it was found in a garbage skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's photograph matched a facial composite picture of a suspect made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated as a suspect after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E

5|$|Raghip's {{parents had}} moved from Cyprus to England in 1956. Raghip left school at age 15, illiterate, and by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> had two convictions, one for {{stealing}} cars and one for burglary. He had a common-law wife, Sharon Daly, {{with whom he had}} a two-year-old boy, and he worked occasionally as a mechanic. He had little connection with Broadwater Farm, though he lived in nearby Wood Green and had gone to the Farm with two friends to watch the riot, he said. One of those friends, John Broomfield, gave an interview to the Daily Mirror on 23 October, boasting about his involvement. When Broomfield was arrested, he implicated Raghip. Broomfield was later convicted of an unrelated murder.|$|E
5|$|A {{father and}} {{daughter}} rollerblading in Central Park stumble across {{the body of a}} woman with several lacerations hidden in a bush. Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb around <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder,</b> one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E

5|$|The Greek Town Riot in 1909 flared after {{increased}} Greek immigration, Greeks' {{working as}} strikebreakers, and {{the killing of}} an Irish policeman provoked violence among earlier immigrants such as ethnic Irish. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or {{had at least one}} parent born outside of America. Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a Mexican immigrant named Juan Gonzalez was killed by a mob near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer was investigating a criminal operation selling goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. Racial profiling targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. Afterward it was discovered that Gonzalez was unarmed, and that he had a reliable alibi for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder.</b> Nobody was ever indicted for his killing. In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of blacks as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{coupled with}} that and his workaholic-like ambitions, this would wear heavily on the romance between Elder and Alexander; by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>murder</b> trial {{proceedings}} began, Elder, as did Knapp sometime beforehand, had broken off their relationship.|$|E
