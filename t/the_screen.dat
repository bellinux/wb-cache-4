5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes obvious use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The more obvious examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E

The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse {{to move the}} cursor on <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The cursor will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. Clicking in any location will guide the player character in that direction. Moving the cursor {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> will reveal the player's inventory.

5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Reports emerged, stating that Sharp was unable to ship <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> before the debut of the iPhone 5, and other manufacturers reported that it was difficult to keep up with demand. As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of stock at retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E

Snowman, a Toronto-based, three-person indie development team, previously worked on productivity apps before Alto's Adventure.

As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into a pile. <b>The</b> <b>screen</b> darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive.

5|$|As well as addition, subtraction, {{multiplication}} and division, it had reciprocal and square-root functions, and {{the ability}} to multiply by a fixed constant. With an eight-digit display, the calculator could display positive numbers between 0.0000001 and 99,999,999, and negative numbers between -0.000001 and -9,999,999. Calculators of the time tended to have displays of between 3 and 12 digits, as reducing the number of digits was an effective way of reducing the cost of the calculator.

5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> displayed. The game's environment was made longer than <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and down while flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
