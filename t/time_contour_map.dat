The structure is dipping at a gentle angle toward the NW-SE. Tectonically the area fall in extensional regime and is dominated by Normal faults, favorable for accumulation of hydrocarbon. The interpretation of Seismic lines, <b>time</b> <b>contour</b> <b>map</b> and depth contour map confirms the Graben structure and stratigraphic traps (Pinchouts) in the study area. The high zone present in the South Eastern part of the contour maps is possible location of hydrocarbon entrapment, which is further confirmed by the presence of the well Nandpur- 02. The reservoir quality of the Samana Suk Formation was much better in terms of clean Sandstone, porosity, water saturation and permeability. We use seismic lines, a base map and well data of Nandpur- 02 area which was obtained from Landmark Resources, Pakistan. For subsurface mapping, structural interpretation, synthetic seismogram generation of investigated area we used four dip and five strike lines. These seismic lines and well data are in digital format. The reservoir discrimination and modeling is carried out with the help of geophysical parameter...|$|E

The interpretation of 422 km of six-fold coverage reflection data is presented here as unmigrated <b>time</b> <b>contour</b> <b>maps,</b> {{and as a}} suite of interpreted VAR time-sections. In 1970, an experimental reconnaissance reflection survey was run over selected parts of the area. In 1971, {{this was followed by}} a reconnaissance reflection survey which was based on uphole surveys made at 5 km intervals along each line before production shooting started. In the western part of Tuz Gölü, where piercement structures had been observed on the early seismic lines, detail seismic lines were shot in 1972. The gravity method was also used to delineate probable salt diapir trends. This gravity data have been compiled with the previous Esso and M. T. A. data. The gravity data of the western Tuz Gölü were processed by Shell in The Hague, using the polynomial method of residual-regional separation. The relationship between some negative gravity anomalies, the indications of piercement structures and areas of topographic depression was investigated. The results of two aeromagnetic surveys carried out by Gulf and M. T. A. (Mineral Research and Exploration Institute) are also discussed in this paper. I. OUTLINES OF GEOLOG...|$|R

These results are compared with satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and drifter trajectories for the same period of <b>time.</b> <b>Contour</b> <b>maps</b> of sea surface height anomalies made for each 10 -day period (TIP data) reveal the formation and evolution of anticyclonic and cyclonicmesoscale features in {{the central part of the}} Caribbean Sea during the entire period studied. These features move westward at average speeds between 10 and 15 cm/s, growing in amplitude up to 25 Cm. Also, a quasi-permanent gyre is detected in the Golfo de los Mosquitos (coast of Panarna and Colombia). The sense of rotation of this gyre is shown to be modulated seasonally. Enhanced relative clockwise and counterclockwise rotation are observed during the rainy season (June-October) and the dry/windy season (January-April), respectively. No strong mesoscale anomalies are detected in the eastern part of the Caribbean Sea where they are expected. A seasonal cycle is found in the sea level anomaly (SLA) derived from TIP and ERS- 1 data due to steric effects. Upwelling is observed near the coast of Venezuela during the dry season. A comparison of SLA with SST is made and good correlation is observed at some locations. Drifter trajectories contemporaneous with SLA data agree well with the sense of rotation of strong features, but the drifter speeds are twice the absolute geostrophic currents calculated from SLA[URL] Junior Grade, Venezuelan Nav...|$|R
40|$|The reinterpretation {{of public}} seismic profiles, the stratigraphic review of {{hydrocarbon}} exploration well logs in the Adriatic offshore of Gargano (Apulia, southern Italy), {{and the use}} of Surfer® (Golden Software, Inc.) and MoveTM (Midland Valley Ltd.) softwares, allowed us to obtain the Two Way <b>Times</b> (TWT) <b>contour</b> <b>map</b> and the 3 D model of the upper Trias salt surface of the Tremiti diapir. The obtained 3 D model of the Tremiti diapir shows two types of shape indicating at least as many modes of salt emplacement: single flap and piercing. Inherited faults were used by salt, which promoted the contemporaneous development of piercing and single flap in the same diapiric body. In addition, the sea floor deformations suggest that the diapirism, which mostly developed during Plio-Pleistocene time, is probably still active. Despite the NW-SE shortening due to the regional EW dextral shearing, that likely triggered halokinesis, the upward growth rate of the diapir was able to promote dip-slip kinematics, which locally hid the strike-slip one...|$|R
40|$|The Common Extensive Cryogenic Engine program {{demonstrated}} {{the operation of}} a deep throttling engine design. The program, spanning five years from August 2005 to July 2010, funded testing through four separate engine demonstration test series. Along with successful completion of multiple objectives, a discrete response of approximately 4000 Hz was discovered and explored throughout the program. The typical low-amplitude acoustic response {{was evident in the}} chamber measurement through almost every operating condition; however, at certain off-nominal operating conditions, the response became discrete with higher amplitude. This paper summarizes the data reduction, characterization, and analysis of the 4, 000 Hz response for the entire program duration, using the large amount of data collected. Upon first encountering the response, new objectives and instrumentation were incorporated in future test series to specifically collect 4, 000 Hz data. The 4, 000 Hz response was identified as being related to the first tangential acoustic mode by means of frequency estimation and spatial decomposition. The latter approach showed that the effective node line of the mode was aligned with the manifold propellant inlets with standing waves and quasi-standing waves present at various <b>times.</b> <b>Contour</b> <b>maps</b> that contain instantaneous frequency and amplitude trackings of the response were generated as a significant improvement to historical manual approaches of data reduction presentation. Signal analysis and dynamic data reduction also uncovered several other features of the response including a stable limit cycle, the progressive engagement of subsequent harmonics, the U-shaped time history, an intermittent response near the test-based neutral stability region, other acoustic modes, and indications of modulation with a separate subsynchronous response. Although no engine damage related to the acoustic mode was noted, the peak-to-peak fluctuating pressure amplitude achieved 12. 1 % of the mean chamber pressure at its highest. The identification of this response in terms of an instability is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the mission}} {{objective}} to deploy {{a number of}} small landers to the surface of Mars at various latitude/longitude locations, it is of interest to obtain a global perspective of the communications link geometry between the landers and a data relay orbiter. Specifically, the question to be answered is what is the total time interval over one Martian day (1 sol) that a lander at any given latitude and longitude can communicate data to the orbiter. Results should be obtained for more than one elevation angle constraint (lander antenna design issue), and also for several time points into the mission since the orbiter's periapsis location moves under the influence of Mars' oblateness perturbation. Such information is presented in terms of global <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> of available communications time per sol summed over all orbiter pases on that day. Global data of this type complements more detailed local site data such as communications range and elevation vs time per pass. Communications <b>time</b> <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> are included here for sol grids of 180, 232, 318, 361, and 404 corresponding to orbiter periapsis latitudes of 35 S, 90 S, equatorial, 45 N, and 90 N. For each of these days, there is a map for both a 15 deg and 45 deg minimum elevation constraint on the lander-to-orbiter line of sight. The jagged appearance of the contour lines is due to computational resolution in interpolating between a finite number of latitude/longitude grid points. Although the contours should really be smooth, the general information content is represented by the lower resolution maps shown here. An example of the tabulated, finite-grid data points is also given. Communication with all sites is possible at the 15 deg elevation constraint, at times only for several minutes per sol but more generally for a much longer time up to 14 hours per sol. Significantly less time is available with a 45 deg elevation constraint, and at certain times in the mission some localized regions of the planet are inaccessible. Still, one may conclude that the reference orbit selection will support a more than adequate communications link through the mission timeline with landers emplaced at any desired location on Mars...|$|R

Many efforts have been made to avoid collecting data from all the sensors in the network and producing maps at the sink, which is proven to be inefficient.

We propose Iso-Map, an energy-efficient protocol for <b>contour</b> <b>mapping,</b> which builds <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> based solely on the reports collected from intelligently selected "isoline nodes" in wireless sensor networks.

On this field, a study about geology structure that develops in the connection of a hydrocarbon trap. By means of the deepened interpretation of sub surface geology structure, it’s expected to be beneficial for the exploration of hydrocarbon. The data used on this research are seismic data as main data, together with regional data as a supporting data, seismic data are used for structure analysis and sub surface mapping of TARATARI field. Regional geology is very worthy in interpreting sub surface structure on the research area. The method that used in this research are analysis and descriptive. Based on the result of the research, the developing structure on the TARATARI field is dextral fault and anticline. The fault structure on vertical profile figure can be identified with the occurrence of flower structure. The dextral fault has a North-South oriented direction. Hydrocarbon trap formed on TARATARI field is a structural trap which controlled by anticline and fault. Based on result from this research, the structure that happened in area research are strike slip and anticline. Strike slip can showed by flower structure in line seismic.

The application of modeling techniques that allows one to include ethnogeographic data in the content of the characteristics of the territory and reflect them on the <b>contour</b> <b>map.</b> The basis of ethnogeographic modeling is the identification and creation of elements of the material and spiritual culture of peoples by means of conventional signs. Comparison of these elements, their superimposition with respect to each other, as well as their comparison with geographic maps allow us to determine the interrelations and the dependence of the phenomenon. Modeling on <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> is the basic method of learning in geography. On the one hand, it creates a cartographic image of the studied territory, {{and on the other hand}} it facilitates the creation of “visual supports” on the <b>map.</b> Modeling on <b>contour</b> <b>maps,</b> at the beginning students put the basic geographical names, which will serve as the basic knowledge. Then, by purposefully analyzing and comparing the thematic maps of the atlas or textbook, the students reflect specific ethno-geographical knowledge on <b>contour</b> <b>maps.</b> As a result, <b>contour</b> <b>maps</b> acquire “their own face”, and do not become a simple copy of maps of an atlas or textbook.
