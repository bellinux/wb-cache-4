5|$|People with SCI are at {{especially}} {{high risk for}} respiratory and cardiovascular problems, so hospital staff must be watchful to avoid them. Respiratory problems (especially pneumonia) are <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in people with SCI, followed by infections, usually of pressure sores, urinary tract infections and respiratory infections. Pneumonia can be accompanied by shortness of breath, fever, and anxiety.|$|E

40|$|We {{have all}} heard {{many times that}} “Glaucoma {{is the second most}} common treatable <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{blindness}} world-wide”.

In developed countries, <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> blindness is age-related macular degenera-tion (AMD). However, there is a fundamental difference between these 2 diseases and glaucoma; their high rank as <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> blindness is due to structural reasons that are hard to address (limited access to surgical infrastructure for cataract and lack of an effective preventive treatment for AMD), whereas in the case of glaucoma, the main reason is low awareness of the disease and its implications.

5|$|In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based {{primarily}} at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were {{the leading cause}} of colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved.|$|E

From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have car accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through its Fatality Analysis Reporting System stated that auto fatalities continue to be <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> for young adults.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 20th century, heart disease had surpassed {{infectious}} disease as <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in the United States, and it is currently the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Since 1948, the ongoing Framingham Heart Study has shed light on the effects of various influences on the heart, including diet, exercise, and common medications such as aspirin. Although the introduction of ACE inhibitors and beta blockers has improved the management of chronic heart failure, the disease continues to be an enormous medical and societal burden, with 30 to 40% of patients dying within a year of receiving the diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}}, {{which include}} {{diseases of the}} heart, are <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> worldwide. The majority of cardiovascular disease is noncommunicable and related to lifestyle and other factors, becoming more prevalent with ageing. Heart disease is {{a major cause of}} death, accounting for an average of 30% of all deaths in 2008, globally. This rate varies from a lower 28% to a high 40% in high-income countries. Doctors that specialise in the heart are called cardiologists. Many other medical professionals are involved in treating diseases of the heart, including doctors such as general practitioners, cardiothoracic surgeons and intensivists, and allied health practitioners including physiotherapists and dieticians.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> (30%) amongst {{women in the}} United States, and {{the leading cause of}} chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help determine the cause and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It is <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia {{was the most common}} reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E

5|$|The Voćin {{massacre}} was {{the killing}} of 43 civilians in Voćin, Croatia, by the Serbian White Eagles paramilitary unit on 13 December 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre was carried out after the unit was ordered to abandon the village before the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) recaptured the area in Operation Papuk-91. All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, {{who had tried to}} protect his neighbours. Gunfire was <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> though some of the victims were killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death.

5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death,</b> accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E
