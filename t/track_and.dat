5|$|The {{establishment}} of the modern Olympic Games {{at the end of}} the 19th century marked a new high for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field. The Olympic athletics programme, comprising <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field events plus a marathon race, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field contests remained among the Games' most prominent. The Olympics was the elite competition for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field, and only amateur sportsmen could compete. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> field continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had played baseball professionally.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympic and Paralympic Games, {{the most}} {{prominent}} events for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field athletes include the three IOC-sanctioned continental games: the All-Africa Games, Asian Games, and the Pan American Games. Other games such as the Commonwealth Games and Summer Universiade, and World Masters Games have significant participation from <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field athletes. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> field is also present at the national games level, with competitions such as the Chinese National Games serving as the most prestigious national competition for domestic <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field athletes.|$|E
5|$|At Muir Tech, Robinson played several {{sports at}} the varsity level and {{lettered}} {{in four of}} them: football, basketball, <b>track,</b> <b>and</b> baseball.

He committed himself to three further editions.|$|E
5|$|From the 1990s onwards, <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field became {{increasingly}} more professional and international, as the IAAF gained {{over two hundred}} member nations. The IAAF World Championships in Athletics became a fully professional competition {{with the introduction of}} prize money in 1997, and in 1998 the IAAF Golden League—an annual series of major <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field meetings in Europe—provided a higher level of economic incentive {{in the form of a}} US$1 million jackpot. In 2010, the series was replaced by the more lucrative IAAF Diamond League, a fourteen-meeting series held in Europe, Asia, North America and the Middle East—the first ever worldwide annual series of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field meetings.|$|E

5|$|Mirroring {{the role}} that <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field events have at the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, the sport is {{featured}} within the athletics programmes of many major multi-sport events. Among {{some of the first}} of these events to follow the Olympic-style model were the World University Games in 1923, the Commonwealth Games in 1930, and the Maccabiah Games in 1932. The number of major multi-sport events greatly increased during the 20th century and thus did the number of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field events held within them.

5|$|That same year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) was established, {{becoming}} the international governing body for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field, and it enshrined amateurism {{as one of}} its founding principles for the sport. The National Collegiate Athletic Association held their first Men's Outdoor <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> Field Championship in 1921, {{making it one of the}} most prestigious competitions for students, and this was soon followed by the introduction of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field at the inaugural World Student Games in 1923. The first continental <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field competition was the 1919 South American Championships, which was followed by the European Athletics Championships in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon Ducks <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field {{program is}} the intercollegiate <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field team for the University of Oregon located in the U.S. state of Oregon. The team competes at the NCAA Division I level {{and is a member}} of the Pac-12 Conference. The team participates in indoor and outdoor <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field as well as cross country. Known as the Ducks, Oregon's first <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field team was fielded in 1895. The team holds its home meets at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. Robert Johnson is the current head coach and since the program's {{inception}} in 1895, there have only been seven permanent head coaches. The Ducks claim 31 NCAA National Championships among the three disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{governance of}} <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field {{falls under the}} jurisdiction of athletics organisations. The International Association of Athletics Federations is the global governing body for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field, and athletics as a whole. The governance of <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field at continental and national level is also done by athletics bodies. Some national federations are named after the sport, including USA Track & Field and the Philippine Amateur Track & Field Association, but these organisations govern more than just <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field and are in fact athletics governing bodies. These national federations regulate sub-national and local <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field clubs, as well as other types of running clubs.|$|E

5|$|The major global <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field {{competitions}} {{are both}} held under {{the scope of}} athletics. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> field contests make {{up the majority of}} events on the Olympic and Paralympic athletics programmes, which occur every four years. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> field events have held a prominent position at the Summer Olympics since its inception in 1896, and the events are typically held in the main stadium of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Events such as the 100 metres receive some of the highest levels of media coverage of any Olympic or Paralympic sporting event.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} major {{international}} competition for <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this {{worked on a}} quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics has been held every two years since 1985 {{and this is the}} only world championships that consists of solely <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field events.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport of}} <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field {{has its roots}} in human prehistory. <b>Track</b> <b>and</b> field-style events are among the oldest of all {{sporting}} competitions, as running, jumping and throwing are natural and universal forms of human physical expression. The first recorded examples of organized <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field events at a sports festival are the Ancient Olympic Games. At the first Games in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece, only one event was contested: the stadion footrace. The scope of the Games expanded in later years to include further running competitions, but the introduction of the Ancient Olympic pentathlon marked a step towards <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field as it is recognized today—it comprised a five-event competition of the long jump, javelin throw, discus throw, stadion footrace, and wrestling.|$|E

Most countries have a national championship in <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field and, for athletes, these often play a role in gaining selection into major competitions. Some countries hold many <b>track</b> <b>and</b> field championships at high school and college-level, which help develop younger athletes.
