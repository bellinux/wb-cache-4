The epicardial pacemaker leads were placed after the patient collapsed during aortic valve surgery. In {{the first half of}} the tracing, pacemaker stimuli at 60 beats per minute result in a wide QRS complex with a right bundle branch block pattern. Progressively weaker pacing stimuli are administered, which results in asystole in the second half of the tracing. At the end of the <b>tracing,</b> <b>distortion</b> results from muscle contractions due to a (short) hypoxic seizure. Because decreased pacemaker stimuli do not result in a ventricular escape rhythm, the patient can be said to be pacemaker-dependent and needs a definitive pacemaker.|$|E

Although widely used in networking research, these traces do not allow to determine the video quality in an accurate manner after networking transport that includes losses and delays. In this work, we provide (i) an overview of frame dependencies {{that have to be}} taken into consideration when working with video traces, (ii) an algorithmic approach to combine traditional video <b>traces</b> and offset <b>distortion</b> <b>traces</b> to determine the video quality or distortion after lossy network transport, (iii) offset distortion and quality characteristics and (iv) the offset <b>distortion</b> <b>trace</b> format and tools to create offset <b>distortion</b> <b>traces...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the ionospheric irregularities produced during daylight hours in mid-latitude regions by medium-scale travelling ionospheric disturbances (MS-TIDs) as these disturbances pass overhead at a recording station. These irregularities are detected as ionogram <b>trace</b> <b>distortions</b> as well as by spread-F conditions particularly related to the second-hop reflections of HF radio waves. The existence of a significant amount of spread on second-hop ionogram traces during the passage of two particular MS-TIDs is illustrated and discussed. Experimental evidence is presented to suggest that, similar to the results for night-time spread-F, the occurrence of these daytime events is inversely related to variations in the neutral-particle density of the upper atmosphere, for the annual and sunspot-cycle variations. However, the results do not show a similar inverse relationship for the diurnal variation...|$|R

40|$|We have {{proposed}} and experimentally demonstrated a configuration of coherent BOTDA using optical phase- and polarization-diversity heterodyne detection and embedded {{digital signal processing}} (DSP). With the unwanted probe side-band and Rayleigh scattered noise eliminated by stable electrical filtering, the in-phase and quadrature-phase heterodyne sensing signals in both x- and y-polarizations are received by the phase- and polarization-diversity coherent receiver with independent local light, and processed by the subsequent embedded DSP. The embedded DSP algorithms are designed to recover the baseband BOTDA trace for sensing and remove the intermediate frequency noise (both amplitude and phase noise) to avoid <b>trace</b> <b>distortion.</b> A spatial resolution of similar to 3 m and temperature accuracy of +/- 0. 3 degrees C have been achieved over 40 -km sensing distance.

Capturing address traces to use in these simulations, however, is a difficult problem for parallel processor architectures.

40|$|Abstract — Video traces {{containing}} the sizes and (PSNR) quali-ties {{of the individual}} frames of a video encoding are a convenient video representation {{for the evaluation of}} video networking mechanisms. These video traces can be used to find the frame loss probabilities of a lossy networking mechanism, but can not give the PSNR video quality after lossy network transport. To date the video quality after lossy network transport could only be determined through experiments with actual video or by approximating the quality of the frames affected by a loss with some low PSNR quality. In this paper we introduce and evaluate offset <b>distortion</b> <b>traces</b> with which the video quality after lossy network transport can be accurately determined without requiring experiments with actual video.

5000|$|Dynagroove is a {{recording}} process introduced in 1963 by RCA Victor that, {{for the first}} time, used analog computers to modify the audio signal used to produce master disks for LPs. The intent was to boost bass on quiet passages, and reduce the high-frequency <b>tracing</b> burdens (<b>distortion)</b> for the less-compliant, [...] "ball" [...] or spherical-tipped playback cartridges then in use. With boosted bass, tracing demands could be reduced in part by reduced recording levels, sometimes supplemented by peak compression. This added top-end margin permitted selective pre-emphasis of some passages for greater perceived (psychological) brilliance of the recording as a whole. As with any compander, the program material itself changed {{the response of the}} Dynagroove electronics that processed it. But, because the changes were multiple (bass, treble, dynamic range) and algorithmic (thresholds, gain curves), RCA justifiably referred to the analog device as a computer.|$|R

The image processing hardware has developed so much during the past 20 years, that at present it exceeds the technical requirements for processing strong motion accelerograms.

40|$|Measuring {{dark matter}} {{substructure}} within galaxy cluster haloes {{is a fundamental}} probe of the Lambda-CDM model of structure formation. Gravitational lensing is a technique for measuring the total mass distribution which is independent {{of the nature of}} the gravitating matter, making it a vital tool for studying these dark-matter dominated objects. We present a new method for measuring weak gravitational lensing flexions, the gradients of the lensing shear field, to measure mass distributions on small angular scales. While previously published methods for measuring flexions focus on measuring derived properties of the lensed images, such as shapelet coefficients or surface brightness moments, our method instead fits a mass-sheet-transformation-invariant Analytic Image Model (AIM) to the each galaxy image. This simple parametric model <b>traces</b> the <b>distortion</b> of lensed image isophotes and constrains the flexion fields. We test the AIM method using simulated data images with realistic noise and a variety of unlensed image properties, and show that it successfully reproduces the input flexion fields.

The ΔTEC map in Fig. 2 shows that there coexisted two types of TEC perturbations; a patchy pattern of TEC enhancement was noted at Kokubunji, which can be distinguished from the concentric pattern. The patchy pattern moved fast out of this area (Tsugawa et al., 2011). The unique signature of the ionogram distortion and its short duration time at Kokubunji might be related to this type of TEC disturbance.|$|R

40|$|Measuring {{galaxy cluster}} total masses {{and the amount}} of dark matter {{substructure}} within galaxy cluster haloes is a fundamental probe of the ACDM model of structure formation, as well as the interactions between baryonic and non-baryonic matter. In this thesis I approach the topic of cluster mass structure in two ways. With a combination of optical imaging, spectroscopy, and X-ray observations I determine that the cluster RCS 043938 - 2904. 7, while apparently anomalous initially due to its high optical richness and low X-ray surface brightness, is in fact an association of structures along the line of sight. Accounting for this structure brings the observed cluster properties into agreement with known scaling relations. I also present a novel method for measuring weak gravitational lensing flexion to inform mass measurements on small scales. While previously published methods for measuring flexion focus on measuring derived properties of the lensed images, such as shapelet coefficients or surface brightness moments, my method fits a fully mass-sheet-invariant parametrized Analytic Image Model (AIM) to the each galaxy image. This simple parametric model <b>traces</b> the <b>distortion</b> of lensed image isophotes. I tested the AIM method using simulated data images with realistic noise and a variety of input image properties, and I show that it successfully reproduces the input lensing fields.

Retinal images typically have a limited field of view, and multiple images can be joined together using an image registration technique to form a montage with a larger field of view. A variety of methods for retinal image registration have been proposed, but evaluating such methods objectively is difficult {{due to the lack}} of a reference standard for the true alignment of the individual images that make up the montage. A method of generating simulated retinal images by modeling the geometric distortions due to the eye geometry and the image acquisition process is described in this paper.

It considers the last two works by Joyce, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, as points of departure for the post-war literary avant-gardes in Great Britain, the USA, and France, in a period generally called "postmodern.

The Joycean exploration of the materiality of language is considered as comprising three stimuli: the conception of writing as concrete <b>trace,</b> susceptible to <b>distortion</b> or effacement; the understanding of literary language as a forgery of the words of others; and the project of creating a personal idiom as an "autonomous" language for a truly modern literature.

40|$|Background: Structural {{changes in}} {{molecules}} are frequently observed during biological processes like replication, transcription and translation. These structural changes {{can usually be}} <b>traced</b> to specific <b>distortions</b> in the backbones of the macromolecules involved. Quantitative energetic characterization of such distortions can greatly advance the atomic-level understanding of the dynamic character of these biological processes. Methodology/Principal Findings: Molecular dynamics simulations combined with {{a variation of the}} Weighted Histogram Analysis Method for potential of mean force determination are applied to characterize localized structural changes for the test case of cytosine (underlined) base flipping in a GTCAGCGCATGG DNA duplex. Free energy landscapes for backbone torsion and sugar pucker degrees of freedom in the DNA are used to understand their behavior in response to the base flipping perturbation. By simplifying the base flipping structural change into a two-state model, a free energy difference of upto 14 kcal/mol {{can be attributed to the}} flipped state relative to the stacked Watson-Crick base paired state. This two-state classification allows precise evaluation of the effect of base flipping on local backbone degrees of freedom. Conclusions/Significance: The calculated free energy landscapes of individual backbone and sugar degrees of freedom expectedly show the greatest change in the vicinity of the flipping base itself, but specific delocalized effects can be discerned upto four nucleotide positions away in both 59 and 39 directions.

But, despite the importance of these clays, their structures are controversial. Two competing models exist, each with profoundly different consequences for the understanding of diagenetic processes: model A views such interstratified clays as a stacking of layers identical to endmember illite and smectite layers, implying discrete and independently formed units (fundamental particles) (5), whereas model B views the clays as composed of crystallites with a unique structure that maintains coherency over much greater distances, in line with local charge balance about interlayers(6). Here we use first-principles density-functional theory to explore the energetics and structures of these two models for an illite-smectite interstratified clay mineral with a ratio of 1 : 1 and a Reichweite parameter of 1. We find that the total energy of model B is 2. 3 kJ atom(- 1) mol(- 1) lower than that of model A, and that this energy difference can be <b>traced</b> to structural <b>distortions</b> in model A due to local charge imbalance.
