Studies have shown that one modification has the tendency to influence whether another modification will take place.

[...] In 4 breast cancer cell lines, SFRP1 expression was significantly restored after treatment with DAC alone.

[...] Interestingly, a different breast cancer cell line (SKBR3, showed loss of SFRP1 expression without significant methylation of the SFRP1 promoter.

[...] After SKBR3 cells were treated with TSA, SFRP1 expression was restored in a dose- and time-dependent manner. [...] Yet another breast cancer cell line (T47D) required both DAC and TSA to upregulate SFRP1 expression. [...] This indicates that T47D cells are tightly regulated by two layers of epigenetic control (DNA methylation and histion deacetylation) and relieving inhibition by both mechanisms is necessary for reactivation of SFRP1. [...] This study shows that both the epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation and histone deacetylation, are involved in silencing of SFRP1.|$|E

We {{have used this}} locus as a model to study at high resolution changes in chromatin structure both in chicken cell lines representing various stages of macrophage differentiation and in primary cells from transgenic mice. In this study we have addressed {{the question of whether}} chromatin rearrangements can be detected in myeloid precursor cells at a stage well before overt transcription of the lysozyme gene begins. In addition to restriction enzyme accessibility assays and DMS footprinting, we have applied new, very sensitive techniques to assay for chromatin changes. Particularly informative was UV photofootprinting, using terminal transferase-dependent PCR and nonradioactive detection. We find that the basic chromatin structure in lysozyme nonexpressing hematopoietic precursor cells is highly similar to the pattern found in fully differentiated lysozyme-expressing cells. In addition, we find that only in nonexpressing cells are dimethylsulfate footprints and UV photofootprints affected by <b>trichostatin,</b> <b>an</b> inhibitor of histone deacetylation.

While protamines are the major component responsible for sperm chromatin packaging, {{a small amount of}} histones is also retained, the relevant role of which has been recently highlighted in influencing early embryo development. We hypothesized that paternal histone modifications are implicated in the process of sperm chromatin disassembly in the zygote, addressing this issue in nGPx 4 KO mice as experimental model. We first assessed the presence of acetylated histones in cauda epididymal sperm from WT mouse and by immunofluorescence we were then able to detect hyperacetylated histone H 4 in mature sperm partially decondensed by treatment with glutathione and heparin. Western blot analysis of hyperacetylated histone H 4 and histone H 3 acetylated at K 9 and K 14 showed significant higher amounts of modified histones in nGPx 4 KO sperm compared to WT sperm. When WT sperm chromatin status was analyzed in zona pellucida free oocytes fertilized in vitro in the presence of <b>trichostatin</b> (TSA), <b>a</b> faster decondensation kinetics was observed compared to untreated sperm. Having a higher content of acetylated histones, nGPx 4 KO sperm did not show any decondensation following TSA treatment. In addition the analysis of DNA methylation pattern of the paternally imprinted gene Igf 2 /H 19 showed a significant hypomethylation in KO sperm compared to WT ones.

40|$|Male {{fertility}} {{is declining}} and an underlying cause {{may be due}} to environment-epigenetic interactions in developing sperm, yet nothing is known of how the epigenome controls gene expression in sperm development. Histone methylation and acetylation are dynamically regulated in spermatogenesis and are sensitive to the environment. Our objectives were to determine how histone H 3 methylation and acetylation contribute to the regulation of key genes in spermatogenesis. A germ cell line, GC- 1, was exposed to either the control, or the chromatin modifying drugs tranylcypromine (T), an inhibitor of the histone H 3 demethylase KDM 1 (lysine specific demethylase 1), or <b>trichostatin</b> (TSA), <b>an</b> inhibitor of histone deacetylases, (HDAC). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to identify genes that were sensitive to treatment. As a control for specificity the Myod 1 (myogenic differentiation 1) gene was analyzed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by qPCR was used to measure histone H 3 methylation and acetylation at the promoters of target genes and the control, Myod 1. Remarkably, the chromatin modifying treatment specifically induced the expression of spermatogonia expressed genes Pou 5 f 1 and Gfra 1. ChIP-qPCR revealed that induction of gene expression was associated with a gain in gene activating histone H 3 methylation and acetylation in Pou 5 f 1 and Gfra 1 promoters, whereas CpG DNA methylation was not affected.

40|$|Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is {{the enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{synthesis}} of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the main donor of methyl groups in the cell. In mammals MAT {{is the product of}} two genes, MAT 1 A and MAT 2 A. MAT 1 A is expressed only in the mature liver whereas fetal hepatocytes, extrahepatic tissues and liver cancer cells express MAT 2 A. The mechanisms behind the tissue and differentiation state specific MAT 1 A expression are not known. In the present work we examined MAT 1 A promoter methylation status by means of methylation sensitive restriction enzyme analysis. Our data indicate that MAT 1 A promoter is hypomethylated in liver and hypermethylated in kidney and fetal rat hepatocytes, indicating that this modification is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. Immunoprecipitation of mononucleosomes from liver and kidney tissues with antibodies mainly specific to acetylated histone H 4 and subsequent Southern blot analysis with a MAT 1 A promoter probe demonstrated that MAT 1 A expression is linked to elevated levels of chromatin acetylation. Early changes in MAT 1 A methylation are already observed in the precancerous cirrhotic livers from rats, which show reduced MAT 1 A expression. Human hepatoma cell lines in which MAT 1 A is not expressed were also hypermethylated at this locus. Finally we demonstrate that MAT 1 A expression is reactivated in the human hepatoma cell line HepG 2 treated with 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine or the histone deacetylase inhibitor <b>trichostatin,</b> suggesting <b>a</b> role for DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation in MAT 1 A silencing...|$|R

Alignment of the HIC 1 and HRG 22 proteins from various species highlighted a perfectly conserved GLDLSKK/R motif highly related to the consensus CtBP interaction motif (PXDLSXK/R), except for {{the replacement of the}} virtually invariant proline by a glycine. HIC 1 strongly interacts with mCtBP 1 both in vivo and in vitro through this conserved GLDLSKK motif, thus extending the CtBP consensus binding site. The BTB/POZ domain does not interact with mCtBP 1, but the dimerization of HIC 1 through this domain is required for the interaction with mCtBP 1. When tethered to DNA by fusion with the Gal 4 DNA-binding domain, the HIC 1 central region represses transcription through interactions with CtBP in <b>a</b> <b>trichostatin</b> A-sensitive manner.

40|$|HDAC 10 {{belongs to}} the class II histone deacetylase family; however, its {{functions}} remain enigmatic. We report here that the HDAC 10 protein complex contained deacetylated chaperone protein hsc 70, and HDAC 10 relieved repression of melanogenesis by decreasing the repressional activity of two transcriptional regulators, paired box protein 3 (Pax 3) and KRAB-associated protein 1 (KAP 1). HDAC 10 physically interacted with Pax 3 and KAP 1 in a ternary complex and maintained Pax 3 and KAP 1 in a deacetylated state. Deacetylated Pax 3 and KAP 1 derepressed promoters of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and melanocyte-specific tyrosinase-related protein 1 and 2 (TRP- 1 and TRP- 2), three genes of the melanogenesis cascade, in <b>a</b> <b>trichostatin</b> A-sensitive manner. Co-occupancy of melanogenic promoters by HDAC 10, Pax 3, and KAP 1 only happened in cells of the melanocyte lineage, and KAP 1 facilitated nuclear enrichment of HDAC 10.

40|$|We {{present for}} the first time that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC 6) regulates EGFR {{degradation}} and trafficking along microtubules in Pkd 1 mutant renal epithelial cells. HDAC 6, the microtubule-associated a-tubulin deacetylase, demonstrates increased expression and activity in Pkd 1 mutant mouse embryonic kidney cells. Targeting HDAC 6 with a general HDAC inhibitor, <b>trichostatin</b> (TSA), or <b>a</b> specific HDAC 6 inhibitor, tubacin, increased the acetylation of a-tubulin and downregulated the expression of EGFR in Pkd 1 mutant renal epithelial cells. HDAC 6 was co-localized with EGF induced endocytic EGFR and endosomes, respectively. Inhibition of the activity of HDAC 6 accelerated the trafficking of EGFR from early endosomes to late endosomes along the microtubules. Without EGF stimulation EGFR was randomly distributed while after stimulation with EGF for 30 min, EGFR was accumulated around a-tubulin labeled microtubule bundles. These data suggested that the Pkd 1 mutation induced upregulation of HDAC 6 might act to slow the trafficking of EGFR from early endosomes to late endosomes along the microtubules for degradation through deacetylating a-tubulin. In addition, inhibition of HDAC activity decreased the phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2, the downstream target of EGFR axis, and normalized EGFR localization from apical to basolateral in Pkd 1 knockout mouse kidneys.

30|$|Yet, {{the above}} {{findings}} did not resolve the main question: i.e. {{to what extent}} the recorded level of exacerbation of organ injury/dysfunction was responsible for the acute mortality. We attempted to address it, at least partly, by comparing CLP-Only to mild CLP with administered CCl 4 and cisplatin to provoke an added exacerbation of organ injury/dysfunction (see respective sections in ‘Methods’). Remarkably, although organ injury and glycemic deregulation in septic ODam mice either approximately equaled (based on urea and glucose) or dramatically exceeded (based on ALT and LDH) the ones recorded in DIED CLP-Only mice, they did not lead to death. It must be noted that comparison of those two experimental setups (i.e. CLP-Only and CLP-ODam) is not ideal considering the dissimilar release mechanism of the measured biomarkers: pronounced hepatocyte (cirrhotic) necrosis caused ALT/LDH secretion in CLP-ODam mice [26], while their release in sepsis (i.e. CLP-Only) can be attributed to circulatory disturbances (e.g. decreased arterial hepatic blood flow) rather than necrosis/apoptosis [1]. Nevertheless, two assumptions can be risked based on the above data. First, the pathophysiological origin of the damage (e.g. presence of comorbidity) can dramatically alter the circulation dynamics of a given organ injury/function parameter(s) in the CLP model (and sepsis in general). Second, even when the elevation of those parameters is very high, it should not be automatically judged as indication of a lethal organ failure and the main cause of early death in CLP sepsis. A recent study by Peng et al. [40] demonstrated a similar ‘mismatch’ phenomenon: an improved survival in antibiotic-treated CLP (24 to 28  weeks old) rats coincided with a much higher severity of AKI (defined by RIFLE score) compared to rats with milder AKI but an exacerbated mortality. In related examples, <b>a</b> <b>trichostatin</b> A-dependent improvement of CLP-induced hepatic injury in C 57 BL/ 6 mice did not increase their survival, and a similar lack of survival advantage was true in the CORTICUS trial septic patients in whom hydrocortisone treatment strongly attenuated organ injury [41].|$|R

Rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione known to activate the glycerol biogenesis pathway, increases PDK4 mRNA transcription in white adipose tissue, but not in liver or muscle tissue.

This is done through a proposed phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway. In fact, even when cells are exposed to dexamethasone to increase mRNA expression, insulin blocks this effect. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors also regulate expression; interestingly, PPAR alpha and delta were found to upregulate PDK4 mRNA, but PPAR gamma activation downregulated expression.|$|E
