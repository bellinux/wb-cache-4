5|$|Around Playford, much {{activity}} was occurring. Legislation provided for <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> {{he was to}} inherit later as Premier: aggressive economic initiatives, a malapportioned electoral system and a staid internal party organisation. The state had been persistently in deficit in recent times, and as an agriculture-dominant state, {{had been at the}} mercy of commodity prices, so a strategy of industrialisation was initiated under the guidance of senior politicians, public servants and industrialists. The creation of the LCL was dependent on the implementation of various policies to ensure the strength of the party's country faction. There had been an electoral bias in favour of rural areas since the Constitution Act of 1857, but it was now to dramatically increase. In 1936, legislation was brought in that stipulated that electoral districts were to be malapportioned to a ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of country areas. In addition, the 46 multimember districts were replaced with 39 single-member districts—13 in Adelaide and 26 in the country. Over the next three decades, Adelaide's population grew until it had triple the population of the country, but the distribution of seats in the legislature gave rural voters a disproportionate influence by a factor of six. The desired long-term effect was to lock the opposition Labor Party out of power; the unexpected short-term effect was a large number of dissatisfied rural independents in the 1938 election. Although he played no part in its development or implementation, the electoral system gerrymander was later christened the 'Playmander', {{as a result of its}} benefit to Playford, and his failure to take action towards reforming it.|$|E

25|$|The Saga of Eric the Red further relates {{that around}} her neck she wore a {{necklace}} of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of amadou from which hung a large pouch, where she hid <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which were white and fluffy inside.|$|E

25|$|During Discoverys {{first full}} day on orbit, the crew used the SRMS to grapple the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) and survey the wing leading edges, nose {{and other parts}} of the Thermal Protection System (TPS), as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) Pods. During this time some of the crew were {{preparing}} the space suits that will be used during the 3 Extra-vehicular activities (EVA) and setting up <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> will be used during the docking. This includes installing the Centerline Camera and extending the Orbiter Docking system Ring Extension.|$|E
25|$|Despite its low capital costs, {{the camp}} economy {{suffered}} from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks {{in just three}} years. But the greatest problem was simple – forced labor was less efficient than free labor. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free laborers in the USSR at the time, which may be partially explained by malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|Below the gun deck was {{the cargo}} hold where the {{passengers}} kept {{most of their}} food stores and other supplies. Other items included most of their clothing and bedding. The hold also stored the passengers' personal weapons and military equipment – armor, muskets, gunpowder, and shot, as well as swords and bandoliers. It also stored all <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> the Pilgrims would need, {{as well as all}} the equipment and utensils needed to prepare meals in the New World. It is also known that some Pilgrims loaded trade goods on board, including Isaac Allerton, William Mullins, and possibly others; these also most likely were stored in the cargo hold.|$|E

25|$|Maritime-adapted hunter-gatherers {{are people}} who have learned to harvest the {{resources}} of the sea and for whom marine foods make up the majority of their diets. In the material left by ancient people, archaeologists look for the kinds of food people were eating as well as <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> they used to collect and process that food. In cultural deposits, if the remains of fish, shellfish, marine mammals and seabirds make up a majority of the faunal assemblage, and tools used to fish, hunt marine mammals and seabirds are found in the same context, the people would be considered to be maritime-adapted. Such is the case for the El Paraiso people.|$|E
25|$|During flight day 4, the MPLM Leonardo was berthed to the Nadir (the Earth-facing port on Harmony) {{using the}} Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). Once it was berthed, the crews {{activated}} it {{and opened the}} hatch for ingress. Some more items were transferred from the shuttle mid-deck including the MDS experiment and the space suits Danny Olivas and Nicole Stott would use during EVA 1. The pair also prepared all <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> would be used during the EVA with some help from Tim Kopra. Later during the night when the crews were asleep, the team of ground controllers vented the Port 1 (P1) Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) Nitrogen Vent lines {{in preparation for the}} ATA to be removed during EVA 1.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the crew}} day was spent on {{conducting}} the standard inspection of the thermal protection system (TPS). All six {{of the crew}} members participated {{at one point during}} this task. Once the inspection process had moved to the port wing, astronauts Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick began working on checking out and preparing the spacesuits that will be used during the mission's three spacewalks. Once the survey of the TPS was complete, Stephen Robinson and Kay Hire, with Bob Behnken joining once his spacesuit tasks were complete, began checking out and preparing <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> will be used during the rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS). These tools include a hand-held LIDAR gun used for finding out the closing rate of the shuttle and distance from the ISS, the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) which is the part of the shuttle that connects to the space station and a centerline camera in the ODS to assist the commander George Zamka during docking.|$|E

The SunTour name lived on as SR-SunTour, but the SunTour {{component}} designs did not survive. <b>The</b> <b>tooling</b> <b>that</b> produced <b>the</b> once-prized Suntour derailleurs, shifters, and associated bicycle components was sold for scrap.|$|R

25|$|On flight day 8, the Cupola was {{successfully}} moved from its launch location to its permanent {{location on the}} earth facing side of Tranquility. Cupola was moved by the space station robot arm (SSRMS), which was operated by Kay Hire and Terry Virts. ISS commander Jeff Williams assisted them by releasing the bolts and hooks that held the Cupola in place and then securing it to its new home. The process was slightly delayed due to some bolts that were torqued tighter than expected on the ground, but flight controllers were able to increase the torque to release the bolts. Once the move of the Cupola was complete, outfitting continued to get the cupola ready. The crew {{will be able to}} ingress it tomorrow, but the window covers will not be opened until after the third and final spacewalk. While the Cupola relocation was going on, some of the crew members participated in transferring items between the shuttle and station. Also during this time Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick prepared <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> they will use during the final spacewalk scheduled for flight day 10. During this time the pair re-sized another spacesuit on station for use by Behnken. This was done because the suit Behnken had been using had some problems with its communications equipment.|$|E

Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet and GPS to solve crimes. Paul McGuigan, who directed two episodes of Sherlock, says that this {{is in keeping with}} Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that [...] "n the books he would use any device possible and he was always in the lab doing experiments.

500|$|In the July 2001 {{edition of}} El Machete the EPB {{published}} a chronology of {{the involvement of}} the religious sector and the diverse independentist organizations in the protests at Vieques, emphasizing that they had kept their word by avoiding any kind of revolutionary acts while the peaceful civil disobedience was ongoing. The organization then mentioned <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> they felt the government could employ against them, led by the laws and the justice system, law enforcement and other agencies, [...] "economic influence and brides", the influence of politicians and complemented by Cuban exile [...] "counterevolutionaries in service of the CIA [...] and their Miami-based media". The group criticized the actions of Rosselló when dealing with the Navy, claiming that he placed the final action in the hand of the armed forces while accusing newly elected governor Sila Calderón of using the topic to her advantage but backtracking after ascending to power. The EPB concluded by stating that they would employ this time period to prepare, fortify and consolidate their operations, avoiding [...] "the provocations of the Navy". In other sections, the organization published an homage to the women involved in the protests. The group also recognized that Norma Burgos remained involved in the protests despite ideological differences, but criticized the actions of Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer, Jorge Santini, Kenneth McClintock and Edison Misla Aldarondo in support of the Navy.|$|E
