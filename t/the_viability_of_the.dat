5|$|In June 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. In early October, several test trains proved <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planned sub-3-hour schedules.

On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would begin on January 16, 1969.|$|E
5|$|In September 1950, on Collins' {{orders the}} Ranger Training Center {{was moved to}} Fort Benning, Georgia, and in October the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Ranger Companies began training.

As a result, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th Ranger Companies were ordered to form. Altogether, another fifteen Ranger companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and six of them would see combat in Korea.|$|E

Instead, they finished as the second-worst regular season team in the league, posting an 18–51–3 record. The Hitmen lost CAD$250,000 in their first season and saw their season ticket base halved to 700 for the 1996–97 season.

5|$|A {{decision}} by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all of its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small fleet of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks to replace its CH-47Ds in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's Foreign Military Sales program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{questions}} {{over the new}} ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E

5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually {{got to the point}} that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
5|$|He faced {{a similar}} {{challenge}} with the impoverished bishopric of Argyll in the 1240s. He {{was given the}} job of restoring <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diocese and installing a new bishop; this involved forming {{a close relationship with}} King Alexander II of Scotland. Clement was with the king during his campaign in Argyll in 1249 and was at his side when he died during this campaign. In 1250 Clement had been able to install a new bishop in Argyll and had become one of the Guardians appointed to govern Scotland during the minority of King Alexander III. By 1250 he had established {{a reputation as one of}} the most active Dominican reformers in Britain. Clement helped to elevate Edmund of Abingdon and Queen Margaret to sainthood. After his death, he received veneration as a saint himself, although he was never formally canonised.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the Bracks State Government {{investigated}} {{the construction of}} a heavy rail link to the airport under the Linking Victoria programme. Two options were considered; the first branched off the Craigieburn Suburban Line to the east, and the second branched off the Albion Goods Line, which passes close to the airport's boundary to the south. The second option was preferred. Market research concluded most passengers preferred travelling to the airport by taxi or car, and poor patronage of similar links in Sydney and Brisbane cast doubt on <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project. This led to the project being deferred until at least 2012. On 21 July 2008, the Premier of Victoria reaffirmed the government's commitment to a rail link and said that it would be considered within three to five years. To maximise future development options, the airport is lobbying for the on-grounds section of the railway to be underground.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

Some historians believe she was in New York at the time, ill with fever related to her childhood head injury. Others propose {{she may have been}} recruiting more escaped slaves in Ontario, and Kate Clifford Larson suggests she may have been in Maryland, recruiting for Brown's raid or attempting to rescue more family members.

5|$|The {{success of}} the LNC relied on taking over all, {{or at least a}} {{significant}} portion, of the burials of London's dead. However, while the Metropolitan Interment Amendment Act 1852 had repealed Chadwick's scheme for two very large cemeteries near London, it had also permitted London's parishes to make their own arrangements for the burial of their dead. Each parish could make arrangements with the cemetery of its choosing, or use money from the rates to create their own cemeteries. The financial mismanagement and internal disputes within the LNC had delayed the opening of Brookwood Cemetery by 18 months, and during this period new cemeteries nearer London had opened or were nearing completion. While some parishes did choose Brookwood as their burial site, many preferred either to make arrangements with less distant cemeteries, or to buy land on the outskirts of London and open their own suburban cemeteries. Concerns over the financial irregularities and <b>the</b> <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheme had led to only 15,000 of the 25,000 LNC shares being sold, severely limiting the company's working capital and forcing it to take out large loans. Buying the land from Lord Onslow, compensating local residents for the loss of rights over Woking Common, draining and landscaping the portion to be used for the initial cemetery, and building the railway lines and stations were all expensive undertakings. With far fewer burial contracts with London parishes than had been anticipated, by the time Brookwood Cemetery opened in November 1854 the LNC {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy.|$|E

40|$|The {{residential}} progressive electricity tariffs (RPETs) in South Korea {{were recently}} changed, which can significantly affect <b>the</b> economic <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar photovoltaic system. In this regard, this study aimed to investigate <b>the</b> economic impact <b>of</b> RPETs {{in implementing the}} building-integrated photovoltaic blind (BIPB) using an advanced finite element model. First, the nine-node-based finite element model with improved prediction accuracy for estimating <b>the</b> technical performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BIPB (FEM 9 -node BIPB) was developed. Second, the life cycle cost approach {{was used to evaluate}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> RPETs on <b>the</b> economic <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BIPB in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy demand and supply. <b>The</b> main findings <b>of</b> this study can be summarized as follows. First, <b>the</b> prediction accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developed FEM 9 -node BIPB was proved to be superior to the existing model, in which the estimation results can be found within a short time in an easy way. Second, considering the RPETs, it showed a tendency that the higher <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> electricity consumption in a household was, the more improved <b>the</b> economic <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BIPB became. However, it should be also analyzed which tariff zones in the RPETs can be covered by <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> electricity generated from the BIPB, because it can significantly affect <b>the</b> economic <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BIPB. Third, after <b>the</b> revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RPETs, <b>the</b> economic <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BIPB under the grid-connected utilization plan was determined to be superior.
