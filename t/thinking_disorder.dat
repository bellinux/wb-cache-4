40|$|Two {{traditionally}} opposed but not neces-sarily {{mutually exclusive}} explanationshave been advanced to explain schizo-phrenic <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder</b> and, particularly, {{to explain the}} concept-forming disturbance. The first explanation {{is that there is}} a primary loss of ability. The second is that there is what might be called an increased distractibility, i. e., an inappropriate utilization of distracting material which is connected in various ways to the matter at hand. This first explanation is expounded most clearly in the writings of those who view the <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder</b> in terms of the "concrete-abstract " dimension. Promi-nent in this school is Goldstein (14), who conceives the loss of the "abstract attitude" as the cause not only of the lowered ability to perform on his conceptual tests but also of a wide variety of other thinking aberrations. In his view, inappropriate responses occur by default when the patient does not have avail-able a correct conceptual response. The second point of view is that the schizo-phrenic has not lost ability per se, but is pre-vented from demonstrating his ability by an over-responsiveness to distracting material. Cameron (4, 5) has most vigorously espoused this point of view in his controversy with Hanfmann and Kasanin (IS). Three previous studies (8, 9, 10) have demonstrated that over-responsiveness to various kinds of distracters accounts in part for the lowered performance of schizophrenics. It has been shown that a differential over-responsiveness to certain kinds of stimuli rather than others may account for some clin-ically observable features of the <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder.</b> In each of these studies, there was introduced, as the independent variable...|$|E

40|$|Seventy-one {{schizophrenic}} and nonschizophrenic {{hospitalized patients}} were assessed on three scales for aspects {{indicative of a}} <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder</b> on the Rorschach: disruption of logical thought, irrelevant or personalized associations, and elaboration in affective terms. Each scale could be reliably scored according to the criteria described. The scales correlated significantly with other Rorschach scores suggestive of thought disorder. All three scales were significantly higher in schizophrenic patients than in depressed patients (f <. 05). In addition, {{two of the three}} scales were related (p <. 01) to ratings of bizarre behavior. The results suggest that the scales can be used to investigate the nature of <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder.</b> One of the few areas of apparent agreement on the topic of schizophrenia is that the syndrome involves a thought disorder. But there are various descriptions of what constitutes the central aspect of cognitive deficit, or thought disorder, including paralogical thinking, interference by affective stimuli, intrusion of irrelevant associations, failure to maintain set, disruption of attention, and failure of reality testing (e. g., Buss & Lang, 1965; Weiner, 1966). The Rorschach suggests itself as a useful measure for assessing thought disorder. A number of facets of the Rorschach have been studied as indicators of a thought disorder. Rapaport, Gill, and Schafer (1946, 1968) reported the frequencies of various types of deviant verbalization such as fabulized responses, fabulized combination, confabulations, contaminations, autistic logic, peculiar and queer verbalizations, and self-references. By and large, these types of responses occur more often in the protocols of schizophrenics, seldom in the protocols of neurotics, and rarely in the protocols of a highway patrol sample of "normal " 5 s. To circumvent the statistical problems accompanying the use of infrequently occurring response categories, a number of investigations have devised methods of weighting each class of deviant response to arrive at single scores representing the degree of thinking disturbance. Such a scale, using weights for the original categories described b...|$|E
40|$|A {{prospective}} study of 45 cases of unipolar depression {{was conducted with}} the aim to examine the hypothesis that cognitive disorder predisposes to depression. The data indicated {{that the absence of}} the cognitive disorder during remission was statistically significant in 41 cases who remitted. Of the latter, 27 were free from cognitive disorder, while 14 continued with it. This fails to support the causal role of the cognitive disorder. It was also observed that those with persisting cognitive disorder in remission ran the risk of early relapse. It is suggested that persistence of cognitive disorder in remission could be a predictor of early relapse and offers the possibility of using cognitive behavioural therapy for such select cases.

40|$|Objectives: Ayahuasca (AYA), {{a natural}} {{psychedelic}} brew prepared from Amazonian plants and rich in dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and harmine, causes effects of subjective well-being and may therefore have antidepressant actions. This {{study sought to}} evaluate {{the effects of a}} single dose of AYA in six volunteers with a current depressive episode. Methods: Open-label trial conducted in an inpatient psychiatric unit. Results: Statistically significant reductions of up to 82 % in depressive scores were observed between baseline and 1, 7, and 21 days after AYA administration, as measured on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Montgomery-&# 197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Anxious-Depression subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). AYA administration resulted in nonsignificant changes in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores and in the <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder</b> subscale of the BPRS, suggesting that AYA does not induce episodes of mania and/or hypomania in patients with mood disorders and that modifications in thought content, which could indicate psychedelic effects, are not essential for mood improvement.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} aggression in the first 24 hours after admission and severity of psychopathology in psychiatric inpatients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included psychiatric patients admitted to Hospital Universitário de Santa Maria, in Santa Maria, southern Brazil, from August 2012 to January 2013. At their arrival at the hospital, patients were interviewed {{to fill in the}} Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) form, and any aggressive episodes in the first 24 hours after admission were recorded using the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare patients according to aggressiveness: aggressive versus non-aggressive, hostile versus violent, and aggressive against others only versus self-aggressive. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 110 patients. Aggressive patients in general had higher BPRS total scores (p = 0. 002) and individual component scores, and their results showed more activation (p < 0. 001) and <b>thinking</b> <b>disorders</b> (p = 0. 009), but less anxious-depression (p = 0. 008).

The objective of our study was the analysis of specific way in which patients with delusion disorders ascribe meanings to events. Method. The test group included 30 patients with delusional disorder, of both sexes, aged between 30 and 53, without serious organic or somatic disorders. In {{order to determine the}} specific attribution system, through a wider frame of cognitive style, Rorschach’s cognitive techniques was applied. RESULTS An average value of MMSE score amounted to 28. 43 and IQ - to 103. 86. The data were evaluated by Comprehensive interpretation system of John Exner, and only those parameters were used that were the most indicative for this analysis. Patients with delusional disorder belonged to ambitent experience type, which pointed to inconsistency because the role of emotions varied during the process of decision making. Processing quality was temporarily significantly reduced to less mature and unsophisticated level, especially in complex situations. Thinking was strongly fixed and inflexible. More than other people, they applied intellectualization in order to annihilate affective experiences, leading thus to delusional <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder</b> in extreme cases. Sometimes, internal conflicts between high self value and awareness that it might not be valid, could lead to delusional expressions, if the environment was especially unsupportive. Conclusion. Attribution style of patients with DD is externalized and implies the ascribing of negative experiences to another person’s action. Marked self-centering and experience of increased personal value dominate over the perception of the environment in these patients, while discrepancy between real self and an ideal is decreased by specific ascribing...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{correlation}} of circRNAs' expression level to the negative- and positive symptoms of patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Methods Gene chip screening was performed with the peripheral blood samples from each five of SZ patients and normal controls. Nine circRNAs showing differentiate expression were confirmed, and further verification was done by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR in 102 SZ patients and 103 normal controls. All the SZ patients were assessed with Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS). Results It was revealed that the expression levels of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 102315, circRNA_ 104597, circRNA_ 101835 and circRNA_ 101836 were significantly down-regulated (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and circRNA_ 103102 and circRNA_ 103704 were up-regulated in SZ group (P< 0. 01). The ΔCT value of circRNA_ 102101 and circRNA_ 103102 was positively correlated to the positive symptoms (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and the ΔCT value of circRNA_ 103704 also showed positive correlation with positive symptoms and general psychopathological symptoms (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). The ΔCT values of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 102315, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were correlated with <b>thinking</b> <b>disorder</b> (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and the ΔCT values of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 104597, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were correlated with the activation (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). The ΔCT values of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were positively correlated with paranoid (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05), and of circRNA_ 102101, circRNA_ 103102, circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102802 were markedly correlated with assault (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). Therefore, circRNA_ 103704 was chosen into regressive equation of positive symptoms (P< 0. 01), and circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 102315 were chosen into regressive equation of general pathological findings (P< 0. 01 or P< 0. 05). Conclusion The expression levels of circRNA_ 103704 and circRNA_ 103102 are obviously up-regulated in SZ patients than in normal controls, and markedly correlated with the negative and positive SZ symptoms, so might be the dominant regulatory factors in the pathological process of schizophrenia.

METHODS: Videotaped speech samples of four groups of high-functioning, latency-aged children with MCDD, AD, ADHD, and anxiety disorders were compared to a control group of normal children using the Kiddie Formal Thought Disorder Rating Scale (K-FTDS). RESULTS: High formal thought disorder scores were found both in the AD and MCDD groups, low rates in the ADHD groups, and no thought disorder in the anxiety disorder and normal control groups. The severity of formal thought disorder was related to verbal IQ scores within the AD and MCDD groups.

The aim of the present paper is to better understand if delusional thought (mainly of paranoid type) {{is at the end of}} the spectrum of heuristic thinking biases (in particular of social and attributional biases), rather than regard it as a discontinuity from the form of thought shared among individuals. Methods: Cochrane analysis of the literature with following key words: euristic biases, paranoid delusions, self-esteem, moral disengagement. Results: Literature data are sufficiently unique in considering that among the factors that interfere with the process of restriction, favoring the onset of delusional thinking, as well as some mental states (anger, mood swings, emotional lability, fear, anxiety), might be considered heuristic biases that are intended to preserve the self-esteem (either an overt or deep).

Design Single-case study of neurological patient HCM and an age-matched comparison group of neurologically Healthy Controls. Methods We administered a full battery of tests assessing general intelligence, memory, and executive functioning. To assess autobiographical memory, the Autobiographical Memory Interview (Kopelman, Wilson, & Baddeley, 1990. The Autobiographical Memory Interview. Bury St. Edmunds, UK: Thames Valley Test Company) was administered. The Past Episodic and Future Episodic sections of Dalla Barba's Confabulation Battery (Dalla Barba, 1993, Cogn. Neuropsychol., 1, 1) and a specifically tailored Mental Time Travel Questionnaire were administered to assess future thinking in HCM and age-matched controls. Results HCM presented with a deficit in forming new memories (anterograde amnesia) and recalling events from before the onset of neurological impairment (retrograde amnesia). HCM's autobiographical memory impairments are characterized by a paucity of memories from Recent Life. In comparison with controls, two features of his future thoughts are apparent: Reduced episodic future thinking and outdated content of his episodic future thoughts. Conclusions This article suggests neuropsychologists should look beyond popular conceptualizations of the past–future relation in amnesia via focussing on reduced future thinking.

On the other hand, patients with a clouded consciousness, referred to as [...] "organic" [...] patients, usually do demonstrate awareness and concern, and complain about being [...] "confused" [...] or [...] "unable to think straight"; Clayton and Winokur suggest that this is because their thought disorder results, instead, from various cognitive deficits.|$|R

Significant {{differences were found}} in each of these domains. Rape offenders {{were more likely to have}} histories of high violence offenses other than sexual offense, including murder, serious juvenile offenses, and both juvenile and adult sexual offenses. Rape offenders were more likely to show lower intellectual functioning and diffuse brain dysfunction associated predominantly with temporal and prefrontal brain cortices. Rape offenders were also more likely to display psychological functioning associated with illogical <b>thinking</b> and <b>disordered</b> attachment but less immature self-focus and fewer feelings of alienation than demonstrated by molest offenders. Implications for treatment and social policy for sexual offenders are suggested. Logistic regression demonstrated that these neuropsychological measures resulted in 71. 7 % accurate prediction and Rorschach measures resulted in 79. 2 % accurate prediction in differentiating rape from molest offenders. Implications for theoretical understanding of sexual offending are discussed...|$|R

The latter problem arises because they are either grouped with people who do meet crite...|$|R
