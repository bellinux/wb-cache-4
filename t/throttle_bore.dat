2500|$|The Valiant was {{completely}} redesigned for 1967 model {{year and the}} station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly-styled Barracuda, which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style. [...] The new Valiant model range included 2- and 4-door sedans on a newly lengthened [...] wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical taillights were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the [...] Slant-6 engine was raised from [...] to [...] by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 carburetors using the larger [...] <b>throttle</b> <b>bore</b> previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller [...] carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine. [...] Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; shoulder belt mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way hazard flasher, and, for 1970, lane-change directional signals were included.|$|E
5000|$|The Yamaha AT1 was {{available}} in three different models, each corresponding to the year of production. 1969 Yamaha AT1, 1970 Yamaha AT1B, 1971 Yamaha AT1C. Each year the AT1 was also available in the Motocross edition designated by an M. The M models were {{very similar to the}} regular models other than a few performance enhancing features, such as weight reduction, higher compression ratio, tuned exhaust, larger carburetor with 26 mm <b>throttle</b> <b>bore,</b> tuned gearing ratio, etc.|$|E
50|$|Weber carburetors {{are marked}} with a model code on the {{mounting}} flange, the body, or {{on the cover of}} the float-chamber. This begins with a number which originally indicated the diameter (in millimetres) of the <b>throttle</b> <b>bore,</b> but later lost this significance. If this number has a single pair of digits, both chokes are of the same diameter and operate together; if it has two pairs of digits separated by a stroke (e.g. 28/36), there are primary and secondary chokes that are opened one after the other, usually of differing diameter. These numbers are followed by a group of letters, which indicates various features: the DCOE is a sidedraught unit, all others being downdraught; the DCD has a piston-type starter valve as opposed to a strangler choke; and so on. After the letters there will be a further number, which may be followed by a letter, e.g. 4B, 13A; these indicate the series. The full designation might be 40 DCOE 29, 45 DCOE 9, etc.|$|E
5000|$|The spread-bore four-barrel carburetor, first {{released}} by Rochester in the 1965 model {{year as the}} [...] "Quadrajet" [...] has a much greater spread between the sizes of the primary and secondary <b>throttle</b> <b>bores.</b> The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary Venturis, each of the secondary throats has an air valve at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate, and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The air valve opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the air valve is linked to metering rods which are raised as the air valve opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.|$|R
50|$|Both the 4300A and 4300D {{are unique}} {{by virtue of}} having spread <b>bore</b> <b>throttle</b> plate designs (the 4300A being much less {{pronounced}} than the 4300D) that are unique to these carburetors and their relative intake mainfolds.|$|R
40|$|During {{the moving}} of vehicle {{is a change}} in {{temperature}} mode, which arises due to fluid friction in the dissipative element (<b>throttle</b> <b>bores)</b> hydropneumatic spring. In this case, hydropneumatic spring can be warm to significant temperatures. Due to lower viscosity of the fluid below the warning level, the increased heat causes a sharp increase in various types of leakage, increased friction parts, and as a consequence, the intensive wear and seizure of the surfaces. This leads to partial or complete loss of efficiency hydropneumatic springs. To changes in temperature mode in the hydropneumatic spring is influenced not only the external surface of the hydropneumatic spring, temperature and speed of blowing air flow, but also the conditions and the duration of the moving of vehicle. In this paper we investigate the heat intensity of the hydropneumatic springs of vehicle in weight 5. 5 tons during the moving at different speeds for different types of roads. Investigations were carried out on the basis of mathematical models realized in a package of Matlab Simulink. In this case, was fixed the time average power released in the hydropneumatic spring in the form of heat. According to the research conclusions were drawn about the most heavy-duty vehicle and the amount of heat generated by the length of relative motion in this mode. To prevent overheating, an algorithm diagnosis of the condition and management of heat intensity of the hydropneumatic springs Also made recommendations to reduce the heat intensity hydropneumatic springs...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "short block" [...] of {{the engine}} {{is the same as}} other Land Rover 4.6 HSE models. Short-blocks used for the 4.6L Callaway engines were stamped with a 9.60:1 {{compression}} ratio marking from Land Rover. The increase of 0.25 points, up from the standard 4.6L compression ratio of 9.35:1 was achieved by a modification to the cylinder heads. The cylinder heads were also modified to improve the airflow {{into and out of the}} combustion chambers. The inlet manifold gasket front valley clamp has been changed to accommodate the heater hose positioning on the bottom front of the Callaway manifold. The ram pipe housing has been modified by shortening the ram pipe tube lengths. The intake runner lengths were tuned to increase both power and torque. The black plastic air inlet tube was replaced with a larger diameter fancy looking carbon fiber inlet tube to match the larger <b>throttle</b> <b>bore</b> in the plenum. The air cleaner box base was modified to increase the airflow. The Lucas GEMS ECU was calibrated to support the mechanical changes to the Callaway engine (the Callaway engine had the same basic FI as in 1998 and did not have the Bosch system that was on other 1999 HSEs).|$|E
5000|$|The Valiant was {{completely}} redesigned for 1967 model {{year and the}} station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly-styled Barracuda, which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style. The new Valiant model range included 2- and 4-door sedans on a newly lengthened 108 in wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical taillights were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the 170 cuin L Slant-6 engine was raised from [...] to [...] by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 carburetors using the larger 1+11/16 in <b>throttle</b> <b>bore</b> previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller 1+9/16 in carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine. Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; shoulder belt mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way hazard flasher, and lane-change directional signals were also included.|$|E
50|$|The Alpha II has a {{cast iron}} engine block and {{aluminum}} DOHC cylinder heads with 4 valves per cylinder. It uses MFI fuel injection and features forged steel connecting rods. It has COP (Coil-On-Plug) ignition, graphite-coated pistons and new cylinder block design to increase strength. <b>Throttle</b> body <b>bore</b> {{has increased from}} 48 to 52 mm. The power and torque spread of the engine is across {{a wider range of}} engine speeds due to Continuously variable valve timing. Engine and automatic transmission control is now integrated into one module and the PCM is located in the engine compartment. It is ULEV-certified in all 50 U.S. states. The Alpha engine family is produced in Ulsan, South Korea.|$|R
5000|$|The LX9 3500 is an OHV engine {{based on}} the 3400 V6. It {{incorporates}} electronic <b>throttle</b> control. <b>Bore</b> is 94 mm, stroke is 84 mm for a displacement of 3498 cc (213 cu in). A GM Press Release for the 2004 Malibu described the 3500 thus: [...] "3.5L V6, will debut in the 2004 Chevrolet Malibu. The engine offers improved performance and fuel efficiency, and runs smoother and quieter than earlier generation V6 engines. The 3500 V6 features an advanced powertrain control module, improved fuel injection system, a redesigned exhaust manifold and a new catalytic converter contribute to reduced emissions, as well as improved efficiency and performance characteristics.

5000|$|Both the Syclone and Typhoon trucks {{featured}} a Mitsubishi TD06-17C 8 cm² turbocharger and Garrett water/air intercooler {{attached to a}} 4.3 L LB4 V6 engine with unique pistons, main caps, head gaskets, intake manifolds, fuel system, exhaust manifolds, and a 48mm twin <b>bore</b> <b>throttle</b> body from the 5.7 L GM Small-Block engine. All Syclones and Typhoons had a GM 700R4 4-speed automatic transmission. A Borg Warner all wheel drive transfer case split torque with 35% forward and 65% to the rear wheels. Both trucks featured sport modifications to the standard suspensions. The Syclone was the first production truck to receive a 4-wheel anti-lock braking system. Output was [...] and 350 lbft Nm. [...] The Syclone, when new, was capable of accelerating from 0-60 mph in 5.3 seconds and could do a quarter-mile run in 14.1 seconds at 93 mph according to Car & Driver's comparison test.|$|R
5000|$|One {{version of}} the fifth {{generation}} Prelude, a high-performance model called the Type S, was only available in Japan. It was equipped with the 2.2 L H22A, featuring VTEC and producing [...] at 7,200 rpm and 163 lbf·ft (221 N·m) at 6,500 rpm. With a compression ratio of 11.0:1, 87.0 mm bore x 90.7 mm stroke and VTEC-valve timing, lift and duration were adjusted to 12.2 mm intake and 11.2 mm exhaust. Honda also overhauled the air box {{and replaced it with}} a more efficient design that {{is often referred to as}} Dynamic Chambering, along with a larger <b>throttle</b> body design <b>bored</b> to 62 mm (as opposed to the previous 60 mm). The exhaust system was also treated to a redesign, with the pipe cross sections becoming more cylindrical rather than oval. The three-way catalytic converter was also increased in size, as well as the exhaust piping from 2 to 2¼ in (51 to 57 mm) (tToV). In addition to a higher output engine both Type S and USDM Type SH featured an overhauled front suspension layout which offered a more effective camber curve. The fifth generation curb weight was , and ground clearance was [...] Unlike the SiR S-spec that had an LSD, the Type S acquired the Honda technology known as the Active Torque Transfer System (ATTS). The gearing on the Type S matches all other fifth-generation Preludes that had a manual transmission except for the five-speed 2.2 VTi VTEC and had a final drive ratio of 4.266:1. The Type S had an Active Control ABS system, different from the others which had the standard ABS systems. The interior featured newly developed synthentic materials called Cabron and Excene to upholster the seats which most people see it as leather and alcantara laced with red stitching. Manufacturer styling options included seat lettering. The exterior styling of fifth generation Preludes was standardized for most models. All had a sunroof except for the Type S model.|$|R
