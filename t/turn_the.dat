5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a <b>turn.</b> <b>The</b> portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

5000|$|I {{have asked}} dozens of bicycle riders how they <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left. I have never found {{a single person}} who stated all the facts {{correctly}} when first asked. They almost invariably said that to <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar {{to the left and}} as a result made a <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left. But on further questioning them, some would agree that they first <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar a little to the right, and then as the machine inclined to <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar to the left and as a result made the circle, inclining inward.|$|R
5|$|In the 500m final, Ohno {{finished}} {{the race in}} second place behind Canada's Charles Hamelin. However, he was disqualified after impeding François-Louis Tremblay of Canada around the final <b>turn.</b> <b>The</b> silver medal went to Sung Si-Bak, with Tremblay taking the bronze.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Allenby's {{plan for}} 13 November was to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> right {{flank of the}} Ottoman line on the coast despite {{aircraft}} and cavalry reconnaissances revealing a considerable Ottoman force further inland on the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's own right flank. He assigned the task of dealing with this immediate threat to the Australian Mounted Division, which was ordered to make as big a demonstration of their operations as possible. This would further focus Ottoman {{attention away from the}} coastal sector where the Anzac and Yeomanry Mounted Divisions would advance northwards to attempt to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman right flank assisted by infantry attacks on the Ottoman right centre the following day.|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E

5000|$|ON/OFF Control: Typically {{used for}} heating loads or speed control of motors, this control method {{involves}} <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> switch on for n integral cycles and <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> switch off for m integral cycles. Because <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> switches {{on and off}} causes undesirable harmonics to be created, <b>the</b> switches are <b>turned</b> on and off during zero-voltage and zero-current conditions (zero-crossing), effectively reducing the distortion.|$|R
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state <b>turn.</b> <b>The</b> sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
5|$|Without the docking-pit, the {{caissons}} and extremities of {{the arms}} of the wheel would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the wheel rotated. The buoyancy of the lower caisson would {{make it more difficult to}} <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> wheel.|$|E

However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and on paper looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an attack of gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.|$|E

50|$|Skate trucks have a {{rigid axle}} {{and a top}} hanger, with a single bolt and bushings, also called rubbers or grommets, that provide the cushion {{mechanism}} for <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> mountainboard. The bushings cushion the truck when it <b>turns.</b> <b>The</b> stiffer the bushings, the more resistant the mountainboard is to <b>turning.</b> <b>The</b> softer the bushings, {{the easier it is}} to turn. A bolt called a kingpin holds these parts together and fits inside the bushings. Thus by tightening or loosening the kingpin nut, the trucks can be adjusted loosely for better turning and tighter for more control. Skate-style mountainboard trucks are similar to skateboard trucks but more robust and with a longer axle.|$|R
