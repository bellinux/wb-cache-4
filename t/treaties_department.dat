40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to determine the effectiveness of using commercial satellite data to detect covert nuclear weapons programs. Seven-band Landsat Thematic Mapper data covering the Pahute Mesa (an area within the United States Nevada Nuclear Testing Site), acquired on October 16, 1985, were analyzed to determine if underground nuclear test sites were spectrally distinguishable from the surrounding area. The analysis consisted of four steps: (1) analyzing the raw data, (2) manipulating the raw data through contrast stretching, filter application, matrix algebra, and principal components analyses, (3) identifying parameters that affect classification of underground nuclear tests and (4) selectively limiting parameters. The results of limiting parameters showed that a supervised classification of a signature created with a five-original-pixel seed of one representative, known test site provided an accurate classification of most known test sites. To further eliminate erroneous classification of roads and other areas of similar reflectance, these areas were seeded to create a second signature. This signature, whose spectral responses were different, was then used in a simultaneous classification. This classification further eliminated erroneous classification of non-test site areas, demonstrating that commercial satellite digital data can aid in the detection of covert nuclear weapons programs, in this case, underground nuclear testing. An application of the classification scheme used is proposed to confront a scenario in which a country seeks additional verification of another party's proposed violation of test ban <b>treaties.</b> <b>Department</b> of Physics and AstronomyThesis (M.

Before 1782 {{the conduct}} of foreign affairs was divided on a roughly geographical basis, together with responsibilities for home and colonial affairs, between the secretaries of state for the Northern and Southern Departments. On 27 March 1782 Charles James Fox was appointed specifically as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Office came into existence, being staffed by the clerks of the former Northern Department. The basic structure of the Foreign Office, headed by a Foreign Secretary and assisted by officials within the office and a diplomatic and consular service abroad, continued throughout its existence. The Foreign Office was responsible for all correspondence with foreign states and negotiations with representatives of other states, liaising with other ministries where necessary. The Foreign Secretary was responsible for {{the conduct of}} the British Government's foreign policy on a day to day basis and for presenting that policy to the Cabinet and Parliament. At first the office was divided into two departments, Northern and Southern, but as the work of the office became greater and more complex the number of departments increased. Most of these departments were organised on a geographical basis and known as political departments, being responsible for policy towards and relations with particular countries or regions. There were, however, other non-political functional departments, such as the Slave Trade Department. In the twentieth century the numbers of these functional departments grew, while the number of political departments fluctuated although the trend was towards a growth in numbers.

The paper illustrates the rampant corruption that has emerged in Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union. This corruption has had a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine and its economy. The corruption in Ukraine has spread in almost every segment of society. For instance the corruption has given rise to dishonest elections, a suppressed media, a shadow economy, rogue military leaders, and organized crime elements in the country.

40|$|To {{address a}} {{critical}} verification {{issue for the}} current Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and for a possible future Comprehensive Test Ban <b>Treaty</b> (CTBT), the <b>Department</b> of Energy sought to measure certain differences between an underground nuclear test and a chemical test in the same geology, so that other explosions could be identified. This was done in a field experiment code-named the NonProliferation Experiment (NPE). This comprehensive experiment was designed to determine the signatures of chemical explosions for {{a broad range of}} phenomena for comparison with those of previous nuclear tests. If significant differences can be measured, then these measures can be used to discriminate between the two types of explosions. In addition, when these differences are understood, large chemical explosions can be used to seismically calibrate regions to discriminate earthquakes from explosions. Toward this end, on-site and off-site measurements of transient phenomena were made, and on-site measurements of residual effects are in progress. Perhaps the most striking result was that the source function for the chemical explosion was identical to that of a nuclear one of about twice the yield. These proceedings provide more detailed results of the experiment...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{questions}} {{the adequacy of}} the Department of the Interior's response to the land claims of Metis settlers in Green Lake, Saskatchewan. Metis people originally settled in Green Lake because of the pattern of development of the fur trade. Green Lake was a major nexus on the fur trade transportation system, which encouraged Metis settlement and community development. After Confederation, when the national policy generated regional differentiation through uneven development, Green Lake remained under fur-trade domination. National policy expansion reached Green Lake with surveys in 1909 and 1911, replacing fur-trade property relations with the Dominion Lands Act. The surveys revealed Green Lake as a fur trade settlement with property claims consistent with the fur trade economy. Prior treatment of such claims under national policy regulations promised recognition of Metis claims based on prior settlement. Economic recession and World War I led to the abatement of national policy expansion. As a result, the department postponed action on the Metis claims until renewed interest in national policy settlement. Legislation passed in 1919 provided new direction to departmental consideration of the Green Lake claims. The only remnant of recognition of fur trade settlement was reference to 1908 legislation requiring occupancy at the time of <b>treaty.</b> The <b>department</b> subsequently disposed of Metis claims by offering most claimants only a right to purchase claimed land. Departmental response to Metis claims at Green Lake was inadequate on several grounds. It failed to consider adequately property relations extant from the fur trade economy. It acted without due consideration for established precedents associated with the national policy. It acted ultra vires to carry out and justify a restrictive and mean spirited response to Metis claims. The retroactive nature of 1908 legislation unfairly penalized claimants in the Treaty Six area. The department's limitation of the eligibility of claimants by constrictive criteria was compounded by its failure to examine seriously the evidence of Metis settlement that would have met such criteria. At the time of the 1930 transfer of land administration to the prairie provinces, the land claims of the Metis settlers of Green Lake remained unsatisfied...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT When {{examining}} a large flood of migration into a country, an imperative {{consideration for the}} affected states is their {{respect for human rights}} values, the protection of vulnerable groups and the assurances for the implementation of those values. The case under scrutiny in this thesis is that of domestic workers who are vulnerable {{due to the nature of}} their work. This thesis concentrates on one of the three Ps of human trafficking as outlined in the Palermo Protocol, namely prevention. In particular, the focus lies on two areas relating to the prevention of trafficking of domestic workers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). These are, firstly, the disregard of national and international laws preventing trafficking in KSA, and secondly, the limited number of policies that specifically target the prevention of domestic workers trafficking generated in KSA after the issue of laws. This research into the current circumstances in KSA shows that while anti-trafficking laws, labour laws and domestic workers’ bylaws have been issued, the KSA government has disregarded, partially at least, the implementation of these laws in preventing trafficking. This research shows that the KSA government has not introduced any prevention elements into the anti-trafficking legislation. This is due to the fact that even though the KSA government have used an obfuscated method to implement their first anti-trafficking law, they have misinterpreted the goals that needed to be achieved. The research also finds three main causes for the limited number of policies in KSA, which may explain why trafficking, is not prevented. These causes are: the lack of interaction between international <b>treaties</b> and KSA <b>departments</b> with regards to human trafficking, inconsistencies between different KSA departments in dealing with human trafficking, and finally, the lack of any policies specifically concerning the prevention of trafficking of domestic workers...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cultural Revolution in the 1970 s and the {{conclusion}} of Mao Zedong’s reign, the People’s Republic of China (PRC or China) has made progress in its understanding of both domestic and international law. In the domestic context, China has initiated improvements to its statutes and regulations, its law enforcement agencies, and its judicial system. These steps forward have been offset by periodic missteps that have resulted in criticism from external organizations, including international human rights groups and foreign government entities, about continuing or lingering deficiencies in China’s approach to the law. Regardless, in comparison to the Mao-era legal concepts of “rule by law” and “rule of man,” China’s authoritarian regime has recently made some positive strides toward what outside observers hope could someday reflect a true rule-of-law system. Nevertheless, concerns remain and the proverbial {{jury is still out on}} whether China’s leaders will tolerate domestic legal reforms that would bring China’s legal system closer to the liberal model. Over the course of the past three decades, China has also made some progress in its understanding of international law and acceptance of the existing international legal order. Observers no longer read or hear mainstream Chinese legal experts use phrases such as the pejorative, Marxist-laden “bourgeois international law. ” Instead, modern Chinese legal scholars recognize the importance of all nations, including China, “understand[ing] and abid[ing] by the rules of the international community. ” Perhaps even more importantly, Chinese officials have begun to make more progressive statements about international law. In October 2006, the legal committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the subject of the rule of law. At that meeting of legal experts, Mr. Duan Jielong, the Director-General of the <b>Treaty</b> and Law <b>Department</b> of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave a speech regarding China’s perspective on international law, during which he made several significant representations on the subject. First, Mr. Duan said that China’s Government “attaches great importance to the rule of international law and puts it into actual practice. ” Then, he assured the international audience that China’s Government “faithfully fulfills all its obligations under international treaties. ” Next, he said that China’s Government “strictly abides by the provisions and principles of international law,” and that “relevant international treaties and principles of international customary law, as well as the binding decisions adopted by the Security Council should all be strictly adhered to,” presumably by all nations. With regard to interpreting international treaties, Mr. Duan said that “uniform application of international law should be ensured” and that such uniform application is “essential for the rule of law at the international level. ” Such representations suggested that China has turned a corner in terms of understanding international law and accepting the existing international legal order. A question that the world must consider, however, is whether these positive assurances by Chinese officials like Mr. Duan reflect a genuine acceptance of international law and the existing international legal order or whether such assurances are merely rhetoric. That question will be the focus of this Article, as viewed through the prism of a particular subspecialty of international law. By its nature, international law can create challenges in any effort to assess whether a particular nation accepts the existing international legal order. One complication stems from the multiple sources of law that comprise international law. There is no single source of international law, rather it is composed of conventional law, customary law, judicial decisions, and learned treatise. Moreover, international law covers a wide range of activities between nations and organizations, including, but not limited to, international trade, international armed conflict, human rights, and environmental protection. Thus, any assessment of a nation’s acceptance of international law cannot be accomplished with a single, broad-brush stroke or general characterization. An additional complication derives from the fact that a particular nation, such as China, might make a deliberate decision to adhere to certain existing rule-sets of international law while simultaneously taking a different approach to other rule-sets. In general, China has indicated its intent to work within existing international systems. For example, in a 2007 report, President Hu Jintao stated that China will “work to make the international order fairer and more equitable,” implicitly affirming that China will work within the existing international legal order. Similarly, the Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Shen Guofang stated in a 2007 speech that China should enhance its ability to determine the agenda and its ability to make use of the rules by playing a substantive role in all kinds of consultations and the writing of international rules. It should show even more initiative in participating in international affairs and in building the multilateral system. Thus, the world sees China operating within some specific rule-sets of the international legal order, such as rule-sets governing international trade. This does not necessarily mean that China has accepted all of the rule-sets within the greater body of international law. In his insightful 2009 study, China’s International Behavior, China-expert and current- White House official Dr. Evan S. Medeiros assessed that “[t]here are more instances of China gradually accepting international rules than objecting to and then trying to revise them (and succeeding). ” Looking ahead, he further concluded that China is “focused far more on working within the current rules and institutions to accumulate power and influence than on opposing and revising them. ” Ultimately, however, Medeiros recognized that China does not necessarily accept every ruleset of international law and, additionally, that its actual intent with respect to some rule-sets is unclear. Medeiros concisely framed the bottom-line question as follows: “does China accept the prevailing rules or does it seek to rewrite them?” This Article considers the Medeiros question for a particular rule-set of international law—namely, the international law of the sea. Specifically, it examines China’s rhetoric on law of the sea matters in recent years, along with its official actions and the realities of the law of the sea, and assesses whether China accepts the prevailing rules or seeks to rewrite them. Part II of this Article identifies some fundamental realities of the law of the sea, which helps frame the remainder of the discussion. Part III considers whether China’s policy preferences are met by those realities, and identifies China’s options for ameliorating any disconnects between those preferences and realities. Part IV examines some specific uses of rhetoric by China on law of the sea matters and evaluates the validity of that rhetoric. Part V discusses some potential concerns about China’s use of this rhetoric and Part VI provides some specific recommendations on how China could reassure the world of its intentions on matters governed by the law of the sea. In the end, this Article will answer the Medeiros question and conclude whether or not China accepts this body of international law...|$|R
