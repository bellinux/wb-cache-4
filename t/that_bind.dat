5|$|Chemical {{compounds}} {{can bind to}} troponin C to act as troponin activators (calcium sensitizers) or troponin inhibitors (calcium desensitizers). There {{are already}} multiple troponin activators <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to fast skeletal troponin C, of which tirasemtiv has been tested in multiple clinical trials. In contrast, there are no known compounds <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> with high affinity to cardiac troponin C. The calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, is purported to bind to troponin C, but only weak or inconsistent binding has been detected, precluding any structure determination. In contrast, levosimendan inhibits type 3 phosphodiesterase with nanomolar affinity, so its biological target is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Psychology is {{the science}} that investigates mental states directly. It uses {{generally}} empirical methods to investigate concrete mental states like joy, fear or obsessions. Psychology investigates the laws <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> these mental states {{to each other}} or with inputs and outputs to the human organism.|$|E
5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E

5|$|Autoimmune {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|Clavaria zollingeri {{contains}} lectins, a {{class of}} proteins <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> specific carbohydrates {{on the surface of}} cells, causing them to clump together. A Korean study demonstrated that extracts of the fungus caused lymphoagglutination, a specific form of agglutination that involves white blood cells. In general, lectins are used in blood typing and serology, and they are widely used in affinity chromatography for purifying proteins.|$|E
50|$|Ankyrins contain four {{functional}} domains: an N-terminal domain {{that contains}} 24 tandem ankyrin repeats, a central domain <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> to spectrin, a death domain <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> to proteins involved in apoptosis, and a C-terminal regulatory domain {{that is highly}} variable between different ankyrin proteins.|$|R
50|$|IL-1RA was {{initially}} called the IL-1 inhibitor and was discovered separately in 1984 by two independent laboratories. IL-1RA is an agent <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> non-productively {{to the cell}} surface interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), the same receptor <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> interleukin 1 (IL-1), preventing IL-1 from sending a signal to that cell.|$|R

5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to dopamine receptors in {{the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (on-off fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.|$|E
5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on the enzyme, {{distinct}} from the active site, <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of the enzyme that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of the enzyme. In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of the enzyme according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E

5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton used his {{solution}} of Apollonius' problem {{to construct an}} orbit in celestial mechanics {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> in a particular enzyme of a pathogenic bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> specifically to this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|In the {{interests}} of keeping the bread kosher (Angel Bakeries carries the hechsher of both the Edah HaChareidis and the Orthodox Union), Angel's son Ovadia, a trained chemist, collaborated with others at the Angel's-owned Adumim Chemicals plant {{to develop a new}} formula for the emulsifiers <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> water and oil in the bread-making process. In those early days, emulsifiers were made with animal-based fats which were not kosher. Ovadia Angel and his team produced emulsifiers from hydrogenated fats, a vegetable-based source, and later sold this new knowledge to other companies.|$|E

5|$|Kasim becomes jealous when {{he hears}} about his brother's fortune, and wants to know the secret behind this. Under Salima's guidance, he invites Alibaba and his {{household}} for a feast. After cunningly obtaining {{the secret of the}} dacoits' cave, Kasim sentences Alibaba to death, falsely accusing him of attempted murder. Marziana pretends to heed Kasim's order. She declares that Alibaba has been unfaithful to her and he deserves this retribution. Taking a knife, Marziana acts as though she means to kill Alibaba, but instead cuts the ropes <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> his hands. A fight ensues between Alibaba and Kasim's thugs (during which Salima is accidentally killed), but Alibaba subdues them and escapes with his allies.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is preventable. This includes {{by individual}} efforts such as removing lead-containing {{items from the}} home, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil. The major treatments are removal {{of the source of}} lead and the use of medications <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> lead so it can be eliminated from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45µg/dl. Medications used include dimercaprol, edetate calcium disodium, and succimer.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are a {{superfamily}} {{of proteins}} with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and {{are found in}} all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine protease inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site. This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to and block access to the protease active site.|$|E

5|$|The first {{screening}} test in someone {{suspected of having}} HIT is aimed at detecting antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes. This may be with a laboratory test of the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) type. The ELISA test, however, detects all circulating antibodies <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> heparin-PF4 complexes, and may also falsely identify antibodies that do not cause HIT. Therefore, those with a positive ELISA are tested further with a functional assay. This test uses platelets and serum from the patient; the platelets are washed and mixed with serum and heparin. The sample is then tested {{for the release of}} serotonin, a marker of platelet activation. If this serotonin release assay (SRA) shows high serotonin release, the diagnosis of HIT is confirmed. The SRA test is difficult to perform and is usually only done in regional laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and point to a way of transcending them.|$|E
5|$|When the {{adaptive}} immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus, it produces specific antibodies <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to the virus and often render it non-infectious. This is called humoral immunity. Two types of antibodies are important. The first, called IgM, is highly effective at neutralising viruses but is produced by {{the cells of the}} immune system only for a few weeks. The second, called IgG, is produced indefinitely. The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection, whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past. IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out.|$|E
