5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady.</b> This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Lady</b> felt Regan was damaging the president.

Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation.
