5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> its 1950 season as Adamle was named team captain, replacing Lou Saban following his retirement. The {{team won the}} 1950 NFL Championship Game, and Adamale was one of seven Browns players chosen {{to play in the}} first Pro Bowl, football's all-star game. He led the NFL with five fumble recoveries that year and was also named a second-team All-Pro by the New York Daily News.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Youngblood was a Second-team All-pro {{selection}} {{and went to}} the first of his seven Pro Bowls and led the Rams with 16½ sacks. The Ram defense led <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> fewest yards allowed and fewest rushing yards. He was voted the Rams defensive lineman {{of the year by the}} Rams Alumni Association. Beginning in the 1973 season, the Rams added the unrelated Jim Youngblood to its roster, so from that time on, both Youngbloods had the unique distinction of having their entire name on the back of their jerseys, the given name appearing above the family name. The following year, 1974, the Rams again led <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> rushing defense and Youngblood led the Rams with 15 sacks while being voted a consensus First-team All-Pro. The Rams advanced to the NFC Championship game, losing 14-10 to the Minnesota Vikings.|$|E
5|$|In all, Hutson caught 488 {{passes for}} 7,991 yards and 99 touchdowns. He rushed for three touchdowns, scored two touchdowns on blocked punts, {{and had an}} {{interception}} return touchdown for a career total of 105. He scored at least six receiving touchdowns {{in each of his}} eleven seasons. Hutson led <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> receptions eight times, including five consecutive times: 1941 to 1945. He led <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> receiving yards seven times, including four straight times: 1941 to 1944. He led <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> scoring five times: 1941 to 1945. As of 2016, Hutson still holds the highest career average touchdowns per game for a receiver, at 0.85. Hutson's single season record of 17 touchdown receptions in 1942 stood for 42 years until broken by receiver Mark Clayton in 1984, a year in which Miami's quarterback Dan Marino had more completions (362) than the entire 1942 Packers team's pass attempts (330). His four receiving touchdowns in a game has been surpassed three times and tied several times, but his four in a single quarter has yet to be matched. His record 99 touchdown receptions stood for 44 years, well into the modern era. In his eleven-year professional career, Hutson never missed a game due to injury. He invented many pass routes still in use today, including the chair route.|$|E

The Patriots played their home games at Foxboro Stadium from 1971 to 2001, then moved to Gillette Stadium {{at the start of the}} 2002 season. The Patriots' rivalry with the New York Jets is considered one of the most bitter rivalries in the NFL.|$|E

With the Bears, Atkins was a First Team All-Pro selection in 1958, 1960, 1961, and 1963, along with being a starter in the Pro Bowl in eight of his last nine years with Chicago.|$|R
5|$|Cleveland {{reached the}} NFL {{championship}} game {{the following year}} but lost to the Rams. The 1952 and 1953 seasons followed a similar pattern: the Browns {{made it to the}} championship game but lost both times to the Detroit Lions. Lavelli was named to the Pro Bowl in 1951 and 1953. He was seventh in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> receiving yards in 1951, with 586. He gained 783 receiving yards in 1953, the fifth-highest total in the league.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's success {{continued}} in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> 1950, silencing skeptics {{who thought the}} team stood out {{only because of the}} poor quality of competition in the AAFC. After beating the defending NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles in {{the first game of the}} season, the Browns advanced to the championship game, where they beat the Los Angeles Rams 30–28 on a last-second Lou Groza field goal. Speedie had 548 receiving yards during the season and was selected for the NFL's first-ever Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Drafted by the Baltimore Colts in {{the twentieth}} round as the 203rd overall pick of the 1954 NFL Draft, Berry was {{considered}} a long-shot {{to make the team}} roster. After being used sparingly as a rookie, catching only 13 passes, he became a permanent starter on the team by his second NFL season when the Colts acquired quarterback Johnny Unitas. Over the next 12 seasons together, the two {{became one of the most}} dominant passing and catching duos in NFL history. Berry, who did not miss a single game until his eighth year in the league, led <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> receptions and receiving yards three times and in receiving touchdowns twice.|$|E

5|$|Helped {{by strong}} line play, Graham, Motley and Cleveland ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie led a potent offense that {{dominated}} the AAFC for three years. The Browns won the AAFC championship in 1947, 1948 and 1949 before the league disbanded and Cleveland was absorbed by the more established NFL. Humble was a consensus second-team All-Pro selection in 1948, when Cleveland won all of its games. Cleveland's success continued in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> 1950, when Humble was used on occasion as a linebacker on defense. The Browns finished {{the season with a}} 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams in the NFL championship game. Humble was selected to play in the first-ever Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons behind such stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E
5|$|In {{his senior}} season at the University of Alabama in 1934, Hutson was {{recognized}} as a consensus All-American and won a national championship with the Alabama Crimson Tide football team. After his career at Alabama, he joined the Packers in 1935 and played eleven seasons before he retired in 1945. He {{led the league in}} receiving yards in seven separate seasons and in receiving touchdowns in nine. A talented safety on defense, he also led <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> interceptions in 1940. Hutson was an eight-time All-Pro selection, a four-time Pro Bowler, and was twice awarded the Joe F.

5|$|Indianapolis' defense {{ranked second}} in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> fewest passing yards allowed. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis (who {{recorded}} 9.5 sacks and forced 4 fumbles) were widely {{considered to be}} among the best pass-rushing defensive ends in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker Cato June led the team in tackles (92) and interceptions (3). The Colts' run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return yardage allowed and 31st in average punt return yardage allowed.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{ended the}} regular season at home against the Lions; in Chicago, the Bears led the series 50–26–3. Jeff Joniak writes that the Bears offense had to hold off the blitz; in 2015, the Lions had 38 sacks, {{including}} 13.5 by defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, and ranked fourth in sack percentage, while recording the second-most negative plays in <b>the</b> <b>NFL.</b> <b>In</b> comparison, the Bears had the fewest negative plays in the league. Despite the frequency to blitz, the Lions only had eight sacks when doing so. Through the air, the Lions pass defense struggled, allowing a 30th-ranked passer rating of 101.7 and 30 touchdown passes while recording only interceptions. To excel, the Bears had to maintain the ball, as they were ranked sixth in <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> time of possession. On defense, the Bears took on a Lions offense that had improved under offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter after Joe Lombardi's firing, going from 18.6 points per game to 26.4 under Cooter. With Matthew Stafford, the Lions were one of eleven teams with over 4,000 yards, while also being {{ranked in the top}} ten with 30 touchdown passes. However, Stafford was sacked 40 times, while the rushing attack averaged only 84.5 yards per game and 3.8 yards per carry. Eddie Royal, Zach Miller, Hroniss Grasu, Jarvis Jenkins, Jacoby Glenn, Tayo Fabuluje and Terry Williams were inactive.|$|E
5|$|The Bengals entered <b>the</b> <b>NFL</b> <b>in</b> 1970 as {{a result}} of the AFL–NFL merger, and were placed in the newly formed American Football Conference {{alongside}} the Browns. A career-ending injury to Cook before the 1970 season forced the Bengals to rely on Virgil Carter, an emergency backup who could make accurate short passes but could not heave the ball like Cook once could. So Brown and Walsh went to work designing an offense around Carter's limitations, a scheme that was the genesis of the West Coast offense Walsh later used to great effect when he became coach of the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E
