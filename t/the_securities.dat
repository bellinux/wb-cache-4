40|$|<b>The</b> <b>security</b> {{industry}} has undergone dramatic changes {{over the last}} twenty years due to a continually increasing demand for security services and products. Internal organisational pressure to <b>the</b> <b>security</b> function has forced a rethink in <b>the</b> way <b>security</b> managers conduct business. Traditionally, security managers have only been aware of the level of service that customers receive by procedures these managers initiated. The availability of a comprehensive study detailing customer attitudes towards security supply is useful for understanding <b>the</b> <b>security</b> demand from <b>the</b> end user perspective, and providing knowledge to fine-tune <b>the</b> service. A <b>security</b> manager with realistic and recent end user information concerning <b>the</b> <b>security</b> supply could be empowered with superior levels of operational decision-making knowledge. The ability for <b>the</b> <b>security</b> supply to be better matched to <b>the</b> <b>security</b> demand suggests that the service could operate with an enhanced degree of efficiency, for both <b>the</b> <b>security</b> provider and consumers. Security management will benefit from this study, as the conceptual framework for identifying the supply and demand of a security function may be used to assess <b>the</b> validity of <b>security</b> services across <b>the</b> entire <b>security</b> industry. Furthermore, as <b>the</b> <b>security</b> industry and discipline develops, tools for <b>the</b> analysis of <b>security</b> services must also be advanced. Exploration of the supply and demand of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> function will provide <b>the</b> <b>security</b> discipline with a practical methodology for end-user evaluation. The end user component of the study required the administration of an attitude assessment tool to a distinct group of customers utilising <b>the</b> tertiary <b>security</b> service. <b>The</b> Likert test comprised of twenty questions exploring five different issues that related to <b>the</b> <b>security</b> service. Combined, <b>the</b> emerging results provide an indication of security demand. Security supply was also assessed through the utilisation of a structured interview that was administered to security professionals from each university. This facilitated in the understanding of each university 2 ̆ 7 s supply and demand on security. Mean statement scores, standard deviation scores, correlation analysis (dimensions and gender) and the depth interview analysis technique were used throughout the data analysis phase of the study. Comparisons could he deduced between the supply and demand of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> service in relation to the associated dimension group. Results of the Likert questionnaires required analysis in order to extract the most useful information from them and make comparisons between <b>the</b> associated <b>security</b> supply and <b>the</b> contrastive university. Murdoch University appears to offer their students a security service superior to Edith Cowan University and this was likely to be the cause of the consistently greater endorsement of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> issues from Murdoch University residents. A framework for the identification of the supply and demand was developed to assist <b>the</b> university <b>security</b> manager to better identify anomalies in <b>the</b> provision of <b>security</b> in <b>the</b> future. This framework provides superior levels of justification towards the concept of enhancing <b>the</b> university <b>security</b> service. A likely example of the potential for this study to support <b>the</b> <b>security</b> manager is with consideration for <b>security</b> outsourcing. <b>The</b> framework can support for and against arguments for outsourcing <b>the</b> <b>security</b> service, by drawing on educated evaluations of both <b>the</b> <b>security</b> supply and demand. The procedure for this study demonstrates the effectiveness of analysing end user attitudes of a security service as a means to develop greater levels of understanding for <b>the</b> <b>security</b> manager on <b>the</b> differences between supply and demand.
