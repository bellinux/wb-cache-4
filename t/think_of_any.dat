5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> more spin-offs.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the fourth}} and final novel {{featuring}} Psmith, the others being Mike (1909) (later republished in two parts, with Psmith appearing in the second, Mike and Psmith (1953)), Psmith in the City (1910), and Psmith, Journalist (1915) – {{in his introduction to}} the omnibus The World of Psmith, Wodehouse said that he had stopped writing about the character because he couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> more stories.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals is the opportunity {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} of 'fair and reasonable' {{must therefore be}} something else, and I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded {{as a human being}} in a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - {{it seems to me that}} the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E
500|$|In , Joan Didion recounts {{that she}} met a man while visiting Meridian in the 1970s who told her, [...] "The KKK {{which used to be}} a major factor in this {{community}} isn't a factor anymore, both the membership and the influence have diminished, and I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> place where the black is denied entrance, {{with the possible exception of}} private clubs." ...|$|E
500|$|Keynes's {{friends in}} the Bloomsbury Group were {{initially}} surprised when, in his later years, he began dating and pursuing affairs with women, demonstrating himself to be bisexual. Ray Costelloe (who would later marry Oliver Strachey) was an early heterosexual interest of Keynes. In 1906, Keynes had written of this infatuation that, [...] "I seem to have {{fallen in love with}} Ray a little bit, but as she isn't male I haven't [...] able to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> suitable steps to take." ...|$|E

500|$|Portal was {{singled out}} for praise by reviewers. Official Xbox Magazine admired its unique puzzle {{gameplay}} mechanics, stating {{that it was the}} first major advance in puzzle gaming [...] "since Russians started dropping blocks." [...] Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw, The Escapist's usually acerbically critical reviewer, stated in his Zero Punctuation review that he couldn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> criticism for Portal, which has [...] "some of the funniest pitch-black humor [...] ever heard in a game" [...] and concluded that it is [...] "absolutely sublime from start to finish, and I will jam forks into my eyes if I ever use those words to describe anything else, ever again." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Borah's career bridged two eras of reform, {{according}} to Ashby, [...] "emotionally and intellectually he belonged {{with the older}} prewar [...] America. [...] As New Deal enthusiast Edgar Kemler observed, he 'was overtaken by obsolescence at an early age'." [...] Borah wrote in 1927, {{near the end of}} a decade of tumultuous change, [...] "I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> views which I now have that I did not have before the war." [...] In 1936, Time magazine noted that though Borah was the most famous senator of the century, and had long been [...] "the great Moral Force of the Senate... the conscience of the country has been placed in other pockets".|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the {{new book}} were as {{complimentary}} as those for its predecessors. The Times Literary Supplement wrote, [...] "French Provincial Cooking needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those who can give the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as La Bourride de Charles Bérot and Cassoulet Colombié." [...] The Observer said that it was difficult to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> home that could do without the book and called David [...] "a very special kind of genius".|$|E

500|$|Another {{influence}} from Old English sources is {{the appearance of}} named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade [...] "Sting" [...] we see Bilbo's acceptance {{of the kinds of}} cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself. This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon's hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, [...] "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same." ...|$|E
500|$|The fifth, and last, of David's volumes {{consisting}} {{primarily of}} recipes {{is by far}} the longest of them. The 1970 paperback edition published by Penguin Books runs to 584 pages. David's biographer Artemis Cooper describes it as [...] "a book that only needed assembling", because it was based on previously published articles and her own collection of notes and recipes from the previous two decades. David researched her recipes thoroughly, and whenever several supposedly classic and mutually contradictory recipes existed she [...] "knew how to reduce a recipe to its bare essentials, and then reconstruct it". By the 1960s, she was described in the British press as [...] "the most revered goddess of cooking", and The Observer said, [...] "It is difficult to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> home that can do without [...] Elizabeth David's [...] French Provincial Cooking.|$|E
500|$|... "Sins of My Father" [...] {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. Nathan S. of DJBooth called the [...] "openly autobiographical" [...] song the most affecting track he has [...] "done in years". He concluded by stating: [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other artist of Usher's status who would tie his cheating ways to an absent father, {{and for that}} he deserves some applause". Eric Arredondo of Beats Per Minute stated that in [...] "Sins of My Father", Usher shows [...] "more bite in his voice" [...] than he has ever heard before, and that [...] "it helps to make a song that is both fun and slightly sinister". Natalie Shaw of BBC Music called [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] outstanding, commenting that Usher's [...] "slink here sounds sinister, for the first time, fearing he'll fall under a demon woman's deathly voodoo while slack, deep beats play out".|$|E

500|$|Critically, Rugrats {{treatment}} of Judaism {{has also been}} acclaimed. Danny Goldberg wrote in his book How The Left Lost Teen Spirit: [...] "I cannot <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other TV show, animated or otherwise, in which Jewish traditions were so clearly expressed {{in the context of}} a mass appeal entertainment [...]" [...] Authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin, in their book Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim praised the series for celebrating [...] "secular Jewishness in the wisest and most entertaining fashion". TV Guide listed [...] "A Rugrats Chanukah" [...] number 5 in their 1999 [...] "10 Best Classic Family Holiday Specials" [...] list, opining that with the episode, [...] "Nickelodeon's Rugrats secured its place in television history." [...] Jewish online magazine Schmooze listed Tommy as the number 1 fictional Jewish character of all time. They also wrote that if someone had yet to see either one of the holiday specials, their [...] "Jewish education is incomplete." ...|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had always}} wanted Marsters {{for the role of}} Milton Fine/Brainiac. The pair wrote a draft for the major story arc of season five, knowing they wanted a new villain on the show to fight Clark. With the arrival of the black ship at the end of season four, Gough and Millar decided to {{introduce}} Brainiac. To them, Marsters was the only actor they could envision that could fit the [...] "menace, intelligence, and sexiness" [...] Brainiac was going to embody. Had Marsters declined the role, Gough and Millar would have rethought introducing Brainiac, as they could not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other actor who could fill those shoes. Marsters felt excited playing a character that was completely intentional; he likened the intention to that of a shark. As Marsters explains, [...] " [...] was just composed of his intent. And that's exciting—it's like watching a shark. You don't really ask how a shark is feeling—it's pure." ...|$|E
500|$|Lin's {{experience}} in the NBA draft {{was used as an}} example in the nonfiction psychology book The Undoing Project by Michael Lewis, which details how stereotypes can overwhelmingly influence a person's decision making, {{even in the face of}} contradictory evidence. In the book, Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey stated that Lin did very well in pre-draft testing. [...] "He lit up our [...] model," [...] said Morey. [...] "Our model said take him with, like, the 15th pick in the draft." [...] A year after the Rockets failed to draft Lin, they began to measure the speed of a player’s first two steps; Lin had the quickest first move of any player measured, and he was able to change direction far more quickly than most NBA players. [...] "He's incredibly athletic," [...] said Morey. [...] "But the reality is that every fucking person, including me, thought he was unathletic. And I can’t <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> reason for it other than he was Asian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, pray don't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>any</b> more: I spoke quite randomly," [...] said Gwendolen; {{she began}} to feel a new {{objection}} to carrying out her own proposition.|$|R
60|$|After he {{went away}} I came upstairs and had a good, {{comfortable}} howl. Then I buried the whole affair decently. I {{am not going to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>any</b> more.|$|R

500|$|Nearly {{two decades}} after Musial retired, {{baseball}} statistician Bill James and the sabermetrics movement began providing new ways of comparing players across baseball history. In 2001, James ranked Musial the tenth-greatest baseball player in history, and the second-best left fielder of all time. According to Baseball-Reference.com, he ranks fifth all-time among hitters on the Black Ink Test, and third all-time on the Gray Ink Test—measures designed to compare players of different eras. He ranks first on Baseball-Reference's Hall of Fame Monitor Test, and is tied for second in the Hall of Fame Career Standards Test. Despite his statistical accomplishments, he is {{sometimes referred to as}} the most underrated or overlooked athlete in modern American sports history. For instance, in his analysis of baseball's under- and overrated players in 2007, sportswriter Jayson Stark said, [...] "I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> all-time great in any sport who gets left out of more who's-the-greatest conversations than Stan Musial." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. {{was less}} willing {{to move forward on}} development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm's script, which Batman co-creator Bob Kane greeted with {{positive}} feedback. Hamm's script was then bootlegged at various comic book stores in the United States. Batman was finally given the greenlight to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton's Beetlejuice (1988). When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction Batman was going in. Hamm explained, [...] "They hear Tim Burton's name and they think of Pee-wee's Big Adventure. They hear Keaton's name and they <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of Batman, and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn't believe us." [...] To combat negative reports on the film's production, Kane was hired as creative consultant.|$|E
500|$|Also seeing {{improvement}} was Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad, commenting [...] "Tonight's episode definitely got me intrigued about fringe science, {{and this is}} the first time I can really say I'm looking forward to the next episode. It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it nice," [...] said Corny, [...] "that he isn't a queen, to {{be taken}} care of, and we can just pay him and come away, and not have to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him <b>any</b> more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me, pray," [...] said Dorothea, {{with simple}} earnestness; [...] "then we can consult together. It is wicked {{to let people}} <b>think</b> evil <b>of</b> <b>any</b> one falsely, when it can be hindered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, father! Dus Malbone {{would no}} more <b>think</b> <b>of</b> askin' {{me to have}} her, than she'd <b>think</b> <b>of</b> marryin' you!
