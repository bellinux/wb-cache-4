5|$|Henry Clifford lived until 1523. Under {{him and his}} son– {{also called}} Henry, who later became Earl of Cumberland– the castle was {{intermittently}} in use as a residence for the family. After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 {{it is likely that}} Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship. As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle, although he was an unpopular landlord. When the north of England rose up in <b>the</b> <b>Pilgrimage</b> of Grace in 1536, Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels. He confronted the rebel leaders at Kirkby Stephen in February 1537, and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle. After <b>the</b> <b>Pilgrimage</b> of Grace was suppressed, there were reforms of regional government in the north west. One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle, with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords' northern-most castle.|$|E

5|$|Percy died at Wressle in 1527 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Henry Algernon Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. <b>The</b> <b>Pilgrimage</b> of Grace {{was a popular}} revolt against the rule of Henry VIII in 1536 partly in {{response}} to the dissolution of the monasteries. The rebels in Yorkshire were led by Robert Aske and in October he sought the support of the Percy family. Aske travelled to Wressle Castle and tried to persuade Henry Algernon Percy, who at the time was suffering from illness, to join the rebellion. Though initially opposed to Aske, Percy eventually gave him control of Wressle Castle. Percy had fallen out with his younger brothers, and when he died in 1537 his one surviving brother did not inherit because he was imprisoned for his role in <b>the</b> <b>Pilgrimage</b> of Grace. In 1537, the crown again resumed control of Wressle Castle, and Henry VIII visited for three nights in 1541.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{the many}} {{literary}} sources, Eliot also draws {{on his personal}} feelings and experience, especially on the great stress that he felt while composing the poem. Similarly, Eliot used the image of pilgrims coming to America and the stories of them that were common throughout his childhood. In particular, his mother wrote poems about the pilgrims arriving in New England, and Eliot found information related to his family's history in a book called Sketch of the Eliot Family. The location, East Coker, was where Andrew Eliott, T. S. Eliot's ancestor, left when joining <b>the</b> <b>pilgrimage.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 802, Harun and {{the most}} {{powerful}} officials of the Abbasid government made <b>the</b> <b>pilgrimage</b> to Mecca, where the definitive succession arrangement was drawn up: al-Amin would succeed Harun in Baghdad, but al-Ma'mun would remain al-Amin's heir and would additionally rule over an enlarged and practically independent Khurasan. A third son, al-Qasim (al-Mu'tamin), was also added as third heir and received responsibility over the frontier areas with the Byzantine Empire. The stipulations of the agreement, extensively recorded by the historian al-Tabari, may however have been distorted by later apologists of al-Ma'mun, especially as regards {{the extent of the}} autonomy granted to al-Ma'mun's eastern viceroyalty.|$|E

5|$|Response to {{the reforms}} was mixed.

Elsewhere the changes were accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553–1558).|$|E
