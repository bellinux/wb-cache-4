The runway cannot be extended to the west {{because of the presence of}} a railway line, while an extension to the east requires diverting National Highway 766. The State Government initially decided <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> on this phase, preferring to wait until air traffic increased and the cost of diverting the runway was justified.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E

Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and go north to threaten the Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses. When the Egyptians at Vergas heard that Theodoros Kolokotronis was advancing on their rear they retreated.|$|E

By this time Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal Barca sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother with a second army.

Watts had found evidence {{in one of the}} photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until its significance could be known.

5|$|That evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's {{rear echelon}} at Barara, along the Toko–Mosigetta–Buin Road, came under attack. Under {{the command of}} the {{battalion}} second-in-command, and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were beaten back by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them.

5|$|Although {{its total}} {{strength}} {{was estimated at}} 185,500 men in late May 1944, the 2nd Panzer Army {{was not able to}} rally more than 16,000 troops for Operation Rösselsprung due to ever-increasing Partisan activity throughout the country. The Germans had to rely on special forces and improved tactics. The Partisans defended the territory they controlled with significant demolition and mining of roads. Roadblocks were manned by patrols and smaller detachments, whose task was <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>off</b> the enemy until reinforcements arrived. During Operation Rösselsprung, the Germans rendered these tactics ineffective by combining strong and fast motorised columns with adequate pioneer support. This combination was especially successful for the column led by the 92nd Motorised Regiment. The second German tactical innovation was the employment of five reconnaissance battalions for independent operations deep inside Partisan-controlled territory.|$|E
