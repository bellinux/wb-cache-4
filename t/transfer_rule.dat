40|$|Abstract. When {{building}} rule-based {{machine translation}} systems, a considerable human effort {{is needed to}} code the <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> {{that are able to}} translate source-language sentences into grammatically correct target-language sentences. In this paper we describe how to adapt the alignment templates used in statistical machine translation to the rulebased machine translation framework. The alignment templates are converted into structural <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> that are used by a shallow-transfer machine translation engine to produce grammatically correct translations. As the experimental results show there is a considerable improvement in the translation quality as compared to word-for-word translation (when no <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> are used), and the translation quality is close to that achieved when hand-coded <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> are used. The method presented is entirely unsupervised, and needs only a parallel corpus, two morphological analysers, and two part-of-speech taggers, such as those used by the machine translation system in which the inferred <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> are integrated. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} the automatic inference of structural <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> {{to be used in}} a shallow-transfer machine translation (MT) system from small parallel corpora. The structural <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> are based on alignment templates, like those used in statistical MT. Alignment templates are extracted from sentence-aligned parallel corpora and extended with a set of restrictions which are derived from the bilingual dictionary of the MT system and control their application as <b>transfer</b> <b>rules.</b> The experiments conducted using three different language pairs in the free/open-source MT platform Apertium show that translation quality is improved as compared to word-for-word translation (when no <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> are used), and that the resulting translation quality is close to that obtained using hand-coded <b>transfer</b> <b>rules.</b> The method we present is entirely unsupervised and benefits from information in the rest of modules of the MT system in which the inferred rules are applied. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{encoding}} <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> in a highly efficient packed structure us-ing contextualized constraints (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1991), an existing method of encod-ing adopted from LFG parsing (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982; Bresnan, 2001; Dalrymple, 2001). The packed representation allows us to encode O(2 n) <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> in a single packed representation only requiring O(n) storage space. Besides reducing space requirements, the representation also has a high impact {{on the amount of}} time taken to load large num-bers of <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> to memory with very little trade-off in time needed to unpack the rules. We include an experimental evaluation which shows a considerable reduction in space and time requirements for a large set of auto-matically induced <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> by storing the rules in the packed representation. ...|$|R

First a “shallow ” method where the parallel corpus is lemmatized before it is aligned by a phrase aligner, and then a “deep” method where the parallel corpus is parsed by deep parsers before the resulting predicates are aligned by phrase aligners. In both procedures, the phrase tables produced by the phrase aligners are used to extract semantic <b>transfer</b> <b>rules.</b> The procedures were employed on a 10 million word Japanese English parallel corpus and 190, 000 semantic <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> were extracted. ...|$|R

40|$|Kaitito is {{a natural}} {{language}} system {{that can be used}} to have conversations with one or more artificial characters. All natural language systems like Kaitito have limited abilities for understanding user input. The best way to improve Kaitito’s language understanding capabilities, seems to be using reformulations (paraphrases) of the user input on the level of semantic representations. This conclusion is based on the specifications of the Kaitito system as well as literature from systems related to Kaitito, like chatbots and question-answer systems. The Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) representations used in the Kaitito system can be paraphrased using <b>transfer</b> <b>rules,</b> also called munge <b>rules.</b> Deriving the <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> by hand is quite tricky and time consuming and moreover, it does not support Kaitito’s rationale of allowing the system to be authored by non-computer-linguists such as for instance English teachers. Therefore, deriving the <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> was automated as much as possible. Although a lot more difficult to implement than deriving the rules by hand, this automated version of deriving the <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> will make the system usable for non-computer-linguists. Using <b>transfer</b> <b>rules</b> involves issues like coverage and precision; rules can be too restrictive...|$|R
