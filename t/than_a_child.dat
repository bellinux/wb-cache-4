5|$|The {{historical}} record contains few details of Romulus' life. He {{was the son}} of Orestes, a Roman who once served as a secretary in the court of Attila the Hun before coming into the service of Julius Nepos in AD 475. In the same year he was promoted to the rank of magister militum, but then led a military revolt that forced Nepos to flee into exile. With the capital of Ravenna under his control, Orestes appointed his son, Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the eastern court in Constantinople. Romulus, however, was little more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> and figurehead for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer, a Germanic foederatus officer who defeated and executed Orestes. After seizing control of Ravenna, Odoacer sent the former emperor to live in the Castellum Lucullanum in Campania, after which he disappears from the {{historical record}}.|$|E
25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> who has more difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E

Instead of having to choose from already {{finished}} faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, etc.) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (Nightlife or later) may be determined. As in The Sims, there are five personality traits, and 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits. However, in The Sims 2, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each of the zodiac signs. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim.|$|E

Despite Molly often being considered a fan-favorite character, the character is nevertheless criticized for being portrayed [...] "far younger <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> {{who is about to}} hit puberty," [...] and is compared to acting more along the lines of a six- or seven-year-old as opposed to eleven. Similarly, the character is always considered being [...] "naive." ...|$|E
500|$|Manuel Marques de Sousa, Count of Porto Alegre (13 June 1804– 18 July 1875), nicknamed [...] "the Gloved Centaur", was an army officer, politician, {{abolitionist}} and monarchist of the Empire of Brazil. Born into {{a wealthy}} family of military background, Manuel Marques de Sousa joined the Portuguese Army in Brazil in 1817 {{when he was}} little more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> His military initiation occurred in the conquest of the Banda Oriental (Eastern Bank), which was annexed and became the southernmost Brazilian province of Cisplatina in 1821. For most of the 1820s, he was embroiled in the Brazilian effort to keep Cisplatina as part of its territory: first during the struggle for Brazilian independence and then in the Cisplatine War. It would ultimately prove a futile attempt, as Cisplatina successfully separated from Brazil to become the independent nation of Uruguay in 1828.|$|E
500|$|The Prince of Wales—though {{offended}} by Pitt's boldness—did not lend his full support to Fox's approach. The Prince of Wales's brother, Prince Frederick, Duke of York, declared that George would {{not attempt to}} exercise any power without previously obtaining the consent of Parliament. Following the passage of preliminary resolutions Pitt outlined a formal plan for the regency, suggesting that {{the powers of the}} Prince of Wales be greatly limited. Among other things, the Prince of Wales would not be able either to sell the King's property or to grant a peerage to anyone other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of the King. The Prince of Wales denounced Pitt's scheme, declaring it a [...] "project for producing weakness, disorder, and insecurity in every branch of the administration of affairs." [...] In the interests of the nation, both factions agreed to compromise.|$|E

500|$|King Thomas died in {{the summer}} of 1461, leaving Catherine a 37-year-old widow with two minor children. Her stepson, Stephen Tomašević, ascended the throne as intended. Catherine's {{relations}} with him were poor during Thomas's lifetime; this now threatened to weaken the kingdom against its adversaries, most of all the rapidly expanding Ottoman Empire. Stephen Tomašević was thus determined to settle his differences with Catherine and guaranteed her the title and privileges of a queen dowager. Having assured himself of Stephen Tomašević's [...] "affection" [...] for his daughter, the Grand Duke refrained from disputing the succession and claiming the crown for his grandson by Catherine. He likely found it in his interest that the throne be occupied by an adult monarch, rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> due to external threats. On 1 December, the Grand Duke wrote to Venetian officials that the new King had [...] "taken her as his mother", Vojača having already died. Although popularly believed to have retired to the castle of Kozograd above Fojnica as dowager, there is no historical basis for dismissing the possibility that she remained at the royal court in Jajce as the mother of Stephen Tomašević's closest heirs.|$|E

Nancy, like the archetypal teenager, experiences social anxiety and {{her relationship with her}} parents becomes very strained. [...] Sexuality is present in Freudian images and is almost exclusively displayed in a threatening and mysterious context (e.g., Tina's death visually evokes a rape, Freddy's glove between Nancy's legs in the bath).

BCG was administered no later than the fourth birthday until 2005, and no later than six months from birth from 2005 to 2012; the schedule was changed in 2012 due to reports of osteitis side effects from vaccinations at 3-4 months. Some municipalities recommend an earlier immunization schedule.|$|R

He is in such haste that I was forced to go halves with him in hiring a packet boat at the rate of £5 on purpose to be almost “drounded,” or what was very near as extravagant a reason, to humour my fellow traveller, for we came over in so prodigious a storm that nothing but our light heads could have kept us from the bottom." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{group had}} already {{recorded}} a second album {{and had been}} released in several countries a year previously. Following their victory, Pye released the album with [...] "Save Your Kisses for Me" [...] added. Entitled Love and Kisses, the album was a success in the UK, reaching the top twenty, {{as well as other}} countries, gaining a Number six position in Norway for instance. Soon after this, a follow-up single was released. Eager to cash in on their success, Pye decided against releasing anything from the album, as the earlier material had been more soul-based than the pop they were now successful with. The group instead released [...] "My Sweet Rosalie" [...] - almost a carbon copy of the previous hit, although the lyrical twist was that it was about a dog, rather <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> The song failed to chart highly, only reaching Number thirty in the UK, but fared better in other countries, particularly Belgium where it made Number two. Concerned by the lack of success for the single, the record company did not release anything else in the UK for the rest of 1976, despite the fact that in Europe a new album of material was released along with singles in various countries: [...] "I Give You My Love" [...] in Germany, Spain and others and [...] "New York City" [...] in France.|$|E
