He worked hard at the humour element, especially during his days in cabaret and revue; he wrote that he [...] "spent {{an enormous amount of}} time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it, but it didn't get me very far. I decided that humour was like a good watch. It would go well if left <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>its</b> <b>job</b> but the moment one started poking around, it went wonky". While working on his television series How do you View?, he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well, even if he gave the best lines to others; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others, including Jack Lemmon, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in How to Murder Your Wife. Lemmon commented that [...] "like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors. He worked with you, not at you".|$|E

50|$|Several {{problems}} need to {{be overcome}} for this hypothesis {{to be consistent with}} our current knowledge of quantum physics. Most importantly, the state of quantum superposition must last long enough to allow the DNA <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>its</b> normal <b>job</b> (produce RNA). Without this, there would be no way for a comparison of the outcomes of various mutations to occur and thus no basis for the system to bring about adaptive mutation. Protein formation occurs at a rate of on the order of 10,000 times a second (10−5 seconds per protein formed). However, DNA is not translated directly into protein, instead DNA is transcribed into a messenger RNA and this RNA copy is then used for protein biosynthesis. A gene is therefore never directly linked to its protein product, making any possible mechanism for signal transmission between a protein and the DNA that encodes it hard to imagine without action at a distance.|$|R

Obviously, teachers ought to be responsible for the fundamentals of learning, but should they be held accountable for what the children eat, or how they choose to behave, or for every single risk, direct or indirect, that could conceivably occur within the school grounds?

50|$|In {{spite of}} {{continuing}} pressure and obvious preparations in the United States for {{an invasion of}} Haïti, the junta refused to yield. On September 19, 1994, just after former President Jimmy Carter negotiated an agreement, the United States sent in military forces with UN approval. Haïti's de facto leaders, including Cédras, agreed to step down by October 15 so that Aristide could return to the presidency. By the end of September, 19,600 U.S. troops were in Haïti as part of Operation Uphold Democracy. At the end of March 1995, a UN commander took over, and the United States provided 2,400 of the 6,000-man UN force that would remain in Haïti until February, 1996. Given {{the opposition to the}} mission when it began, the primary U.S. concern was <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>its</b> limited <b>job</b> and avoid casualties among its forces. With the final withdrawal of U.S. troops, and Aristide's duly elected successor installed in office in February 1996, the Pentagon and the Clinton administration could label the Haitian operation a success up to that point.|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{legality}} and {{wisdom of the}} FDA’s effort to persuade courts to find most failure-to-warn claims preempted. The article first analyzes the FDA’s justifications for reversing its long-held views to the contrary and explains why the FDA’s position cannot be reconciled with its governing statute. The article then examines why the FDA’s position, if ultimately adopted by the courts, would undermine the incentives drug manufacturers have to change labeling to respond to newly-discovered risks. The background possibility of failure-to-warn litigation provides important incentives for drug companies to ensure that drug labels reflect accurate and up-to-date safety information. The article next explains why the agency’s view that {{it is capable of}} singlehandedly regulating the safety of drugs is unrealistic. The agency does not have the resources to perform the Herculean task of monitoring the performance of every drug on the market. Both the Institute of Medicine and the Government Accountability Office have explained the shortcomings in the FDA’s recent performance, and they express doubt that the FDA is in capable of facing an increasingly challenging future. The article then explains how state damages litigation helps uncover and assess risks that are not apparent to the agency during a drug’s approval process, and why this “feedback loop” enables the agency <b>to</b> better <b>do</b> <b>its</b> <b>job.</b> FDA approval of drugs is based on clinical trials that involve, at most, a few thousand patients and last a year or so. These trials cannot detect risks that are relatively rare, affect vulnerable sub-populations, or have long latency periods. For this reason, most serious adverse effects do not become evident until a drug is used in larger population groups for periods in excess of one year. Time and again, failure-to-warn litigation has brought to light information that would not otherwise be available to the FDA, to doctors, to other health care providers, and to consumers. And failure-to-warn litigation often has preceded and clearly influenced FDA decisions to modify labeling, and, at times, to withdraw drugs from the market...|$|R

Traz, como mote para essa experimentação, linhas de currículos traçadas em uma investigação que cartografou os fazeres curriculares de três professoras que trabalham em três escolas distintas. Utiliza vários conceitos retirados do pensamento da diferença deleuziano para pensar linhas virtuais no território do currículo. Defende a necessidade de pensar o currículo em suas bifurcações, em seus escapes, variações e linhas de fugas. Prioriza a diferença em vez da identidade, e segue as ramificações que surgem desse pensamento. Procura fazer traçados que racham os extratos dos currículos existentes, em seu meio, para ver a diferença fazer o seu trabalho. Experimenta, por fim, fazer a diferença operar para pensar um currículo como território de multiplicidades, somas, desejo, desterritorializações, cultivo de alegrias e afectos. This paper {{intends to}} consider a curriculum with the difference, as conceptualized by Gilles Deleuze, in order to shake the extracts of the already existing curriculums so as to {{give rise to a}} new one. It brings, as a means of experimentation, lines traced in an investigation which has mapped out the curriculum of three teachers working in three different schools. Concepts taken from the deleuzian thought on difference are used to establish virtual lines in the territory of the curriculum. The need to consider the curriculum with its bifurcations, escapes, variations and escape lines is defended. Difference is prioritized, as opposed to identity, and the ramifications that emerge from this thought are then followed up on. Its lines and traces aim to break the extracts of the already existing curriculums so as to enable us <b>to</b> observe difference <b>doing</b> <b>its</b> <b>job.</b> Last but not least, it means to operate with difference {{in such a way that}} the curriculum may be viewed as a multiple territory of summation, desire, extinction of territorial boundaries as well as cultivation of joys and affections...|$|R
40|$|As one grows older, birthdays {{gradually}} {{shift from}} being celebratory events to more reflective occasions. One 2 ̆ 7 s 40 th birthday is commemorated rather differently from one 2 ̆ 7 s 2 lst, which is, in turn, celebrated quite differently from one 2 ̆ 7 s first. After a certain point, the individual birthdays become less important {{and it is}} the milestone years to whch we pay particular attention. Sadly for entities like the Securities and Exchange Commission, it is only the milestone years (the ones ending in five or zero, for some reason), that draw any attention at all. No one held a conference to celebrate the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s 67 th anniversary. Clearly the SEC is not getting its fair share of chocolate cake. Eventually the birthdays come to be recognitions {{of the fact that you}} are still around. Survival, not moving ahead in life, becomes the notable fact. And so it is with the SEC. It has now been 70 years since Congress created the SEC in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are still short of the gold standard for human survival [...] 100 years - but 70 is not bad. The SEC today looks poised to outlast even the longest human life span. It has largely moved beyond the tasks that dominated much of its early agenda - the taming of the New York Stock Exchange, the reform of corporate bankruptcies and public utilities - and ensconced itself firmly as the arbiter of corporate disclosure and the primary enforcer of anti-fraud rules relating to the purchase and sale of securities. And the perceived importance of those latter-day functions, and thus, the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s prospects for survival, have only increased of late, reinforced by the fin de sicle accounting scandals and corporate abuses. The list is by now familiar - Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Adelphia, Global Crossing, etc., etc. - and that drumbeat of scandal has made the SEC once again the fair-haired boy of the Congress and the White House. The SEC was given a raft of new enforcement tools by Congress in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as politicians fell over themselves to get tough on corporate crime in the wake of the collapse of the tech bubble. The SEC - most anxious not to disappoint - has responded to this groundswell of support with a flurry of rulemaking aimed at accountants, analysts and audit committees, just to covcr the 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 7 s. I have not run across any rules directed toward the 2 ̆ 2 Z 2 ̆ 7 s, but I am sure that is only because the agency has not gotten that far yet. So the SEC clearly shows no interest in slowing down and taking it easy as it reaches its advanced years. A more telling sign of continued vitality at thc SEC is that the customary complaints about how the agency docs not have nearly enough resources <b>to</b> adequately <b>do</b> <b>its</b> <b>job</b> of protecting the integrity of our financial markets have given way to an extraordinary situation in which the agency finds itself unable to spend all of the money allocated to it by Congress (which vas in turn, more than the White House asked for). This is a most unusual problem for a bureaucracy to have. In sum, business is booming at the SEC...|$|R
