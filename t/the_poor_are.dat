Charity is practiced also by offering food for the poor called beggars lunch (bikareanchem jevonn) where <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>are</b> invited for lunch, from the village and treated with dignity and respect.

25|$|Affordability. Urban water tariffs {{were highly}} {{affordable}} {{according to data}} from the year 2000. A family of five living on the poverty line which uses 20cubic meter of water per month would spend less than 1.2% of its budget on its water bill if it had a water meter. If it did not have a water meter and was charged a flat rate, it would pay 2.0% of its budget. This percentage lies below the often used affordability threshold of 5%. However, at that time the average metered tariff was estimated at only 0.03 per m3, or less than three times what it was estimated to be in 2007. Apparently no more up-to-date estimates on the share of the average water bill in the budget of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>are</b> available.|$|E

25|$|In some countries, {{recycling}} is {{performed by the}} entrepreneurial poor such as the karung guni, zabbaleen, the rag-and-bone man, waste picker, and junk man. With the creation of large recycling organizations that may be profitable, either by law or economies of scale, <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} driven out of the recycling and the remanufacturing market. To compensate for this loss of income, a society may need to create additional forms of societal programs to help support the poor. Like the parable of the broken window, there is a net loss to the poor and possibly the whole of a society to make recycling artificially profitable e.g. through the law. However, in Brazil and Argentina, waste pickers/informal recyclers work alongside the authorities, in fully or semi-funded cooperatives, allowing informal recycling to be legitimized as a paid public sector job.|$|E
500|$|But Wollstonecraft's {{criticisms of}} the wealthy do not {{necessarily}} reflect a concomitant sympathy for the poor.

500|$|Vonnegut was a vocal {{critic of}} the society in which he lived, and this was {{reflected}} in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In The Sirens of Titan, the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of Saturn's moons, Titan, {{as a result of}} his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>are</b> in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in Hocus Pocus, the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views. In Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion, Thomas F. Marvin states: [...] "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." [...] Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a [...] "hereditary aristocracy" [...] develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because [...] "they deserve their fate". Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In Slaughterhouse-Five and Timequake the characters have no choice in what they do; in Breakfast of Champions, characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in Cat's Cradle, Bokononism views free will as heretical.|$|E
500|$|Novelist Brian Lynch, {{writing for}} the Irish Independent found [...] "The story in Pure is simple, almost dreamlike, a {{realistic}} fantasy, a violent fairy tale for adults", stating [...] "At its best Pure shimmers".

He is a close observer of cats" [...] and stated, of Baratte's project as a whole, [...] "Miller intimately imagines how it might have felt to witness it." [...] Holly Kyte found Pure to be [...] "irresistibly compelling" [...] and [...] "Exquisite inside and out". She stated that [...] "Every so often a historical novel comes along that is so natural, so far from pastiche, so modern, that it thrills and expands the mind" [...] and that she found that [...] "Pure is a near-faultless thing: detailed, symbolic and richly evocative of a time, place and man in dangerous flux. It is brilliance distilled, with very few impurities." [...] Suzi Feay, for the Financial Times, stated [...] "Quietly powerful, consistently surprising, Pure is a fine addition to a substantial body of work" [...] and also noted that [...] "Miller's portraits of women and <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>are</b> thoughtful and subtle." [...] Writing for the Daily Express Vanessa Berridge found the novel to be [...] "very atmospheric, if not to say positively creepy at times" [...] and stated that [...] "Miller's eloquent novel overflows with vitality and colour. It is packed with personal and physical details that evoke 18th-century Paris with startling immediacy." [...] Reviewing for the Daily Mail Clare Colvin stated that the novel [...] "draws you in with hallucinatory power" [...] and that she found that [...] "Miller evokes the underside of Parisian society with assured, vivid detail so that images remain in your mind long after you reach the last page. This is historical fiction with imaginative style." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{can be done}} {{in several}} ways. Some laypeople offer food, others offer robes and supplies, and others fund ceremonies, build monasteries or persuade a {{relative}} to ordain as a monk. Young people often temporary ordain as monks, because they believe this will not only yield fruits of merit for themselves, but also for their parents who have allowed them to ordain. In China, Thailand and India, it used to be common to offer land or the first harvest to a monastery. Also, more socially oriented activities such as building a hospital or bridge, or giving to <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>are</b> included in the Tipiṭaka, and by many Buddhists considered meritorious. In fieldwork studies done by researchers, devotees appreciated the merits of becoming ordained and supporting the building of a temple the most. Fisher found that building a temple was considered a great merit by devotees, because they believed they would in that way have part in all the wisdom which would be taught at that temple. People may pursue merit-making for different reasons, as Buddhist orthodoxy allows for various ideals, this-worldy or ultimate. Although many scholars have pointed out that devotees often aim for this-worldly benefits in merit-making, it has also been pointed out that in old age, people tend to make merit with a view on the next life and liberation. Among lay people, women tend to engage in merit-making more than men, and this may be a way for them to enhance empowerment. Very often, merit-making is done as a group, and it is believed that such shared merit-making will cause people to be born together in next lives. This belief holds for families, friends, communities and even the country as a whole. In some cases, merit-making took the form of a community-wide competition, in which different donors tried to outdo each other to prove their generosity and social status. This was the case during merit-making festivals in nineteenth-century Thailand. In modern Thailand, businesses and politicians often make merit to improve their public image and increase confidence among customers or voters. In Burma, lay devotees form associations to engage in merit-making as a community. People were so intent on merit-making and giving, that in some societies, people would even offer [...] and their family to a Buddhist temple, as one high-ranking minister did in the ancient Pagan Kingdom (ninth until fourteenth century Burma). On a similar note, in Sri Lanka, kings and commoners would offer slaves to the temple, and then donate money to pay for their freedom, that way accruing two merits at once. Even more symbolically, kings would sometimes offer their kingdom to a temple, which, returned the gift immediately, together with some Dhamma teaching. Also in Sri Lanka, King Mahakuli Mahatissa disguised himself as a peasant and started to earn his living working on a paddy field, so {{he would be able to}} gain more merit by working himself to obtain resources to give to Buddhist monks. In some cases, merit-making was even continued after a person's death: in ancient Thai tradition, it was considered meritorious for people to dedicate their corpses to feed the wild animals after death.|$|E
