25|$|The Swedish court's {{decision}} {{to grant the}} two critics access to the data was controversial. When <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>participants</b> were contacted by Gillberg {{and asked if they}} would be prepared to have the data released, all but one family refused. Citing that, and the promise of confidentiality given to the participants as a precondition, Gillberg and the other researchers decided to not turn over the personal data. 267 Swedish doctors signed a letter in support of Gillberg's {{decision to}} not hand over the data. After the verdict, the chairman of the Central Ethical Review Board of Sweden, Johan Munch, said that in Swedish legislation, the Principle of Public Access is incompatible with promises of absolute confidentiality, and that the Central Ethical Review Board therefore no longer approves such promises. According to Martin Ingvar of the Karolinska Institute, medical researchers in Sweden will be forced to change the current practice because of the verdict. Ingvar told media that medical studies in Sweden must now adhere to a strict anonymization encoding, even in extensive studies like Gillberg's which contain large amounts of clinical material collected over long periods of time, in spite of the increase in cost and the larger margins of error.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} was conducted to identify interventions that increase independence for students with autism.

A gap in the literature on Work Systems was identified among students with autism receiving their education in a secondary level inclusive setting. This study extended investigations of the effectiveness of Work Systems to include high school students with autism who are members of general education classrooms. A single subject research design was conducted across three classroom settings. Every stage of the intervention was implemented in the general education classroom and the Work System was designed to address the characteristics of the classroom arrangement. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>participant</b> was trained to independently complete nine observable behaviors included in the Work System. <b>The</b> <b>study</b> <b>participant</b> demonstrated increased levels of independence and productivity in the classroom {{with the use of the}} Work System. Results of a survey administered to <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>participant</b> and his mother reflected a positive experience with the Work System. The results of this study highlight Work Systems as an effective intervention for reducing off-task behaviors and increasing engagement in classroom expectations for students with autism in a secondary level inclusive setting...|$|R

Milgram had [...] "teachers" [...] that delivered mock electric shocks to the [...] "learner" [...] for every wrong answer that was given in a multiple choice test. The teachers, however, did not know that the electric shocks were not real, and still delivered them to the learners. At the end of the experiment, 65% of men ages 20–50 complied fully up to the very last voltage. In the same room as the teacher, there was a [...] "confederate" [...] that kept tabs on the teacher and if they were delivering the shocks to each wrong answer. In the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> <b>participants</b> signed a waiver that clearly explained the ability to opt out of the experiment and not deliver the shocks. But with the surprising result rate of teachers who did continue to shock the learners, there was a situational force. The situational force that influenced the teachers to continue was the voice of the confederate egging them on by phrases such as, [...] "I advise you to continue with this experiment" [...] or [...] "I am telling you to continue delivering the shocks" [...] and the one that caught most teachers was [...] "You must continue with the shocks." [...] Although the teachers knew that they could leave the experiment at any point in time, they still continued when they felt uncomfortable because of the confederate's voice demanding they proceed.|$|E
