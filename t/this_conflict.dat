5|$|Analysts {{see in the}} {{character}} of Lady Macbeth the conflict between femininity and masculinity as they are impressed in cultural norms. Lady Macbeth suppresses her instincts toward compassion, motherhood, and fragility — associated with femininity — in favour of ambition, ruthlessness, and the singleminded pursuit of power. <b>This</b> <b>conflict</b> colours the entire drama and sheds light on gender-based preconceptions from Shakespearean England to the present.|$|E

5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. <b>This</b> <b>conflict</b> of opinions {{came to a}} head in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics at a time when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 11th century, control of al-Rahba was contested between the Uqaylids of Mosul and the Fatimids of Egypt. Preceding <b>this</b> <b>conflict,</b> the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim {{appointed}} {{a member of}} the Al Khafajah tribe, Abu Ali ibn Thimal, as lord of al-Rahba. Abu Ali was killed in 1008/09 during a battle with his Uqaylid rivals led by Isa ibn Khalat. The latter lost al-Rahba to another Uqaylid emir, Badran ibn Muqallid. The latter's victory was short-lived as the Fatimid emir of Damascus, Lu'lu, soon captured both al-Rahba and Raqqa, a fortified city to the northwest.
