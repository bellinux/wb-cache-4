Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year. What he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing Redburn: [...] "I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time," [...] the narrator remarks, adding, [...] "I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt... and we removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises up in my throat and almost strangles me."

The song's lyrics portray [...] "the issues that arise when one plays the fool in a relationship." [...] During Rowland's concert series for iheartradio, the singer took time out {{to reflect on the}} song. She recalled, [...] "The first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose-colored glasses." [...] It was also revealed that, during the studio recording session with Dean, she began to cry at the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> [...] "toxic relationships" [...] she had been in [...] "where she needed to leave." [...] Later in an interview with The Belfast Telegraph, Rowland said that the song had taken its toll on her. She said [...] "It brought back a few memories, and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen." [...] Dean also worked alongside Rowland during last minute studio sessions with producer Tricky Stewart, which spawned a female empowerment song called [...] "I'm Dat Chick". Although [...] "Rose Colored Glasses" [...] was omitted from the US track listing, Dean's song [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] made the album appearing as the opening song. Written as a [...] "confidence-boosting" [...] anthem, [...] "I'm Dat Chick" [...] is built around an urban-electro club beat designed to get [...] "even shy women to come out of their shells" [...] according to Rap-Up magazine. Meanwhile, Dean's third contribution, [...] "Lay It on Me", features rapper Big Sean and centers on an up-tempo R melody with 808s and high NRG-led production.

40|$|Etienne van Heerden’s Die stoetmeester : {{visions of}} a dead prophet Although the title {{indicates}} that Van Heerden's fourth novel {{tells the story of}} a stud-master, the narrative structure shows how one personal history implicates a variety of other stories. In this way the novel illustrates how subjectivity interacts with the narratives of history and of culture. The dominant focalizer in the novel is a deceased Afrikaner attorney, Siener (meaning prophet), who is reviewing the circumstances leading to his death. His exceptional narrative position entitles him to go back in time and enter <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> characters involved. The result is a polyphonic display of voices and stories. In this article the question is posed whether the narrative position of the novel as a post-modern critique of truths and certainties can be reconciled with Siener’s explicit display of political preferences. Ultimately Van Heerden’s novel illustrates the Afrikaner author’s struggle for moral authority in the present transitional era...|$|R

The initiative involved more than one hundred of students, tutors and professors coming from twenty different countries of the world and took as main focus the problem of ‘Nutrition’, in accordance with the theme of the EXPO 2015 Exhibition. In order to guide the extended and complex theme of nutrition towards the architectural discipline the term Planet was replaced by the one of landscape. Exploited, mistreated and often bad interpreted, the landscape seems in fact back in the spotlight as a protagonist: a rare and limited resource, therefore precious, to which take care so that the planet of the future will be a ‘sustainable place’. In this sense the relationship between architecture and resources was the main reference for the design experiences made by the students involved in the three weeks workshop, during which they produced ten big projects oriented to express innovative ideas, methodologies and strategies for the transformation of some critical areas in Piacenza. The books gathers both the answers by the students and <b>the</b> theoretical <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> professors and tutors which have guided the students during this experience...|$|R

He founded 'Pratap', his famous revolutionary weekly, which identified itself with {{the cause of the}} oppressed wherever they might be and Pratap would prove to be widespread as its circulation jumped from five hundred in 1913 to six hundred in 1916. It was through this paper that he waged his famous fights for the oppressed peasants of Rae Bareli, the workers of the Kanpur mills and the downtrodden people of Indian states. During the course of these fights he had to face numerous prosecutions, pay heavy fines and suffer five prison sentences. On January 11, 1915, he said the following quote: [...] Now {{the time has come for}} our political ideology and our movement no to be restricted to the English-educated and to spread among the common people janta, and for Indian public opinion lokmat, to be not the opinion of those few educated individuals but to mirror <b>the</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> classes <b>of</b> the country...democratic rule is actually the rule of public opinion".
