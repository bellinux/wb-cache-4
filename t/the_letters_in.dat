5|$|The name-letter {{effect is}} the {{tendency}} of people to prefer <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> their name over other letters in the alphabet. Whether subjects are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out {{of a set of}} two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.|$|E
40|$|The {{transposal}} of PROSE into SPORE {{is exactly}} the same as the transposal of OLIVE into VOILE: both can be represented by the transformation 12345 - 41325, which says that <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> first position is moved to second position, <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> second position is moved to fourth position, and so on to <b>the</b> <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> fifth position which remains fixed.

5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> his newspaper, asserting that Priestley {{and his friends were}} fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.|$|E
5|$|Wilkes wrote a History of Oregon, Geographical and Political in 1845, {{which was}} inaccurate. Notwithstanding this, an extract {{from the work}} was {{published}} as Project for a National Railroad from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, also in 1845. It was popular and was in its fourth edition by 1847. In 1848 and 1849, Wilkes wrote a novel, loosely based on the life and murder of Helen Jewett, a New York prostitute. The novel was first serialized in the National Police Gazette before being published as a stand-alone work in 1849, titled The Lives of Helen Jewett and Richard P. Robinson. The novel was only based on Jewett's life and death, with much embellishment. It combined {{the facts of the}} case with elements from contemporary novels of murder mysteries and seduction in the growing cities of the time. Wilkes did have access to some of Jewett's letters, which had been held by the district attorney's office since Jewett's murder in 1836 and the subsequent trial. Wilkes, who obtained <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> 1848, also acquired the hatchet which had murdered Jewett. The letters were eventually published in the Police Gazette and even were displayed, along with the murder weapon, in the newspaper's office window.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the length}} of the key is known, the {{ciphertext}} can be rewritten into that many columns, with each column corresponding to a single letter of the key.

Using methods similar to those used to break the Caesar cipher, <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> the ciphertext can be discovered.|$|E
25|$|The first {{victim was}} her tutor, who carried the letters between them.

Two of the brothers escaped to France but they soon returned with the evident intention of concluding their revenge against Diego who, fearing for his life, hired a bodyguard.

25|$|The oldest {{forms of}} <b>the</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> antiquity are {{majuscule}} forms. Besides the upright, straight inscriptional forms (capitals) found in stone carvings or incised pottery, more fluent writing styles adapted for handwriting on soft materials were also developed during antiquity. Such handwriting has been preserved especially from papyrus manuscripts in Egypt since the Hellenistic period. Ancient handwriting developed two distinct styles: uncial writing, with carefully drawn, rounded block letters of about equal size, {{used as a}} book hand for carefully produced literary and religious manuscripts, and cursive writing, used for everyday purposes. The cursive forms approached the style of lowercase letter forms, with ascenders and descenders, {{as well as many}} connecting lines and ligatures between letters.|$|E

According to Worsham, the lab's equipment for drying spores, a machine the size of a refrigerator, was not in containment so that it would be expected that non-immunized personnel in that area would have become ill. Colleagues of Ivins at the lab have asserted that he couldn't have grown the quantity of anthrax used in the letters without their noticing it.|$|E
25|$|The first {{publication}} of <b>the</b> <b>letters,</b> <b>in</b> Latin, was in Paris in 1616, simultaneously in two editions. These editions {{gave rise to}} numerous translations of the letters into European languages ‚Äì and consequent 18th- and 19th-century interest {{in the story of}} the medieval lovers. In the 18th century, the couple were revered as tragic lovers, who endured adversity in life but were united in death. With this reputation, they were the only individuals from the pre-Revolutionary period whose remains were given a place of honour at the newly founded cemetery of P√®re Lachaise in Paris. At this time, they were effectively revered as romantic saints; for some, they were forerunners of modernity, at odds with the ecclesiastical and monastic structures of their day and to be celebrated more for rejecting the traditions of the past than for any particular intellectual achievement.|$|E
25|$|The main {{characteristic}} of these scripts was their writing style. <b>The</b> <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> {{most of these}} manuscripts are heavy-looking, relatively short and horizontally elongated. The slanted isolated form of the alif that was present in the Umayyad period completely disappeared {{and was replaced by}} a straight shaft with a pronounced right-sided foot, set at a considerable distance from the following letter. Also, unlike the Hijazi scripts, these are often richly illuminated in gold and other colors. Another difference is that sura headings are clearly marked and enclosed in rectangular panels with marginal vignettes or palmettes protruding into the outer margins. These Qurans of the early Abbasid period were also bound in wooden boards, structured like a box enclosed on all sides with a movable upper cover that was fastened {{to the rest of the}} structure with leather thongs.|$|E
