Considering the <b>target’s</b> <b>acceleration</b> as a timevarying bounded external disturbance, an estimator with an adaptive property is derived. It is proven that the proposed guidance law can guarantee the LOS angular rates global uniform ultimate boundedness during the terminal course.

In addition to compensating for the perceptual-motor delay, these predictive processes perpetuate eye motion during a transient occlusion and compensate for the loss of visual input. At present, however, it is not well understood whether and how the oculomotor system extracts and represents <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> for subsequent predictive control. To this end, we used a target occlusion paradigm where both position and velocity of the target during the occlusion and at reappearance could not be predicted without extracting <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> before target disappearance. We found that the oculomotor response during the blanking period was not influenced by <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> when the initial exposure was 200 ms. However, smooth and saccadic eye movements did discriminate between the different levels of acceleration after an initial 500 - or 800 -ms exposure. In the event that the smooth response during the occlusion did not match well the target trajectory and thus eliminate a developing displacement error, there was an increased saccadic displacement. Still, the combined response during the blanking period did not eliminate retinal slip and position error at target reappearance. These results indicate that information on <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> can be extracted on-line, during pursuit of a visible ramp, and then used to drive a predictive oculomotor response in the absence of visual input. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor the {{terminal}} guidance problem of missiles intercepting maneuvering {{targets in the}} three-dimensional space, the design of guidance laws for non-decoupling three-dimensional engagement geometry is studied. Firstly, by introducing a finite time integral sliding mode manifold, a novel guidance law based on the integral sliding mode control is presented with the <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> as a known bounded external disturbance. Then, an improved adaptive guidance law based on the integral sliding mode control without the information of the upper bound on the <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> is developed, where the upper bound of the <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> is estimated online by a designed adaptive law. The both presented guidance laws can {{make sure that the}} elevation angular rate of the line-of-sight and the azimuth angular rate of the line-of-sight converge to zero in finite time. In the end, the results of the guidance performance for the proposed guidance laws are presented by numerical simulations. Although the designed guidance laws are developed for the constant speed missiles, the simulation results for the time-varying speed missiles are also shown to further confirm the designed guidance laws...|$|E

We assessed the sensitivity of pursuit to acceleration or speed, and compared the results with those obtained in perceptual experiments done with similar stimuli and tasks. Specifically, observers pursued or made psychophysical judgments of targets that moved at randomly selected base speeds and subsequent accelerations. Oculomotor and psychophysical discrimination were compared by analyzing performance for the entire stimulus set sorted by either <b>target</b> <b>acceleration</b> or speed.
