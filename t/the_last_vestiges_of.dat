5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> these Nazi landmarks. The {{construction of the}} buildings {{in the area around}} the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable.

5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With {{the demise of the}} Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
5|$|Aided by NATO air cover, {{the rebel}} militia pushed westward, {{defeating}} loyalist armies and securing {{control of the}} centre of the country. Gaining the support of Amazigh (Berber) communities of the Nafusa Mountains, who had long been persecuted as non-Arabic speakers under Gaddafi, the NTC armies surrounded Gaddafi loyalists in several key areas of western Libya. In August, the rebels seized Zliten and Tripoli, ending <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> Gaddafist power.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated a Roman army in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War.

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E
5|$|Nobunaga granted Echizen to {{his general}} Shibata Katsuie, and in 1576 Katsuie's nephew Sakuma Morimasa {{penetrated}} deeper into Kaga, capturing Miyukizuka. In 1580, Morimasa destroyed the capital, Oyama Gobo. The same year, Ishiyama Hongan-ji surrendered. Despite {{the resistance of}} the Ikkō-Ikki being effectively suppressed, a few Kaga ikki fled the plains and entrenched themselves in the mountains at the fortified temples Torigoe and Futoge. Shibata Katsuie captured these strongholds in 1581, but the garrisons he established were over-run and the temples recaptured. Still in the year 1581, Katsuie and Sakuma Morimasa again recaptured the temples, killing all the Ikkō-ikki at the sites. Despite this, in 1582, resistance elements again recaptured Torigoe and Futoge. A third attack was mounted by Morimasa, and this time the final resistance elements were eliminated, ending <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> ikki rule in Kaga.|$|E

5|$|PedroII {{planned a}} trip to Europe which would result in his absence for almost a year. In his place, his {{daughter}} and heir Isabel became Regent. Since {{she was young and}} inexperienced, Rio Branco could not rely on Imperial intervention to help push through passage of the Emperor's anti-slavery legislation. By this time, the Conservative elders were no more, and he had risen to lead the Conservative Party. Rio Branco formed his Cabinet on 7 March 1871 and it would last until 25 June 1875—the second longest in the Empire's history. Rio Branco became the longest-serving prime minister. With a single exception, all ministers he appointed were young and inexperienced. Only one achieved prominence: João Alfredo Correia de Oliveira, who as President of the Council of Ministers would, on 13 May 1888, secure passage of the law that extinguished <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> slavery in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Camerinum in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, {{all of whom were}} probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army that faced the Romans at the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians. When the Roman army won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy and in the Battle of Populonia (282 BC) Rome destroyed <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> Etruscan power in the region.|$|E
5|$|The late 1960s and 1970s were a time {{of major}} change at Manual. A new wing {{featuring}} a gym with a seating capacity of 2,566 opened in 1971. The school had as many as 3,360 students in the 1971–72 school year, necessitating 17 portable classrooms {{in the front and}} rear courtyards. Manual still had grades seven through twelve at this time, and overcrowding gradually began to improve after Manual dropped the seventh and eight grades when Noe Middle School opened in 1974. Throughout the decade the administration gradually dropped <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> its manual training emphasis as the number of shop classes dwindled from 16 in 1971 to three in 1979. The Youth Performing Arts School, actually a magnet school within Manual, opened in 1978 and, along with the changing curriculum, presaged Manual's transition to an academically intensive magnet school in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The screenplay, {{written by}} the American b-film scenarist, Richard Landau, and heavily revised by Val Guest, {{presents}} a heavily compressed version {{of the events of}} the original television serial. The most significant plot change occurs at the climax of the film. In the television version, Quatermass appeals to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> the creature's humanity and convinces it to commit suicide to save the world. In the film, Quatermass kills the creature by electrocution. Nigel Kneale was critical of the changes made for the film adaptation and of the casting of Brian Donlevy, whose brusque interpretation of Quatermass was not to his liking. To make the film's plot convincing to audiences, Guest employed a high degree of realism, directing the film in a style akin to a newsreel. The film was shot on location in London, Windsor and Bray and at Hammer's Bray Studios. Carroon's transformation was effected by makeup artist Phil Leakey, who worked in conjunction with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to accentuate Wordsworth's naturally gaunt features to give him an alien appearance. Special effects, including a model of the fully mutated creature seen at the climax, were provided by Les Bowie. The music was composed by James Bernard, the first of many scores he wrote for Hammer.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada be placed around the shield {{in order to bring}} these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E

25|$|The Board's {{operations}} briefly {{became the}} responsibility of the Christchurch City Council before being transferred to a new company, Christchurch Transport Limited.

25|$|In 1880, the Wellington Harbour Board was {{established}} to manage and develop the harbour and its facilities.

This removed <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>vestiges</b> <b>of</b> private ownership of the foreshore, putting the waterfront under the control of the Harbour Board.|$|E
