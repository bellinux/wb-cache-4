5|$|Scheele {{and other}} chemists {{were aware that}} {{manganese}} dioxide contained a new element, {{but they were not}} able <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> it.

5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} <b>to</b> <b>isolate.</b> Thorium is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: thorium pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is reacted with nitric acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate.

5|$|Historically, {{manganese}} {{is named}} for pyrolusite and other black minerals from the region of Magnesia in Greece, which also gave its name to magnesium and the iron ore magnetite. By the mid-18th century, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be manganese dioxide) contained a new element, but they were unable <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon.|$|E

40|$|An agar disc {{diffusion}} {{method was}} used to examine the sensitivity of 27 Haemophilus paragallinarum (Hpg) isolates consisted of 23 local isolates, 4 standard isolates (serotype A) and Escherichia coli ATCC 24922 as a control to eight antimicrobial drugs (ampicillin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, doxycycline, neomycin, streptomycin, colistine and sulphanlethoxazole-trimethoprim). Twenty one out of 23 local isolates of Hpg were sensitive <b>to</b> doxycycline, 19 <b>isolates</b> <b>to</b> ampsllin, 18 <b>isolates</b> <b>to</b> oxytetracycline, 17 <b>isolates</b> <b>to</b> sulphametoxazole-trimethoprim, 16 <b>isolates</b> <b>to</b> erythromycin, and 13 <b>isolates</b> <b>to</b> neomycin, while 13 <b>isolates</b> were resistance <b>to</b> colistine and 11 isolates were also resistance to streptomycin. ...|$|R

5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin {{was the first to}} observe that lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin tried and failed <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

5|$|Electrolysis of {{a mixture}} of {{beryllium}} fluoride and sodium fluoride was used <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the alkali metals. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of beryllium iodide was investigated following {{the success of a}} similar process for the production of zirconium, but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 and who was able <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E

An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred gratification, though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred gratification. Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed gratification.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{realized}} that the beta decay of 239Np must produce an isotope of element 94 (now called plutonium), but the quantities involved in McMillan and Abelson's original experiment were too small <b>to</b> <b>isolate</b> and identify plutonium along with neptunium.
