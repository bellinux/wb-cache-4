500|$|According to critic Harold Bloom, in his {{analysis}} of [...] "Times-Square", the first line of the fourth stanza ("I ain't playing dozens mister") is an allusion to the Dozens, a game in which the participants insult each other. [...] The game is mentioned in later poems, [...] "The <b>Thirteens</b> (Black)" [...] and [...] "The <b>Thirteens</b> (White)." [...] According to critic Geneva Smitherman, Angelou uses the <b>Thirteens,</b> a twist on the Dozens, to compare the insults of blacks and whites, which allows her to compare the actions of the two races. [...] Bloom compares [...] "Times-Square" [...] to Langston Hughes' blues/protest poetry. [...] He suggests {{that the best way to}} analyze the subjects, style, themes, and use of vernacular in this and most of Angelou's poems is to use [...] "a blues-based model", since like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. Hagen compares the themes in [...] "The <b>Thirteens</b> (Black and White)" [...] with Angelou's poems [...] "Communication I" [...] and [...] "Communication II", which appear in Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well, her second volume of poetry.|$|R
