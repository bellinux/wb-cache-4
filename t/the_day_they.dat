5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>they</b> set out, Australian airmen {{reported}} that the garrisons at El Arish and Maghara Hills, in {{the centre of the}} Sinai, appeared to have been withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Wild equines {{may spend}} seven {{hours a day}} sleeping. During <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> sleep {{standing}} up while at night they lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks and other objects and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the mountain zebra, wild equines can roll over completely.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens {{generally}} walk {{when moving}} {{around on the}} ground, though do hop when hurrying. They preen themselves frequently, particularly when roosting {{in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>They</b> also engage in allopreening, where birds will preen each other's head and neck. This takes place particularly in autumn, winter and spring, and is important in pair bonding. Either member may initiate it, generally by landing near the other bird, shuffling next to its mate, then bending its head forward and presenting its nape.|$|E
50|$|Addica and Glazer often wrote scenes <b>the</b> <b>day</b> before <b>they</b> were shot, {{giving them}} to the actors on <b>the</b> actual <b>day</b> <b>they</b> were shooting.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George, however, {{carried his}} plan into effect. <b>The</b> next <b>day</b> <b>they</b> went to Antwerp; and on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{following}} <b>they</b> crossed <b>the</b> Belgian frontier, and entered Holland.|$|R
5000|$|Workshops. More than 70 {{workshops}} {{are offered}} over <b>the</b> three <b>days.</b> Attendees can attend {{any of the}} workshops on <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>they</b> register for.|$|R
5|$|Cockatoos {{maintain}} their plumage with frequent preening throughout <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>They</b> remove dirt {{and oil and}} realign feather barbs by nibbling their feathers. They also preen other birds' feathers that are otherwise hard to get at. Cockatoos produce preen-oil from a gland on their lower back and apply it by wiping their plumage with their heads or already oiled feathers. Powder-down is produced by specialised feathers in the lumbar region and distributed by the preening cockatoo all over the plumage.|$|E
5|$|No. 6 Commando led {{the brigade}} from the beach. Moving through a swamp that briefly slowed their progress, the commandos {{began to come}} up against the German defences {{that had not been}} {{destroyed}} by the naval bombardment. Where possible they attempted an indirect approach, penetrating the defences using infiltration tactics. However, as they advanced towards bridges that had been captured by the paratroopers earlier in <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> assaulted four pillboxes as well as an artillery battery that had been firing on the landing beaches.|$|E
5|$|On 20 December 1943, the under-strength Loyal Edmonton Regiment {{moved toward}} Ortona, with the Seaforth Highlanders {{covering}} their eastern flank. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> encountered {{heavy machine gun}} fire during their attempts to enter Ortona. By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on {{the western edge of}} Ortona, yet had encountered heavy resistance in their attempts to secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.|$|E
60|$|At length {{the party}} arrived safely at Grindelwald {{and put up}} at an {{excellent}} inn, with windows looking out upon the glaciers. <b>The</b> next <b>day</b> <b>they</b> {{went to see the}} glaciers; and on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> following <b>they</b> returned to Interlachen.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> next <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> {{were buried}} in Safed.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> next <b>day</b> <b>they</b> searched again, {{but with}} no better success.|$|R
5|$|Pied currawongs are vocal birds, calling when {{in flight}} and at all times of <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>They</b> are more noisy {{early in the morning}} and in the evening before roosting, as well as before rain. The loud {{distinctive}} call has been translated as Kadow-Kadang or Curra-wong, akin to a croak. They also have a loud, high-pitched, wolf-like whistle, transcribed as Wheeo. The endemic Lord Howe Island subspecies has a distinct, more melodious call.|$|E
5|$|Suriname-born Milton Kam, who {{had shot}} 10 feature films {{and more than}} 50 short films, {{was chosen as the}} {{director}} of photography. Since Domalpalli's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio, he was shocked to look through the Super 16mm lens <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>they</b> commenced the shoot. However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E
5|$|Tall eucalypts {{that are}} {{emergent}} over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It {{is here that}} the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from the heat of <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>They</b> often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather.|$|E
60|$|And on <b>the</b> selfsame <b>day</b> <b>they</b> were to {{proclaim}} that {{that first day}} should be a holy convocation unto them. The which the apostles did, and grounded that their proclamation so on the resurrection of Jesus Christ, not on ceremonies, that at <b>the</b> same <b>day</b> <b>they</b> brought three thousand souls to God (Acts 2:41).|$|R
50|$|He {{represented}} {{hope for}} Dadaab Youth and the Somali community at large. He {{was the first}} person from Dadaab to hold such a high government office. Everyone looked up to him and started dreaming of <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>they</b> will all go back home.|$|R

5|$|The {{experiment}} {{is now in}} full flow with the gas affecting the townspeople's thinking. About half the town, including Frantz and Suzanne, talk revolution. Others give themselves to pleasure. Fritz and Suzel sing of making love until <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>they</b> die. The political agitators intend to overthrow the town council but Niklausse and Van Tricasse persuade them instead to attack a neighbouring town over an incident 700 years earlier involving a stray cow. Frantz is appointed the war leader for pledging to kill the most people.|$|E
5|$|Though quite agile on land (capable {{of running}} {{as fast as}} a horse), capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are {{excellent}} swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the morning}} of 26 September, the Germans pressed home their attacks and finally linked up from both sides at the river. It was not until about noon that they {{realised}} the British had actually withdrawn. Later in <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> rounded up about 600 men, mostly {{the men in the}} aid stations and those left on the north bank, as well as some pockets of resistance that had been out of radio contact with division Headquarters and did not know about the withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> {{earliest}} <b>days,</b> <b>they</b> were {{a significant}} manufacturer of salt glaze pottery.|$|R

5|$|After {{learning}} {{about his past}} life, Harsha is rescued from the lake by a fisherman named Solomon (who is the reincarnation of Sher Khan) and, with Soloman's help, visits Udayghad. He gains access to Raghuveer's palace and overhears Ghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's memories of the past are not revived within <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>they</b> can never be revived, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu and takes her to Bhairavakona and in the process, Ghora is accidentally killed by Raghuveer. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived; she reunites with Harsha. Harsha fights Raghuveer, {{and with the help}} of Solomon, manages to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the {{regiment}} undertook basic training including weapons handling, ceremonial drill, mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres. In late April, they marched through {{the centre of}} Sydney {{as part of a}} farewell before deploying overseas. On 11 June, after the brigade had concentrated, {{the regiment}} embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic. After four days steaming, the ship put into Adelaide, South Australia, where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at that time of year. The men continued on their journey three days later, undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> <b>They</b> crossed the equator in the early afternoon on 5 July; a short time later an epidemic of measles broke out.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> next <b>day</b> <b>they</b> {{embarked}} {{on board the}} steamer, and returned to Geneva.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> early <b>days,</b> <b>they</b> did {{not confirm}} haplogroups for either mtDNA or Y-DNA.|$|R
50|$|On <b>the</b> fourth <b>day</b> <b>they</b> {{entered into}} lunar orbit and {{prepared}} for lunar descent.|$|R
5|$|In 1954, at {{a psychic}} event in California, Ruth was {{introduced}} to Ernest Norman, who told her that in a past life {{she had been the}} daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>they</b> met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study of the group that Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Khalid ignored Cave's warning, and {{his forces}} began {{mustering}} in the Palace Square {{under the command}} of Captain Saleh of the palace bodyguard. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> numbered 2,800 men armed with rifles and muskets. The majority were civilians, but the force included 700 Zanzibari Askari soldiers who had sided with Khalid. The sultan's artillery, which consisted of several Maxim machine guns, a Gatling gun, a 17th-century bronze cannon and two 12-pounder field guns, was aimed at the British ships in the harbour. The 12-pounders had been presented to the sultan by Wilhelm II, the German emperor. The sultan's troops also took possession of the Zanzibari Navy, which consisted of one wooden sloop, the HHS Glasgow, built as a royal yacht for the sultan in 1878 based on the British frigate Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1737, penniless, Johnson {{left for}} London {{with his former}} pupil David Garrick. To make things worse, Johnson {{received}} word that his brother had died on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>they</b> left. However, their prospects were not completely hopeless, as Garrick was set to inherit a large sum the next year. Also, Garrick had connections in London, and the two would stay with his distant relative, Richard Norris, who lived on Exeter Street. Johnson did not stay there long, and set out for Greenwich near the Golden Hart Tavern to finish Irene. During that time, he wrote to Cave on 12 July 1737 and proposed a translation for Paolo Sarpi's The History of the Council of Trent (1619), which Cave did not accept until months later.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> next <b>day,</b> <b>they</b> go out {{together}} and accidentally {{fall in love}} with each other after pretending to be a married couple. After <b>the</b> <b>day</b> ended, <b>they</b> both went back to the hotel. In the hotel, Gaygay was waiting in the lobby for them and they exchanged their bag. Xiao Yu is very angry about Lee's deception. She slaps him and runs away.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> next <b>day</b> <b>they,</b> with Peter and Jake, {{stopped at}} the house as they passed.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Melamed {{told his}} {{followers}} to deduct <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>they</b> spent in prison protesting the disengagement from <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>they</b> serve on Israeli Defense Force (IDF) reserve duty, suggesting even that <b>they</b> might multiply <b>the</b> <b>days</b> in prison two- or three-fold. In 2009, he expressed support for soldiers disobeying IDF orders if they came {{in conflict with the}} soldier's political or religious beliefs. This position gained some support from fellow rabbis. Melamed was threatened with consequences for his stance, and eventually, then-Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, cancelled the Hesder program at Melamed's Yeshiva. In July 2013, Barak's successor, Moshe Ya'alon, resumed the program. In 2012, concerned that IDF members were being forced to listen to women singing (in conflict with a religious prohibition on doing so), he called for followers to delay enlisting until that policy was changed.|$|R
