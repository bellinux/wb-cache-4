The only co-worker he invites {{to the funeral}} is Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez), who flees when Dwight begins shooting the corpse with a shotgun to ensure it is really dead. At the funeral, Dwight's family gathers: his cousins Mose (Michael Schur) and Zeke (Matt Jones), his brother Jeb (Thomas Middleditch), his sister Fannie (Majandra Delfino), his nephew Cammy (Blake Garrett Rosenthal), and his uncle Heinrich (Tom Bower). The family learns that Aunt Shirley has willed the siblings her estate {{on the condition that}} <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>come</b> back home to run it. Despite Dwight's enthusiasm in inheriting it, Fannie and Jeb are unwilling to move back in {{due to the lack of}} sophistication farm life offers. Nevertheless, Dwight convinces them to help him run the farm.|$|E
25|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{state that}} the essential nature of the messengers is twofold: they are at once human and divine. They are divine in that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>come</b> from the same God and expound His teachings. In this light they are seen as one and the same. At {{the same time they}} are separate individuals (their human reality) and known by different names. Each fulfills a definite mission, and is entrusted with a particular revelation.|$|E

500|$|The Euthanasia Coaster {{is an art}} {{concept for}} a steel roller coaster {{designed}} to kill its passengers. In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas, a PhD candidate at the Royal College of Art in London. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated {{that the goal of}} his concept roller coaster is to take lives [...] "with elegance and euphoria". As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned [...] "euthanasia" [...] or [...] "execution". John Allen, who {{served as president of the}} Philadelphia Toboggan Company, inspired Urbonas with his description of the [...] "ultimate" [...] roller coaster as one that [...] "sends out 24 people and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>come</b> back dead".|$|E
500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>come,</b> we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, and pull it down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!" [...] repeated eight times in succession, possibly referring to the plane's yoke.|$|E

2500|$|In 924, it was reported: In {{the shops}} and the markets, control of silk and money has {{resulted}} in the circulation of small lead coins which we readily find in great quantities; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>come</b> from south of the [...] river whence the merchants transport them here surreptitiously. In 929, the Chu authorities fixed the value of a lead coin as 1/100 of a bronze coin. In 962, it was decreed that the lead coins should circulate in towns, and copper coins outside of them. Those contravening this risked the death penalty.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil’s public {{research}} institutes {{and universities}} follow rigid rules {{that tend to}} make them difficult to manage. States may opt {{to develop their own}} research institutes and university systems but, as all laws and regulations are adopted at federal level, they all have to follow the same rules and regulations. Thus, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>come</b> up against the same hurdles. These include extensive bureaucratic structures, an obligation to recruit staff, academic or otherwise, from among public servants, analogous career ladders and salary systems, an irregular flow of funds, overly complex procurement procedures and powerful unions in the civil service. A structural alternative was developed in 1998, with the creation of social organizations. These private, non-profit entities manage public research facilities under contract to federal agencies. They have the autonomy to hire (or fire) staff, contract services, buy equipment, choose the topics and objectives of scientific or technological research and sign research contracts with private companies. The flexibility accorded to these social organizations and their management style have made them a success story in Brazilian science. As of 2015, there were six such organizations: ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the film}} {{approached}} release, Gilliam {{learned that the}} Writers Guild of America (WGA) would not allow Cox and Davies {{to be removed from}} the credits even though none of their material was used in the production of the film. According to WGA rules, Gilliam and Grisoni had to prove that they wrote 60% of their script. The director said, [...] "But there have been at least five previous attempts at adapting the book, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>come</b> from the book. They all use the same scenes." [...] Gilliam remarked in an interview, [...] "The end result was we didn't exist. As a director, I was automatically deemed a 'production executive' by the guild and, by definition, discriminated against. But for Tony to go without any credit would be really unfair." [...] David Kanter, agent for Cox and Davies, argued, [...] "About 60 percent of the decisions they made on what stays in from the book are in the film – as well as their attitude of wide-eyed anarchy." [...] According to the audio commentary by Gilliam on the Criterion Collection DVD, during the period where it appeared that only Cox and Davies would be credited for the screenplay, the film was to begin with a short scene in which it is explained that no matter what is said in the credits, no writers were involved in the making of the film. When this changed in early May 1998 after the WGA revised its decision and gave credit to Gilliam and Grisoni first and Cox and Davies second, the short was not needed. Angered over having to share credit, Gilliam publicly burned his WGA card at a May 22 book signing on Broadway.|$|E
