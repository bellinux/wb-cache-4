5|$|Demonstrative pronouns {{distinguish}} between proximate and remote. When they occur independently, they inflect for number. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be suffixed to nouns, e.g. /tabardaja/ 'this pack-saddle'.|$|E
5|$|Earthbags {{may be used}} to make {{dome-shaped}} or vertical wall buildings. With {{soil stabilization}} <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be used for retaining walls.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{supports}} {{effectiveness and}} safety in adolescents {{and those who}} have and have not previously had children. IUDs do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be used immediately after an abortion. Once removed, even after long term use, fertility returns to normal immediately.|$|E
5|$|Flame robins {{often become}} more {{abundant}} in areas recently burnt by bushfires, but move away once the undergrowth regrows. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> move into logged or cleared areas in forests. However, a field {{study in the}} Boola Boola State Forest in central Gippsland revealed they are not found {{in areas where the}} regrowth after logging is dense.|$|E
5|$|For {{older people}} with chronic pain, opioids {{may be used}} in those for whom NSAIDs present too great a risk, {{including}} those with diabetes, stomach or heart problems. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be useful for a select group of people with neuropathic pain.|$|E
30|$|When TaaS {{providers}} are organizations {{accepted by the}} cloud industry, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> act <b>also</b> as a quality assurance mechanism. Therefore, accredited certification third parties can naturally become also a TaaS provider.|$|R
3000|$|... [*]Policy. Policies {{are written}} in an {{extended}} version of Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [22], but <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> expressed using an ontology language like Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) [23].|$|R
30|$|For example, if {{participants}} answered “Orwell” to the question: “What is {{the last}} name of the author who wrote Brave New World?” <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> received the incorrect but plausible lure “Orwell” as false feedback.|$|R
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} offer a {{range of}} volunteer-led programming, usually focusing on anthropomorphic art, crafts, music and literature. Some raise money for charity. Attendees often dress up and wear artistic name badges for identification, though the majority do not bring fursuits. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> spend money {{on the work of}} amateur and professional artists, both directly and at auction.|$|E
5|$|Some probiotics {{have been}} shown to be {{beneficial}} in reducing both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial. Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is usually}} seen singly {{or in small}} groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is often found {{in the company of}} kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E
50|$|Please note, that {{although}} some non-selective serotonin antagonists {{may have an}} particular affinity for a specific 5-HT receptor (and thus may be listed above e.g. methysergide), <b>they</b> still <b>may</b> <b>also</b> possess a generalised non-selective action.|$|R
50|$|This {{military}} futuwa {{was also}} practiced by Javans, mercenary soldiers of 10th and 11th centuries in Khurasan, Persia (although <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have <b>also</b> had non-Muslim soldiers amongst them). Apparently {{it may have}} been a model for janissaries.|$|R

5|$|The {{scaly-breasted munia}} feeds mainly on seeds but also eats small berries {{such as those}} of Lantana. Although the bill is suited for {{crushing}} small grains, they do not show lateral movements of the lower mandible which help European greenfinches in dehusking seeds. Like some other munias, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> feed on algae, a rich protein source, prior to the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Whale song {{is thought}} to have an {{important}} role in mate selection; however, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be used between males to establish dominance. Polygamy has been observed in humpback whales, with the females having multiple male partners throughout their lifespan.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} cairn {{was erected}} near {{the crash site}} by the regiment in 1987. A special remembrance was held in Valemount for the 60th anniversary of the disaster in 2010.

The names of the military dead are inscribed in the Korea Book of Remembrance and are also on the Wall of Remembrance in Brampton, Ontario; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be found on the Korea Cairn at Winnipeg Brookside Cemetery. Manitoba has named a lake for Gunner William D. Wright, who died in the crash.|$|E
50|$|An {{associate}} specialist is {{a hospital}} doctor and is generally {{treated as a}} senior doctor. Pay is usually {{lower than that of}} a consultant (though as associate specialists sometimes have fewer duties <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be <b>also</b> be paid less overall).|$|R
50|$|Zig zag stitches, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Marriage Lines, {{can be used}} to represent the typical highs and low of matrimony and marriage life. <b>They</b> are <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be used to represent the twisting cliff paths that are on the islands.|$|R
25|$|Formulas to {{calculate}} {{sediment transport rate}} exist for sediment moving in several {{different parts of the}} flow. These formulas are often segregated into bed load, suspended load, and wash load. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> sometimes <b>also</b> be segregated into bed material load and wash load.|$|R
5|$|Adult Lepidoptera {{have two}} pairs of {{membranous}} wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute fibres and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> contain tracheae, nerve fibres and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|Attendees {{of major}} {{conventions}} receive a {{bag with the}} convention book (or conbook), a lavishly illustrated volume featuring themed artwork, fiction and articles submitted by members and the Guests of Honor, along {{with a description of}} the event's programming, staff, rules, guests and any charity being supported by the convention.

Sponsors often receive additional items such as T-shirts, pins or ribbons, as well as faster registration badge pick-up and on-site meals (some conventions provide a con suite with basic refreshments for all members). <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> be displayed prominently in convention publications.|$|E
50|$|Interjectives are {{isolated}} words {{or groups of}} words of an exclamatory nature, used to express emotion, or {{for the purpose of}} calling attention, giving commands, or conveying assent or dissent. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> themselves <b>also</b> constitute complete sentences, without the use of predicates.|$|R
50|$|Nonessential {{nutrients}} {{are those}} nutrients {{that can be}} made by the body; <b>they</b> <b>may</b> often <b>also</b> be absorbed from consumed food. The majority of animals ultimately derive their essential nutrients from plants, though some animals may consume mineral-based soils to supplement their diet.|$|R
50|$|Damage waivers are not {{necessarily}} complete. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> have deductibles (<b>also</b> called excess) and limits on the amount covered. Liability coverage always has limits.|$|R
5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa {{as it is in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile and breathing gas. In some cases <b>they</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
50|$|Vortex rings <b>may</b> <b>also</b> {{be formed}} {{in the wake of}} a solid object that falls or moves through a fluid at {{sufficient}} speed. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> form <b>also</b> ahead of an object that abruptly reverses its motion with the fluid, as when producing smoke rings by shaking an incense stick. A vortex ring can also be created by a spinning propeller, as in a blender.|$|R
