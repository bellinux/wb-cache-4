5|$|Commercial {{operations}} are remunerated activities which {{fall within the}} ICAO definition of CAT. Some are, however, closely aligned to, and considered part of, the GA sector. Public transport {{operations are}} non-scheduled, on-demand services flying between points specified by the customer, providing a more flexible service than airline travel. Air taxi operations offer charter services for third parties, and business or corporate aviation uses company-owned aircraft to transport employees and clients. Aircraft used in these operations include business jets, helicopters, and twin piston-engine aeroplanes carrying between six and ten people. An example of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> is the transport by helicopter of spectators to the British Formula One grand prix at Silverstone. This involves so many flights that, according to Cranfield Aviation Services, on race day the heliport is temporarily the world's busiest airport. Aerial work is a small but {{important component of the}} commercial GA sector, characterised in its simplest form as remunerated non-transport activities, such as surveying, crop spraying, and emergency services work (air ambulance and police).|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the {{majority}} of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost {{as soon as they}} landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, {{the vast majority of the}} commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.|$|E

Consequently, safety is a priority and important consideration on Habitat construction sites, and volunteers are given safety orientations and {{they are required to}} work with skilled construction supervisors on the build sites. Depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> OSHA rules may be generally applicable to Habitat construction sites, similar to for-profit builders.

25|$|If {{the cancer}} has been {{diagnosed}} {{while still in}} an early stage, surgical treatment with a curative intention may be possible. Some small tumors that only involve the mucosa or lining of the esophagus may be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). Otherwise, curative surgery of early-stage lesions may entail removal of {{all or part of}} the esophagus (esophagectomy), although this is a difficult operation with a relatively high risk of mortality or post-operative difficulties. The benefits of surgery are less clear in early-stage ESCC than EAC. There are a number of surgical options, and the best choices for particular situations remain the subject of research and discussion. As well as characteristics and location of the tumor, other factors include the patient's condition, and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> the surgical team is most experienced with.|$|E
25|$|When the Board of Control {{published}} {{their second}} survey in 1961 {{the use of}} psychosurgery had declined by more than half; the decline being attributed to {{an awareness of the}} risks of irreversible effects and the introduction in 1955 of neuroleptic drugs. By 1961 nearly half of mental hospitals in the United Kingdom were no longer carrying out leucotomies. Approximately 500 operations were performed a year, and were unevenly distributed over the country. Someone hospitalised in the North East Metropolitan region was more than 15 times more likely to undergo psychosurgery than someone hospitalised in the neighbouring East Anglian region. There were also random differences in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> used and the type of illness treated. Twenty per cent of operations were still standard pre-frontal leucotomies; the rest were new operations, and a few centres used stereotactic techniques. Some hospitals still used psychosurgery to treat chronic schizophrenia, in others the only indications were depression or obsessive illness.|$|E

500|$|In June 2006, Colonel Sean MacFarland and the 1st Brigade Combat Team (BCT) of the 1st Armored Division {{were sent}} to Ramadi. Colonel MacFarland was told to [...] "Fix Ramadi, but don't do a Fallujah." [...] Many Iraqis assumed the 1st BCT was {{preparing}} for exactly that <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> with over 77 M1 Abrams tanks and 84 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, but Colonel MacFarland had another plan. Prior to Ramadi, the 1st BCT had been stationed in {{the northern city of}} Tal Afar, where Colonel H. R. McMaster in 2005 had pioneered a new type of operation: [...] "Clear, Hold, Build". Under McMaster's approach, his commanders saturated an area with soldiers until it had been cleared of insurgents, then held it until Iraqi security forces were gradually built to a level where they could assume control. As in other offensive operations, many insurgents fled the city in anticipation of a big battle. The 1st BCT moved into some of Ramadi's most dangerous neighborhoods and, beginning in July, built four of what would eventually become eighteen Combat Outposts. The soldiers brought the territory under control and inflicted many casualties on the insurgents in the process. On 24 July, AQI launched a counterattack, launching 24 assaults, each with about 100 fighters, on American positions. Despite the reported presence of AQI leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the insurgents failed in all of their attacks and lost about 30 men. Several senior American officers, including General David Petraeus, later compared the fighting to the Battle of Stalingrad. Despite the success, Multi-National Force– Iraq continued to view Ramadi as a secondary front to the ongoing civil war in Baghdad and considered moving two of Colonel MacFarland's battalions to Baghdad. Colonel MacFarland even publicly described his operations as [...] "trying to take the heat off Baghdad." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Apprehension Tactical Team or [...] "A-Team" [...] is ESU's {{full-time}} tactical element.

A-Team members strictly perform tactical missions which, {{on a day-to-day basis}} are typically High-Risk search warrants. The A-Team is widely considered to have the highest operational tempo of any US tactical team, sometimes performing as many as 800–1000 missions per year. The team can be called upon to support any unit within the NYPD, federal law enforcement agencies or outside police departments upon official request for tactical entries. Members of the Apprehension Team are also utilized as tactical and firearms trainers both within ESU and to other NYPD units. The A-Team has participated in many of the city's most notable criminal take-down operations of recent decades many times without recognition. Members of the team are recruited from within ESU, based on team needs and assignment to the team is highly selective.

In recent times, the numbers <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> used in various centres have gradually reduced as the principles necessary to ensure adequate cosmetic and functional results with minimum complications are better understood. The aim of this article was to review the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> used for managing hypospadias in a tertiary hospital in a developing country, to analyse the complications of surgery and discuss the factors that contribute to complications. Materials and Methods: Patient folders, theatre, and ward records were used to obtain the required information.

Results and Conclusion: With three main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> tubularised incised plate urethroplasty and meatal advancement and glanuloplasty incorporated for anterior hypospadias (glanular, coronal, subcoronal, distal, midpenile), and lateral based flap urethroplasty for posterior hypospadias (proximal penile, penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal), most hypospadias were corrected with acceptable complication rates...|$|R
