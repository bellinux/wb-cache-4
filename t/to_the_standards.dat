5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced {{to ensure that it}} did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required quite small spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E

5|$|Under Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer {{was firmly}} {{committed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of ethical drugs, {{as opposed to}} patent medicines. Ethical drugs were drugs that could be obtained only through a pharmacist, usually with a doctor's prescription. Advertising drugs directly to consumers was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors.|$|E
5|$|By 1889, Manmohan had {{determined}} {{to pursue a}} literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations {{but to do so}} when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of Oscar Browning. He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College. Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{proposed}} that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, {{as long as}} the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time (d∝t2). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} refuel their nuclear power plants, the {{carriers}} each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This {{is also the}} most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of the nuclear power plants.|$|E

He then started a {{relationship with}} Emma Beal, together having two children, Thomas (born December 2002) and Mia (born March 2004). At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park, Livingstone got into an argument with Beal's friend Robin Hedges, {{a reporter for the}} Evening Standard. Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his ribs and ended up in hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although he insisted that he did not. Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly referred the matter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standards</b> Board for England, who ruled that there was no evidence for any wrongdoing on Livingstone's behalf.|$|E
5|$|The Bofors 40 mm {{anti-aircraft}} gun was used {{on almost every}} major warship in the US and UK fleet from about 1943 to 1945. Although a descendant of German, Dutch, and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the US Navy during World War II had been heavily Americanized to bring the guns up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> placed on them by the Navy. This resulted in a gun system set to British standards (now known as the Standard System) with interchangeable ammunition, which simplified the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with hydraulic couple drives to reduce salt contamination and the Mark 51 director for improved accuracy, the Bofors 40mm gun became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{appearance}} of new Soviet tanks {{such as the}} T-80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded {{the development of new}} technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor. The T-80B had increased firepower and a new composite ceramic armor. The T-72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt to bring it up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of the T-80B. In 1985 the new T-72B version entered production, with a new laminate armor protection system; its turret armor, designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles, surpassed the T-80B's in protection.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 1970s, Syracuse University {{was under}} {{pressure}} to improve its football facilities in order to remain a NCAA Division I football school. Its small concrete stadium, Archbold Stadium, was seventy years old and not up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of other schools. The stadium could not be expanded; it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to the fire codes. Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium. In 1978, Archbold Stadium was demolished {{to make way for the}} Carrier Dome, which was to have a domed Teflon-coated, fiberglass inflatable roof. It would also serve as the home for the men's basketball team, as a replacement for Manley Field House. The Carrier Dome was constructed between April 1979 and September 1980. The total construction cost was $26.85million, including a $2.75million naming gift from the Carrier Corporation.|$|E

There, while waiting for the arrival of new musical instruments and equipment, they continued the search for a singer through an advertisement in the British music paper Melody Maker. Rod Stewart was among the dozens of aspiring vocalists that were considered for the auditions, but was not up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> the band required. They chose Rod Evans instead, who was already the singer of the club band The Maze. Evans brought along after the audition his 19-year-old bandmate Ian Paice, a drummer whom Blackmore recognised from his days in Hamburg. They quickly improvised an audition for Paice and he was chosen on the spot to replace Woodman behind the drum kit. Woodman was unhappy with the direction the band was heading and the other members thought that he was not suited for their sound.|$|E

In September 2012, the ministry concluded that also the second report was insufficient {{and that it would be}} discarded. There were two main concerns with the report. Firstly, it was based on a single-track line which would not be built <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of high-speed rail. The ministry stated that all new railway plans in Norway were to have double track and be optimized for high-speed rail. Secondly, the report had a simplified economic analysis which was not sufficient to be used for political evaluation. The result of the discard was that the planning of E16 was no longer tied to the planning of the railway.|$|E
