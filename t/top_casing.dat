40|$|Material fatigue is {{a failure}} mode that {{has been known to}} {{researchers}} and engineers since the 19 th century. Catastrophic accidents have happened due to fatigue failures of structures, machinery and transport vehicles. The capsizing of the semisubmersible rig Alexander L. Kielland in Norwegians waters in 1980 killed 123 people, and investigations pointed at the fatigue failure of a weld as one of the direct causes. This accident led to a number of improvements to the design of offshore structures. The noticeable safety principle ”No single accident should lead to escalating consequences” has since been adopted in a widespread manner. Since 1992 the Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway has enforced a risk based safety regime. Wells are designed to hold back reservoir pressures and avoid uncontrolled escape of hydrocarbons. In other words a well is a pressure containing vessel. Norwegian safety regulations require a dual barrier construction of wells. This safety principle ensures that one “barrier” is preventing an escalating situation should the other barrier fail. A wellhead is a heavy walled pressure vessel placed {{at the top of the}} well. The wellhead is part of the second well barrier envelope during drilling. The subsea wellheads are located at sea bottom and during subsea drilling the Blow Out Preventer (BOP) is placed on top of the subsea wellhead. The drilling riser is the connection between the BOP and the floating drilling unit. Waves and current forces acting on the drilling riser and drilling unit will cause dynamic movement. Flexible joints at top and bottom of the drilling riser protects the drilling riser from localised bending moments. The subsea wellhead is both a pressure vessel and a structurally load bearing component resisting external loads transmitted from a connected riser. These external loads can be static and cyclic combinations of bending and tension (compression). Cyclic loads will cause fatigue damage to the well. The well can take a certain amount of fatigue damage without failing. A fatigue failure of a WH system may have serious consequences. Should the WH structurally fail its pressure vessel function will be lost and for this reason WH fatigue is a potential threat to well integrity. The structural load bearing function will also be affected. Wellhead fatigue analysis can be used as a tool to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage. Analysis results then compares to a safe fatigue limit. This thesis addresses selected aspects of fatigue damage estimations of subsea wellheads and surface casings. The presented work is a contribution to the fatigue analysis methodology currently being developed within the industry. The well cement role as a boundary condition for surface casings in analytical models is particularly addressed. The majority of research focuses on the casing shoe and formation sealing, which is the primary objective of well cementing. Recent research focus on the cement limits conditions e. g. elevated temperatures. The “near-seabed” conditions of lead cements have seen less scrutiny. Some researchers have shown interest in this issue related to deep water cementing. Deep water bottom temperature is low all year round regardless of location latitude. Low sea water temperatures will depress the normal thermal gradient of the upper parts of the soil. Subsea wells are typically cemented using a lead and tail cement system, and the lead <b>top</b> <b>casing</b> cement will be pumped all the way to seabed. This lead cement will then be left curing in a low temperature environment. Hydration of cement is an exothermic chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is dependent on temperature. Laboratory measurements of low temperature early compressive strength of typical lead cement slurries are presented herein. In the North Sea the duration between placement of surface casing lead cement and installation of BOP/drilling riser will typical be around 24 hrs. Then dynamic riser loads will start acting on the upper part of a subsea well. Bending of the well causes relative motions between the conductor and surface casing. The cement around these casings will experience these relative motions. The combination of delayed cement setting due to low temperature and surface casing motions will cause localized failure of cement bonding in the upper part of the well. In subsea wellhead fatigue analysis finite element models are used. Boundary conditions in analytical models are important in ensuring similar behaviour of model and reality. One boundary condition in wellhead models is the lateral cement support of the surface casing. Modelling this cement support as infinitely stiff with a discrete vertical transition is the existing solution. In this work a modified boundary condition is presented based on low curing temperatures in combination with “premature” loading of the supporting cement. An overall analysis methodology approach has been suggested. Using a detailed local model of the well to define the lower boundary condition for the global riser load analytical model is one of its features. The implementation of a modified cement boundary condition will change the global stiffness of the local well model. The possible effect on global riser load from variations to the lower boundary condition has been studied. The conclusion supports the suggested analysis approach. Overall well ultimate structural strength will be reduced by the presence of a fatigue crack in a non pressurised load bearing part of a subsea well. An analysis methodology with case results are presented and indicate that the location of a fatigue crack affects the reduction in ultimate strength. Cases of significant reduction are expected to impact normal operating limitations. To be able to include the wellhead fatigue failure mode in an overall risk management system, the failure probability needs to be estimated. This can be done by applying a structural reliability analysis methodology to the problem. A suggested structural analysis methodology approach is suggested and notational failure probabilities are presented. Future improvements to wellhead fatigue analysis may emerge from calibrations from measurements of the reality. A comparison between analytical fatigue loading and measured fatigue loading has been presented and results indicate that the analysis results are conservative. This is evidence that analytical estimate on acceptable fatigue limits can be trusted from a safety point of view. It also indicates the monetary potential that measurements can present to the well...|$|E

30|$|The casing {{program is}} the most crucial feature that {{influences}} successful drilling operations and the longevity of the future geothermal fluid production. It implies assessing casing setting depths, a number of casing strings, nominal casing weight, casing material, type of connections and well completion. The main functions of casing programs are preventing casing deformation, supporting blow-out preventers and permanent wellhead, containing drilling and production fluids, preventing groundwater contamination, mitigating drilling fluid losses, protecting wells from corrosion, fracturing and erosion, preventing inter-zonal cross-contamination of geothermal fluids, defining a production zone and providing access to the reservoir (New Zealand Standard 2015). Conventional high-temperature (also called high-enthalpy) geothermal wells consist usually of three–four cemented casing strings. The typical casing program for most geothermal wells incorporates a conductor pipe, a surface casing, an intermediate casing which may serve as an anchor casing (i.e., casing string to which wellhead is attached), a production casing and an optional perforated liner (holed or slotted). All of these casing strings mentioned are cemented from <b>casing</b> shoe to <b>top</b> of <b>casing</b> string to prevent corrosion resulting from migration of reservoir fluids and to control thermal expansion during fluid production. A liner pipe, which is either suspended from a liner hanger or set at the well bottom, is usually left uncemented in the production section of the well. The completion is finalized by assembling a permanent wellhead {{at the top of}} the well. In most cases, it includes an expansion spool placed directly below the first master valve, which allows for expansion of the uppermost parts of the production casing string with respect to the anchor casing to which the permanent wellhead is attached.|$|R

50|$|DOGGR also {{maintains}} {{a database of}} active wells, expired wells, surveyed lands and leases on California land, coastal waters (0-3 miles) and federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). When a well is no longer needed, either because the oil or gas reservoir becomes depleted, or because no oil or gas was found (called a dry-hole), the well is plugged and abandoned. A well is plugged by placing cement in the well-bore or casing at certain intervals as specified in California laws or regulations. The purpose of the cement is to seal the wellbore or casing and prevent fluid from migrating between underground rock layers. Cement plugs are required to be placed across the oil or gas reservoir (zone plug), across the base-of-fresh-water (BFW plug), and at the surface (surface plug). Other cement plugs may be required {{at the bottom of}} a string of open casing (shoe plug), on top of tools that may become stuck down hole (junk plug), on <b>top</b> of cut <b>casing</b> (stub plug), or anywhere else where a cement plug may be needed.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of a primary cement job is to provide zonal {{isolation}} in the well. Obtaining zonal isolation according to regulations at the Valhall field have been challenging. The complex overburden at Valhall contains several permeable zones {{that need to be}} isolated from each other and the surface. A new set of strict internal regulations for cementing operations has lead to a change in the basic casing design. This was done in an effort to increase the chances of obtaining an approved job according to the new regulations. This has, however, proven to be challenging as the cement jobs have suffered severe problems with lowside channeling and general bonding problems. This thesis investigates the recent cementing operations at Valhall for the <b>top</b> hole <b>casing</b> strings (18 5 / 8 " and 13 5 / 8 "). A total of eight case histories are investigated, where important aspects of the operations are presented. An evaluation of the case histories are performed, where the effect of important factors are discussed. This includes spacer volume, displacement rate, centralization, and fluid properties. The effect of the factors are discussed both from a theoretical perspective and with the basis in the case histories and results. One of the most significant improvement was seen when displacing the drilling fluid to a low rheology mud prior to performing the cement operation. The low rheology WARP OBM from M-I SWACO was found to give the best results. This is also consistent with the theory, as the WARP OBM had the lowest rheological properties of all the investigated drilling fluids. A big potential improvement was found to be the increase in displacement rate up towards turbulent flow for the spacer. This is not realistic to be achieved using todays cementing technique. Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) equipment during cementing was found to reduce the Equivalent Circulating Density (ECD) by 0, 9 ppg equivalent mud weight at target depth. This reduction in pressure can be used for a significant increase in displacement rate, possibly up towards turbulent flow. </p...|$|R

Robust {{and reliable}} telemetry units with an implantable transmitter and data acquisition software are necessary to insure long-term measurements. It was the goal of this study to update the current implantable telemetry system. Updates included using a new tablet computer for increased rates of data acquisition and encasing transmitters in a new waterproof casing. Software was developed using Labview on a Windows based Acer Iconia Tab. The Labview program allowed the user to save data to a measurement file and view the data in real time. The increased processing power of the tablet resulted in an increase in data collection rates from 29 Hz to 87 Hz. Interfacing the tablet computer with the telemetry system required the use of a RS- 232 protocol to USB adapter. The newly developed tablet computer system was also used for load measurement collection during the most recent in vivo study. In order to insure transmitter function in vivo it was necessary to characterize the factors affecting transmission in vivo and develop transmitter and power coil designs that operated reliably. In the past implantable transmitters were noted to operate properly during bench top testing, but often failed after being placed in vivo. The two factors studied that limited power transfer to the transmitters were immersion in an aqueous environment and exposure to elevated temperatures.

40|$|Large {{geotechnical}} {{structures such as}} embankment {{dams and}} tailings dams are subject to high safety requirements. One of the key requirements is long-term stability {{in order to avoid}} incidents and failures as well as to ensure environmental safety during and after the operational phases. To ensure security, the instrumentation of existing embankment dams and tailings dams, using drilling technologies, is necessary for surveillance. Drilling in the structures of dams or in their foundations, however, always entails certain risks. Therefore, the selection of drilling technologies must be carried out carefully, taking into account the condition and sensitivity of each dam section. A continuous evaluation and development of existing drilling requirements is an important safety aspect. The main objective of this comparative study, implemented in collaboration between LKAB, Wassara AB, Sweco Infrastructure AB and Luleå University of Technology in Malmberget, Sweden, is to analyse the influence on surrounding soil of a water powered DTH hammer system and top hammer drillings with different setups during the drilling process. Covering an area of 800 m², an artificial dam with a height of 3 m was built and compacted in layers. The soil used was characterised as gravelly sand. Drillings were done vertical and inclined. Weight sounding tests before and after drilling, excavation of boreholes as well as soil sampling for further laboratory analysis have all been conducted. Complementing this research project, one vertical borehole with a depth of 30 m has been drilled with Wassara’s Lost Hammer concept (LHC) in the tailings dam of LKAB in Malmberget. This study concludes by stating that, for the analysed drilling formation, the average radius of influence on soil was identical (0. 49 m along the borehole axis) for both the water powered DTH and the hydraulic top hammer system with a pre-drilling protective <b>casing.</b> <b>Top</b> hammer drillings in combination with a casing drilling system (Symmetrix) indicate an increased average zone of influence of 0. 72 m around the boreholes.

Borehole B was completed to a depth of 70 m and was cased to a depth of 12. 7 mbgl; remaining unsupported below this. It should be stated that the casing protruded approximately 0. 16 m above ground level. Initial geophysical characterisation was undertaken to evaluate the hole and its suitability for further testing. A multi-level sampler was installed in Borehole B during autumn 2008 when the groundwater level was low. The aim was to capture samples as the water table rose towards the anticipated spring 2009 high. The sampler worked well for most of the period, but there were issues with bottles not filling consistently, and the sampler length was insufficient to cope with rapid water level rise following heavy rainfall or snow melt. Samples retrieved were analysed for chloride, sulphate and nitrate (as NO 3), which ranged between 16. 9 and 68. 8 mg/l, 11. 7 and 29. 9 mg/l, and < 0. 6 and 60. 1 mg/l, respectively. Concentrations of nitrate appeared to increase as the water table rose above 20. 5 mbgl; below this depth there is significant noise. Concentrations of sulphate and chloride both increased as the water table rose. Gamma and resistivity logs identified marl horizons which correlated with the Borehole A core as reported in Stuart et al. (2008 a). Fluid and flow logs also indicate hydraulic layering within the Chalk. Temperature and conductivity logs suggested vertical flow below c. 25 m below <b>casing</b> <b>top,</b> which is was also supported by heat pulse flow meter (HPFM) and impeller flow logs. This flow regime was unaltered by pumping from a depth of 21. 5 m indicating reasonable permeability in the Chalk above this depth. A nitrate sonde was also run before and during pumping. The results are currently awaiting calibration and are not available at the time of reporting. Groundwater levels were monitored in Borehole A and fluctuated over a range of 13. 5 m, from around 10 to 23. 5 mbgl, between December 2006 and the beginning of March 2009. However, numerous gaps in the data remain due to water levels exceeding the range of the pressure transducer initially installed in the borehole. Water levels were notably responsive to rainfall between December and February, for example between 25 th January 2009 and 23 rd February 2009 the water table rose by 8. 7 m. The aquifer appears less responsive during summer and autumn when there is likely to be a greater soil moisture deficit...|$|R
40|$|Characterization of {{launch vehicle}} {{unsteady}} aerodynamics {{is a field}} best studied through experimentation, which is often {{carried out in the}} form of large scale wind tunnel testing. Measurement of the fluctuating pressures induced by the boundary layer noise is customarily made with miniature pressure transducers installed into a model of the vehicle of interest. Literature shows that noise level increases between two to five decibels (dB referenced to 20 micropascal) can be induced when the transducer surface is not mounted perfectly flush with the model outer surface. To reduce this artificially induced noise, special transducer holders have been used for aeroacoustic wind tunnel testing by NASA. This holder is a sleeve into which the transducer fits, with a cap that allows it to be mounted in a recessed hole in the model. A single hole in the holder allows the transport of the tunnel medium so the transducer can discriminate the fluctuating pressure due to the turbulent boundary layer noise. The holder is first dry fitted into the model and any difference in height between the holder and the model surface can be sanded flush. The holder is then removed from the model, the transducer glued inside the holder, and the holder replaced in the model, secured also with glue, thus eliminating the problem of noise level increases due to lack of flushness. In order to work with this holder design, special transducers have been ordered with their standard screen removed and the diaphragm moved as close to the <b>top</b> of the <b>casing</b> as possible to minimize any cavity volume. Although this greatly reduces induced noise due to the transducers being out of flush, the holders can also induce a cavity resonance that is usually at a very high frequency. This noise is termed transducer mount induced noise (XMIN). The peak of the mode can vary with the cavity depth, boundary layer noise that can excite the mode, tunnel flow medium, and the build of the transducers. Because the boundary layer flow interaction with the microphone holder seems to have some effect on the cavity resonance response, the NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) aeroacoustic team postulated that changing the design of the holder might reduce the cavity resonance response. An experiment was performed at the MSFC Trisonic Wind Tunnel comparing a new holder design with the traditional MSFC holder. The new holder design is intended to mimic the Kulite Semiconductors, Inc. B-screen, where the single hole of the traditional MSFC holder is replaced by a series of ten 0. 007 inch diameter holes. This particular design serves to protect the transducer diaphragm as in the manufacturer's B-screen, but also increases the frequency of the XMIN such that it is not apparent in the data collected from aeroacoustic wind tunnel tests. MSFC compared the two holder designs by installing two transducers in standard holders on one side of a ten inch long ten degree cone, and two transducers in B-screen holders on the opposite side for a series of runs at different conditions. Over 11 - 13 February, 2013, the model was run at Mach numbers between 0. 80 and 1. 96 at angles of attack at 0 deg, plus or minus 1 deg, plus or minus 2 deg, plus or minus 4 deg, and plus or minus 8 deg. Model roll attitudes at 0 deg, 90 deg, and 180 deg were tested to isolate potential tunnel bias. This paper presents results from the test showing that the proposed holder design significantly reduces the influence of XMIN on measured fluctuating pressure levels...|$|R
40|$|Evapotranspiration is a {{critical}} factor for local and regional planning, {{in terms of both}} water quality and quantity, to inform decisions around water catchment management, irrigation, water storage, and resource sustainability. Despite its importance, understanding of evapotranspiration from irrigated dairy pasture in Canterbury has to date been relatively limited. The focus of this research was, therefore, to improve understanding of evapotranspiration from ryegrass-based irrigated pastures under grazing. This was achieved through quantifying relationships between actual evapotranspiration and canopy development and evaluation and validation of methods commonly applied in the estimation of potential canopy evapotranspiration (PETc) for grazed perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) pasture. A network of nine lysimeters located at three sites across the mid to north Canterbury Plains was used. Pasture canopy measurements were taken throughout the study at one of the sites, and the biophysical model ‘DairyMod’ used to simulate pasture growth at all three sites. The ‘DairyMod’ and ‘HYDRUS- 1 D’ models were used to simulate soil water flow, and used to support lysimeter-based estimates of actual evapotranspiration. Methods examined for modelling PETc included the use of a crop coefficient time series and a number of commonly applied single-layer models including Penman-Monteith (PM), FAO-modified Penman-Monteith (PMFAO) and Priestley-Taylor (PT), and the dual-layer dual crop coefficient (DCC) and Shuttleworth-Wallace (SWW) models. ‘DairyMod’ and ‘HYDRUS’ and selected PETc models were validated with data collected under a controlled, perennial ryegrass and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) pasture experiment at Lincoln University, with two levels each of irrigation and nitrogen fertiliser. At all three lysimeter sites, the pasture production was nitrogen-limited, with herbage yields of 10. 8 - 14. 9 t DM/ha/y, below optimum yields achievable for Canterbury. The results suggested under-fertilisation of pasture to be prevalent across the region. ‘DairyMod’ was successful in accurately simulating pasture growth under a commercial dairy operation when compared with the measured lysimeter data. However, limitations within the model were identified. Specifically, the calibrated model failed to account for the mechanistic relationship between nitrogen and leaf extension at the temperature stress parameter values required to achieve a reasonable fit with the observed data. Accordingly, within the model, temperature became more limiting than nitrogen. However, this was able to be overcome through the reliance on the empirical relationship between temperature stress and photosynthesis whereby temperature stress functions in the model could be manipulated to achieve the ‘correct’ yields. ‘HYDRUS- 1 D’ was found to be superior to ‘DairyMod’ in the simulation of soil water flow. This was due to the closer predictions of drainage and soil moisture content with that observed compared with DairyMod. The simulated drainage highlighted issues in the lysimeter design. Where lysimeters were installed without rubber rims around the <b>top</b> of lysimeter <b>casings,</b> there was the potential for surface redistribution of water to occur. This ultimately led to discrepancies in the lysimeter data through unaccounted for water losses and therefore a reduction in drainage. A crop coefficient time series was developed from the lysimeter water use data. The time step over which water use measurements were made was the dominant contributing factor to variation in monthly crop coefficient values between lysimeter sites. When daily estimates of water use are used rather than weekly or greater, which were calculated with the SWW model, the spatial variability was largely eliminated. Temporal variations were found to be seasonally driven. When a mean crop coefficient time series from the three lysimeter sites was used to predict PETc, estimates were within 1 - 11 % of the actual evapotranspiration (AET), determined using the observed lysimeter data. When used to predict PETc in the Lincoln experiment, estimates were within 3 - 13 % of AET when water was not limiting. The results highlighted that, due to temporal variations, use of a single crop coefficient value could not be supported, which led to the rejection of the null hypothesis. However, the site averaged time series could be used for water allocation management purposes over the irrigation season months. The single layer PM, PMFAO and PT models over predicted water use. There was a strong systematic error to the daily PM estimates. When the canopy was small PM under-estimated AET but at a leaf area index greater than approximately 1. 3, PM over-estimated AET. This led to total over-estimations of 8 - 29 %. However, this was an improvement on the climate-based PMFAO predictions, which over-estimated AET by 31 - 58 %, and the PT model, which over-estimated AET by 17 - 30 %. The failure of these methods to accurately predict water use was due to their inherent assumptions of the canopy that are not representative of a typical grazed ryegrass pasture in Canterbury. The dual crop coefficient model provided estimates of water use within 1 - 24 % of the observed AET. However, the SWW model predicted water use within 9 % of AET. This was largely owing to the separation of soil evaporation from canopy transpiration, enabling the influence of the canopy on the potential soil evaporation to be adequately accounted for. These results highlighted the benefit of using the SWW model for irrigation management purposes over other PETc models and the need to actively account for the canopy, being the primary factor controlling water use. The method of estimation was also found to be significant, whereby under a grazed system the process of canopy transpiration needs to be separated from the soil evaporation. Finally, irrigation schedule scenario testing across the three lysimeter sites indicated ~ 35 % of drainage losses could be avoided through optimising irrigation scheduling. Doing so involved applying 10 - 20 mm per irrigation event, with a minimum return interval of 2 - 4 days, and delaying irrigation by 10 - 14 days following grazing of the paddock. Through optimising irrigation, the total irrigation applied was reduced by up to 64 % without compromising herbage accumulation. However, while less irrigation was required, more nitrogen was necessary for optimum yields to be achieved. It is likely that this finding is applicable to many commercial dairy farms region wide...|$|R
