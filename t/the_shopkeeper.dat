5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>shopkeeper</b> presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the novel}} uses fantastic elements, its main focus is a {{realistic}} {{portrayal of the}} excesses of bourgeois materialism. Balzac's renowned attention to detail is used to describe a gambling house, an antique shop, a royal banquet, and other locales. He also includes details from his own life as a struggling writer, placing the main character in a home {{similar to the one}} he occupied at the start of his literary career. The central theme of La Peau de chagrin is the conflict between desire and longevity. The magic skin represents the owner's life-force, which is depleted through every expression of will, especially when it is employed for the acquisition of power. Ignoring a caution from <b>the</b> <b>shopkeeper</b> who offers him the skin, the protagonist greedily surrounds himself with wealth, only to find himself miserable and decrepit at the story's end.|$|E

25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, <b>the</b> <b>shopkeeper</b> goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often <b>the</b> <b>shopkeeper</b> may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. <b>The</b> <b>shopkeeper</b> can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E

25|$|Although Kant never {{explicitly}} states {{what the}} first proposition is, {{it is clear that}} its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Common sense distinguishes among: (a) the case in which a person clearly acts contrary to duty; (b) the case in which a person’s actions coincide with duty, but are not motivated by duty; and (c) the case in which a person's actions coincide with duty because she is motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper (4:397) who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer in order to preserve his business’s reputation. Because it is not motivated by duty, the shopkeeper's action has no moral worth. Kant contrasts <b>the</b> <b>shopkeeper</b> with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief” (4:398) obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Juvenile is a {{phenomena}} that {{more or less}} always has been around in our societies. From a society perspective, a crime is committed if actions that the legislative power of state consider as unacceptable or actions that are punishable. There is no particular explanation to why certain people become criminal; crime {{can be caused by}} many different factors at the same time. There are several types of justice. In this essay, it is reparative justice for shoplifting in force, that will be illustrated. The purpose of this essay is to investigate how <b>the</b> <b>shopkeepers</b> experience incidents such as shoplifting or theft in their stores, and how they will react and act if they will be exposed by circumstances like that. In Sweden, a new law of mediation will be introduced 1 / 1 2008. After that date will all youth between age 15 and 21 will be offered mediation at crime. Due to that, it will also be illustrated what opinion <b>the</b> <b>shopkeepers</b> have about mediation at crime. Also, their attitude towards participating in a mediation process when their stores have been exposed to shoplifting will be illustrated. The research method is qualitative. The empiric data collections have been conducted thru interviews done on site. The interviews have been carried out with 10 different shopkeepers, five from cities and five from smaller villages. This investigation shows that stores frequently meet with shoplifting. Many of these crimes are committed by youth, but far from all. Several of <b>the</b> <b>shopkeepers</b> point out that the present limit of 800 :- SEK between shoplifting and theft is way too high. Unless <b>the</b> <b>shopkeepers</b> find themselves have time and resources to report crimes such as shoplifting to the police, they will do that. <b>The</b> <b>shopkeepers</b> who have been interviewed think that mediation at crime is crime preventive to youth and first time shoplifters. Mediation at crime is also a course of action that most of <b>the</b> <b>shopkeepers</b> show willing to do. They, who do not show willing to mediation at crime, think they already have wasted so much time on shoplifters and police interrogations that {{they do not want to}} and spend more time on the committer...|$|R
500|$|At {{the start}} of the novel, Balzac {{includes}} an image from Laurence Sterne's 1759 novel Tristram Shandy: a curvy line drawn in the air by a character seeking to express the freedom enjoyed [...] "whilst a man is free". Balzac never explained his purpose behind the use of the symbol, and its significance to La Peau de chagrin is the subject of debate. In his comprehensive review of La Comédie humaine, Herbert J. Hunt connects the [...] "serpentine squiggle" [...] to the [...] "sinuous design" [...] of Balzac's novel. Critic Martin Kanes, however, suggests that the image symbolizes the impossibility of language to express an idea fully.
