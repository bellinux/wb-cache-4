Often they trick persons who are troubled by floaters into thinking they see {{something out of the}} corner of their eye <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> not there. Most persons come to terms with the problem, after a time, and learn to ignore their floaters. For persons with severe floaters it is nearly impossible to completely ignore the large masses that constantly stay within almost direct view.|$|E

Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E

[...] However, critics said the album did not feature enough [...] "consistency" [...] and Chris True called the tracks [...] "cold, calculated dance-pop numbers." [...] However, he said her eleventh album Aphrodite [...] "rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems" [...] and [...] "the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> her strong suit." [...] Tim Sendra from Allmusic stated, [...] "The various producers keep their eyes on the dancefloor throughout, crafting shiny and sleek tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns" [...] and found Aphrodite [...] "One of her best, in fact." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{would have}} to pick Erica's legal {{abortion}} back in 1973. Number one, it was timely. Abortion had only recently been legalized when Erica decided not to have her baby. Secondly, it was a bold move. I can't think of a hotter political topic for the time than abortion (it still remains a subject that soaps tend to avoid as much as possible; women may contemplate abortions, but rarely go through with having them). Erica's abortion let the fans know that All My Children was going to tackle some major issues. What made it work {{was the fact that}} it was the perfect marriage of character to social issue storyline. We've all watched shows where some character develops a social issue problem that feels artificial to them as though it's been tacked onto them as some sort of glorified public service announcement. But Erica's abortion made sense. She was a rising model who didn't want a baby to derail that career. Whether you agree or disagree with her decision, you understand her rationale. <b>That</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> important for these social issue storylines to succeed [...] that they really be paired up with the right characters.|$|E

The time has come where I have to come out of my safe bubble that is the studio and share my music with you... butterflies just got worse [...] I've had the incredible opportunity to work with some of my favourite artists, DJs and producers on my album. I have had the most amazing time and I have learnt so much. It was important that my record was personal to me. I {{wanted to be able to}} look back on the album and know that I have honestly put 100% of myself into it. I've written songs and stories that I have wanted to write for a long time. I really hope that you're able to relate to my music, because <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> what it's all about.. So here goes, I'm taking a big leap, but it's going to be the best fun ever.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was heavily {{criticized for being}} overly violent and graphic. Madonna's {{spokesperson}} {{said that there was}} a lot of violence because it tells the story of a woman who had probably been abused. Madonna also explained that her character was acting out a [...] "fantasy and doing things that girls are not allowed to do." [...] The video was received only early hours play on MTV. However, it was not the first time that Madonna had a video rejected for heavy rotation by MTV, since in 1990, the channel refused to show [...] "Justify My Love" [...] because of its steamy images, and in 1992 MTV only showed [...] "Erotica" [...] late at night. The decision to ban the video was a source of argument, since it appeared to be no more violent than some television shows that aired at the time. Ironically, the video went into heavy rotation on Oh! Oxygen and was streamed on America Online frequently. It was also later played frequently on VH1 Madonna programs, but in an edited format. According to Eden Miller of PopMatters, the reason why the video was possibly banned from MTV was due to the scene where it featured Madonna pointing a gun towards the police, as MTV had previously banned videos that contained guns. Miller explained that [...] "while Madonna is one of MTV's darlings, she's still a woman, and the idea of a woman taking her aggressions out on men is something the network can just not have. That's what is so disturbing [...] And <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> what it feels like for a girl." [...] MSN listed the song on [...] "Madonna's Most Shocking Moments" [...] and said the song was supporting a [...] "pro-feminist image".|$|E

2500|$|They {{eventually}} get together but writers planned to create fresh relationship dramas for the pair. Zosia {{is happy with}} her relationship and wants to plan their future. She asks for a key to Oliver's flat but she is met with optimism from him. Then a pregnant patient Melissa Peters (Faye McKeever) arrives on Darwin ward. She recalls having a one-night stand with Oliver and claims he is the baby's father. They later find out Melissa has lied and Oliver is not the father. But the scenario damages Zosia and Oliver's relationship. When Zosia is named in the local newspaper as having bipolar disorder she is eager to prove it will not effect her surgical abilities. As her senior Oliver decides to pull rank and have her removed from a major operation. When she finds out the truth she ends their relationship. Arfwedson {{said that it was}} [...] "very sad" [...] because they love each other, but Zosia cannot move on from his betrayal. She believed Oliver made the correct decision, describing her character's mood as [...] "explosive" [...] and [...] "not in a good place". She is [...] "most hurt" [...] that Oliver spoke to his colleague, Specialist registrar Mo Effanga (Chizzy Akudolu) privately about her state of mind, rather than discuss it with her first. Arfwedson {{thought it would be a}} [...] "shame to lose" [...] the on-screen romance as they have a [...] "a lovely partnership". Zosia decides to give Oliver another chance. She tracks him down to a bar but finds him drunken and kissing staff nurse Cara Martinez (Niamh Walsh). The actress described Zosia's shock [...] "As far as Zosia's concerned <b>that</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the end for them. It’s very sad." ...|$|E
