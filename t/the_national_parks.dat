5|$|As their landscapes {{have similar}} scenic qualities, AONBs may be {{compared}} to <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> of England and Wales. AONBs are created under the same legislation as <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks,</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Parks</b> and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. In contrast to national parks, which have their own authorities and legal power to prevent unsympathetic development, very few statutory duties are imposed on the local authorities within an AONB. However, further regulation and protection of AONBs was added by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.|$|E

5|$|There {{are seven}} {{national}} parks in Svalbard: Forlandet, Indre Wijdefjorden, Nordenskiöld Land, Nordre Isfjorden Land, Nordvest-Spitsbergen, Sassen-Bünsow Land and Sør-Spitsbergen. The archipelago has fifteen bird sanctuaries, one geotopic protected area and six nature reserves—with Nordaust-Svalbard and Søraust-Svalbard both being larger {{than any of}} <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks.</b> Most of the nature reserves and three of <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>parks</b> were created in 1973, with the remaining areas gaining protection in the 2000s. All human traces dating from before 1946 are automatically protected. The protected areas make up 65% of the archipelago. Svalbard is on Norway's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E
