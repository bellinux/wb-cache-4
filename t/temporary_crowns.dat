5000|$|A {{temporary}} crown (provisional crown, interim crown) is a [...] (short-term) crown used in dentistry. Like other interim restorations, {{it serves}} until a final (definitive) restoration can be inserted. Usually the temporary crown is constructed from a chemical-cure composite, although alternative systems using aluminium crown forms are occasionally used. <b>Temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> function {{to protect the}} tooth, prevent teeth shifting, provide cosmetics, shape the gum tissue properly, and prevent sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} used {{in a variety of}} {{applications}} in dentistry. It is common to use stainless steel in many instruments that need to be sterilized, such as needles, endodontic files in root canal therapy, metal posts in root canal-treated teeth, <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> and crowns for deciduous teeth, and arch wires and brackets in orthodontics. The surgical stainless steel alloys (e.g., 316 low-carbon steel) have also been used in some of the early dental implants.|$|E
50|$|The TempOff is {{a dental}} {{instrument}} that removes <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> {{of all types}} and brands. It allows for higher incisal positioning so forces are transmitted to the temporary, and not the tooth. The instrument features sharpened tips that firmly grip the crown to eliminate slippage and which provides for a more efficient provisional removal. The small, lightweight instrument is made from stainless steel and has uniquely designed beaks that grab the temporary and guide it gently off the tooth.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{adhesive}} resistance of metallic brackets bonded to <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> made of acrylic resin after different surface treatments. METHODS: 180 specimens {{were made of}} Duralay and randomly divided into 6 groups (n = 30) according to surface treatment and bonding material: G 1 - surface roughening with Soflex and bonding with Duralay; G 2 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting and bonding with Duralay; G 3 - application of monomer and bonding with Duralay; G 4 - roughening with Soflex and bonding with Transbond XT; G 5 - roughening with aluminum oxide blasting and bonding with Transbond XT and G 6 : application of monomer and bonding with Transbond. The results were statistically assessed by ANOVA/Games-Howell. RESULTS: The means (MPa) were: G 1 = 18. 04, G 2 = 22. 64, G 3 = 22. 4, G 4 = 9. 71, G 5 = 11. 23, G 6 = 9. 67. The Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) ranged between 2 and 3 on G 1, G 2 and G 3 whereas in G 4, G 5 and G 6 it ranged from 0 to 1, showing that only the material affects the pattern of adhesive flaw. CONCLUSION: The surface treatment and the material influenced adhesive resistance of brackets bonded to <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns.</b> Roughening by aluminum blasting increased bond strength when compared to Soflex, in the group bonded with Duralay. The bond strength of Duralay acrylic resin was superior to that of Transbond XT composite resin...|$|E

30|$|Eugenol-containing {{materials}} have several advantages as bases for restorations; however, they {{are believed to}} interfere with polymerization during the curing of composite restorations [12, 23]. The hydroxyl group of the eugenol molecule tends to protonize the free radicals formed during the polymerization of resin-based materials, thereby blocking their reactivity and reducing the degree of conversion of these materials [3, 18]. Studies indicated that shear bond strengths were reduced when eugenol-based cements were used to lute <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> or inlays [31, 35], although this point has been contested [19]. Some researchers found eugenol to {{have no effect on}} the shear bond strengths of resin adhesives [1, 19, 30]. Schwartz et al.

Actually, young operator simulates for the operation with 3 D model, to easily and deeply understand and operate safely. Use of full-scale 3 D models facilitates not only a shorter, more precise operation {{as a result of a}} realistic pre-operation simulation, but enables a better grasp of the extent of bone movement and illustrates more ideal occlusion. 3 D models would also enable the construction of <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> and the fabrication of operation plates before surgery.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the reaction exothermia of 2 relining resins for <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns.</b> The resins used were Duralay, a methacrylate-based resin, and Protemp II, a bisacrylic resin. METHODS: The coronal parts of an adult molar and of an impacted one were used. Abutments were obtained from the crowns, while the radicular part was sectioned in order to insert a thermocouple into the pulpal chamber. During the experiment the tooth with the polymerising resin was put into an oral cavity simulator to keep a constant temperature. The thermal increase during polymerisation of the 2 resins was recorded for 6 minutes at 5 seconds intervals and with 1 and 2. 5 mm dentin thickness (n = 10). Data were statistically analysed by variance analysis with Scheffe test. RESULTS: The intrapulpal thermal increase was significantly higher in relation to the type of resin (Duralay p < 0. 0001), thickness (1 mm p < 0. 0001) and type of dentin (young dentin p < 00001).

Materials and methods: Twenty-six subjects received two non-adjacent endosseous implants in the esthetic zone. Functional <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> were installed 17 - 19 weeks later, using conventional (control) and curved (experimental) abutments. The abutments were randomized in each patient independently. Final crowns were cemented after 2 months (T 0). Standard intraoral photographs and radiographs were made to evaluate papillary fill after 12 months (T 12). The interproximal papilla fill was measured {{by means of the}} papilla index score (PIS) and related to the maximum bone level between the implant and the adjacent root as well as the peri-implant marginal bone level at T 12, both measured radiographically. Results: No statistically significant difference between the experimental and the control group could be demonstrated (P = 0. 25). Ordinal regression analysis showed a positive correlation between the maximum bone level and papilla fill (P < 0. 01) and a negative correlation between the peri-implant marginal bone level and papilla fill (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Crown {{and bridge}} have {{life span of}} many years but they fail {{for a number of}} reasons. Over the years, many devices have been {{designed}} to remove crowns and bridges from abutment teeth. While the removal of <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> and bridges is usually very straightforward, the removal of a definitive cast crown with unknown cement is more challenging. Removal is often by destructive means. There are a number of circumstances, however, in which conservative disassembly would aid the practitioner in completing restorative/endodontic procedures. There are different mechanisms available to remove a failed crown or bridge. But there is no information published about the classification of available systems for crown and bridge removal. So it is logical to classify these systems into different groups which can help a clinician in choosing a particular type of system depending upon the clinical situation. The aim {{of this article is to}} provide a classification for various crown and bridge removal systems; describe how a number of systems work; and when and why they might be used. A PubMed search of English literature was conducted up to January 2010 using the terms: Crown and bridge removal, Crown and bridge disassembly, Crown and bridge failure.

40|$|Introduction: An {{increase}} in the number of adults seeking orthodontic treatment has given rise to new problems for orthodontists, one of which is the need to bond orthodontic brackets to teeth restored with <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns.</b> Many prefabricated <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> are composed of polycarbonates or thermoplastic polymers; bonding to these surfaces is complex because of the composition, surface integrity, and resistance of the crowns. The bond must be sufficient to resist breakage from the forces of orthodontic biomechanics and oral functions including mastication. The purpose of this study was to test, in vitro, the effect of different surface treatments on the shear bond strength of metal and ceramic orthodontic brackets bonded to temporary polycarbonate crowns. Methods: Eighty polycarbonate crowns for the maxillary right central incisor were evenly divided into 4 groups, and the facial surfaces were subjected to one of the following conditions: group A (control) : no treatment; group B: the surface was sandblasted with 50 mu m aluminum oxide particles; group C: the glazed surface was removed with a diamond bur; and group D: the surface was etched with 9. 6 % hydrofluoric acid. Precoated Victory metal brackets (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif) were bonded to the facial surface of half (n = 10) of the polycarbonate crowns in each group, and precoated Clarity ceramic brackets (3 M Unitek) were bonded to the facial surface of the other half (n = 10). Each was debonded with a shear load in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 254 mm per minute, and the adhesive remnant index (ARI) was used to analyze the sites of bond failure. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), post-hoc t test with the Bonferroni adjustment, Student t test, and chi-square test with the Yates correction were used for statistical analysis. Results: There was a significant difference between group B (sandblasting) and all other ceramic and metal groups. In the metal groups, there was a slight difference between group C (diamond bur) and group A (control). According to the ARI, sandblasting was the only surface treatment to significantly affect the adhesion of metal and ceramic brackets to polycarbonate crowns. There was no statistically significant difference between the metal and ceramic brackets in group B (sandblasting). There was a statistically significant difference between metal and ceramic brackets in each group, with the exception of group C (diamond bur), which was just below statistical significance. Conclusions: Metal and ceramic orthodontic brackets bonded to temporary polycarbonate crowns will most likely not withstand the forces of orthodontic biomechanics. However, sandblasting polycarbonate crowns consistently increased the shear bond strength of metal and ceramic brackets. A diamond bur effectively roughens the surface of a polycarbonate crown but with no gain in bond strength. Likewise, etching the surface of polycarbonate crowns with 9. 6 % hydrofluoric acid is ineffective. Ceramic brackets bonded to sandblasted polycarbonate crowns produced the highest mean shear bond strength (2. 87 MPa), although this value is far below bond strengths with natural tooth surfaces.

40|$|This article {{reports the}} case of a 55 -year-old female patient who {{presented}} with unsatisfactory <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> in the right mandibular premolars and molars, and a premolar-to-molar fixed partial denture in the left side. The clinical and radiographic examinations revealed a fracture of the left first premolar that was a retainer of the fixed partial denture and required extraction. Initially, the acrylic resin crowns were replaced by new ones, and a provisional RPD was made using acrylic resin and orthodontic wire clasps to resolve the problem arising from the loss of the fixed partial denture. Considering the patient’s high esthetic demands, the treatment options for the definitive prosthetic treatment were discussed with her and rehabilitation with implant-supported dentures was proposed because the clinical conditions of the residual alveolar ridge were suitable for implant installation, and the patient’s general health was excellent. However, the patient did not agree because she knew of a failed case of implant-retained denture in a diabetic individual and was concerned. The patient was fully informed that implant installation was the best indication for her case, but the arguments were not sufficient to change her decision. The treatment possibilities were presented and the patient opted for a clasp-retained removable partial denture (RPD) associated with the placement of crowns in the pillar teeth.

40|$|In most cases, oral {{rehabilitation}} using implants provides esthetic {{excellence and}} consequently {{an improvement in}} the quality of life so cherished by edentulous patients. When there is interproximal papilla loss, this rehabilitation becomes difficult to achieve. To solve this problem, it is possible to use the gingival conditioning technique. This consists of rebuilding provisional crowns with acrylic resin during the phases of surgical healing through to the application of gradual pressure, leading to gingival papilla formation. The aim of this research was to show, by way of a clinical case, the esthetic possibilities obtained through gingival conditioning via the rebuilding of the provisional crown on the implant.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the primary marginal accuracy of four commercially available provisional materials (Protemp 4, Luxatemp Star, Visalys Temp and DPI tooth moulding powder and liquid) at 2 time intervals (10 and 30 min). Materials and Methods: A customized stainless steel master model containing two interchangeable dies was used for fabrication of provisional crowns. Forty crowns (n = 10) were fabricated, and each crown was evaluated under a stereomicroscope. Vertical marginal discrepancies were noted and compared at 10 min {{since the start of}} mixing and then at 30 min. Observations and Results: Protemp 4 showed the least vertical marginal discrepancy (71. 59 μ), followed by Luxatemp Star (91. 93 μ) at 10 min. DPI showed a marginal discrepancy of 95. 94 μ while Visalys Temp crowns had vertical marginal discrepancy of 106. 81 μ. There was {{a significant difference in the}} marginal discrepancy values of Protemp 4 and Visalys Temp. At 30 min, there was a significant difference between the marginal discrepancy of Protemp 4 crowns (83. 11 μ) and Visalys Temp crowns (128. 97 μ) and between Protemp 4 and DPI (118. 88 μ).

40|$|Aim The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the hard and soft tissue changes following immediate placement and provisional restoration of single-tooth implants in the aesthetic zone. Methods Thirteen patients with immediately placed and restored implants were included in this study. All participating patients underwent the same treatment strategy that involved removal of the failed tooth, flapless surgery, immediate implant placement, and connection of a screw-retained provisional restoration. Three months following implant placement, the <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns</b> were replaced by the definitive restorations. Implant survival rates, and hard and soft tissue changes were measured using periapical X-rays and photographs. The range of the observation period was between 12 and 37 months with a mean period of 23. 2 ?. 6 months. Results At the time of follow-up, all implants were present with no complications. Radiographic evaluation revealed a mean mesial bone gain of 1. 20 ?῱. 01 ?mm and a mean distal bone gain of 0. 80 ?῱. 14 ?mm, which reached statistical significance. The mean mid-buccal recession was 0. 20 ?῰. 78 ?mm, whereas the mesial and distal papillae height loss was 0. 50 ?῱. 26 ?mm and 0. 30 ?῰. 82 ?mm, respectively. The changes in the soft tissues did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion Notwithstanding the limitation of a small sample size, this study shows that immediate implant placement and provisional restoration in the maxillary aesthetic zone can result in favorable treatment outcomes with regards to soft and hard tissues changes over a follow-up period of 23. 2 ?. 6 months. Clinical Significance Most clinical trials investigating immediate implant placement and immediate restoration in the maxillary anterior zone have focused on implant survival and implant success, with particular emphasis on radiographically assessed hard tissues changes. However, this study assesses the soft tissue changes associated with this procedure, which is an important area of study given the esthetic demands of implant therapy in the maxillary anterior region.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} {{clinical}} study was to evaluate the placement of transmucosal implants into fresh extraction sockets and their immediate restoration with <b>temporary</b> <b>crowns.</b> A series of 22 cases with a 12 -month follow-up is presented. Twenty-two patients (15 women and 7 men; mean age 39 years) who needed a single tooth replaced because of vertical or horizontal root fracture, caries, endodontic lesions, or periodontal disease were treated with immediate postextraction implant placement. The implant was then restored with a screw-retained prosthetic restoration within 24 hours. Radiographic assessments were made at baseline and 12 months after implant placement. Clinical parameters, such as plaque score, mucositis score, probing attachment level, mucosal margin position, variation of gingival level, and variation of papilla position, were also measured at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up. At 12 months, no implants had failed. Radiographic examination revealed mean bone resorption of 0. 5 mm at 12 months compared to baseline. The mean variation of gingival level, compared to the neighboring teeth, was - 0. 75 mm. Probing attachment levels were 0. 79, 0. 45, and 0. 54 mm at proximal, buccal, and lingual sites, respectively. The values for the mucosal margin position were 2. 9, 2. 2, and 2. 4 mm at proxi. mal, buccal, and lingual sites, respectively. Regarding variation of papilla position, according to Jemts index, 27 papillae presented with a score of 2 (61 %) and 17 with a score of 3 (39 %). An examination of oral hygiene and peri-implant soft tissue conditions at the 12 -month follow-up visit revealed an overall frequency of plaque-carrying implant surfaces of 13 %. Furthermore, mucositis (score 2) was not observed {{at any of the}} peri-implant units. Primary implant stability did not significantly increase over time. The immediate restoration of dental implants placed into fresh extraction sockets was shown to be a safe and predictable procedure. The success rate and radiographic and clinical results were comparable to those obtained following the standard protocol. Within the limits of the present investigation, immediate restoration of single-tooth implants placed in fresh extraction sockets can be considered a valuable option to replace a missing tooth. However, long-term clinical trials are needed to confirm the present results...|$|E

40|$|The {{immediate}} single-tooth implant {{has become}} a viable treatment option. However, {{the impact of the}} restorative procedure on esthetics is currently unclear. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare the soft tissue outline at immediate implants following two restorative protocols: immediate connection of a <b>temporary</b> <b>crown</b> or submerged healing during which a removable partial denture is used. A 1 -year single-blind randomized clinical study was performed in 49 patients. Twenty-four patients were assigned to the immediate restoration group and 25 to the delayed restoration group. Clinical and radiographic evaluations of soft and hard tissues were carried out after 3, 6 and 12 months. Implant survival, bone remodeling, probing depth and bleeding tendency were not influenced by the restorative protocol. Delayed restoration resulted in initial papilla loss taking up to 1 year to attain comparable height as for immediate restoration. Midfacial recession was systematically 2. 5 - 3 times higher following delayed restoration pointing to a 0. 75 mm additional loss in comparison with immediate restoration after 1 year. If the primary implant stability permits it, immediate single-tooth implants should be instantly provisionalized in the interest of optimal midfacial esthetics...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of eugenol-free temporary cement’s remnants on the retentive strength of full metal crowns luted via zinc phosphate and resin cement (Maxcem) to the tooth structure. Materials and methods: Forty complete standardized Ni-Cr crowns in four groups were cemented by two types of permanent cements: zinc phosphate cement and resin cement (Maxcem). In the two groups before permanent cementation of <b>crowns,</b> <b>temporary</b> acrylic <b>crowns</b> were cemented by eugenol-free temporary cement. Crowns’ retention was evaluated by Universal testing machine. All data were analyzed by means of one-way ANOVA test in SPSS software version 11. 5 ( = 0. 05). Results: There was no significant difference in groups with prior using eugenol-free temporary cement and groups with just using two permanents cement (p-value  0. 05). Discussion: The application of temporary cement before permanent cementation of full metal crowns does not have any adverse effect on retention of full metal <b>crowns,</b> when <b>temporary</b> cements are removed properly...|$|R
