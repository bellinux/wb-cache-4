40|$|We report multi-spacecraft and {{ground-based}} {{observations of}} a "sawtooth" event on 20 November 2007. For this event, data from three THEMIS, two GOES, and four LANL spacecraft are available {{as well as}} those from extensively distributed ground magnetometers and all-sky imagers. In the present paper we focus on the spatial extents of the electromagnetic and particle signatures of the first "tooth". In this event, auroral images and ground magnetic bays showed two activations: a pseudo onset and a major <b>onset</b> (we use <b>the</b> term pseudo <b>onset</b> since <b>the</b> former auroral brightening did not significantly expand poleward). Ground magnetic bay observations indicate that the substorm current wedge (SCW) developed after <b>the</b> major <b>onset</b> in an azimuthally wide region of ~ 14 – 3 h MLT. Similarly, broad magnetic bay distribution was observed also for <b>the</b> pseudo <b>onset</b> prior to <b>the</b> major <b>onset.</b> Furthermore, around <b>the</b> pseudo <b>onset,</b> magnetic dipolarisations were observed from 0. 5 to 5 h MLT. These observations illustrate that, during sawtooth events, activities following not only <b>the</b> major <b>onset</b> but also <b>the</b> pseudo <b>onset</b> can extend more widely than those during usual substorms. Remarkable electromagnetic field fluctuations embedded in the dipolarisation trend were seen at 0. 5 and 2. 5 h MLT. In particular, comprehensive plasma and field data from THEMIS showed the presence of a long-excited weak magnetosonic wave and an impulsive large-amplitude Alfvén wave with an earthward Poynting flux at around the eastward edge of the SCW; the latter was sufficiently strong for powering aurora (140 mW/m 2 when mapped to the ionosphere). These two activations of the electromagnetic wave were identified, corresponding to <b>the</b> pseudo <b>onset</b> and <b>the</b> major <b>onset.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, the dipolarisation at geosynchronous 0 h MLT was observed only after <b>the</b> major <b>onset,</b> despite its closer location to the centre of the auroral activity in terms of the MLT; this indicates that the inner radial limit of the dipolarisation region at <b>the</b> pseudo <b>onset</b> was tailward of geosynchronous altitude at 0 h MLT. The outer radial limit of the electron injection region was also found at ~ 10 R E by conjunction measurements with THEMIS satellites. These radial distributions are not significantly different to those expected for usual substorms...|$|R
40|$|We present four {{successive}} substorm events, {{which followed}} a super-long, {{as long as}} 9 h, growth phase on 5 December 2008, observed by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interaction during Substorms (THEMIS) and the GOES 11 satellite with simultaneous coverage by the Alaska and THEMIS ground magnetometers. Several interesting and unique features were found for these cases. The interplanetary magnetic field was steadily southward and the solar wind speed was slow, less than 450 km s − 1, which are thought to drive the long growth phase for <b>the</b> following <b>onsets.</b> At least four substorm expansion onsets occurred, including a double-onset event, {{which appears to be}} a challenge to the reconnection hypothesis for double-onset substorm and favored an instability mechanism for <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> and could not be explained by the two neutral line models. For <b>the</b> <b>onsets</b> at 09 : 32 UT and 09 : 42 UT, the dipolarization signature was observed by GOES 11, which was located earthward of THEMIS C and THEMIS B.

These observations provide us with direct evidence that these events initiated at the near-earth region.
