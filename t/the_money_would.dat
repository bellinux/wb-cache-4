5|$|After the Virginia Tech {{massacre}} on April 16, 2007, Vick and the United Way donated $10,000 {{to assist}} families affected. The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia {{to be placed}} in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a special fund at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.|$|E
5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed {{that half of the}} settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. One-fourth of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E

When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

5|$|Hsu may in {{fact have}} been running {{multiple}} cons on a massive scale. As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate deals with a Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be used to manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were insufficient funds. Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{is active}} {{in a number of}} issues. Along with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, he set up Farm Aid in 1985 to assist and {{increase}} awareness of the importance of family farms, after Bob Dylan's comments during the Live Aid concert that he hoped some of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> help American farmers in danger of losing their farms through mortgage debt. The first concert included Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, B.B. King, Roy Orbison, and Neil Young among many others, and raised over $9million for America's family farmers. Besides organizing and performing in the annual concerts, Nelson {{is the president of the}} board of Farm Aid.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E

5|$|By the June deadline, Laing {{had made}} a payment of $200,000. GEDCA {{requested}} the outstanding $50,000 along with the $100,000 remaining balance to be paid by Laing by the September deadline. When asked by a local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement money would be a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} future economic development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing. In September, Rigel Entertainment declared bankruptcy. On October 26, GEDCA board met and established that Laing {{had made a}} partial late payment of $75,000 on the $150,000 still outstanding. A new deadline was set for January 31, 2013. Laing missed the January deadline, but in late February, GEDCA reported receiving the money, thus bringing the lawsuit to a close.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to restricting photography of public art, closing {{a public park}} for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, {{as one of the}} park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT Plaza from 6a.m. to 11p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park were forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June, and in {{response}} to a question from Fianna Fáil's James Browne about government spending on mental health, McEntee told the Dáil the government was committed to an annual increase in funding; Browne had noted that in 2014, €20 million had been allocated to mental health services rather than the promised €35 million, but McEntee said that €35 million had been ringfenced for 2016 and 2017. Along with Minister for Health Simon Harris, McEntee argued for the restoration of €12 million originally ringfenced for mental health spending that had been diverted to other areas. On 8 June, and as part of a €480m bailout package for health, the government announced that the mental health funding would be restored. Welcoming the decision, McEntee said <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be used for staff recruitment and to improve services for homeless people, as well as developing perinatal mental health services.|$|E

Along with cabinet ministers and industry officials, Dunderdale {{announced that the}} federal and provincial governments would be investing $400 million, over three years, into the fishery. The federal government portion of the money totalled $280 million while the provincial portion was $120 million. The money is compensation for the province eliminating minimum processing requirements for the European Union. Although the premier said that her government plans to work with industry officials on how <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be spent, she {{said it would be}} invested into such things as research and development, new marketing initiatives and infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The church faced {{internal}} {{dissent in}} 1991 over {{its decision to}} publish The Destiny of The Mother Church. Written and privately printed in 1943 by Bliss Knapp, {{former president of the}} Mother Church, the book suggested that Eddy was the Woman of the Apocalypse of the New Testament. Knapp and his family bequeathed $98 million to the church on condition that it publish and authorize the book by 1993; otherwise <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> go to Stanford University and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The church published and made the book available in Christian Science reading rooms. One senior employee was fired for failing to support the church's decision, and 18 of the 21 editorial staff of the religious journals resigned. In the end the other parties disputed that making the book available in Reading Rooms constituted authorization, and the bequest was split three ways.|$|E
5|$|The two {{chambers}} {{announced that}} their negotiations had reached an impasse {{just days before}} the constitutionally mandated end of the session on April 15, but Bevin insisted he would not call a special legislative session for them to continue negotiations. Just before 3:00a.m. on April 14, negotiators announced they had reached a compromise that would cut public universities' budgets by 4.5 percent over the biennium instead of the 9 percent requested by Bevin and implement a performance-based funding model in 2017. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>would</b> be reallocated to contribute over $1 billion toward the state pension system's liabilities, which exceeded $30 billion. Republicans agreed to fund a Democratic proposal for a scholarship program providing free community college tuition for qualified students, relented on their demands to stop state funding for Planned Parenthood, and spared the state's prevailing wage guidelines. Bevin signed the budget, but used his line-item veto to strip funding for the scholarship program {{in the first year of}} the biennium, saying the guidelines were poorly written and should be revised before implementing the program in 2017. Because of the constitutional prohibition against the legislative session extending past April 15, the General Assembly was unable to override the veto.|$|E

5000|$|At {{this point}} the bank {{will be out of}} {{business}} and the dollar will have lost all value.
