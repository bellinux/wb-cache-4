5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} few {{instances}} of cattle egret eggs being laid in <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of snowy egrets and little blue herons, although these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E

25|$|The {{individuals}} in each colony {{can usually be}} separated into three groups: on <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> next to <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> or absent from <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Those who are on <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> usually consist of the dominant reproductive female, queens, and those caring for the brood or taking care of <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> If more than one reproducing female is present in a <b>nest,</b> <b>the</b> less dominant one either stays on a smaller comb or remains next to <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> out of <b>the</b> way of the dominant individual. Non-reproductive individuals can reside in all three groups, but they usually remain either next to <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> or absent from <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> foraging for food. If they are on <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> <b>the</b> dominants often force these subordinates onto smaller combs.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>nested</b> {{universal}} relation (UR) model aims {{to provide}} logical data independence to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> relational model by allowing users {{to view the}} database {{as if it were}} composed of a single nested relation. Moreover, non-technical users may find <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> relational model too complex to interact with, a problem we call herein the usability problem. <b>The</b> <b>nested</b> UR model solves the usability problem by allowing users to interact with <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> database without having to know its detailed structure, which may be complex. In order to formalise <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model we extend the weak instance approach to the (classical) UR model to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> weak instance approach to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model. <b>The</b> <b>nested</b> weak instance approach leads naturally to the definition of the underlying data structure for <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model, namely <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> representative instance (NRI) over <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> universal relation scheme. We present two different definitions of the NRI and show that they are equivalent. First, we define the NRI declaratively as the greatest lower bound of <b>the</b> set of <b>nested</b> weak instances with respect to a natural ordering defined on nested relations. Second, we define the NRI constructively as the result of computing the extended chase on <b>the</b> underlying <b>nested</b> database. Finally, we show that the weak instance approach to the UR model is a special case of <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> weak instance approach to <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model, thus allowing us to implement a flexible UR interface by using <b>the</b> <b>nested</b> UR model; this provides us with all <b>the</b> advantages of <b>nested</b> relations over flat relations...|$|R
50|$|They breed from May to September. <b>The</b> <b>nest</b> {{is built}} on top of trees or in reeds. <b>The</b> <b>nest</b> is {{different}} in structure from the other weaver species found in India, but as in other weavers, woven from thin strips of leaves and reeds. This species lines the entire inside of <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> unlike <b>the</b> other weavers, which line only the floor of <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Males strip <b>the</b> leaves of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> tree, making <b>the</b> globular <b>nests</b> clearly visible.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>nests,</b> built {{entirely by}} the female, are mud {{plastered}} to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. <b>The</b> <b>nests</b> are often constructed from the saliva {{of the females}} mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days.|$|E
5|$|A second {{possible}} aetosaur nest site {{is known}} from northeastern Italy. <b>The</b> <b>nests</b> are preserved as depressions in carbonate rock that are circular or horseshoe-shaped, with high ridges around the sides. They {{appear to be}} unusually complex for nests created by Triassic reptiles. Archosaur footprints were found nearby that resembled aetosaurs, although they were not present in the same layer. Because the tracks were found so close to <b>the</b> <b>nests,</b> {{it is likely that}} aetosaurs built them.|$|E
5|$|Birds of {{variable}} size with slender bodies and long tails. Some species are {{lay their eggs}} in <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other birds. There are about 141 species worldwide, one of which breeds in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
50|$|When {{temperatures}} are high, workers fan <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> by rapidly vibrating their wings. Foragers {{have been observed}} alternating between finding prey and collecting water, regurgitating the water droplets around <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Fanning of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> would continue, and <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> would cool off through evaporation. Drones are known to also fan <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> up to {{as long as a}} worker, after only a day or two from emergence.|$|R
50|$|Cuckoo female {{bumblebees}} usually {{use their}} smell {{to locate a}} nest. They tend to infiltrate <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and sting <b>the</b> existing queen to death before laying their eggs. However, the female cuckoo bee may sneak into <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> hide in {{for a couple of}} days to ensure she smells like <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> and then lay her eggs without detection. As a parasitic relationship, this does not bode well for <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> because <b>the</b> cuckoo larvae impostors steal resources from <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and energy from the worker bees, while contributing nothing to <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before leaving <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> <b>the</b> adults {{generally}} make {{an inspection}} walk around <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and will also perform the same task upon returning, generally {{to make sure}} <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> is in good order and not damaged in any way. Another potential reason for the inspection routine could be to check for parasites around <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Along with <b>the</b> inspections, adults also perform the maintenance routes where the wasps remove particles and waste and check the integrity of <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Females occasionally will apply silk to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> surface, pedicel and attachment point between the leaf and pedical.|$|R
5|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. <b>The</b> <b>nests</b> are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9m (between 1.5 and 6.5m) off {{the ground in a}} variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. <b>The</b> <b>nests</b> are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers, as well as the introduced green tree skink.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics of behaviour, {{such as what}} {{materials}} {{apart from}} saliva <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> contain, {{can be used to}} differentiate between certain species of Aerodramus.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{measures}} have included attempts to breed them in captivity {{and to reduce}} fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites. Nearly 15% of the chicks are killed when they fall off <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> and die of starvation, so some conservationists have used nets positioned below <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> to prevent injuries to falling young and then raising these fallen birds in enclosures for about five months before releasing them to join their wild siblings.|$|E
50|$|Reproductive {{suppression}} {{is often}} used in social insect colonies by queens to maintain a genetic monopoly of the offspring in <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Some species suppress worker egg laying through pheromones and chemical control. However, in Xylocopa pubescens, the dominant female of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> suppresses reproduction of any other females in <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> by preventing them access to the cell in the tunnels of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> necessary for eggs. The only way that another female in <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> can reproduce is if she takes over <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> by force, or leaves to either take over another nest or found her own.|$|R

50|$|Nestlings fledge in 28 days. Young marbled murrelets {{remain in}} <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> longer than other alcids and molt into their {{juvenile}} plumage before leaving <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Fledglings fly directly from <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> to <b>the</b> ocean.|$|R
5|$|Fly larvae of {{the genus}} Fannia live in <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of at least European bee-eaters, and feed on faeces and food remains. Their {{presence}} and cleaning activities appear to benefit the developing bee-eaters.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is a {{seasonal}} breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. <b>The</b> <b>nests</b> are {{situated at the}} base of ferns with tussock grass, tussock grass clumps, or in tufts of sedges. <b>The</b> <b>nests</b> are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. <b>The</b> <b>nests</b> are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, tussock grass or sedges. Where the construction material is tussock grass, larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).|$|E
5|$|Vertebrate predators of bees include bee-eaters, shrikes and flycatchers, {{which make}} short sallies to catch insects in flight. Swifts and {{swallows}} fly almost continually, catching insects as they go. The honey buzzard attacks bees' nests and eats the larvae. The greater honeyguide interacts with humans by guiding them to <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of wild bees. The humans break open <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> {{and take the}} honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax. Among mammals, predators such as the badger dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food.|$|E
50|$|Since A. flavissma are {{observed}} to be dormant during the day, the species {{appears to have}} developed a behavior to regulate the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> This is done by coating the roof of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> with oral secretions and attaching plant fibers {{to the roof of}} <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> <b>The</b> central part of the roof is made to be particularly thick, to help with the insulation of the structure. This technique is successful at maintaining a mean temperature of 27.3 °C in <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> During <b>the</b> day when temperature fluctuations are greater, the generation of metabolic heat from individuals in <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> appears to be key to the temperature stabilization of <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>nesting</b> {{season is}} April to June and the clutch varies {{from one to}} five very {{symmetrical}} white eggs. Indian grey hornbills usually nest in tree hollows on tall trees. An existing hollow may be excavated further to suit. The female enters <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> hollow and seals <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> hole, leaving only a small vertical slit through which the male feeds her. <b>The</b> <b>nest</b> entrance is sealed by the female using its excreta and mud-pellets supplied by the male. While inside <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> <b>the</b> female moults her flight feathers and incubates the eggs. The regrowth of the female's feathers coincides with the maturity of the chicks, at which point <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> is broken open.|$|R
50|$|Dunham began {{crawling}} {{more than}} 100 yd {{to the first}} machine gun nest under fire from two machine guns and supporting riflemen. When10 yd from <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> he jumped up to assault <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and {{was hit by a}} bullet which caused him to tumble 15 yd downhill. He got back up and charged <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> firing his carbine as he went, and kicked aside an egg grenade that had landed at his feet. Prior to reaching <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> he tossed a hand grenade into <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> When he got to <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> he killed <b>the</b> machine gunner and his assistant. His carbine then jammed, and he jumped into the machine gun emplacement. He threw a third German in <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> down <b>the</b> hill who was later captured by his unit.|$|R
5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{guillemot}} tick Ixodes uriae and {{the flea}} Ornithopsylla laetitiae (probably originally a rabbit flea) {{have been recorded}} from <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of puffins. Other fleas which have been found on the birds include Ceratophyllus borealis, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Ceratophyllus garei, Ceratophyllus vagabunda and the common rabbit flea Spilopsyllus cuniculi.|$|E
5|$|Brushtail possums (Trichosurus spp.), and {{introduced}} cats and rats raid <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> for nestlings and eggs, and raptors {{such as the}} brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus), grey goshawk (Accipiter novaehollandiae), Australian masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae), and probably powerful owl seize young birds. Juvenile southern boobooks {{are at greater risk}} after bushfires and have perished after being tangled up in dodder (Cassytha) or bidgee-widgee (Acaena novae-zelandiae).|$|E
50|$|Once released, {{the eggs}} stick to gravel, sand, or other debris in <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> and they hatch in {{as few as}} three days. Females leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> {{immediately}} after spawning, but males remain and guard their offspring. The male guards them for about the first 11 days, returning them to <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> in his mouth if they stray from <b>the</b> <b>nesting</b> site.|$|R
50|$|Within <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> {{there is}} a special {{division}} of labor and social organization. 11-13% of workers maintain small spatial fidelity zones inside <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> and all workers remain at a specific distance from the colony center. Smaller individuals maintained smaller spatial zones and tended to be closer to the center of <b>the</b> <b>nest.</b> Individuals that perform the in-nest task of larval feeding were found in the center of <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> while foragers were often found on the periphery of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> when not foraging.|$|R

5|$|Kyo is {{a secret}} {{character}} in most versions of The King of Fighters '99, and has no team. In the story, Kyo is kidnapped by <b>the</b> <b>NESTS</b> syndicate to use his DNA to make various clones of himself. He tries to obtain answers personally from his captors entering their base but is forced to retreat when the place around him begins to collapse. Depending on how many points the player has when the game finishes, Kyo can be faced as a bonus fight. He continues his fight against <b>the</b> <b>NESTS</b> alone in The King of Fighters 2000 {{and in the next}} game, Kyo reunites with his old teammates, and his student Shingo Yabuki, to make a comeback on the Japan Team. In KOF 2002, Kyo is a playable character on the original Japan Team.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} wasp, {{including}} especially the cuckoo or jewel wasps (Chrysididae), are kleptoparasites, laying their eggs in <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other wasp species to exploit their parental care. Most such species attack hosts that provide provisions for their immature stages (such as paralyzed prey items), and they either consume the provisions {{intended for the}} host larva, or wait for the host to develop and then consume it before it reaches adulthood. An example of a true brood parasite is the paper wasp Polistes sulcifer, which lays its eggs in <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other paper wasps (specifically Polistes dominula), and whose larvae are then fed directly by the host. Sand wasps Ammophila often save time and energy by parasitising <b>the</b> <b>nests</b> of other females of their own species, either kleptoparasitically stealing prey, or as brood parasites, removing the other female's egg from the prey and laying their own in its place. According to Emery's rule, social parasites, especially among insects, tend to parasitise species or genera {{to which they are}} closely related. For example, the social wasp Dolichovespula adulterina parasitises other members of its genus such as D. norwegica and D. arenaria.|$|E
50|$|Acromyrmex heyeri workers {{construct}} <b>the</b> colonies <b>nest</b> by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures {{ranging from}} 20-30 °C, workers created more openings in <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> thatch as <b>the</b> internal <b>nest</b> temperature goes up {{as a method}} of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> thatch as <b>the</b> air humidity surrounding <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.|$|R
50|$|After {{building}} <b>the</b> <b>nest,</b> <b>the</b> birds abandon <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> {{for about}} a week before the female returns to lay one or two greenish-blue eggs. The eggs take a further week to hatch. The female may leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> for short periods during the day during incubation. After the chicks have hatched, both male and female assist in the care of the young, which leave <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> about two or three weeks later.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{a colony}} {{are able to}} {{recognize}} non-resident wasps by how they approach <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and by their dominance behavior. Members of the colony approach <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> in a swift and purposeful fashion, whereas wasps that {{are not part of}} the colony hover by <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> and not exhibit a specific direction. Oftentimes, they hover by <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> without landing. If spotted, members of the colony begin to act aggressively and alarm others of the possible intruder. Non-resident wasps are often chased out of <b>the</b> <b>nest</b> within <b>the</b> first five minutes of entering.|$|R
