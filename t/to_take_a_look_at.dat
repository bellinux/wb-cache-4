5|$|On April 13, 2007, Judah {{made his}} return to the ring against Ruben Galvan at the Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel in Tunica, Mississippi. Judah came out {{strongly}} in the first round, landing numerous shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the cut. Due to the severity of the cut, the fight was waved off. The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E

25|$|A lesser known {{story from}} the Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates a {{different}} version of Ganesha's birth. On the insistence of Shiva, Parvati fasted for a year (punyaka vrata) to propitiate Vishnu {{so that he would}} grant her a son. Vishnu, after the completion of the sacrifice, announced that he would incarnate himself as her son in every kalpa (eon). Accordingly, Ganesha was born to Parvati as a charming infant. This event was celebrated with great enthusiasm and all the gods were invited <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the baby. However Shani (Saturn), the son of Surya, hesitated to look at the baby since Shani was cursed with the gaze of destruction. However Parvati insisted that he look at the baby, which Shani did, and immediately the infant's head fell off. Seeing Shiva and Parvati grief-stricken, Vishnu mounted on Garuda, his divine eagle, and rushed to the banks of the Pushpa-Bhadra river, from where he brought back the head of a young elephant. The head of the elephant was joined with the headless body of Parvati's son, thus reviving him. The infant was named Ganesha and all the Gods blessed Ganesha and wished Him power and prosperity.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the Six-Day War in 1967, the river became the ceasefire line and both banks became militarised and {{inaccessible}} to pilgrims. After 1982, while Qasr el-Yahud was still off-limits, Israel enabled Christian baptisms at the Yardenit site further north. Following the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 access to Al-Maghtas was restored after Prince Ghazi of Jordan, who is deeply interested in religious history, visited the area {{in the company of a}} Franciscan archaeologist who had convinced him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what was thought to be the baptism site. When they found evidence of Roman-period habitation, this was enough to encourage de-mining and further development. Soon afterwards, there were several archaeological digs led by Dr. Mohammad Waheeb who rediscovered the ancient site in 1997. The 1990s marked the period of archaeological excavations of the site followed by primary conservation and restoration measures during the early 21st century. Jordan fully reopened al-Maghtas in 2002. This was then followed by the Israeli-run western side, known as Qasr el-Yahud, which was opened for daily visits in 2011 - the traditional Epiphany celebrations had already been allowed to take place since 1985, but only at the specific Catholic and Orthodox dates and under military supervision. In 2007, a documentary film entitled The Baptism of Jesus Christ – Uncovering Bethany Beyond the Jordan was made about the site.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles' drive {{carried over}} from the {{previous}} quarter. A completed pass and a run moved the Eagles to the 12-yard line. But on third down, Vick was sacked for a 4-yard loss by DT Rocky Bernard, forcing Philadelphia {{to settle for a}} 34-yard field goal from K David Akers. The Giants received the ball and started at their own 21-yard line, whereupon they put together an 8-play, 79-yard drive. RB Ahmad Bradshaw ran three times for 24 yards. The drive ended on Manning's second touchdown pass to Manningham, this one for 33 yards putting the Giants in the driver's seat, 14–3. The Giants once again stopped the Eagles on their next drive and received the ball. Two passes to Hagan for 27 yards and 11-yard run by Bradshaw helped the Giants get to the Eagles 7-yard line. The Giants were unable to score on third down because of an incomplete pass to TE Kevin Boss. The Giants settled for a 25-yard field goal from K Lawrence Tynes to make the score 17–3. The Eagles tried to get something going on the next drive and it appeared they did when Vick found WR Jeremy Maclin, but the ball came loose before he hit the ground. S Kenny Phillips recovered it and ran it to the Philadelphia 8-yard line. The Eagles called a timeout {{to try to get the}} replay assistant <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the play since it was now under two minutes in the half, but the play was reviewed and it was determined to be a fumble. The Giants took advantage of this and on the next play, Manning found WR Hakeem Nicks for an 8-yard touchdown pass putting the Giants in total control at halftime 24–3.|$|E

500|$|Later during January 2013, Solis {{confirmed}} {{her interest}} in the County Board of Supervisors race, saying [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." [...] In explaining why a former U.S. Representative and Cabinet member {{would be interested in}} a county-level body, analysts stated that the board is the most powerful county-level legislative body in the United States, and exercises some executive and quasi-judicial powers as well. [...] It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department's and its $26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state. Each member presiding over some two million constituents, three times that of Solis' old congressional district, and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics, after Governor, U.S. Senator, and Mayor of Los Angeles. [...] The supervisors have long been nicknamed [...] "the five little kings".|$|E
500|$|... "Like Father, Like Clown" [...] {{was written}} by the duo of Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Krusty's {{religion}} had not {{been part of the}} original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody The Jazz Singer and establish that Krusty is Jewish. They pitched the idea to co-executive producer Sam Simon, who rejected it, but it was approved by James L. Brooks. Krusty's last name, Krustofski, was established in this episode as pitched by Al Jean. The portion of the episode where characters quote the Bible in support or opposition of clowning were carefully researched. Cited passages from the Bible include Exodus 20:12 and Joshua 1:8. The quotations from the Talmud were also researched, and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and Harold M. Schulweis, were credited as [...] "special technical consultants". Schulweis was asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a draft of the script. While not a fan of the show, he felt [...] "it was profound" [...] and added some corrections. He later commented, [...] "I thought it had a Jewish resonance to it. I was impressed by the underlying moral seriousness." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first result}} {{had already been}} {{determined}} by G. Bauer in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called hypergeometric series, which had first been researched by Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hardy found these results [...] "much more intriguing" [...] than Gauss's work on integrals. After seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems [...] "defeated me completely; I {{had never seen anything}} in the least like them before". He figured that Ramanujan's theorems [...] "must be true, because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them". Hardy asked a colleague, J. E. Littlewood, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were [...] "certainly the most remarkable I have received" [...] and said that Ramanujan was [...] "a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power". One colleague, E. H. Neville, later remarked that [...] "not one [...] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world".|$|E

500|$|With Brezhnev's {{position}} consolidated in {{the early}} 1970s, he used Podgorny to weaken Kosygin's position as Chairman of the Council of Ministers by giving the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet some executive powers. With the help from Brezhnev Podgorny managed to make the Council of Ministers subordinate to the Presidium. However, these changes threatened Brezhnev, and Brezhnev would later [...] order Konstantin Chernenko <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the 1936 Soviet Constitution {{to find a way}} to weaken Podgorny's position. As it turned out there were none, Podgorny's position as head of state meant that he could in fact block any measures taken by Brezhnev to circumscribe his powers. Chernenko did come up with a solution, to make it law that the Party leader would also become the leader of the Government apparatus. The 1977 Soviet Constitution was drafted to weaken the position of Podgorny by making it law that the Party leader was in fact also leader of the Government. The draft which dealt with the leading role of the Party, and its clear supremacy, in Soviet society was approved by the Soviet leadership. The approval of the 1977 Soviet Constitution is considered Podgorny's death knell.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 30, 1910. It states: [...] "John Gary runs a summer hotel at a charming spot on the seashore, {{but he has been}} unable to induce people to stop there, and {{at the opening of the}} picture he is seen lamenting the fact that there is not a single guest name on his hotel register. At this juncture his daughter Ethel returns from school. Ethel is an expert swimmer, and on reading in the paper the rumor that a mermaid has made several appearances in the water of the Atlantic, he decides to have his daughter pose as the mysterious lady of the sea. He wisely conjectures that a handy mermaid will bring guests. With Ethel clad in appropriate costume, and seated upon the rocks in true mermaid fashion, her father persuades the reporter of the local paper <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the phenomenon. The newspaper man is greatly impressed with the spectacle and obtains a photo of the mermaid, which he publishes. The mermaid gains wide publicity - and vacationists arrive from near and far to see her. Tom, Dick and Harry, a trio of city sports, jump into bathing suits and the water, each bent on capturing the mermaid. She eludes them all, however, and the mystery is not cleared up until Ethel, in a pre-tailored suit, presents herself to the guests and explains the joke. By this time Gary's hotel is famous and the owner is certain of a big summer business." ...|$|E
