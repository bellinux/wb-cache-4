5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double policy. On {{the one hand}} John, Prince of Brazil, as regent of Portugal, signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade. On the other hand, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, he allowed for such trade to {{continue}} and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them. However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E

5|$|By March 1945, the Allies had {{advanced}} into Germany and {{had reached the}} River Rhine. The Rhine was a formidable natural obstacle to the Allied advance, but if breached would allow the Allies to access the North German Plain and ultimately advance on Berlin and other major cities in Northern Germany. Following the 'Broad Front Approach' laid out by General Eisenhower, {{it was decided to}} attempt <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the Rhine in several areas. British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery, commanding the 21st Army Group, devised a plan to allow the forces under his command <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the Rhine, which he entitled Operation Plunder, and which was subsequently authorized by Eisenhower. Plunder envisioned the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey and the U.S. Ninth Army under Lieutenant General William Simpson crossing the Rhine at Rees, Wesel, and an area south of the Lippe Canal. To ensure that the operation was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component was inserted into the plans for the operation to support the amphibious assaults that would take place, which was code-named Operation Varsity. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to take part in Varsity, these being the British 6th Airborne Division, the U.S. 13th Airborne Division and the 17th Airborne Division, all of which were assigned to the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{withdrawal}} from the area around Orsogna, the 2nd New Zealand Division {{was one of a}} number of divisions that was transferred from the Eighth Army to the Fifth Army, then engaged on the western side of the Apennines. This was part of an overall strategy <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the Gustav Line and break an otherwise deadlocked Italian front. Together with the 4th Indian Division and supporting British and American artillery, the division formed the New Zealand Corps, under the command of Freyberg. The corps moved to Cassino, the defenders of which had resisted American forces for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Illyrians soon {{captured}} and later fortified Dyrrachium (modern-day Durrës, Albania) and Phoenice (which was soon liberated with a truce and a fee). While her ships {{were off the}} coast of Onchesmos, they intercepted and plundered some Roman merchant vessels. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southward into the Ionian Sea, defeating the combined Achaean and Aetolian fleet in the battle of Paxos and capturing the island of Corcyra, which put them in position <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the important trade routes between the mainland of Greece and the Greek cities in Italy.|$|E

5|$|Kīlauea {{is one of}} five subaerial volcanoes {{that make}} up the island of Hawaii, created by the Hawaii hotspot. The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, is more than a million years old, and Kīlauea, the youngest, is {{believed}} to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age; Lōʻihi Seamount on the island's flank is even younger, but has yet <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the surface. Thus it is the second youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 August, two German formations—the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions, {{attacked}} Polish positions on Hill 262. At the same time, the 16th Infantry and 12th SS Panzer Divisions attacked American and Canadian forces from within the pocket, opening small channels through Allied positions. By mid-morning, 2,000 survivors of the German 2nd Parachute Division had managed <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> Canadian positions along the Dives River, {{as well as at}} Point117. At approximately noon, several units of the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions managed to break through these weakened positions.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptian {{artillery}} failed <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the walls, so Ibrahim {{decided to}} launch two ships with cannons {{and have them}} bombard the Maniot defences from the sea. He also combined this attack with infantry assaults, however these failed as the invaders were driven back from the walls eight times. The attacks lasted {{for a few more}} days before the Egyptians and Ottomans were forced to retreat when news arrived that Kolokotronis was approaching their rear with 2,000 men. The Maniots chased the Egyptians up to Kalamata before withdrawing. Ibrahim lost 2,500 men at Vergas and the Greek losses are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} {{assault was}} preceded by a massive artillery bombardment {{that was meant to}} soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repulsed with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reinforcements}} {{had settled}} in, the Spanish began digging siege lines and trenches towards the confederate positions. The first attack came on 26 October when Spanish guns {{opened fire on}} the confederate defences around the Round Tower, causing considerable damage. A French force carried out a simultaneous raid of Gibraltar's harbour, burning the bomb ship. Villadarias then carried out a heavy bombardment of the San Pablo bastion using 27 guns and 16 mortars, which managed <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> it. Among the casualties were the two feuding colonels, Fox and Nugent, who were killed on successive days. At the same time, an epidemic disease broke out among the Gibraltar garrison, reducing their effective numbers to about 1,300 men.|$|E
5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in September, {{in advance}} of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted. A blockade of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.|$|E

5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they {{came under heavy fire}} from the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half hours}} while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under fire from the air and from the fort, the attack bogged down to a complete halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet was able <b>to</b> <b>breach</b> the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor {{in the river}} at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
