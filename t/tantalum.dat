5|$|All welding of <b>tantalum</b> {{must be done}} in an inert {{atmosphere}} of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. <b>Tantalum</b> is not solderable. Grinding <b>tantalum</b> is difficult, especially so for annealed <b>tantalum.</b> In the annealed condition, <b>tantalum</b> is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.|$|E
5|$|The {{fluorides}} of <b>tantalum</b> can be {{used for}} its separation from niobium. <b>Tantalum</b> forms halogen compounds in the oxidation states of +5, +4, and +3 of the type , , and , although multi-core complexes and substoichiometric compounds are also known. <b>Tantalum</b> pentafluoride (TaF5) is a white solid with a melting point of 97.0°C and <b>tantalum</b> pentachloride (TaCl5) is a white solid with a melting point of 247.4°C. <b>Tantalum</b> pentachloride is hydrolyzed by water and reacts with additional <b>tantalum</b> at elevated temperatures by forming the black and highly hygroscopic <b>tantalum</b> tetrachloride (TaCl4). While the trihalides can be obtained by reduction of the pentahalides with hydrogen, the dihalides do not exist. A tantalum-tellurium alloy forms quasicrystals. <b>Tantalum</b> compounds with oxidation states as low as −1 have been reported in 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum</b> is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of <b>tantalum</b> minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for <b>tantalum</b> extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more <b>tantalum</b> than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than <b>tantalum</b> is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other <b>tantalum</b> containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation the best method. Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum</b> is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause <b>tantalum</b> to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} useful metal for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from <b>tantalum.</b> <b>Tantalum</b> was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The <b>tantalum</b> is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the cases}} of most other {{refractory}} metals, the hardest known compounds of <b>tantalum</b> are its stable nitrides and carbides. <b>Tantalum</b> carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a <b>tantalum</b> carbide-graphite composite material {{that is one of the}} hardest materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two <b>tantalum</b> aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E
5|$|For decades, the {{commercial}} technology for separating <b>tantalum</b> from niobium involved the fractional crystallization of potassium heptafluorotantalate away from potassium oxypentafluoroniobate monohydrate, {{a process that}} was discovered by Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866. This method has been supplanted by solvent extraction from fluoride-containing solutions of <b>tantalum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier <b>tantalum</b> atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for <b>tantalum,</b> which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of <b>tantalum,</b> the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to <b>tantalum</b> in the {{workplace}} by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for <b>tantalum</b> exposure in the workplace as 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 2500mg/m3, <b>tantalum</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{there was}} {{considerable}} confusion over the difference between columbium (niobium) and the closely related <b>tantalum.</b> In 1809, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston compared the oxides derived from both columbium—columbite, with a density 5.918g/cm3, and tantalum—tantalite, with a density over 8g/cm3, {{and concluded that the}} two oxides, despite the significant difference in density, were identical; thus he kept the name <b>tantalum.</b> This conclusion was disputed in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who argued that there were two different elements in the tantalite sample, and named them after children of Tantalus: niobium (from Niobe) and pelopium (from Pelops). This confusion arose from the minimal observed differences between <b>tantalum</b> and niobium. The claimed new elements pelopium, ilmenium, and dianium were in fact identical to niobium or mixtures of niobium and <b>tantalum.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ta and atomic number 73. Previously known as tantalium, its {{name comes from}} Tantalus, a villain from Greek mythology. <b>Tantalum</b> is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. It {{is part of the}} refractory metals group, which are widely used as minor components in alloys. The chemical inertness of <b>tantalum</b> makes it a valuable substance for laboratory equipment and a substitute for platinum. Its main use today is in <b>tantalum</b> capacitors in electronic equipment such as mobile phones, DVD players, video game systems and computers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum</b> is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, <b>tantalum</b> can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, <b>tantalum</b> is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous <b>tantalum</b> coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum</b> is {{considered}} a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and <b>tantalum</b> are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why <b>tantalum</b> is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of <b>tantalum</b> is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's <b>tantalum</b> output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|The English chemist Charles Hatchett {{reported}} a new element similar to <b>tantalum</b> in 1801 and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that <b>tantalum</b> and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that <b>tantalum</b> ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, {{a series of}} scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from <b>tantalum),</b> and for a century both names were used interchangeably. Niobium was officially adopted as {{the name of the}} element in 1949, but the name columbium remains in current use in metallurgy in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between <b>tantalum</b> and niobium were demonstrated unequivocally in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand, and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} by Louis J. Troost, who determined the empirical formulas of some of their compounds in 1865. Further confirmation came from the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, in 1866, who proved that there were only two elements. These discoveries did not stop scientists from publishing articles about the so-called ilmenium until 1871. De Marignac was the first to produce the metallic form of <b>tantalum</b> in 1864, when he reduced <b>tantalum</b> chloride by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen. Early investigators had only been able to produce impure <b>tantalum,</b> and the first relatively pure ductile metal was produced by Werner von Bolton in Charlottenburg in 1903. Wires made with metallic <b>tantalum</b> were used for light bulb filaments until tungsten replaced it in widespread use.|$|E
5|$|World <b>tantalum</b> mine {{production}} has undergone an important geographic shift {{since the start}} of the 21st century when production was predominantly from Australia and Brazil. Beginning in 2007 and through 2014, the major sources of <b>tantalum</b> production from mines dramatically shifted to the DRC, Rwanda, and some other African countries. Future sources of supply of <b>tantalum,</b> in order of estimated size, are being explored in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Greenland, China, Mozambique, Canada, Australia, the United States, Finland, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Calculations for {{solution}} chemistry {{indicate that}} again, the maximum oxidation state of dubnium, +5, {{will be more}} stable than that of niobium and <b>tantalum,</b> and the +3 state will be less stable than those of niobium and <b>tantalum.</b> The propensity towards hydrolysis of cations in the highest oxidation state {{is expected to continue}} to decrease within group 5; however, it is still expected to be quite rapid. Complexation of dubnium is expected to follow group 5 trends in its richness. Calculations for hydroxo-chlorido- complexes have been conducted; they show reversal in the trends of complex formation and extraction of group 5 elements, with dubnium being more prone to do so than <b>tantalum.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are less than 50 years left of <b>tantalum</b> resources, based on extraction at current rates, demonstrating the need for increased recycling.|$|E
5|$|K2 can be {{converted}} to metallic <b>tantalum</b> by reduction with sodium, at approximately 800°C in molten salt.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum</b> {{can be used}} as {{a target}} {{material}} for accelerated proton beams for the production of various short-lived isotopes including 8Li, 80Rb, and 160Yb.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum,</b> always {{together}} with the chemically similar niobium, occurs in the minerals tantalite, columbite and coltan (a mix of columbite and tantalite).|$|E
5|$|While the {{remaining}} valence electrons in a singly ionized dubnium ion (Db+) organize {{themselves in a}} 6d27s2 configuration, the doubly (Db2+) or triply (Db3+) ionized atoms eliminate the 7s electrons, the opposite order to that of its lighter homologs. Despite the changes, however, dubnium is still expected to use five electrons as its valence electrons; 7p energy levels have not been shown to influence dubnium and its properties. As the 6d orbitals of dubnium are more destabilized than the 5d ones of <b>tantalum,</b> and Db3+ {{is expected to have}} two d, rather than s, electrons remaining, the resulting oxidation state is expected to be unstable and even rarer than that of <b>tantalum.</b> The ionization potential of dubnium in its maximum oxidation state should be slightly lower than that of <b>tantalum</b> and the ionic radius of dubnium should increase compared to tantalum; this has a significant effect on dubnium's chemistry (see below).|$|E
5|$|According to the {{periodic}} law, dubnium should belong to group 5, under vanadium, niobium, and <b>tantalum.</b> Several studies investigated {{the properties of}} element 105 and found a general agreement with the predictions from {{the periodic}} law. Significant deviations may nevertheless occur, due to relativistic effects, which dramatically change physical properties on both atomic and macroscopic scales. (Relativistic effects arise when an object moves on velocities comparable to the speed of light; in heavy atoms, the quickly moving objects are electrons revolving around the nucleus.) These properties have remained challenging to measure: studies have only been performed on single atoms; they generally confirm the assignment of dubnium to the position under <b>tantalum</b> in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Compounds {{containing}} <b>tantalum</b> {{are rarely}} {{encountered in the}} laboratory. The metal is highly biocompatible and is used for body implants and coatings, therefore attention may be focused on other elements or the physical nature of the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{is used in}} alloys with iron, titanium, niobium, <b>tantalum,</b> {{and other}} metals. An alloy used for liquid rocket {{thruster}} nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Dmitri Mendeleev {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} an element between thorium and uranium. The actinide element group was unknown at the time. Therefore, uranium was positioned below tungsten in group VI, and thorium below zirconium in group IV, leaving the space below <b>tantalum</b> in group V empty and, until the 1950s, periodic tables were published with this structure. For a long time chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to <b>tantalum,</b> making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible. Tantalum's heavier analogue was later found to be the transuranic element dubnium.|$|E
5|$|Like titanium, <b>tantalum,</b> and aluminium, niobium can be {{heated and}} {{anodized}} ("reactive metal anodization") {{to produce a}} wide array of iridescent colours for jewelry, where its hypoallergenic property is highly desirable.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{americium}} {{is obtained}} by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride {{was first used}} for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of <b>tantalum</b> and tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Metallic curium is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted in the environment free from water and oxygen, in the apparatus made of <b>tantalum</b> and tungsten, using elemental barium or lithium as reducing agents.|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and <b>tantalum</b> and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, <b>tantalum,</b> and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than <b>tantalum,</b> indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Several {{steps are}} {{involved}} in the extraction of <b>tantalum</b> from tantalite. First, the mineral is crushed and concentrated by gravity separation. This is generally carried out near the mine site.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tantalum</b> is dark (blue-gray), dense, ductile, very hard, easily fabricated, {{and highly}} {{conductive}} {{of heat and}} electricity. The metal is renowned for its resistance to corrosion by acids; in fact, at temperatures below 150°C <b>tantalum</b> is almost completely immune to attack by the normally aggressive aqua regia. It can be dissolved with hydrofluoric acid or acidic solutions containing the fluoride ion and sulfur trioxide, {{as well as with}} a solution of potassium hydroxide. Tantalum's high melting point of 3017°C (boiling point 5458°C) is exceeded among the elements only by tungsten, rhenium and osmium for metals, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} {{are placed in}} a <b>tantalum</b> crucible and fired in a helium atmosphere. As the reaction progresses, the resulting halide compounds and molten dysprosium separate {{due to differences in}} density. When the mixture cools, the dysprosium can be cut away from the impurities.|$|E
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able to withstand its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as <b>tantalum</b> and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E
5|$|Natural <b>tantalum</b> {{consists}} of two isotopes: 180mTa (0.012%) and 181Ta (99.988%). 181Ta is a stable isotope. 180mTa (m denotes a metastable state) is predicted to decay in three ways: isomeric transition to the ground state of 180Ta, beta decay to 180W, or electron capture to 180Hf. However, radioactivity of this nuclear isomer has never been observed, and only a lower limit on its half-life of 2.0×1016years has been set. The ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of only 8 hours. 180mTa is the only naturally occurring nuclear isomer (excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides). It is also the rarest isotope in the Universe, {{taking into account the}} elemental abundance of <b>tantalum</b> and isotopic abundance of 180mTa in the natural mixture of isotopes (and again excluding radiogenic and cosmogenic short-living nuclides).|$|E
5|$|Rhenium {{has a high}} {{melting point}} and a low vapor {{pressure}} similar to <b>tantalum</b> and tungsten. Therefore, rhenium filaments exhibit a higher stability if the filament is operated not in vacuum, but in oxygen-containing atmosphere. Those filaments are widely used in mass spectrometers, in ion gauges and in photoflash lamps in photography.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between <b>tantalum</b> and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas {{of some of the}} compounds in 1865 and finally by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866, who all proved that there were only two elements. Articles on ilmenium continued to appear until 1871.|$|E
