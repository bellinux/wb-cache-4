5|$|Significantly, {{the highly}} {{experienced}} and irreplaceable experts were among <b>the</b> <b>losses.</b> The most notable loss of II./JG 1 was its Kommandeur, Hauptmann Seegatz (KIA 8 March 1944, 40 kills). The Group also lost seven experienced pilots.|$|E
5|$|The {{soldiers}} of Alpha and Delta Companies were {{sent back to}} their Base Camp at Lai Khe to adjust to <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> they had suffered, and to be kept away from enemy activity.|$|E
50|$|Only two {{transcript}} variants were {{predicted to}} might occur. One transcript variant predicted <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of exon 4. <b>The</b> <b>loss</b> of exon 4 {{would lead to}} <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of roughly half of the DUF3496 and <b>the</b> entire <b>loss</b> of <b>the</b> transmembrane domain. The other transcript variant predicted <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of exon 2, which would not lead to <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of DUF3496 and leaves the reading frame relatively intact.|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> in the battle.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston {{withdrew his}} forces into western Tennessee, {{northern}} Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. Johnston established his base at Corinth, Mississippi, {{the site of}} a major railroad junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, but left the Union troops with access into southern Tennessee and points farther south via the Tennessee River.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{powerful}} cyclone over water, {{the storm had}} relatively little impact over land. In the Valsad district, two coastal communities lost a combined 200 homes due to large swells produced by the storm. However, <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> were more extensive offshore. Between 120 and 900 fishermen were listed as missing after contact was lost with their vessels during the storm.|$|E

40|$|Heating the Sabin {{strains of}} {{poliovirus}} at 42 to 45 degrees C caused inactivation, loss of native antigen, and {{release of the}} viral RNA (vRNA). <b>The</b> <b>loss</b> of virion infectivity exceeded <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of vRNA infectivity (as measured by transfection) by roughly 2 log 10. Pirodavir inhibited <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of native antigen and RNA release and reduced <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of virion infectivity to {{the same level as}} <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of vRNA infectivity. Thermoinactivation thus involves an RNA and a protein component, and pirodavir protected only against the latter...|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> it had suffered, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had ceased to be an {{effective}} fighting force. Following a series of raids on the Japanese shipyard at Kure, Japan, the only major warships in fighting order were six aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and one battleship, none of which could be fueled adequately. Although 19destroyers and 38submarines were still operational, their use was limited by the lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, Sparta lost its {{position}} as a major power in Greece. Subsequent Spartan attempts to recover <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> failed and Nabis, the last sovereign ruler, was eventually murdered. Soon after, Sparta was forcibly made a member of its former rival, the Achaean League, ending several centuries of fierce political independence.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, {{a number}} of serious {{concerns}} confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties in operating a new broadband communications trading unit, and <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>loss</b> of Ilmarinen is <b>the</b> {{greatest}} single <b>loss</b> of <b>the</b> Finnish Navy to date. The {{military command}} {{tried to keep}} <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> secret, but Swedish newspapers soon reported the incident, and the numerous sailor obituaries in Finnish newspapers could also have alerted the Soviets, who soon also reported <b>the</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R

5|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 12 {{percent of total}} forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> were due to sorties in which the French were able to inflict heavy damages. Gaston Bodart estimated that of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart estimated that the Austrian losses were lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread {{because of a lack of}} bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed {{close to the}} islands, which severely limited {{the effectiveness of their}} radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used more effectively.|$|E
25|$|With <b>the</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>the</b> Packers' record {{dropped to}} 4–6. <b>The</b> <b>loss</b> marked <b>the</b> {{first time the}} Packers were shut out at Lambeau Field twice in a season.|$|R
50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>loss,</b> <b>the</b> Rams {{went into}} their bye week at 0-4. Head coach Scott Linehan {{was fired after}} <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> and was {{replaced}} by Jim Haslett.|$|R

5|$|Concerned over <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> to his carrier fighter {{aircraft}} strength, {{anxious about}} the threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships' fuel levels, Fletcher {{announced that he would}} be withdrawing his carrier task forces on the evening of August 8.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> {{that had}} brought the Allies to the border of their homeland, German morale was {{surprisingly}} strong.

5|$|During the Soviet era, <b>the</b> <b>losses</b> in {{the battle}} of Narva were not {{released}} by the Soviets. In recent years, Russian authors have published some figures but not for the whole course of the battles. The number of Soviet casualties can only be estimated indirectly.|$|E

50|$|Genetic erosion in {{agricultural}} and livestock biodiversity is <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of genetic diversity, including <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of individual genes, and <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of particular combinations of genes (or gene complexes) {{such as those}} manifested in locally adapted landraces or breeds. The term genetic erosion is sometimes used in a narrow sense, such as for <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of alleles or genes, {{as well as more}} broadly, referring to <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> of varieties or even species. The major driving forces behind genetic erosion in crops are: variety replacement, land clearing, overexploitation of species, population pressure, environmental degradation, overgrazing, policy and changing agricultural systems.|$|R
