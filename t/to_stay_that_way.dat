25|$|During the {{previous}} day at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Italy's World Cup hopes seemed to be diminishing fast as goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off with the game still at 0–0. Yet despite this, Italy {{was still able to}} salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately pay a price for their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca's dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Republic of Ireland made it through after a dreary 0–0 draw with Norway; midfielders Massaro and Bernal traded strikes as Italy and Mexico played to a 1–1 draw.|$|E

5000|$|Janet Maslin of the New York Times stated, [...] "Mr. Grisham {{so often}} writes similar books {{that the same}} things must be said of them. The Associate is true to form: it grabs the reader quickly, becomes {{impossible}} <b>to</b> put down, <b>stays</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> through most of its story, and then escalates into plotting so crazily far-fetched that it defies resolution. Kyle McAvoy is another of the two-dimensional yet terrifically likeable heroes who come to life on Mr. Grisham’s pages only to evaporate later. It’s easy to predict what choice Kyle will make {{at the end of}} the novel. It’s impossible to imagine, let alone care, what his life will be like once the improbably wild furor surrounding this one lone law-firm recruit is over." ...|$|R
50|$|Akru and Sura - The sons of Alexander and Luri and Mowgli's adoptive brothers. Akru has {{brown and}} beige fur, while Sura's is blue and black, like his father. They are only cubs when Mowgli is first {{adopted by the}} wolf couple but are fully grown in {{subsequent}} episodes. They are both very close <b>to</b> Mowgli and <b>stay</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> throughout the series, even after they leave home and find mates. Akru {{has a tendency to}} be hot-headed and does not always look before he leaps, whereas Sura tends to be calmer and more collective. In the French version of the show, Akru was actually female and Mowgli's adoptive sister; this later became a problem when the character becomes mates with Maki, and due to his voice actor being a woman, many mistook Sura as female in the English version initially. Sura's efforts to court Lala are, at first, incorrect, but in Episode 24, he proves his worthiness to her by keeping a trio of muggers away from her long enough for Baloo to finish them. In the ninth episode, Akru was briefly exiled from the pack, but re-welcomed after Mowgli conjures a remedy to ease his injuries. Sura becomes a father of two cubs, making Akru and Mowgli uncles.|$|R
2500|$|A September 2003 poll {{revealed}} that {{seventy percent of}} Americans believed there was a link between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of 9/11. 80% of Fox News viewers were found to hold at least one such belief about the invasion, compared to 23% of PBS viewers. Ted Turner, founder of CNN, charged that Rupert Murdoch was using Fox News to advocate an invasion. Critics have argued that this statistic is indicative of misleading coverage by the U.S. media since viewers in other countries {{were less likely to}} have these beliefs.

And before I was asleep, in comes this artificial mother of mine and tucks in the covers. 'Panchito,' she says, 'my little lost one, God has brought you back to me. I bless His name forever.' It was that, or some truck like that, she said. And down comes a drop or two of rain and hits me on the nose. And all that stuck by me, Mr. Thacker. And it's been that way ever since.

I'm a low-down wolf, and the devil may have sent me on this trail instead of God, but I'll travel it to the end. And now, don't forget that I'm Don Francisco Urique whenever you happen to mention my name." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the top of}} the second, Red Murray {{doubled to}} center. He {{advanced}} to third on a sacrifice bunt by Merkle and scored on a sacrifice fly by Herzog, giving the Giants a 1-0 lead. Three innings later, Herzog doubled and scored on a single by Fletcher, stretching New York's lead <b>to</b> 2-0. It <b>stayed</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> until the bottom of the ninth. Rube Marquard, who pitched a complete game for the Giants, got Speaker to pop up to start the inning. Lewis followed with a grounder to first baseman Merkle, who flipped to Marquard covering first, but Marquard couldn't find the bag and Lewis reached with an infield single. Gardner followed with an RBI double, narrowing the Giant lead to 2-1. First baseman / playing manager Jake Stahl grounded to Marquard, who threw out Gardner at third base for the second out as Stahl took first. Manager Stahl then took himself out of the game for pinch-runner Olaf Henriksen. The next Boston hitter, Heinie Wagner, reached on an error by Merkle, with Henriksen, representing the tying run, advancing to third. Wagner, the potential winning run, then stole second to get into scoring position but the next batter, Hick Cady, lined out to right field to end the game. Although Josh Devore missed the ball with his glove, he managed to catch it with his bare left hand, allowing the Giants to hang on for a 2-1 victory and even the series at a game apiece.|$|R
