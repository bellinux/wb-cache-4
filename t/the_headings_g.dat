40|$|This article studies <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> of <b>the</b> Psalms in the Dead Sea Scrolls, {{especially}} {{in relationship to}} <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> in <b>the</b> Masoretic Text and in the Septuagint. Special attention is given to those manuscripts that contain {{a substantial number of}} headings, such as 4 QPsa, 4 QPsb, 4 QPsc, 4 QPse, 11 QPsa, 11 QPsc, 11 QPsd, He/Se 4 and MasPsa. Special attention is also given to those Psalms where important variants occur in <b>the</b> <b>headings,</b> such as Psalms 33, 71, 91, 100, 104, 105, 123, 126, 130, 135, 144, 148 and 150. The results tend to demonstrate affinity with the Septuagint in {{only a limited number of}} instances, such as Psalm 33, 104 and perhaps 91. It does not seem as if <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> at Qumran have any special significance for <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> in <b>the</b> Septuagint. The results also indicate stability in <b>the</b> Hebrew <b>headings</b> (Masoretic text and Qumran) in the first three books of the Psalter. It is also clear that the situation with regard to 11 QPsa is not different from <b>the</b> other <b>headings</b> from <b>the</b> corresponding sections of the Psalter...|$|R

40|$|Following {{the view}} of Theodore of Mopsuestia, the translator(s) of the Peshitta Psalter did not accept the historicity of <b>the</b> <b>{{headings}}</b> of <b>the</b> Psalms in the Hebrew Psalter. In some manuscripts the Peshitta Psalms do not have headings at all, while in other manuscripts headings are supplied. This paper makes a few remarks {{on the study of}} <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> of <b>the</b> Psalms in Syriac and discusses <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> of a number of Psalms in different Syriac traditions, with special attention to <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> in <b>the</b> Syriac manuscript 12 t 4. These headings can be regarded as a summary of the exegesis of the particular Psalm and they represent different schools of exegetes with widely different interpretations of most of the Psalms.

40|$|There are two Syriac {{versions}} of the commentary of Athanasius on the Psalms, a longer and a shorter one. This study deals with <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> of <b>the</b> Psalms in the two Syriac versions, in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> in <b>the</b> original Greek commentary and in the Syro-Hexapla. The summaries {{at the beginning of}} the different Psalms are related in a linear fashion. The shorter commentary depends on the longer one and the longer one on a Greek original. <b>The</b> <b>headings</b> in <b>the</b> Greek commentary are those of the Septuagint, with a few variants. Most of these variants agree with variants given in the edition of Rahlfs. <b>The</b> Syriac <b>headings</b> of <b>the</b> shorter commentary are usually in agreement with that of the Syro-Hexapla. Many of the differences between the longer commentary on the one hand and the other two are related to the fact that the longer commentary ascribes all twenty-eight Psalms discussed in this article to David. <b>The</b> <b>headings</b> in <b>the</b> longer commentary are not just translations from a Greek original, but are the work of the translator.

40|$|The oldest {{published}} description by Addai Scher of this Syriac manuscript {{dates from}} 1907. The manuscript is a liturgical document containing the Psalms (including Psalms 151 - 155) and Odes. Scher also mentions that every Psalm is preceded by headings ascribed to Eusebius, Athanasius and Theodore of Mopsuestia. What {{he did not}} mention is that <b>the</b> set of <b>headings</b> for each Psalm starts off with a heading in Syriac referred to as a Hebrew heading. The Peshitta does not contain <b>the</b> Masoretic Psalm <b>headings.</b> <b>The</b> Syro-Hexapla contains <b>headings</b> from <b>the</b> Septuagint and these are thus indirectly related to <b>the</b> Masoretic <b>headings.</b> <b>The</b> Hebrew <b>headings</b> of 12 t 4 are, however, not identical to those of the Syro-Heaxpla. Especially important are those cases where the Syro-Hexapla, following the Septuagint, disagrees with <b>the</b> Masoretic <b>headings.</b> In many of these cases 12 t 4 has variants, indicated by “another manuscript” or “other manuscripts”. In some of these cases the variants contain the heading of the Syro-Hexapla. This paper discusses a number of these headings with their variants. The author of this manuscript interpreted <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> of <b>the</b> Hebrew Old Testament independently of the LXX and the Syro-Hexapla, though it is also evident that he was influenced by them in some instances...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of the five Syriac Apocryphal Psalms has been known since the eighteenth century. Psalm 151 {{was included in the}} Septuagint, whereas Hebrew versions of Psalms 151, 154 and 155 are part of the Psalms Scroll found in Qumran Cave XI. This paper explores the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> of these Psalms in different traditions. In the Syriac transmission manuscript 12 t 4 is of special importance and has a large number of unique readings {{as well as a number}} of important marginal notes. There are a number of important differences in <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> of <b>the</b> different traditions. The heading of Psalm 151 in 12 t 4 was influenced by Athanasius and is also related to the heading in the Septuagint. The heading of Psalm 151 in the other Syriac manuscripts is probably related to a heading in the lost Hebrew Vorlage. <b>The</b> <b>headings</b> of Psalms 152 and 153 are part of an attempt to link these Psalms more closely to Psalm 151 and the Peshitta of 1 Samuel 16 and 17. The relationship between <b>the</b> different <b>headings</b> of Psalms 154 and 155 in 12 t 4 and the other manuscripts is not easily definable. They are, however, related to <b>the</b> East Syrian <b>headings</b> of canonical Psalms 85 and 86. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} history of the reception of <b>the</b> Psalm <b>headings</b> (also called <b>the</b> inscriptions, superscriptions, or titles) from the original Hebrew text into the main early versions of Greek, Latin, Coptic, Syriac, and Targumic Aramaic. This material has proven difficult for both ancient and modern scholars to fully understand, and the goal {{of this study is to}} see what ancient translators and copyists did when faced with such opaque texts—and, if possible, to ascertain what they thought of them. No similar study has yet been made, either in the scope of the versions used or the detail into which the evidence of the manuscript traditions has been described. This study is organized into two main parts. Part One surveys the early versions, in sections organized by language (for most of these languages more than one translation or version was made). For each, relationships to other versions, notable figures involved in the translation or interpretation of the Psalms in that language, and the sources (important manuscripts and available critical editions) are delineated. The different scribal presentations of the actual text of <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> in manuscripts are discussed as well. This material provides both the context and the textual basis for the rest of the study. Part Two provides a synoptic edition of the texts of <b>the</b> Psalm <b>headings</b> themselves, organized by language and proximity to the original Hebrew. Specific English translations for the main text of all these versions are provided, as is a critical apparatus listing all important variants. Two main treatments of <b>the</b> Psalm <b>headings</b> can be discerned in the early versions: accommodation or replacement. Accommodation, which seeks to maintain <b>the</b> <b>headings</b> inherited ultimately from Hebrew, can be either conservative (without additions or modifications) or free (<b>the</b> <b>headings</b> are flexible and may be amended). Replacement, the rarer treatment, involves the excision of <b>the</b> original <b>headings</b> from transmission and their replacement with theological material designed to guide the reader toward a proper understanding of the Psalm. These varied treatments attest to a range of opinion about the validity and function of <b>the</b> <b>headings...</b>|$|R
