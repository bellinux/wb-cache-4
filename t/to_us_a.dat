25|$|In a very {{definite}} sense, {{we are all}} beneficiaries {{from the}} life of Fr. Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed on <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has given us a share of dauntless bravery– of body and soul. He has transmitted to every one of us a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy– godlessness, now stalking the world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit of one who loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E
500|$|In response, Yeats {{delivered}} {{a series of}} speeches that attacked the [...] "quixotically impressive" [...] ambitions {{of the government and}} clergy, likening their campaign tactics to those of [...] "medieval Spain." [...] "Marriage is not <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> Sacrament, but, upon the other hand, the love of a man and woman, and the inseparable physical desire, are sacred. This conviction has come to us through ancient philosophy and modern literature, and it seems <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> most sacrilegious thing to persuade two people who hate each other... to live together, and it is to us no remedy to permit them to part if neither can re-marry." [...] The resulting debate has been described as one of Yeats's [...] "supreme public moments", and began his ideological move away from pluralism towards religious confrontation.|$|E
500|$|His {{most ambitious}} {{trip to the}} region was however in July 1910, when he {{undertook}} to explore the interior of Labrador, saying [...] "it seemed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> pity that such a terra incognita should continue to exist under the British flag". This same territory had claimed the life of writer Leonidas Hubbard a few years earlier. He described his journey up the Fraser River to access Indian House Lake on George River in the popular Through Trackless Labrador in 1911.|$|E

500|$|While {{producer}} Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange {{expressed an}} interest in working again with AC/DC, his schedule did not allow this. When the Young brothers called Columbia Records' president Steve Barnett to announce the making of a new album, Barnett recommended producer Brendan O'Brien. Angus said the band had considered talking to O'Brien since the 1990s, as [...] "he seemed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> very competent professional" [...] and because he and the band would benefit from working with a producer they had not worked with before.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the early}} fan-made {{trailers}} and later other viral videos and commercials circulated via YouTube, and captured media attention there with such titles as: Cats on a Plane (which was featured in Joel Siegel's review of Snakes on a Plane on Good Morning America), Snakes Who Missed the Plane, All Your Snakes Are Belong <b>To</b> <b>Us</b> (<b>a</b> spoof of the All your base are belong to us phenomenon), Steaks on a Train, and Badgers on a Plane (a spoof of [...] "Badger Badger Badger"). Several websites also held contests about the film in fan-submitted short films and posters.|$|E
500|$|Rediff.com stated: [...] "Sporting a new, rugged look, 'Prince' Mahesh Babu {{has stolen}} the show. He carries the film on his shoulders, {{consolidating}} his winning streak after last year's Athadu. Another {{highlight of the}} film is its well-choreographed action sequences (if you can digest the violence), which give it a slick look." [...] IndiaGlitz gave a positive review stating: [...] "In Pokiri, the hero is introduced <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> ruthless baddie, part of the huge underbelly of mafia. By the time we come to the denouement, there is much twist and turn. If you like some racy action, fun, glamour and love, then Pokiri would be your kind of film." ...|$|E

60|$|Yes, {{those old}} despotisms we trust are dead, and never to revive. But their corpses are the corpses, not of our enemies, but {{of our friends}} and predecessors, slain in the world-old fight of Ormuzd against Ahriman--light against darkness, order against disorder. Confusedly they fought, and {{sometimes}} ill: but their corpses piled the breach and filled the trench for us, and over their corpses we step on to what should be <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> easy victory--what may be <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> yet, <b>a</b> shameful ruin.|$|R
500|$|When {{the tour}} began, it {{was marred by}} protests and disturbances. Telephone threats were received, and concerts were picketed by the Ku Klux Klan. Daily Express writer Robert Pitman, {{responding}} to the US outcry, wrote, [...] "It seems a nerve for Americans to hold up shocked hands, when week in, week out, America is exporting <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> subculture that makes the Beatles seem like four stern old churchwardens." [...] The reaction was also criticised in the US; a Kentucky radio station {{announced that it would}} give the Beatles' music airplay to show its [...] "contempt for hypocrisy personified", and the Jesuit magazine America wrote: [...] "Lennon was simply stating what many a Christian educator would readily admit".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on Australian Music Online Blaik listed his favourite Australian artists, and specified some of their attributes or albums: INXS and their lead singer Michael Hutchence's ability [...] "to create so much power and emotion"; Powderfinger's dedication and uniqueness, and Odyssey Number Five which had [...] "everything that I love about Powderfinger"; Crowded House especially Neil Finn's song writing capabilities; Silverchair's Diorama which was [...] "a journey from beginning to end"; The Cruel Sea's live performances; and End of Fashion's self-titled debut album, which he opined [...] "represent <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> place that {{we would want to}} be in the near future." [...] He also acknowledged AC/DC, especially their Back in Black album, as being highly influential, claiming [...] "I don't think I know a single musician who doesn't have this record and this band in their record collection", and asking [...] "How can you not be inspired by this band?" ...|$|E
500|$|German philosopher Immanuel Kant devised an {{argument}} from morality based on practical reason. Kant {{argued that the}} goal of humanity is to achieve perfect happiness and virtue (the summum bonum) and believed that an afterlife must exist in order for this to be possible, and that God must exist to provide this. In his book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis argued that [...] "conscience reveals <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> moral law whose source cannot be found in the natural world, thus pointing to a supernatural Lawgiver." [...] Lewis argued that accepting the validity of human reason as a given must include accepting the validity of practical reason, which could not be valid without reference to a higher cosmic moral order which could not exist without a God to create and/or establish it. A related argument is from conscience; John Henry Newman argued that the conscience supports the claim that objective moral truths exist because it drives people to act morally even when it is not in their own interest. Newman argued that, because the conscience suggests the existence of objective moral truths, God must exist to give authority to these truths.|$|E

500|$|The musical {{received}} almost unanimous {{rave reviews}} after its opening in 1945. [...] According to Hischak, reviews {{were not as}} exuberant as for Oklahoma! as the critics were not taken by surprise this time. [...] John Chapman of the Daily News termed it [...] "one of the finest musical plays I have ever seen and I shall remember it always". [...] The New York Timess reviewer, Lewis Nichols, stated that [...] "Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, who can do no wrong, have continued doing no wrong in adapting Liliom into a musical play. [...] Their Carousel is on the whole delightful." [...] Wilella Waldorf of the New York Post, however, complained, [...] "Carousel seemed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> rather long evening. [...] The Oklahoma! formula is becoming a bit monotonous and so are Miss de Mille's ballets. [...] All right, go ahead and shoot!" [...] Dance Magazine gave Linn plaudits {{for her role as}} Louise, stating, [...] "Bambi doesn't come on until twenty minutes before eleven, and for the next forty minutes, she practically holds the audience in her hand". [...] Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune also applauded the dancing: [...] "It has waited for Miss de Mille to come through with peculiarly American dance patterns for a musical show to become as much a dance as a song show." ...|$|E

In the point of rest at the centre of our being, we encounter a world where all things are at rest in the same way.
