25|$|Of course, we have {{returned}} to realism, to a deeper, more refined and more psychological realism. Let us get a little stronger in it and we shall once more continue on our quest. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> have invited Gordon Craig. After wandering about in search of new ways, we shall again return to realism for more strength. I do not doubt that every abstraction on the stage, such as impressionism, for instance, could be attained {{by way of a}} more refined and deeper realism. All other ways are false and dead.|$|E
25|$|It (Independence) {{belongs to}} all of us and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> {{celebrate}} it. Do you think, however, that our nation from the outset needs only men to serve it? Women should also take their part as women did {{in the early years of}} our nation and Islam. From their examples we must learn that we must all contribute toward the development of our nation and that this cannot be done without being equipped with knowledge. So we should all attempt to acquire as much knowledge as possible, in order that we may render our services to society in the manner of the women of early Islam.|$|E

500|$|As the Cold War set in, the {{alliance}} with the Communists became increasingly damaging for the RDA. The French colonial administration showed itself increasingly hostile toward the RDA and its president, whom the administration called a [...] "Stalinist". Tensions reached their height {{at the beginning of}} 1950, when, following an outbreak of anti-colonial violence, almost the entire PDCI leadership was arrested; Houphouët-Boigny managed to slip away shortly before police arrived at his house. Although Houphouët-Boigny would have been saved by his parliamentary immunity, his missed arrest was popularly attributed to his influence and his prestige. In the ensuing chaos, riots broke out in Côte d'Ivoire; the most significant of which was a clash with the police at Dimbokro in which 13 Africans were killed and 50 wounded. According to official figures, by 1951 a total of 52 Africans had been killed, several hundred wounded and around 3,000 arrested (numbers which, according to an opinion reported by journalist Ronald Segal in African Profiles, are certainly underestimated). In order to defuse the crisis, Prime Minister René Pleven entrusted the France's Minister for Overseas Territories, François Mitterrand, with the task of detaching the RDA from the PCF, and in fact an official alliance between the RDA and Mitterrand's party, the UDSR, was established in 1952. Knowing he was at an impasse, in October 1950, Houphouët-Boigny agreed to break the Communist alliance. Asked in an undated interview why he worked with the communists, Houphouët-Boigny replied: [...] "I, a bourgeois landowner, I would preach the class struggle? <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> aligned ourselves with the Communist Party, without joining it." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{real life}} and actual {{practice}} do not always coincide with theory.

30|$|The RNN and LSTM {{language}} {{models were}} created on a character level. A single one-hot encoded row of data which was fed {{to the network}} during training was related to one particular character. Then again, during inference time, the network was also fed data samples related to one character. On the other hand, the 3 -gram model operates on trigrams of consecutive characters. One aspect of our research was testing whether DSL methodology could be applied and actually useful in different kinds of setups, with different kinds of architectures for each model. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> decided to use a 3 -gram-based language model {{in one of our}} experiments [14, 15].|$|R
60|$|The {{remarkable}} thing, {{that first}} day of the strike, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no one really apprehended anything serious. The announcement of organized labour in the morning papers <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> prepared to stay out a month or three months was laughed at. And yet that very first day we might have guessed as much {{from the fact that the}} working class took practically no part in the great rush to buy provisions. Of course not. For weeks and months, craftily and secretly, the whole working class had been laying in private stocks of provisions. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> permitted to go down and buy out the little groceries in the working-class neighbourhoods.|$|R
2500|$|The book is metaphorically {{called by}} the native English, Domesday, i.e., the Day of Judgement.

2500|$|There was {{controversy}} in April when Graham Yallop released a (ghost written) {{book about the}} Ashes, Lambs to the Slaughter where he claimed Hogg ran [...] "roughshod" [...] over him during the English series.

[...] "I simply didn't get any support at all for field placings in the early Tests and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> had continual disagreements". Yallop said he didn't actually write the book and wanted the Hogg chapter re-written. The book was released regardless.|$|E

Look what happened. Did you hear of any particular efforts of the United Nations UNIFIL force in the south of Lebanon to prevent the attacks against Israel in the first place.

5000|$|Following {{a run of}} {{disastrous}} results {{during which}} Hamburger SV picked up only four points from their first five league games of the 2013-14 Bundesliga season and with the club in 15th place in the league table, Fink was sacked with immediate effect on 16 September 2013. [...] "We were no longer confident <b>that</b> Thorsten Fink <b>was</b> capable of turning the team around and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> took this decision (to sack Fink).

50|$|There {{are three}} or four really {{extraordinary}} novels — The Silent Speaker, In the Best Families, and The Doorbell Rang, for example. These {{are some of the}} most famous and most complex and most amazing stories in the series, but we didn't want to start with those particular ones for a whole complex of reasons. We wanted to pick a story that had activity in it so that we could slowly bring people into the static milieu of Nero Wolfe's house. The Golden Spiders took you outside. There's a gunfight and a tough interrogation scene. It was a very strong story with a lot of pathos, because a young boy is murdered and Wolfe has to deal with his mother. So <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> chose <b>that</b> one.|$|R
2500|$|The Vice Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Joint Staff said [...] "We do {{not have}} enough forces there. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are having a new division, the 14th Division, to be built in Basrah, {{especially}} with the possibility that the British might be leaving us in time.". The formation of this new division was not scheduled to be completed before June 2008 and was accelerated to deal with the upcoming operation. The 3rd brigade of the division graduated from the Besmaya Combat Training Center Program on 13 February 2008, five weeks before the battle and the 4th brigade is still forming.|$|E

Lisa Power, head of policy at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said [...] "in some ways the storyline was not reflective {{of what was happening}} at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community". She also said [...] "he was perhaps killed off too early as advancements in drugs are helping people live for much longer...
