Design {{education}} in particular {{seem to be}} at the core of European goals: 1) 2009 it is the European year of creativity; 2) the EU underlines, in several recent documents, the importance of research, of the education for research, 3) there is a continuous stress and promotion of interdisciplinary approach and of internationalization to maintain and improve the higher education level and strengthen its competitiveness. Within our institution there is an educational model based on the so called Research and didactic units, between which there is a virtuous circle. Starting from the virtuous circle between research and education and the importance of creativity in Design activities the paper will explore the example of Metadesign studios. If nowadays knowledge is less and less linked to the contents acquisition and it identifies more with the ability of coding and de-coding messages, the Metadesign studio has the purpose to give an approach to design knowledge, to learn to learn, to develop metacognitive skills, to acquire autonomy in coding and decoding information. The necessity of decoding the professional practice is the core of inductive approach and inside our course this translates in role game where students have to cooperate inside small design teams to develop a specific project for a definite company...|$|E

Refer to era before the open source, {{the number of}} operating system is very limited and developed by big groups or companies. Now, number of operating system increase very dramatically, the main contribution is Linux Distribution which called Distro. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>reason</b> in developing a distro, the reason can be purpose, size of hardware, user group etc. Currently, {{there are more than}} an hundred distro around the world. The approach to develop distro can differ from one distro to the other. Many number of distro can rise new issues in how to choose an appropriate distro. Indonesia is a developing country, so the budget of IT is very limited. Based on this condition, Indonesia should find economic solution for IT especially for the software. However, piracy software or illegal software is still high in Indonesia. Since two years ago, government of Republic Indonesia has been very serious to consider the Linux or open source as a solution. In the paper, we are interested to look at the relation between number of distro including the sustaining and Linux implementation in desktop and server in Indonesia. First section talk about background of distro. Methodol-ogy of survey will discuss in section two. Section three look at the result of distro survey in Indonesia to look at relation of distro and Linux implementation. Result of the research can enhance point of view at manager level in considering implementation of Linux...|$|E
