40|$|INTRODUCTION: Mortality data provide {{essential}} {{evidence on}} the health status of populations in crisis-affected and resource-poor settings and to guide and assess relief operations. Retrospective surveys are commonly used to collect mortality data in such populations, but require substantial resources and have important methodological limitations. We evaluated the feasibility of an alternative method for rapidly quantifying mortality (<b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method). <b>The</b> study objective {{was to assess the}} economic feasibility of <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method. METHODS: <b>The</b> <b>informant</b> method captures deaths through an exhaustive search for all deaths occurring in a population over a defined and recent recall period, using key community informants and next-of-kin of decedents. Between July and October 2008, we implemented and evaluated <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method in: Kabul, Afghanistan; Mae La camp for Karen refugees, Thai-Burma border; Chiradzulu District, Malawi; and Lugufu and Mtabila refugee camps, Tanzania. We documented the time and cost inputs for <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method in each site, and compared these with projections for hypothetical retrospective mortality surveys implemented in the same site with a 6 month recall period and with a 30 day recall period. FINDINGS: <b>The</b> <b>informant</b> method was estimated to require an average of 29 % less time inputs and 33 % less monetary inputs across all four study sites when compared with retrospective surveys with a 6 month recall period, and 88 % less time inputs and 86 % less monetary inputs when compared with retrospective surveys with a 1 month recall period. Verbal autopsy questionnaires were feasible and efficient, constituting only 4 % of total person-time for <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> method's implementation in Chiradzulu District. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>informant</b> method requires fewer resources and incurs less respondent burden. The method's generally impressive feasibility and the near real-time mortality data it provides warrant further work to develop the method given the importance of mortality measurement in such settings...|$|R

Diane Purkiss observes an equating of fairies with the untimely dead who left [...] "unfinished lives". One tale recounted a man caught by the fairies, who found that whenever he looked steadily at one, the fairy was a dead neighbor of his.

But the divine name is not thus tabooed and sacred when the mere folklore about him is narrated. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> of Mr. Howitt instinctively distinguished between the mythology and the religion of Darumulun.[9] This distinction-- the secrecy about the religion, the candour about the mythology--is essential, and accounts for our ignorance about the inner religious beliefs of early races. Mr. Howitt himself knew little till he was initiated. The grandfather of Mr. Howitt's friend, before the white men came to Melbourne, took him out at night, and, pointing to a star, said: 'You will soon be a man; you see Bunjil [Supreme Being of certain tribes] up there, and he can see you, and all you do down here.'
