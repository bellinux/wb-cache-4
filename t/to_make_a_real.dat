Starbucks is still only 3% fair trade – enough to appease consumers, but not enough <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> difference to small farmers, according to some activists. The ethics of buying fair trade from {{a company that is}} not committed to the cause are questionable; these products are only making a small dent in a big company even though these companies' products account for a significant portion of global fair trade.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} offered Dr. No to Guy Green, Guy Hamilton, Val Guest and Ken Hughes to direct, {{but all of}} them {{turned it}} down. They finally signed Terence Young who had a long background with Broccoli's Warwick Films as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series. Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that [...] "a lot of things in this film, the sex and violence and so on, if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you take the mickey out, put the tongue out in the cheek, it seems to disarm." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Lesser {{was asked}} to help develop and lead the {{research}} department of the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later the Sesame Workshop), the organization responsible {{for the production of}} Sesame Street and other educational television programs. [...] He was invited by Carnegie Foundation vice-president and Sesame Street co-creator Lloyd Morrisett, whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale. [...] At first, Lesser was skeptical about the new show's potential and its ability to teach children; according to Morrisett, [...] "he took some convincing". [...] As Lesser later reported, he would be involved only if he was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> contribution. [...] When he saw that Morrisett and his co-creator, Joan Ganz Cooney, were serious about developing goals and a curriculum for the new show, {{and that it would be}} an [...] "experimental venture in education by television", he became the first chairman of the CTW's advisory board, a position he held from 1967 to 1997. [...] Lesser was skeptical about Cooney's qualifications as CTW's first CEO, although by the time he wrote Children and Television in 1974, she stated in the book's foreword, [...] "...I couldn't begin to measure how proud I am to be Gerry Lesser's colleague and how happy I am to know the pleasure of his company".|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with {{me for the rest of}} my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E

2500|$|If I was {{to spend}} two years on the 16 {{paintings}} for Masquerade I wanted them to mean something.

2500|$|Ten years later, {{we still}} {{note that there}} is no place in Holy Orthodoxy for the present case of multi-jurisdictionalism in North America and across the globe, as this only impedes the Church's evangelizing efforts.

2500|$|His {{interest}} in general relativity led Weber {{to use a}} 1955–1956 sabbatical, funded by a Guggenheim Fellowship, to study gravitational radiation with John Archibald Wheeler at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ and the Lorentz Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. [...] At the time, the existence of gravitational waves was not widely accepted. [...] Weber was the first <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> attempt to detect these waves. [...] After he began publishing papers on the detection of gravitational waves, he moved from the Engineering department to the Physics department at Maryland.|$|E
2500|$|Bussard {{believed}} that the WB-6 machine had demonstrated progress and that no intermediate-scale models would be needed. He noted, [...] "We are probably the only {{people on the planet}} who know how <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> net power clean fusion system" [...] He proposed to rebuild WB-6 more robustly to verify its performance. After publishing the results, he planned to convene a conference of experts in the field in an attempt to get them behind his design. The first step in that plan was to design and build two more small scale designs (WB-7 and WB-8) to determine which full scale machine would be best. He wrote [...] "The only small scale machine work remaining, which can yet give further improvements in performance, is test of one or two WB-6-scale devices but with [...] "square" [...] or polygonal coils aligned approximately (but slightly offset on the main faces) along the edges of the vertices of the polyhedron. If this is built around a truncated dodecahedron, near-optimum performance is expected; about 3–5 times better than WB-6." [...] Bussard died on October 6, 2007 from multiple myeloma at age 79.|$|E

[...] Henry, on the other hand, believes {{the only way to}} stay positive in light of all this is to hold a dance, which in turn was a way to ask Violet out. At the same time, Emma continues <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> man out of Gold without telling him exactly why she needed him. Gold tried to tell Emma that being the Dark One would cost her the ones she loved, but she didn’t want to listen. She then brings in Merida to do her bidding and sends them to the woods. Emma, heeding Gold's words, was having second thoughts about everything as she went to her shed full of dreamcatchers and cried. As they arrive in the woods, Merida began putting Gold to work on making him a hero, but he is shown to be weak, which infuriated the Scottish archer from DunBroch. She then finds something that he can fight for by showing him Belle's chipped teacup, then taunts Gold on how cowardly he was, even to Belle. Gold immediately takes the sword and swings at Merida, who stops and tells him that what he did was an act of bravery, he was not thinking about himself or his limp: he was thinking of her. But, [...] she also says that they {{have a long way to}} go so they can kill Emma.|$|E
500|$|Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is {{considered}} to be an important film in the history of African American cinema. Hollywood studios were led to attempt to replicate the film's success by producing black-oriented films such as Shaft and Super Fly. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song was credited by Variety as leading {{to the creation of the}} blaxploitation genre, largely consisting of exploitation films made by white directors. As Spike Lee states, [...] "Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song gave us all the answers we needed.
