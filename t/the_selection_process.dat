The Chinese contestants go through a camp. In others, such as the USA, possible participants go {{through a series of}} easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty. In the USA, the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, each of which is a competition in its own right. For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection, there also is a summer camp, like that of China.|$|E
