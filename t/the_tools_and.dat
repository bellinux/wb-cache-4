5|$|For {{several days}} the men {{attempted}} to salvage <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> provisions {{that had been}} loaded on the Aimable, but a bad storm prevented them from recovering more than food, cannons, powder, and {{a small amount of}} the merchandise. The ship sank on March 7. The French watched the Karankawa loot the wreckage. As French soldiers approached the Native American village to retrieve their supplies, the villagers hid. On discovering the deserted village, the soldiers not only reclaimed the looted merchandise but also took animal pelts and twocanoes. The angry Karankawa attacked, killing twoFrenchmen and injuring others.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would have been used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
30|$|A perfect {{sticking}} thermomechanical {{contact is}} considered between <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> work-piece. It {{means that the}} temperature field and the displacement field are continuous through the interface between <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> work-piece. Like some authors [26 – 28], {{we assume that the}} heat produced by the friction between <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> work-piece is negligible versus the heat generated by plastic deformations.|$|R
30|$|Adhesive wear is a {{phenomenon}} which occurs when two materials rub together with sufficient force to cause the removal of material from the less wear-resistant surface [27]. The precondition of adhesive wear is the interaction between <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> chip materials. <b>The</b> affinity between <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> workpiece materials has a great effect on adhesion, and the affinity {{is proportional to the}} intersolubility of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> chip materials. Through the energy spectrum analysis, the elements of the workpiece and chip materials are found in <b>the</b> <b>tool’s</b> material. Thus, it is considered that the replacement reaction occurs between <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> <b>and</b> workpiece elements, thus the substituted solid solution is formed. From materials science knowledge, the atomic size, electronegativity and the location of element periodic table will affect the formation the substituted solid solution.|$|R

5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot of trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a great sense of discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{suggested}} a plan where the encomienda would be abolished and Indians would be congregated into self-governing townships to become tribute-paying vassals of the King. He still {{suggested that the}} loss of Indian labor for the colonists could be replaced by allowing importation of African slaves. Another important part of the plan was to introduce a new kind of sustainable colonization, and Las Casas advocated supporting the migration of Spanish peasants to the Indies where they would introduce small-scale farming and agriculture, a kind of colonization that didn't rely on resource depletion and Indian labor. Las Casas worked to recruit a large number of peasants who would want to travel to the Islands, where they would be given lands to farm, cash advances, and <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> <b>and</b> resources they needed to establish themselves there. The recruitment drive was difficult, and during the process the power relation shifted at court when Chancellor Sauvage, Las Casas's main supporter, unexpectedly died. In the end a much smaller number of peasant families were sent than originally planned, and they were supplied with insufficient provisions and no support secured for their arrival. Those who survived the journey were ill-received, and had to work hard even to survive in the hostile colonies. Las Casas was devastated by the tragic result of his peasant migration scheme, which he felt had been thwarted by his enemies. He decided instead to undertake a personal venture which would not rely on the support of others, and fought to win a land grant on the American mainland which was in its earliest stage of colonization.|$|E
