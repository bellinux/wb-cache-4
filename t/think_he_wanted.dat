500|$|In {{the spring}} of 449 BC, Pericles {{proposed}} the Congress Decree, {{which led to a}} meeting ("Congress") of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress failed because of Sparta's stance, but Pericles' intentions remain unclear. Some historians think that he wanted to prompt a confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities; others <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to assert Athenian pre-eminence. According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the Delian League and for the collection of [...] "phoros" [...] (taxes).|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to know was, what would I think of him if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael McCoy's 'Insider challenge' for {{the week}} was to ensure that he was {{nominated}} by eight Housemates in the next week's nominations. [...] Success would mean immunity from eviction {{for the week}}. [...] He spun a complex and fictitious tale of a son called Reuben and a paternity test supposedly taken shortly before he entered the House that revealed he was not (as he had believed for nearly nine years) Reuben's biological father, {{in a bid to}} make other Housemates <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to leave the house.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Battlefield", {{from the}} This Is My Battlefield 2004 Panzer AG album samples Captain Rhodes asking Sarah in {{reference}} to Miguel's zombie bite: [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to walk around after <b>he's</b> dead? You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> {{to be one of}} these things?" [...] The line [...] "Sit down or so help me god I'll have you shot" [...] appears once {{near the end of the}} song.|$|R

2500|$|Pickard {{explained}} Tony's {{reason for}} marrying Cindy saying: [...] "he’s {{looking forward to}} someone {{not so much to}} fall in love with, but for more practical reasons – so he lets himself be swept off his feet by Cindy". Shortly before the wedding Tony becomes intoxicated and has sex with a woman who Darren has paid. Tony admits this to Cindy who in turn admits she and Darren had been planning to scam Tony. Waring said Tony has [...] "been a good man telling the truth and Cindy takes that as her opportunity to tell him the truth. All the cards are on the table". Pickard said he was [...] "surprised that Tony would go through with it because of their volatile relationship and the fact that Tony knows Cindy's into Darren. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to just go for it with her, and hopefully it'll work out for him". Pickard later stated that he didn't think Cindy was right for Tony stating: [...] "I don't think she's the one for him, to be honest". Tony meets Gabby Sharpe (Phina Oruche) which allows him to realise [...] "his marriage is over and he intends to tell Cindy that as soon as he gets home".|$|E
2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, {{she felt as if she}} was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", and she knew it was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua played an important role in her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E

60|$|He did {{not express}} himself quite like this. He used {{gestures}} instead of adjectives, and he halted. I have put {{into my own}} words what I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to say.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, I <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to see you, but I wasn't {{going to}} let him. Not until to-night, when you're going to burst upon every one like King Solomon in his glory! Come on! WE'RE GOING TO SHOP!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not matter?" [...] said Adam, gravely. [...] "You {{seemed very}} frightened about it. I'll hold it till you're {{ready to take}} it," [...] he added, quietly closing his hand over it, that she might not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to look at it}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, dear. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to {{quarrel with}} any one;--but above all {{he must not}} quarrel with me. Lord Fawn has quarrelled with him, and that's a misfortune,--just for the present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] said Caleb, {{looking up}} gravely, [...] "there is {{something}} wrong--a stranger, {{who is very}} ill, I <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> a doctor, and I came to tell you of that. His name is Raffles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beatem, Beatem, {{come over}} to my room. This man is {{absolutely}} the biggest thing in America. For sheer calmness and nerve I never heard of anything to approach him. What do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do I make of it? Can't you see, Sam?

6000|$|... "Leslie {{passed her}} up the gangway," [...] said another man, adding, with a suggestive laugh as he {{answered}} another question: [...] "Why did he do it? Well, perhaps he's had his fortune told, or you can ask him. Anyway, although I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to, he dared not turn her back." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, no! The rascal is {{come over}} to my side. What do you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to say?

60|$|January 12.--Mathews {{last night}} {{gave us a}} very perfect {{imitation}} of old Cumberland, who carried the poetic jealousy and irritability further than any man I ever saw. He was a great flatterer too, the old rogue. Will Erskine used to admire him. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> originality. A very high-bred man in point of manners in society.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{very much}} to be convinced," [...] said Heyst, with the courteous {{intonation}} so {{well known in the}} Islands. [...] "I don't want to disturb your touching trust in your--your follower, but he must be the most credulous brigand in existence. What do you imagine? If the story of my riches were ever so true, do you think Schomberg would have imparted it to you from sheer altruism? Is that the way of the world, Mr. Jones?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he raged. [...] "He expects! Expects me--for his rotten money!... Who {{wants his}} home? Mad--not <b>he!</b> Don't you <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> his own way. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> to turn {{me into a}} miserable lawyer's clerk, and now <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to make of me a blamed tame rabbit in a cage. Of me! Of me!" [...] His subdued angry laugh frightened her now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> outside now. I can't <b>think</b> what <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> Would you--would {{you mind}} being {{kind enough to}} go and send him away?" ...|$|R

6000|$|I heard Cavor's {{voice in}} alarm and entreaty. Even then I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{compromise}} with these creatures. [...] "I say, Bedford," [...] he cried, [...] "I know a way!" [...] But {{the sting of}} that second stab seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had held us unresisting {{in the hands of}} these moon creatures. For that second, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad. The chain was twisted round my fist.|$|E
60|$|The {{next night}} he came again. I should {{say he was}} a bird {{with a sense of}} humour. Thinking this might happen, I had, however, taken the {{precaution}} to have a few stones ready. I opened the window wide, and fired them one after another into the tree. After I had closed the window, he hopped down nearer, and cawed louder than ever. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me to throw more stones at him: he appeared to regard the whole proceeding as a game. On the third night, as I heard nothing of him, I flattered myself that, in spite of his bravado, I had discouraged him. I might have known rooks better.|$|E
60|$|He was so set in his {{own opinion}} on this point of position, that we were afraid we should be obliged to give the thing up. He used very good arguments, too. He {{said that he had}} been elected to his present office by his fellow Africans; that he had held it a long time; that he didn't think the rest of his people wanted him to give it up, and he didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to give it up himself. A prime {{minister}} might be all very well, but he didn't know anything about it. He knew what it was to be governor, and was very well satisfied to leave things as they were.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} of {{anything}} but YOU. But I have, since last evening, a new hope. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to give me an opening.
