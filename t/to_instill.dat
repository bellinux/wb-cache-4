5|$|At age ten Balzac {{was sent}} to the Oratorian grammar school in Vendôme, where he studied for seven years. His father, seeking <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> the same hardscrabble work ethic which had gained him the esteem of society, {{intentionally}} gave little spending money to the boy. This made him the object of ridicule among his much wealthier schoolmates.|$|E
5|$|His mother {{played the}} piano {{reasonably}} well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein {{is said to have}} begun playing when he was 5, although he did not enjoy it at that age.|$|E

5|$|Brian Delate as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his {{character}} {{on the show}} was killed off <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and {{as he tries to}} get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E
5|$|Hines {{went to the}} Confederate {{capital of}} Richmond, Virginia, after his escape in January 1864. He {{convinced}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis of a plan <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> mass panic in the Northern states, by means of freeing prisoners and causing arson in larger Northern cities. Impressed by Hines' plan, Davis agreed to back him. Davis urged Hines to tell Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin and Secretary of War James Seddon his plan. Both men agreed to the plan, and encouraged Hines to proceed, with the only hesitation by Davis, Benjamin and Sheldon being the effect on public opinion on such a plan, including what Great Britain and France would think of Hines' actions.|$|E
5|$|Holmboe {{published}} his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E

50|$|People not deemed {{sufficiently}} {{committed to}} the communist cause were also dismissed. With these purges, the SVAG created a force that was steadfastly loyal in its politics. <b>To</b> further <b>instill</b> the correct politics into Volkspolizei officers, the Main Administration of Training was established in 1949. These training courses were run by communist heroes such as Spanish Civil War veteran Wilhelm Zaisser {{and the man who}} would later become East Germany's Minister of Defence, Heinz Hoffmann.|$|R
5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role in the early church, urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold by officers. The International Crisis Group {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective chain of command, logical military formations and a credible troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, the respected former army chief, attempted <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{has established a}} military program, the , wherein fifty randomly selected classes of third-year junior {{high school students are}} kidnapped, dropped into a remote location, and forced to kill one another until only one student of each class remains. Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.|$|E

5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of virtue in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines virtue in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, virtue was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that virtue should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|Augustine flees {{back to the}} D.U.P. headquarters. Delsin tracks Hank down to the docks, {{where he}} is fleeing from D.U.P. forces. Hank begs for forgiveness, saying that he only worked with Augustine because she {{threatened}} to hurt his daughter. Delsin can choose to either kill Hank, or let him escape Seattle with his daughter. Aided by Fetch and Eugene, Delsin rallies {{an assault on the}} D.U.P. headquarters. After breaking through the building's defenses, Delsin confronts Augustine and reveals to her that he has figured out she staged the Conduit escape at Akomish <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> fear in the population and give the D.U.P. a reason to continue their regime. Augustine lets Delsin absorb her powers, and tells him that she wants to save the Conduits by imprisoning and protecting them from the population. Delsin battles and eventually defeats Augustine with his new concrete powers.|$|E
5|$|Hill and his {{brothers}} {{had taken over the}} management of their father's school in Birmingham in 1819, which opened a branch at Bruce Castle in 1827, with Rowland Hill as Headmaster. The school was run along radical lines inspired by Hill's friends Thomas Paine, Richard Price and Joseph Priestley; all teaching was on the principle that the teacher's role is <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> the desire to learn, not to impart facts, corporal punishment was abolished and alleged transgressions were tried by a court of pupils, while the school taught a radical (for the time) curriculum including foreign languages, science and engineering. Among other pupils, the school taught the sons of many London-based diplomats, particularly from the newly independent nations of South America, and the sons of computing pioneer Charles Babbage.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, the {{gendarmerie}} was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti {{and became}} the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had {{a long tradition of}} military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avrill also contends the gendarmerie worked <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> a respect for political neutrality in its men.|$|E
5|$|On February 1, 1985, Disney {{executives}} {{moved the}} animation division from the Disney studio lot in Burbank {{to a variety}} of warehouses, hangars, and trailers located about two miles east (3.2 kilometers) in nearby Glendale, California. The animation division's first feature animation at its new location was The Great Mouse Detective (1986), begun by John Musker and Ron Clements as Basil of Baker Street after both left production of The Black Cauldron. The film was enough of a critical and commercial success <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> executive confidence in the animation studio. Later the same year, however, Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment released Don Bluth's An American Tail, which outgrossed The Great Mouse Detective at the box office and became the highest-grossing first-issue animated film to that point.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} roams Pacific City, {{systematically}} eliminating the leaders and subordinates {{of the three}} gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place <b>to</b> <b>instill</b> fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for the Agency to control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the Agency will replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E

50|$|Established with a {{gift from}} L. William Krause '64, the Krause Center for Leadership and Ethics offers symposiums, classes and {{training}} seminars <b>to</b> help <b>instill</b> the principles of leadership, ethics, morals and service. A minor in leadership studies is also sponsored through this program. Training is conducted each year for freshmen and sophomores on honor and ethics.

40|$|Teachers of {{literacy}} have two major goals; {{to help their}} students become able readers and <b>to</b> help <b>instill</b> in their students the desire to read. This article reports a one year study in a fourth grade classroom to help students in both areas. The reading program in this fourth grade classroom included silent reading time, choices of reading materials, sharing of literature, and appropriate adult modeling of reading. Results included increases in reading rates, comprehension, vocabulary, and amount of reading accomplished by the students. Recommendations for teachers are provided based on findings of the study...|$|R
5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to {{liquidate}} the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. <b>To</b> <b>instill</b> public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis and DeMar playtested {{the game}} themselves, and {{continually}} tweaked the designs {{as the project}} progressed. Though games at the time began to use scrolling to have larger levels, the developers chose a single screen to confine the action. <b>To</b> <b>instill</b> panic in the player, the character was initially placed {{in the center of}} the game's action, and had to deal with projectiles coming from multiple directions, as opposed previous shooting games such as Space Invaders and Galaxian, where the enemies attacked from a single direction. This made for more challenging gameplay, an aspect Jarvis took pride in. Enemies were assigned to stages in different groups to create themes. Early stages were designed to be relatively simple compared to later ones. The level of difficulty was designed to increase quickly so players would struggle to complete later stages. In retrospect, Jarvis attributes his and DeMar's average player skills to the game's balanced design. Though they made the game as difficult as they could, the high end of their skills ended up being a good challenge for expert players. The graphics were given a simple appearance to avoid a cluttered game screen, and object designs were made distinct from each other to avoid confusion. Black was chosen as the background color to help characters stand out and reduce clutter.|$|E
