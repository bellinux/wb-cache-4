5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> out of the station before the lift hill and <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal style {{was also a}} knowing collage. There was a certain moment in the '90s when, if you were headed downtown and <b>turned</b> <b>left,</b> every girl looked like Bettie Page. But {{they did not do}} what Winehouse did, mixing Bettie Page with Brigitte Bardot and adding that little bit of Ronnie Spector.|$|E
5|$|The French infantry—mostly Gascons—had {{meanwhile}} {{started down}} the slope towards Sanseverino. Montluc, noting that the disorder of the Italians had forced them to a standstill, suggested that De Tais attack Madruzzo's advancing column of landsknechte instead; this advice was accepted, and the French formation <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> {{in an attempt to}} strike the landsknechte in the flank. Madruzzo responded by splitting his column into two separate portions, one of which moved to intercept the French while the other continued up the slope towards the Swiss waiting at the crest.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February, over 50,000 {{participated in}} the {{funerals}} of crackdown victims. One was held in Al Daih, another in Karzakan. The largest however, was in Sitra. At about 4:46 in the afternoon, about a thousand protesters, most of them young men who participated in Al Daih funeral of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima marched toward Manama, defying the government ban on gatherings. By 5:18 they had reached a road junction; to the right was Salmaniya hospital {{and to the left}} Pearl Roundabout. They <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> after a short pause. On their way, they clashed with riot police who withdrew from the site. Protesters continued their march removing barriers set by police a day ago.|$|E
5|$|The Light Division, {{based at}} Vught, {{was the only}} {{manoeuvre}} force the Dutch Army possessed. Its planned withdrawal had been similarly executed a day early. Its regiments had biked over the Maas and Waal bridges and then <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> through the Alblasserwaard when it was decided in the afternoon to let it counterattack the German airborne landing on IJsselmonde. It reached the Noord, the river separating the Alblasserwaard from IJsselmonde, in the evening. There they discovered that the sector near the only bridge, built in 1939, was not strongly occupied by the airborne troops, as the Germans simply had not known of its existence because of outdated maps. It was decided to postpone a crossing until the next day, to gather sufficient forces. No {{attempt was made to}} establish a bridgehead.|$|E

It <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> onto Changu Road and followed Dongge Road up to the Guangxi People's Hall, which was around the 8km mark.

5|$|The All Blacks' first-half {{play was}} {{generally}} considered poor—with aimless kicking to Welsh fullback Winfield who returned much better kicks into touch. The first ten minutes saw New Zealand's Roberts break the line twice only, {{to be caught}} by Winfield without support. Eventually Wales had a scrum-feed 25 yards out from the All Blacks' try-line. From this Wales executed a planned move—Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right to Bush. He then <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> and passed to Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then passed to Gabe, who passed to Bush, who eventually passed to Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion—leaving the score at 3–0. In {{the final stages of}} the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two minutes early, and Wallace that it was three minutes early.|$|E

US 52 then turned right onto West Street (from West Street, it <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> onto Maryland Street). U.S. 52 <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> on either Indiana Avenue or 16th Street (US 136). Eventually, U.S. 52 would overlap U.S. 136 on 16th Street. It then turned right onto Lafayette Road, which became Indianapolis Road when {{reaching}} Zionsville. When I-65 was completed through Downtown Indianapolis, U.S. 52 got on I-65 from the Lafayette Road interchange, and traveled on I-65 {{the rest of}} the way.

25|$|Emperor Napoleon I plotted {{to replace}} the royal family of the Kingdom of Spain. Pursuant to his design, he ordered several key points, {{including}} Barcelona, to be seized in February 1808. On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's Imperial French troops were marching through Barcelona, ostensibly to help fight Portugal. Lechi staged a military review, {{but it was a}} cover for gaining control of the citadel. As the soldiers marched past the main gate of the fortress, they suddenly <b>turned</b> <b>left</b> and rushed inside. Without spilling a drop of blood, the Imperial troops herded the baffled Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other key points, the French also grabbed San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras. On 2 May 1808, the infuriated Spanish people rose in rebellion against their French occupiers.|$|E
5000|$|The ride {{begins with}} the train leaving the station passing under a walkway, going down a small hill and <b>turning</b> <b>left</b> into the {{enclosed}} transfer track area.
