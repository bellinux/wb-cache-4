500|$|Iodine monofluoride (IF) is {{unstable}} at {{room temperature}} and disproportionates very readily and irreversibly to iodine and iodine pentafluoride, and thus cannot be obtained pure. It can be synthesised from the reaction of iodine with fluorine gas in trichlorofluoromethane at −45°C, with iodine trifluoride in trichlorofluoromethane at −78°C, or with silver(I) fluoride at 0°C. Iodine monochloride (ICl) and iodine monobromide (IBr), on the other hand, are moderately stable. The former, a volatile red-brown compound, was discovered independently by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Humphry Davy in 1813–4 {{not long after the}} discoveries of chlorine and iodine, and it mimics the intermediate halogen bromine so well that Justus von Liebig was misled into mistaking bromine (which he had found) for iodine monochloride. Iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide may be prepared simply by reacting iodine with chlorine or bromine {{at room temperature}} and purified by fractional crystallisation. Both are quite reactive and attack even platinum and gold, though not boron, carbon, cadmium, lead, zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, and tungsten. Their reaction with organic compounds depends on conditions. Iodine chloride vapour tends to chlorinate phenol and salicyclic acid, since when iodine chloride undergoes homolytic dissociation, chlorine and iodine are produced and the former is more reactive. However, iodine chloride in <b>tetrachloromethane</b> solution results in iodination being the main reaction, since now heterolytic fission of the I–Cl bond occurs and I+ attacks phenol as an electrophile. However, iodine monobromide tends to brominate phenol even in <b>tetrachloromethane</b> solution because it tends to dissociate into its elements in solution, and bromine is more reactive than iodine. When liquid, iodine monochloride and iodine monobromide dissociate into [...] and [...] anions (X = Cl, Br); thus they are significant conductors of electricity and can be used as ionising solvents.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogen bromide {{prepared}} by the above methods can be contaminated with Br2, which can be removed by passing the gas through a solution of phenol at room temperature in <b>tetrachloromethane</b> or other suitable solvent (producing 2,4,6-Tribromophenol and generating more HBr in the process) or through copper turnings or copper gauze at high temperature.|$|E

50|$|The {{reaction}} proceeds by {{a thermal}} reaction or pyrolysis (above 200 °C) forming a short-lived and very reactive para-benzyne biradical species.

When quenched by <b>tetrachloromethane</b> the reaction product is a 1,4-dichlorobenzene and with methanol the reaction product is benzyl alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Before {{they became}} {{strictly}} regulated, {{the general public}} often encountered haloalkanes as paint and cleaning solvents such as trichloroethane (1,1,1-trichloroethane) and carbon tetrachloride (<b>tetrachloromethane),</b> pesticides like 1,2-dibromoethane (EDB, ethylene dibromide), and refrigerants like Freon-22 (duPont trademark for chlorodifluoromethane). Some haloalkanes are still widely used for industrial cleaning, such as methylene chloride (dichloromethane), and as refrigerants, such as R-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane).|$|E
50|$|Often {{molecules}} contain dipolar groups, {{but have}} no overall dipole moment. This occurs if there is symmetry within the molecule that causes the dipoles to cancel each other out.

50|$|The {{chlorinated}} hydrocarbons produced via photochlorination are often only industrial intermediates and react {{with a large}} number of basic chemicals to secondary products such as alcohols, mercaptans, amines and carboxylic acids.

Chlorinated hydrocarbons are also used as intermediates in the chemical industry for the production of silicones or detergents.|$|E
50|$|The {{switch from}} solid to hollow pits caused a work safety issue; the larger surface-to-mass ratio led to {{comparatively}} higher emission of gamma rays and necessitated {{the installation of}} better radiation shielding in the Rocky Flats production facility.

50|$|The {{synthesis}} of 2,2-diethoxytetrahydrofuran via γ-butyrolactone and the Meerwein salt triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate in diethyl ether was first described by Hans Meerwein and co-workers. In the reaction the electrophilic ethyl cation attackes the carbonyl oxygen and forms the stable but extraordinarily hygroscopic O-ethyl-γ-butyrolactonium tetrafluoroborate (melting point 42 °C). The compound dissolves in dichloromethane, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane but is insoluble in diethyl ether, benzene and <b>tetrachloromethane.</b> The onium salt reacts practically quantitatively with an ethanolate anion from sodium ethoxide in ethanol forming 2,2-diethoxytetrahydrofuran.|$|E

50|$|PETN is {{practically}} {{insoluble in water}} (0.01 g/100 ml at 50 °C), weakly soluble in common nonpolar solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons (like gasoline) or <b>tetrachloromethane,</b> but soluble in some other organic solvents, particularly in acetone (about 15 g/100 g of the solution at 20 °C, 55 g/100 g at 60 °C) and dimethylformamide (40 g/100 g of the solution at 40 °C, 70 g/100 g at 70 °C). PETN forms eutectic mixtures with some liquid or molten aromatic nitro compounds, e.g. trinitrotoluene (TNT) or tetryl. Due to its highly symmetrical structure, PETN is resistant to attack by many chemical reagents; it does not hydrolyze in water at room temperature or in weaker alkaline aqueous solutions. Water at 100 °C or above causes hydrolysis to dinitrate; presence of 0.1% nitric acid accelerates the reaction.|$|E
40|$|Metabolism of <b>tetrachloromethane</b> (carbon tetrachloride) by liver microsomal {{fraction}} under {{anaerobic conditions}} and in vivo leads to covalent binding of trichloromethyl radicals to lipids. The resulting covalently modified lipids contain {{two different types}} of fatty acids: a group of monomeric trichloromethyl fatty acid residues, usually with one double bond less than the precursor fatty acids, and a group of fatty acids that are not sufficiently volatile for gas chromatography. The liquid-chromatographic properties of the latter indicate high molecular mass, presumably due to cross-linking. The chemical structures of the monomeric fatty acids were elucidated, and these support the view that the most significant reactive metabolite of <b>tetrachloromethane</b> is the trichloromethyl radical. The isomer patterns of the monomeric trichloromethyl fatty acids in vitro and in vivo are almost identical, which shows that anaerobic incubation of <b>tetrachloromethane</b> with microsomal fraction very well reflects the processes involved in hepatotoxicity of <b>tetrachloromethane</b> in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Five {{anaerobic}} bacteria {{were tested}} for {{their abilities to}} transform <b>tetrachloromethane</b> so that information about enzymes involved in reductive dehalogenations of polychloromethanes could be obtained. Cultures of the sulfate reducer Desulfobacterium autotrophicum transformed some 80 microM <b>tetrachloromethane</b> to trichloromethane and {{a small amount of}} dichloromethane in 18 days under conditions of heterotrophic growth. The acetogens Acetobacterium woodii and Clostridium thermoaceticum in fructose-salts and glucose-salts media, respectively, degraded some 80 microM <b>tetrachloromethane</b> completely within 3 days. Trichloromethane accumulated as a transient intermediate, but the only chlorinated methanes recovered {{at the end of the}} incubation were 8 microM dichloromethane and traces of chloromethane. Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and an autotrophic, nitrate-reducing bacterium were unable to transform <b>tetrachloromethane.</b> Reduction of chlorinated methanes was thus observed only in the organisms with the acetyl-coenzyme A pathway. Experiments with [14 C]tetrachloromethane were done to determine the fate of this compound in the acetogen A. woodii. Radioactivity in an 11 -day heterotrophic culture was largely (67 %) recovered in CO 2, acetate, pyruvate, and cell material. In experiments with cell suspensions to which [14 C]tetrachloromethane was added, 14 CO 2 appeared within 20 s as the major transformation product. A. woodii thus catalyzes reductive dechlorinations and transforms <b>tetrachloromethane</b> to CO 2 by a series of unknown reactions...|$|E
