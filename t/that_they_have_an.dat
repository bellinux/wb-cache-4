5|$|The {{volcanic}} rocks {{which make}} {{up some of the}} seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain are unusual in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> acid-neutralizing chemical substance like typical ocean-island basalts but a low percentage of strontium as found at mid-ocean ridge basalts. However, the strontium-bearing volcanic rocks comprising Bowie Seamount also contain lead. Therefore, the magma mixtures that formed Bowie Seamount seem to have originated from varying degrees of partial melting of a depleted source in the Earth's mantle and basalts which had distinctly high lead isotopic ratios. Estimates during geological studies indicate that the abundance of the depleted-source component ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the erupted material.|$|E

When a substance abuser admits <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem, this is more likely to occur in the bargaining stage.

25|$|Each {{receiver}} must {{be connected}} to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If {{this is not an}} option, the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.|$|E
25|$|Sturm–Liouville {{theory is}} a theory of a special type of second order linear {{ordinary}} differential equations. Their solutions are based on eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of linear operators {{defined in terms of}} second-order homogeneous linear equations. The problems are identified as Sturm-Liouville Problems (SLP) and are named after J.C.F. Sturm and J. Liouville, who studied such problems in the mid-1800s. The interesting fact about regular SLPs is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> infinite number of eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenfunctions form a complete, orthogonal set, which makes orthogonal expansions possible. This is a key idea in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. SLPs are also useful in the analysis of certain partial differential equations.|$|E
25|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} occurs {{frequently}} in Western society, although {{the rate of}} prevalence {{can be difficult to}} determine. Research in North America has concluded that approximately 15% to 25% of women and 5% to 15% of men were sexually abused when they were children. In the UK, a 2010 study estimated prevalence at about 5% for boys and 18% for girls (not dissimilar to a 1985 study that estimated about 8% for boys and 12% for girls). More than 23,000 incidents were recorded by the UK police between 2009 and 2010. Girls were six {{times more likely to be}} assaulted than boys with 86% of attacks taking place against them. Barnardo's charity estimates that two thirds of victims in the United Kingdom are girls and 1 third boys. Barnardo's is concerned that boy victims may be overlooked.

500|$|The {{home range}} of the Namib Desert Horse reaches north in the Namib Desert to the Koichab River, usually dry, and west to the Great Escarpment. Bands of horses range together, {{consisting}} of as few as two animals, although there are generally more. In observations between 1993 and 2003, between six and eleven bands were identified, including a mixture of bachelor herds, breeding groups and co-operating stallion groups (groups {{with more than one}} stallion that share breeding duties). The Namib Desert Horse travels extensively, searching for food, water and shelter from the climate and insects. A 1994 study found <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> average home range of , although not all of that is traversed each day.

In 1941, in a shallow channel between Chincoteague Island and Cape Charles, Virginia, several large bluntnose stingrays were observed repeatedly breaking the surface and swimming rapidly in straight lines, some with their tails thrashing in the air; others were seen rising slowly {{to the surface and}} [...] "hanging" [...] for several minutes. One of the rays was hooked and the shock of capture caused it to release five near-term fetuses, suggesting that this activity may have been related to parturition. The aborted young were pale with small yolk sacs, and a swelling in the place of their tail spines. Females begin ovulating a new batch of eggs immediately after giving birth, indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> annual reproductive cycle.

UN General Assembly Resolution 194 supports this argument, and resolved that Israel should permit [...] "refugees wishing {{to return to their homes}} and live at peace with their neighbors" [...] to do so.

2500|$|Women have an {{obligation}} to hear the Megillah because [...] "they also were involved in that miracle." [...] Most Orthodox communities, including Modern Orthodox ones, however, generally do not allow women to lead the Megillah reading except in rare circumstances owing to the notion of [...] "Kavod HaTzibbur" [...] ("respect for the community"). Rabbinic authorities who hold that women should not read the Megillah for themselves, because of an uncertainty as to which blessing they should recite upon the reading, nonetheless agree <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> obligation to hear it read. According to these authorities if women, or men for that matter, cannot attend the services in the synagogue, the Megillah should be read for them in private by any male over the age of thirteen. Often in Orthodox communities there is a special public reading only for women, conducted either in a private home or in a synagogue, but the Megillah is read by a man.|$|E
