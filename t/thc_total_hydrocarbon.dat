40|$|Abstract: To {{measure the}} traffic {{pollutants}} with high {{temporal and spatial}} resolution under real conditions a mobile emission laboratory (MEL) was designed and built in KIST with close-cooperation with KIMM and Yonsei university. The equipment of the mini-van provides gas phase measurements of CO, NOx, CO 2, <b>THC</b> (<b>Total</b> <b>hydrocarbon)</b> and number density & size distribution measurements of fine and ultra-fine particles by a fast mobility particle sizer (FMPS) and a condensation particle counter (CPC). The inlet sampling port above the bumper enables the chasing of different type of vehicles. This paper introduces the construction and technical details of the MEL and presents data from the car chasing experiment of diesel and CNG city bus. The dilution ratio was increased rapidly according to the chasing distance. Most particles from the diesel city bus were counted under 300 nm and the peak concentration of the particles was located between 40 - 60 nm.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{combustion}} and emission characteristics under various equivalence ratio up to stoichiometric condition were experimentally investigated in a Cl (compression ignition) engine. In order {{to control the}} equivalence ratio, the O- 2 mole fraction of intake gas was reduced from 21 to 11. 16 % by adding only N- 2 to intake gas while the injected fuel quantity was held constant. The test was used a single-cylinder compression ignition (Cl) engine with a displacement volume of 373. 3 cc, a compression ratio of 17. 8, a re-entrant type piston-bowl. The emission measurement instruments consisted of emission bench (MEXA- 9100 D, HORIBA) and smoke meter (AVL- 415 S, AVL). In the result, the maximum IMEP (indicated mean effective pressure) and fuel conversion efficiency gradually decreased when the equivalence ratio was richer. In particular, the stoichiometric condition (i. e. 1. 0 equivalence ratio) had around 15 % and 11 % losses, respectively. The stoichiometric diesel combustion had a positive ignition dwell over the whole operating condition, leading to {{a large amount of}} <b>THC</b> (<b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons)</b> and CO emission.

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental TechnologyTreatment of {{municipal}} wastewater produces {{large quantities of}} sludge that represents a cost for the individual wastewater treatment plant. Proper sludge treatment enables reuse of sludge, possibly as fertilizers. Fertilizer application of sludge is desirable since it improves the organic material reconstitution of the soil and implies recycling of nutrients. Negative aspects of sludge reuse are accumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the sludge, and fertilizers based on sludge can therefore {{be a source of}} pollution. At present, there are only regulations regarding heavy metals (HMs) for sludge reuse in Norway, however, more stringent requirements is inevitable as the European Union {{is currently working on a}} document on sludge and sludge utilization where maximum levels of other pollutants in fertilizers, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), will be determined. In this thesis, fate of POPs during the processes leading to bio pellets production at the municipal wastewater treatment plant Sentralrenseanlegg Nord-Jæren (SNJ) was examined. Fate of POPs and HMs in anaerobic digesters was determined based on modeling of PAH’s partitioning between sludge particles and water phase using the software AQUASIM. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the distribution of POPs and HMs in the processes of centrifugation and drying. Analyses of samples of spiked sludge, dewatered sludge, reject water, and dried sludge were done externally by Eurofins. Modeling of partitioning of PAHs between sludge and surrounding aqueous phase showed an approxumate setting of equilibrium within the first 10 hours after which almost all of the PAHs were found sorbed to the sludge.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the first year's effort towards a 3 -year program to develop micropilot ignition systems for existing pipeline compressor engines. In essence, all Phase I {{goals and objectives}} were met. We intend {{to proceed with the}} Phase II research plan, as set forth by the applicable Research Management Plan. The objective for Phase I was to demonstrate the feasibility of micropilot ignition for large bore, slow speed engines operating at low compression ratios. The primary elements of Micropilot Phase I were to develop a single-cylinder test chamber to study the injection of pilot fuel into a combustion cylinder and to develop, install and test a multi-cylinder micropilot ignition system for a 4 -cylinder, natural gas test engine. In all, there were twelve (12) tasks defined and executed to support these two (2) primarily elements in a stepwise fashion. Task-specific approaches and results are documented in this report. Research activities for Micropilot Phase I were conducted with the understanding that the efforts are expected to result in a commercial product to capture and disseminate the efficiency and environmental benefits of this new technology. An extensive state-of-art review was conducted to leverage the existing body of knowledge of micropilot ignition with respect to retrofit applications. Additionally, commercially-available fuel injection products were identified and applied to the program where appropriate. This approach will minimize the overall time-to-market requirements, while meeting performance and cost criteria. The four-cylinder prototype data was encouraging for the micro-pilot ignition technology when compared to spark ignition. Initial testing results showed: (1) Brake specific fuel consumption of natural gas was improved from standard spark ignition across the map, 1 % at full load and 5 % at 70 % load. (2) 0 % misfires for all points on micropilot ignition. Fuel savings were most likely due to this percent misfire improvement. (3) <b>THC</b> (<b>Total</b> <b>Hydrocarbon)</b> emissions were improved significantly at light load, 38 % at 70 % load. (4) VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions were improved above 80 % load. (5) Coefficient of Variance for the IMEP (Indicated Mean Effective Pressure) was significantly less at lower loads, 76 % less at 70 %. These preliminary results will be substantiated and enhanced during Phase II of the Micropilot Ignition program...|$|E

40|$|Emissions {{testing in}} the {{laboratory}} forms {{an essential part of}} the European type approval procedure for light-duty vehicles. The approach yields reproducible and comparable results and provides clear design criteria for vehicles that have to comply with applicable emission limits. Although emission limits have become increasingly stringent in the past decade, road transport remains the most important source of urban air pollution with respect to nitrogen oxides (NOX) and carbon monoxide in Europe. Several studies have indicated that in particular on-road nitrogen oxide emissions of light-duty diesel vehicles might substantially exceed emission levels as identified in the laboratory. Here, we address this problem by using Portable Emission Measurement Systems (PEMS) to analyze the on-road emissions of 12 light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles on four test routes, representing rural, urban, uphill/downhill, and motorway driving. The results indicate that average NOX emissions of diesel vehicles (0. 93 ± 0. 39 g/km), including Euro 5 diesel vehicles (0. 62 ± 0. 19 g/km), substantially exceed the respective emission limits. The observed deviations range from a factor of 4 - 7 for NOX emission averages over entire test routes up to a factor of 14 for NOX emissions of individual averaging windows. By comparison, on-road NOX emissions of gasoline vehicles as well as CO (carbon monoxide) and <b>THC</b> (<b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon)</b> emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles generally stay within Euro 3 - 5 emission limits. The tested light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles emit during on-road testing on average 189 ± 51 g CO 2 /km (grams carbon dioxide per kilometre) and 162 ± 29 g CO 2 /km, respectively, thereby exceeding the CO 2 emissions as specified during laboratory testing by on average 21 ± 9 %. The cold-start emissions of both diesel and gasoline vehicles span over a large value range; NOX emissions exceed Euro 3 - 5 emission limits by a factor 2 - 14, CO emissions often exceed emission limits, and THC emissions are both below and above Euro 3 - 5 emission limits, respectively. The PEMS equipment is reliable and provides accurate emission measurements. PEMS are able to verify the proper operation of emission control technologies under a wide variety of normal operating conditions as well as test emissions from novel fuel/engine/after-treatment/powertrain technologies (e. g., parallel/serial (plug-in) hybrid vehicles. The PEMS procedure for light-duty vehicles is, however, relatively new and requires further refinement before being applied at large scale. The findings of this report indicate that the current laboratory emissions testing fails to capture the wide range of potential on-road emissions. A promising remedy for this problem may be attained by supplementing the laboratory test with complementary emission test procedures such as PEMS on-road testing. This report provides a first step into that direction, thereby contributing to a more comprehensive EU policy that assures compliance of light-duty vehicles with emission limits under normal conditions of use.

The source apportionment techniques employed in this study include correlation matrix of logarithmic transformed chemical species concentrations and wind field data to derive source-wind direction relationships and an advanced algorithm called positive matrix factorization (PMF) in receptor modeling for identification of RSP sources subject to a rigorous approach to eliminate rotation ambiguity. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used in the wind sector analysis RSP in Hong Kong. The species analyzed in this study were Al, Ca, Mg, Pb, Naplus, V, Clminus, NH 4 +, NO 3 minus, SO 42 minus, Brminus, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, EC (elemental carbon), <b>THC</b> (<b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon),</b> Cd, Kplus, Ba, Cu, As, and Be. The study aimed to develop a relationship between the sources and wind characteristics using a purely statistical analysis of the particulate database. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test shows that the 24 -hour cumulative wind speed from all directions and the mass concentrations of some chemical species follow lognormal distributions. Logarithmic transformed species concentrations and 'wind speeds were used as inputs to minimize the effect of fluctuation of wind direction due to local topography under low wind speed conditions. The four sources identified by filtered matrix were marine, crustal, "non-ferrous smelters" and fuel oil burning sources. Marine aerosols were found to be predominately associated with southeastern winds. Nevertheless, they were also -xi- correlated with some localized coastal northwesterly winds. Crustal particulates were mostly locally driven such as reclamation, large-scale construction activities or soil erosion. Although found in some residential/commercial areas, aerosols derived from non-ferrous smelters and fuel oil burning were mostly identified in a major industrial area in Hong Kong. EC, NH 4 plus, NO 3 minus and SO 42 minus are found to be independent of wind directions and are ubiquitously present in Hong Kong as "background species". PMF was used to identify the sources of RSP in Hong Kong. The compositional data obtained from the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department from 1992 to 1994 were analyzed. The species analyzed in this study are Al, Ca, Mg, Pb, Naplus, V, Clminus, NH 4 plus, SO 42 minus, Brminus, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Cd, Kplus, Ba, Cu, and As. Unlike the conventional receptor modeling algorithm, Factor Analysis (FA), PMF only generates non-negative source profiles. To eliminate sulfate from such factors where it is not physically plausible, special penalty terms were included in the model so that sulfate concentrations could be selectively decreased in specified factors. A 9 -factor model containing non-zero sulfate concentrations in three factors gives the most satisfactory source profiles. Ammonium sulfate, chloride depleted marine aerosols and crustal aerosols are the three non-zero sulfate sources. Other factors are marine aerosols, non-ferrous smelters, particulate copper, fuel oil burning, vehicular emission and bromide/road dust. The last two sources can be combined as a single source of vehicle/road dust. The 'compositional profiles of these factors were also developed. The mass profiles obtained can be improved by further refinement of distribution of sulfate in the sources...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{levels of}} {{petroleum}} hydrocarbons and some heavy metals in the tissues of Tympanotomus fuscatus periwinkle from Warri River of Niger Delta area were investigated. Six hundred samples of periwinkles collected fortnightly {{for a period}} of six months from three stations (Jala.

The mean levels of <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> varied from 0. 0045 mg/g to 0. 093 mg/g and mean lead (Pb) levels varied from 0. 0023 ppm to 0. 046 ppm. Mercury (Hg) and Cadmium (Cd) were below the instrument detection limit of < 0. 001 ppm in all three stations. The levels of <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> at Jala and Ubeji were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than at Suoroagbene, the control station. The level of lead at Suoroagbene was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) than at Jala and Ubeji. The higher levels of <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and lead in tissues of periwinkles from Jala and Ubeji were attributed to more industrial activities and close proximity of the stations to the major road where emission from automobiles abound more than Suoroagbene, which is purely a residential area.

40|$|CO 2 and {{hydrocarbon}} fluxes from a {{sitka spruce}} forest were measured using a conditional sampling method, The method {{was used in}} two ways: (1) an automated system was used to monitor continuously the mixing ratio difference of <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> and CO 2 in sampling lines for updraught and downdraught air and (2) conditionally sampled updraught and downdraught air was passed through adsorption tubes, which subsequently were analyzed in the laboratory, to determine the fluxes of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), Aerodynamic gradient measurements of NMHC fluxes were made over the same period. Method (1) produced a high temporal resolution data set of approximately 4 days of near-continuous fluxes. Marked diurnal trends in CO 2 flux were evident. Peak daylight photosynthetic fluxes ranged from - 30 to - 90 mmol m(- 2) h(- 1). Smaller fluxes were noted during heavy rainfall and diminished photosynthetically active radiation, Nighttime respiration ranged from 0 to 10 mmol m(- 2) h(- 1). <b>Total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> fluxes were 3 orders of magnitude smaller. During hot, sunny conditions a <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> flux of approximately 400 mu mol m(- 2) h(- 1) (CH 4 equivalents) was observed, Fluxes of specific NMHC compounds, from method (2), ranged between 90 and 563 mu g m(- 2) hour(- 1). The annual carbon flux to Great Britain's conifer forests {{was estimated to be}} 1. 3 Mt using a simple upscaling model based on the observations of CO 2 flux during the field experiment...|$|R

The porosity, water saturation, and net pay raw datasets for six wells enclosed within the studied area are thoroughly examined and fed to the deterministic and probabilistic calculation algorithms and the results are compared. In order to include the probable effects of the uncertainties associated with reservoir characterization, two distinct methodologies are developed and incorporated in both types of the calculation processes. In the first methodology, <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> volume is calculated in one stage, while in another, hydrocarbon volume estimation have been carried out separately in each producing layer; then, summing them to estimate <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> volume.

40|$|Landfarming {{bioremediation}} {{was performed}} over 2 years on soil heavily polluted with weathered oil and oil derivatives: 23200 mg kg- 1 of mineral oil, 35300 mg kg- 1 <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbons,</b> and 8. 65 mg kg- 1 of total PAHs. During the experiment, mineral oil, <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> and PAH concentrations decreased by approximately 53 %, 27 % and 72 %, respectively. A GC/MS-Scan {{was used to}} identify the crude oil components that persist after bioremediation treatment of contaminated soil and the metabolites generated during this process. The data shows that in weathered-hydrocarbons contaminated soil, the number of initially detected compounds after the bioremediation process further decreased over a 2 year period, {{and at the same}} time several new compounds were observed at the end of experiment. Higher persistence was also shown for heavier n-alkanes and branched alkanes, which could be detected over a longer period of time. The analysis highlights the importance of n-alkanes, their substituted derivatives and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as the most significant pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Biodegradation of {{petroleum}} hydrocarbons {{was investigated in}} contaminated soil surrounding Tehran Oil refining Co. Tehran, Iran. During the experiment which took 10 weeks, nitrogen and phosphorus amounts, <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> utilizing bacteria (THUB), total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) and <b>total</b> petroleum <b>hydrocarbons</b> (TPHs) were specified. Also trend in TPHs removal and microbial population were studied. Results indicated that, after 10 weeks TPH level reduced from 25073. 3 mg kg- 1 to 7173. 10 mg kg- 1. The nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations also decreased during degradation. But the <b>total</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> utilizing bacteria increased from 4. 1 × 104 to 11. 9 × 104 cfu g- 1 {{at the end of}} 6 th week and finally reduced to 6. 5 × 104 cfu g- 1 at the end of experiment, while the THB reduced from 2. 7 × 108 to 0. 001 × 108 cfu g- 1. In studied soils TPHs significantly has positive correlation with N and P and THB count and negative correlation with THUB. The low microbial correlation shows that a part of the hydrocarbon loss due to natural attenuation probably had to be attributed to abiotic processes. To conclusion, we demonstrated that a significant reduction in the level {{of one of the most}} common pollutants, petroleum waste, can be achieved even under unfavorable conditions...|$|R
