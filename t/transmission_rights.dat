40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} multidimensional financial <b>transmission</b> <b>right</b> (MDFTR) which is a generalized group financial <b>transmission</b> <b>right</b> (FTR) concept. An MDFTR allows its owner to hold a total FTR amount over a path group along with multiple choices to distribute this grouped amount among the individual grouping paths. This added flexibility provides forward-market participants with a useful support to overcome the congestion price risk that originates from the uncertainty in their transaction paths. All the. fundamental issues regarding the implementation of MDFTRs are addressed in detail in this paper. The practical utility of MDFTRs is judged by analyzing their costs. It is shown with illustration that an MDFTR may be more cost-effective than any given portfolio of individual FTRs that {{has the ability to}} give the same risk-hedging benefit...|$|R

25|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model advocates that the spectrum resources {{should be treated}} like land, i.e. private ownership of spectrum portions should be permitted.

Alternatively, the spectrum owners would be able to use their bands in any way they want through any technology they prefer (service and technology neutrality). Although the spectrum property rights model advocates exclusive allocation of <b>transmission</b> <b>rights,</b> it {{is not the same as}} a licensed regime. The main difference is the service and technology neutrality advocated in the spectrum property rights approach, as opposed to strict requirements on services and communications technologies inherent in licensed governance regimes.|$|E

Season three was released on Blu-ray on June 3, 2008. Seasons one to three on Blu-ray are multi-region discs; however, season four has been region-locked to region A only.

50|$|The {{transmission}} tower seen on {{the bank}} of the lake was the 1938 creation of journalist Jacques Tremoulet and radio manufacturer Leon Kierkowsky, to operate a radio station Radio Andorra from Andorra amidst controversy over <b>transmission</b> <b>rights.</b> This antenna tower was erected over 400 ft pylons. Its foundation was not based on rocks but on copper-bound and earth-filled piers. The radio station from which they transmitted music programmes at 60,000 watts of power is located in the valley below the lake to reach listeners not only in Andorra but also England, Italy and France. After transmission started on August 7, 1939, there was a series of controversies over the <b>transmission</b> <b>rights</b> accorded to the radio station. It was shut down on 9 April 1981.
