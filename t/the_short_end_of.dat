50|$|Counterweight trebuchets are {{powered by}} gravity; {{potential}} energy is stored by slowly raising an extremely heavy weight box (typically filled with stones, sand, or lead) attached by a hinged connection to <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beam, and releasing it on command. Traction trebuchets are human powered; on command, men pull ropes attached to <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trebuchet beam. The difficulties of coordinating {{the pull of}} very many men together repeatedly and predictably makes counterweight trebuchets preferable for the larger machines, though they are more complicated to engineer.|$|R

25|$|Boyle's Law {{was perhaps}} the first {{expression}} of an equation of state. In 1662 Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury {{was added to the}} tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's Equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.|$|E
25|$|Adult seals {{more than}} one year old must be shot in the head with {{expanding}} bullets, and cannot be clubbed to death. The hakapik shall be used to ensure the animal is dead. This is done by crushing the skull of the shot adult seal with <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the hakapik, before the long spike is thrust deep into the animal's brain. The seal is then bled by making an incision from its jaw to the end of its sternum. The killing and bleeding must be done on the ice, and live animals may never be brought on board the ship. Young seals may be killed using just the hakapik, but only in the aforementioned manner, i.e., they need not be shot.|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{had a significant}} effect on the interest rates and the term structure of interest rates around the globe. In this paper we apply the GARCH-in-mean (GARCH-M) to study the effect of the {{global financial}} crisis on the term structure volatility, persistence of volatility, risk premium, and effects of the yield spread in five European markets; Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain (PIIGS). To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first such study in the field, and thus represents the main contribution of the paper to the literature. We investigate both the longer <b>end</b> and <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term structure.

25|$|The early Pacers {{came out}} on <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{two of the most}} one-sided trades in NBA history. In 1980, they traded Alex English to the Nuggets in order to reacquire former ABA star George McGinnis. McGinnis was long past his prime, and contributed very little during his two-year return. English, in contrast, went on {{to become one of the}} {{greatest}} scorers in NBA history. The next year, they traded a 1984 draft pick to the Portland Trail Blazers for center Tom Owens, who played one year for the Pacers with little impact. In 1983–84, the Pacers finished with the worst record in the Eastern Conference, which would have given the Pacers the second overall pick in the draft—the pick that the Blazers used to select Sam Bowie while Michael Jordan was still available. As a result of the Owens trade, they were left as bystanders in the midst of one of the deepest drafts in NBA history—including such future stars as Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton.|$|E

The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as [...] "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, [...] "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the table, three feet apart; a ball {{is placed on the}} top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so gently as not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand {{at the head of the}} table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{what the}} term structure {{of interest rates}} tells us about future inflation. The evidence indicates that {{the information in the}} term structure about the future path of inflation is quite different at <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term structure (maturities six months or less) than it is for maturities of nine to twelve months. For maturities of six months or less, in all the sample periods examined [...] February 1964 to December 1986, 1964 to October 1979, November 1979 to October 1982, November 1982 to December 1986 [...] the term structure provides almost no information about the future path of inflation. On the other hand at this <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the term structure, the results do indicate that the term structure of nominal interest rates contain {{a great deal of information}} about the term structure of real interest rates. This finding is quite important because it suggests that researchers can examine observable data on <b>the</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nominal term structure to provide them with information about the behavior of the real term structure. For maturities of nine and twelve months, the term structure does appear to contain information about the future path of inflation in the full sample period and in the sub-periods before October 1982. At these longer maturities, however, there does not appear to be much information in the nominal term structure about the term structure of real interest rates. The evidence in this paper suggests that some caution should be exercised in using the term structure of interest rates as a guide for assessing inflationary pressures in the economy, as is currently under consideration by the Federal Reserve. Although there is apparently significant information in the term structure about the future path of inflation for maturities greater than six months, there is no information about the future path of inflation that can be obtained from <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term structure. ...|$|R
