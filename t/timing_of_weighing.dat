40|$|The paper {{presents}} a systemic functional description of English discursive resources for representing and regulating the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social practices. Four key categories are distinguished: the time summons, which imposes timing on social activities by decree; social synchronisation, {{in which the}} <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social activities is synchronised with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> other social activities; natural synchronisation, in which the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social activities is synchronised with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> natural events; and mechanical synchronisation, in which the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> social activities is synchronised with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> artificially created events. A number of more delicate categories and other aspects <b>of</b> <b>timing</b> are discussed, together with their realisations. Two texts are analysed {{to demonstrate the utility}} of this descriptive framework for the critical discourse analysis of texts in which the management of time is a key issue...|$|R

The results of discussion with this method was enhancement <b>of</b> feedrate and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> cooling the rate wear cutter increases. Type of cutter wear that occurs is flank wear and began to grow relatively quickly then followed by a relatively slow growth to a certain cutting. The smallest edge of the cutter rate wear occurs when interaction feedrate 0. 11 mm/rev with a <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> cooling 10 minutes value is 562. 57 μm, while the largest edge of the cutter rate wear occurs when interaction feedrate 0. 15 mm/rev with a <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> cooling 20 minutes value is 958. 65 μm.

40|$|The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> river {{entry in}} the Atlantic salmon is known to depend on genetic, {{demographic}} and environmental factors, but {{little is known about}} the relative magnitude of among population and among year variation and covariation in this respect in natural state Atlantic salmon rives. To investigate this, variability in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> river entry in three historical Finnish Atlantic salmon populations were analyzed using salmon trap data collected during 1870 – 1902.

40|$|Recently, climatological studies report {{observational}} {{evidence of}} changes in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the seasons, such as earlier <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the annual cycle of surface temperature, earlier snow melt and earlier onset of the phenological spring season. Also hydrological studies report earlier timing and changes in monthly streamflows. From a water resources management perspective, {{there is a need to}} quantitatively describe the variability in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> hydrological regimes and to understand how climatic changes control the seasonal water budget of river basins. Here, the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> hydrological regimes from 1930 – 2009 was investigated in a network of 27 river gauges in Saxony/Germany through a timing measure derived by harmonic function approximation of annual periods of runoff ratio series. The timing measure proofed to be robust and equally applicable to both mainly pluvial river basins and snow melt dominated regimes. We found that the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> runoff ratio is highly variable, but markedly coherent across the basins analysed. Differences in average timing are largely explained by basin elevation. Also the magnitude of low frequent changes in the seasonal <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> streamflow and the sensitivity to the changes in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> temperature increase with basin elevation. This sensitivity is in turn related to snow storage and release, whereby snow cover dynamics in late winter explain a large part of the low- and high-frequency variability. A trend analysis based on cumulative anomalies revealed a common structural break around the year 1988. While the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> temperature shifted earlier by 4 days, accompanied by a temperature increase of 1 K, the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> runoff ratio within higher basins shifted towards occurring earlier about 1 to 3 weeks. This accelerated and distinct change indicates, that impacts of climate change on the water cycle may be strongest in higher, snow melt dominated basins...|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} is having {{a major impact on}} the {{viability}} of species. Whether a particular population will survive or go extinct will depend on its potential to adapt to new environmental conditions. In migratory birds, the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spring migration {{is one of the major}} determinants <b>of</b> the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> reproduction and as spring temperatures increase, we expect birds to return earlier to their breeding grounds. In accord with this expectation, the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spring arrival has advanced in many bird populations within the last 30 years. Yet, despite the presence of genetic variation in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> migration and fitness advantages in birds arriving early we still lack conclusive evidence for evolutionary change. One reason for this may be that weather conditions en route, particular the direction and speed of winds, have an important influence on individual migration speed. Moreover, there is strong evidence that physical condition may modify the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> departure from the wintering grounds, migration speed and ultimately the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> arrival and breeding. We also expect nestling condition and maternal effects to influence spring migration timing. Long-term population studies monitoring individual arrival in combination with experimental approaches will be needed to tease apart genetic and different environmental effects on the traits determining migration timing. This knowledge will be crucial for predicting adaptive responses <b>of</b> the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spring arrival in the future. ...|$|R

Aims To quantify the impact <b>of</b> shifts in <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> breeding on changes in Willow Warbler productivity across the UK. Methods Using records of ∼ 7000 nests from the British Trust for Ornithology Nest Record Scheme, we quantify shifts in <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> breeding and seasonal variation in productivity and <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> breeding, and explore their relative contribution to changes in overall productivity. As population trajectories vary across Britain (south-east declining, north-west stable), analyses were conducted regionally.

However, while the proportion of early-season nests has increased, the seasonal decline in productivity in the north-west has lessened, and overall (season-long) productivity is stable. In the south-east, however, the seasonal decline in productivity has strengthened and, despite the advance in <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> breeding, overall productivity has declined.

40|$|Intraluminal impedance, a nonradiological {{method for}} {{assessing}} bolus flow within the gut, may {{be suitable for}} investigating pharyngeal disorders. This study evaluated an impedance technique {{for the detection of}} pharyngeal bolus flow during swallowing. Patterns of pharyngoesophageal pressure and impedance were simultaneously recorded with videofluoroscopy in 10 healthy volunteers during swallowing of liquid, semisolid, and solid boluses. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> bolus head and tail passage recorded by fluoroscopy was correlated with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> impedance drop and recovery at each recording site. Bolus swallowing produced a drop in impedance from baseline followed by a recovery to at least 50 % <b>of</b> baseline. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the pharyngeal and esophageal impedance drop correlated with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the arrival of the bolus head. In the pharynx, the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> impedance recovery was delayed relative to the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> clearance of the bolus tail. In contrast, in the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) and proximal esophagus, the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> impedance recovery correlated well with the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> clearance of the bolus tail. Impedance-based estimates of pharyngoesophageal bolus clearance time correlated with true pharyngoesophageal bolus clearance time. Patterns of intraluminal impedance recorded in the pharynx during bolus swallowing are therefore more complex than those in the esophagus. During swallowing, mucosal contact between the tongue base and posterior pharyngeal wall prolongs the duration of pharyngeal impedance drop, leading to overestimation <b>of</b> bolus tail <b>timing.</b> Therefore, we conclude that intraluminal impedance measurement does not accurately reflect the bolus transit in the pharynx but does accurately reflect bolus transit across the UES and below.
