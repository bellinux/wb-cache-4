5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further north in the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially Quint refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by Quint <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{references}} <b>to</b> <b>harpoons</b> {{in ancient}} literature; though, in most cases, the descriptions {{do not go}} into detail. An early example from the Bible in Job 41:7: [...] "Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Saab's next {{attempt at}} anti-ship {{missiles}} to equip the Norrköping class FACs of the Swedish navy was in 1978 under the project name [...] "RB 04 Turbo", a {{development of the}} air force RB 04E missile with a turbofan engine, changed wing configuration and start rockets to take off from land. The initial proposal was rejected as inferior <b>to</b> the <b>Harpoon.</b> The project, under the leadership of Hans Ahlinder, then worked out a proposal for a missile with greater capabilities and superior performance <b>to</b> the <b>Harpoon.</b> <b>To</b> indicate that it was a new weapon the project name was changed from [...] "RB 04 Turbo" [...] to [...] "RBS-15".|$|R
50|$|Early {{engineers}} attempted <b>to</b> develop gun-fired <b>harpoons</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the}} hit rate from hand-thrown harpoons, generally with little success, as the guns {{were not very}} accurate, especially when fired from small moving whaleboats. Another problem appeared when the quarry were baleen whales, which tended to sink when killed. The idea was modernized and perfected by Norwegian Svend Foyn. He developed a swiveling steel cannon, mounted to the bow deck of his steel and steam whaling ship, improving accuracy, and lastly, attaching an exploding steel head <b>to</b> the <b>harpoon,</b> filled with 500g of black powder. While by no means instantaneous, the whale's death would be faster than before, {{and there would be}} greater ease in keeping the whale attached <b>to</b> the <b>harpoon</b> line. Modern guns with improved grenades were significantly improved during the 20th century, and currently, the most advanced technologies can kill a whale virtually instantly.|$|R
25|$|The species found {{raise the}} {{question}} of whether a whaling or sealing industry existed as such or whether the bones came from opportunistic scavenging. There is no direct evidence of voyaging out in dugouts <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> whales that could kill the voyagers in an instant. However, one of the two main types of pottery used was the blubber lamp, a small, oval deep dish in which you ignited a chunk of blubber or even oil with a wick. The widespread use of this lamp implies a widespread industry to obtain blubber; i.e., professional whale and seal hunting.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} games, gameplay elements {{focus more}} on ship-based exploration of the seamless open world map, while also retaining the series' third-person land-based exploration, melee combat, and stealth system. Multiplayer also returns, albeit with only land-based modes and settings. The game spans across the Caribbean with the three main cities of Havana, Nassau and Kingston along with numerous islands, sunken ships, and forts. Players have the option <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> large sea animals and hunt land animals. For {{the first time in}} the series, naval exploration is a major part of an Assassin's Creed game, where Edward Kenway captains the Jackdaw, a brig he captures from a Spanish fleet.|$|E
500|$|The divine {{struggle}} involves many episodes. [...] "Contendings" [...] {{describes the}} two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing {{in different types}} of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting {{each other in the}} form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.|$|E
5000|$|The word slocan {{is derived}} from the Sinixt word meaning [...] "pierce, strike on the head", a {{reference}} <b>to</b> the <b>harpooning</b> of salmon.|$|R

50|$|The {{ships were}} modernised {{a third time}} between 1987 and 1991. During this upgrade, the radar and gun systems were updated, and the Mark 13 {{launcher}} was modified <b>to</b> fire <b>Harpoon</b> missiles.|$|R
2500|$|Similar to walrus, bowhead {{whales are}} {{captured}} by harpoon. The hunters use active pursuit <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> the whale {{and follow it}} during attack. At times, Inuit were known for using a more passive approach when hunting whales. According to John Bennett and Susan Rowley, a hunter would harpoon the whale and instead of pursuing it, would [...] "wait patiently for the winds, currents, and spirits to aid him in bringing the whale to shore." ...|$|E
60|$|And away he went. He went uninjured, too--I had {{the murderous}} impulse <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> {{him in the}} back with my alpenstock, but as I raised the weapon the {{disposition}} left me; I found I hadn't the heart to kill him, he was such a joyous, innocent, good-natured numbskull.|$|E
60|$|She {{knew all}} about the Flying Dutchman, and Davy Jones' Locker, and Captain Kidd, and how <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> a whale or dodge an iceberg or lasso a seal. Cap'n Bill had been {{everywhere}} in the world, almost, on his many voyages. He had been wrecked on desert islands like Robinson Crusoe and been attacked by cannibals, and had {{a host of other}} exciting adventures. So he was a delightful comrade for the little girl, and whatever Cap'n Bill knew Trot was sure to know in time.|$|E

50|$|In 1863, Foyn {{contracted}} {{the building of}} his first whaling ship—a steam powered ship (also with sails) that had seven whaling cannons—the Spes et Fides (Hope and Faith). The ship was also fitted with check boards to increase the drag on harpooned whales. He also incorporated a 'compensator' or 'accumulator' from the Roys system—a series of rollers and springs installed below deck—to help the thick whale line, attached <b>to</b> the <b>harpoon,</b> <b>to</b> take {{up some of the}} shock without breaking.|$|R
50|$|The {{explosive}} harpoon is {{a device}} used by whalemen to kill whales efficiently and without poison. As {{soon as the}} harpoon is thrown into the whale and fastened to it the wooden pin is broken {{by the power of}} the whale pulling upon the tow-line attached <b>to</b> the <b>harpoon.</b> This causes the fluke of the <b>harpoon</b> <b>to</b> open or turn upon the iron rivet, and the rivet will come in contact with the vial and break it, producing friction, cause the powder to explode.|$|R
60|$|It was breezy and pleasant, but the sea {{was still}} very rough. One could not {{promenade}} without risking his neck; at one moment the bowsprit was taking a deadly aim at the sun in midheaven, and at the next it was trying <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> a shark {{in the bottom of}} the ocean. What a weird sensation it is to feel the stem of a ship sinking swiftly from under you and see the bow climbing high away among the clouds! One's safest course that day was to clasp a railing and hang on; walking was too precarious a pastime.|$|E
6000|$|The {{swordfish}} {{are always}} harpooned {{from the end}} of the bowsprit of a sailing-vessel. It is next to impossible to approach them in a small boat. All vessels regularly engaged in this fishery are supplied with a special apparatus called a [...] "rest," [...] or [...] "pulpit," [...] for the support of the harpooner as he stands on the bowsprit, and this is almost essential to success, although it is possible for an active man <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> a fish from this station without the aid of the ordinary framework. Not only the professional swordfish fisherman, but many mackerel-schooners and packets are supplied in this manner.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the crew}} went to meals, each man carried {{at least one}} plug in his pocket; {{that he had a}} right to; and as many more were hidden about his person as he dared. Among the great crowds pouring out of the dock-gates at such hours, of course these smugglers stood little chance of detection; {{although}} vigilant looking policemen were always standing by. And though these [...] "Charlies" [...] might suppose there were tobacco smugglers passing; yet to hit the right man among such a throng, would be as hard, as <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> a speckled porpoise, one of ten thousand darting under a ship's bows.|$|E

50|$|W.W. Greener {{also used}} the Martini action to produce the Greener-Martini Light Harpoon Gun used for whaling, and also for {{commercial}} harvest of tuna and other large fish. The gun fired a blank cartridge <b>to</b> propel the <b>harpoon.</b> A special barrel and stock were fitted <b>to</b> accommodate the <b>harpoon</b> and <b>to</b> lower weight. A Greener harpoon gun is used by Quint in the 1975 movie Jaws.|$|R
60|$|But {{here there}} were only good quiet beasts, lying about like the black hulls of sloops, and blowing {{every now and then}} jets of white steam, or {{sculling}} round with their huge mouths open, for the sea- moths to swim down their throats. There were no threshers there to thresh their poor old backs, or sword-fish to stab their stomachs, or saw-fish to rip them up, or ice-sharks to bite lumps out of their sides, or whalers <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> and lance them. They were quite safe and happy there; and {{all they had to do}} was to wait quietly in Peacepool, till Mother Carey sent for them to make them out of old beasts into new.|$|E
60|$|When Bartholemy {{reached the}} Caribbean Sea he {{probably}} first touched at Tortuga, the pirates' headquarters, and then sailed out {{very much as}} if he had been a fisherman going forth to see what he could catch on the sea. He cruised about on the track generally taken by treasure ships going from the mainland to the Havanas, or the island of Hispaniola, and when at last he sighted a vessel in the distance, it was not long before he and his men had made up their minds that if they were to have any sport that day it would be with what might be called most decidedly a game fish, for the ship slowly sailing toward them was a large Spanish vessel, and from her portholes there protruded the muzzles of at least twenty cannon. Of course, they knew that such a vessel would have a much larger crew than their own, and, altogether, Bartholemy was very much in the position of a man who should go out <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> a sturgeon, and who should find himself confronted by a vicious swordfish.|$|E
60|$|Barney {{received}} no answer, for his sable friend was already {{up to his}} waist in the water with five or six of his brethren, who were flourishing their long poles and driving the snorting alligators towards the shore, where their comrades, with lassos and harpoons, awaited them. Sometimes they harpooned the alligators, and then, fastening lassos to their heads and tails, or to a hind leg, dragged them ashore; at other times they threw the lasso over their heads at once, without taking the trouble <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> them. It was a terrible and a wonderful sight to witness the Negroes in the very midst of a shoal of these creatures, any one of which could have taken a man into his jaws quite easily,--whence, once between these long saw-like rows of teeth, no man could have escaped to tell how sharp they were. The creatures were so numerous {{that it was impossible}} to thrust a pole into the mud without stirring up one of them; but they were so terrified at the sudden attack and the shouts of the Negroes, that they thought only of escape.|$|E
50|$|Other finds from Creswellian {{contexts}} include Baltic amber, mammoth {{ivory and}} animal teeth and bone. These were used <b>to</b> make <b>harpoons,</b> awls, beads and needles. Unusual bevelled ivory rods, known as sagaies {{have been found}} at Gough's Cave in Somerset and Kent's Cavern in Devon.|$|R
50|$|There was anecdotal {{evidence}} from whalers (see section above) that sonar could panic whales and {{cause them to}} surface more frequently making them vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>harpooning.</b> It has also been theorized that military sonar may induce whales to panic and surface too rapidly leading {{to a form of}} decompression sickness. In general trauma caused by rapid changes of pressure is known as barotrauma. The idea of acoustically enhanced bubble formation was first raised by a paper published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America in 1996 and again Nature in 2003. It reported acute gas-bubble lesions (indicative of decompression sickness) in whales that beached shortly after the start of a military exercise off the Canary Islands in September 2002.|$|R

60|$|Ere the English ship fades {{from sight}} be it set down here, that she hailed from London, {{and was named}} after the late Samuel Enderby, {{merchant}} of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of enderby and sons; a house which in my poor whaleman's opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued the Leviathan, {{but only in the}} North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.|$|E
6000|$|Presently my boatman yelled, [...] "Sailfish!" [...] We {{looked off}} to port {{and saw a}} big {{sailfish}} break water nine times. He was perhaps five hundred yards distant. My boatman put on speed, and, as my boat is fast, {{it did not take}} us long to get somewhere near where this big fish broke. We did our best to get to the exact spot where he came up, then slowed down and trolled over the place. In this instance I felt a light tap on my bait and I jumped up quickly, both to look and let him take line. But I did not see him or feel him any more. We went on. I saw a flash of bright silver back of my brother's bait. At the instant he hooked a kingfish. And then I felt one cut my bait off. Kingfish are savage strikers and they almost invariably hook themselves when the drag is set. But as I fish for sailfish with a free-running reel, of course I am exasperated when a kingfish takes hold. My brother pulled in this kingfish, which was small, and we rebaited our hooks and went on again. I saw more turtles, and one we almost ran over, he was so lazy in getting down. These big, cumbersome sea animals, once they get headed down and started, can disappear with remarkable rapidity. I rather enjoy watching them, but my boatman, who is a native of these parts and therefore a turtle-hunter by instinct, always wore a rather disappointed look when we saw one. This was because I would not allow him <b>to</b> <b>harpoon</b> it.|$|E
