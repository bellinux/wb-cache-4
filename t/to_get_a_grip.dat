500|$|In {{naming the}} character, {{executive}} producer and head writer Russell T Davies {{drew inspiration from}} the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, a character whose surname Davies had previously used in naming lead characters in Century Falls and The Grand. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of the character on the blank page. Jack's original appearances in Doctor Who were conceived {{with the intention of}} forming a character arc in which Jack is transformed from a coward to a hero, and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character. Following on that arc, the character's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous, publicity materials asking, [...] "Is he a force for good or ill?" ...|$|E
500|$|When Gareth David-Lloyd {{was cast}} in the role, the {{character}} was renamed Ianto Jones. This {{was inspired by the}} character of Yanto Jones, also played by David-Lloyd, in Russell T Davies's 2004 comedy-drama Mine All Mine. Ianto shares the surname [...] "Jones" [...] with Doctor Who characters Martha Jones and family as well as Harriet Jones, Torchwood character Eugene Jones ("Random Shoes"), and Stuart Allen Jones in Davies's earlier Queer as Folk; Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of the character on the blank page. In developing the character's attire, costume designer Ray Holman comments: [...] "Ianto has a very distinct look but his suits actually vary quite a lot. He started off with some nice but boring Marks and Spencers suits in series one, which were top-end fitted ones but always very sober. Towards the end of series one, I also got him into a waistcoat, and everyone thought that looked really good.|$|E

[...] "Never since Fet has a single poet managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of their readership in such a way," [...] wrote her friend Vasily Nemirovich-Danchenko.

2500|$|Other {{critics have}} {{complained about the}} {{similarity}} between News Knight and similar shows such as Have I Got News for You. The Daily Record said, [...] "Nicely done.

2500|$|Drawing {{from her}} creator's pool of {{recurring}} names, Martha {{and her family}} share the last name [...] "Jones" [...] with many other Russell T Davies-penned characters. Foremost among them are Harriet Jones in Doctor Who, Ianto Jones and Eugene Jones in Torchwood, Yanto Jones in Mine All Mine and Stuart Allen Jones in Queer as Folk. Davies states that reusing names (such as Tyler, Smith, Harper, Harkness and Jones) allows him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of the character on the blank page. In casting Martha, the actress Freema Agyeman was reused from her minor role as [...] Adeola Oshodi, in the Series 2 episode [...] "Army of Ghosts". Acknowledging this, the resemblance of the two characters was touched upon in [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] when Martha makes reference to her deceased cousin, also serving to connect Martha to the larger Doctor Who universe.|$|E

60|$|The Government {{wanted to}} save the Blacks from {{ultimate}} extermination, if possible. One of its schemes was to capture them and coop them up, on a neighboring island, under guard. Bodies of Whites volunteered for the hunt, for the pay was good--L5 for each Black captured and delivered, but the success achieved was not very satisfactory. The Black was naked, and his body was greased. It was hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> on him that would hold. The Whites moved about in armed bodies, and surprised little families of natives, and did make captures; but it was suspected that in these surprises half a dozen natives were killed to one caught--and {{that was not what}} the Government desired.|$|E
60|$|His hips were thin; and the legs, {{lean and}} hairy, were crooked and stringy-muscled. In fact, my father's legs {{were more like}} arms. They were twisted and gnarly, and with {{scarcely}} the semblance of the full meaty calf such as graces your leg and mine. I remember he could not walk on the flat of his foot. This was {{because it was a}} prehensile foot, more like a hand than a foot. The great toe, instead of being in line with the other toes, opposed them, like a thumb, and its opposition to the other toes was what enabled him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> with his foot.

60|$|Harris is more {{accustomed}} to sea rowing than to river work, and says that, as an exercise, he prefers it. I don’t. I remember taking a small boat out at Eastbourne last summer: I used {{to do a good}} deal of sea rowing years ago, and I thought I should be all right; but I found I had forgotten the art entirely. When one scull was deep down underneath the water, the other would be flourishing wildly about in the air. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of the water with {{both at the same time}} I had to stand up. The parade was crowded with nobility and gentry, and I had to pull past them in this ridiculous fashion. I landed half-way down the beach, and secured the services of an old boatman to take me back.|$|E
60|$|Under the {{circumstances}} of the case, it was impossible to decline this request. I wrote to say that time should be made, and the notes were forwarded to me at Robin Hood's Bay. I began by reading carefully and twice over, so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of the story and the novelist's intention, the part that had already appeared, and the proofs so far as the author had gone. I then turned to the notes. I found that these were not merely notes such as I expected--simple indications of the plot and the development of events, but an actual detailed scenario, in which every incident, however trivial, was carefully laid down: there were also fragments of dialogue inserted at those places where dialogue was wanted to emphasise the situation and make it real. I was much struck with the writer's perception of the vast importance of dialogue in making the reader seize the scene. Description requires attention: dialogue rivets attention.|$|E

Then they all got round you, and I rolled into the ditch, crept along it, got on the cross-road in the shadow of the trees, and was beside the carriage before ever they knew that I was gone. I saw in a flash that there was only one way by which I could be of use to you. The coachman was leaning round with his head turned to see what was going on behind him. I out with my knife, sprang up on the front wheel, and stopped his tongue forever." ...|$|E

The Wall Street Journal counted one start of Pelfrey's and found he did this action 89 times over the course of a game.|$|R

6000|$|With a quick {{intake of}} breath he tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> on himself. He thought of the battles he had fought with bullies older and bigger than himself, and had won because he had kept {{his head in the}} heat of contest and had coolly taken {{advantage}} of every opening. But that was different. Then he was in action and it was easier to keep cool. Then, too, if he missed one blow there was a chance for another. It was this sitting still with the knowledge that there would be but one chance, and that this must be taken at just the right moment or be lost forever that upset him so. Then curiously enough the motto of the Boy Scouts flashed into his head--"Be prepared." [...] It was like a tonic to his shaking nerves. Was not a Scout supposed to be prepared for all emergencies, and what was this but a form of emergency? ...|$|E
60|$|The fellow {{rose with}} a {{promptness}} which partly disarmed Grant's suspicions, {{and put his}} foot {{on the edge of the}} vehicle, ready to jump down. Then he turned swiftly and flung himself upon the farmer, crushing his soft felt hat down to his chin. Grant could see nothing, and while he strove <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> on his antagonist he was thrown violently backward off the driving seat. The wagon was of the usual high pattern, and he came down on the ground with a crash that nearly knocked him unconscious. Before he got up, he was seized firmly and held with his shoulders pressed against the soil. He struggled, however, until somebody grasped his legs and his arms were drawn forcibly apart. It was impossible to see, because the thick hat was still over his face and somebody held it fast, but he had an idea that three or four men had fallen upon him. They had, no doubt, been hidden among the brush; the affair had been carefully arranged with his treacherous companion.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} how long that {{drifting}} took. In the sphere of course, even more than on the moon, one's earthly time sense was ineffectual. At the touch of the bale it was as if I had awakened from a dreamless sleep. I immediately perceived that if I wanted to keep awake and alive I must get a light or open a window, so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>grip</b> of something with my eyes. And besides, I was cold. I kicked off from the bale, therefore, clawed on to the thin cords within the glass, crawled along until I got to the manhole rim, and so got my bearings for the light and blind studs, took a shove off, and flying once round the bale, and getting a scare from something big and flimsy that was drifting loose, I got my hand on the cord quite close to the studs, and reached them. I lit the little lamp first of all {{to see what it was}} I had collided with, and discovered that old copy of Lloyd's News had slipped its moorings, and was adrift in the void. That brought me out of the infinite to my own proper dimensions again. It made me laugh and pant for a time, and suggested the idea of a little oxygen from one of the cylinders. After that I lit the heater until I felt warm, and then I took food. Then I set to work in a very gingerly fashion on the Cavorite blinds, to see if I could guess by any means how the sphere was travelling.|$|E
