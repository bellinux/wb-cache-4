5|$|Often ingenious {{methods were}} {{developed}} for administering the weapons. The 10th-century Olga of Kiev {{is reported to}} have tied burning <b>tinder</b> to birds which, when released, flew back to their nests in the hostile town and set them alight.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri wrote {{three main}} works that were popular in his time. Among his works are The <b>Tinder</b> Spark, Unnecessary Necessity, and Resalat Al-Ghufran (The Epistle of Forgiveness) {{which may be}} {{considered}} a precursor to Dante's Divine Comedy. Al-Maʿarri never married and {{died at the age}} of 83 in the city where he was born, Maarrat al-Nuʿman. In 2013, a statue of Al-Maʿarri located in his Syrian home town was beheaded by jihadists from the Al-Nusra Front.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} gunpowder attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the gunpowder ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated <b>tinder</b> that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the gunpowder was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with gunpowder.|$|E

5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that may have been}} used as <b>tinder</b> (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references to the destruction of crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle killed {{a number of}} trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. This created a heterogeneous forest in which old surviving trees were mixed with younger trees of various ages. This mixed stand structure may have provided ladder fuels {{that contributed to the}} fires. In addition, the winter season of 1987–1988 was drier than usual, with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31% of the normal snowpack. However, April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development. By June, the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months. By July, the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began. Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry <b>tinder.</b> Relative humidity levels fell further, desiccating the forest. Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5%. By mid-August, humidity levels were averaging below 20% and were recorded as low as 6% on one occasion. To compound the lack of rainfall, the majority of Yellowstone's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention. A series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to the rapid spread of a number of the largest fires.|$|E
25|$|A lean-to fire-build {{starts with}} the same pile of <b>tinder</b> as the tipi fire-build. Then, a long, thick piece of {{kindling}} is driven into the ground at an angle, so that it overhangs the <b>tinder</b> pile. The smaller pieces of kindling are leaned against the big stick so that the <b>tinder</b> is enclosed between them.|$|E
5000|$|On June 30, 2014, <b>Tinder's</b> {{co-founder and}} former vice {{president}} of marketing, Whitney Wolfe, filed a sexual harassment and sex discrimination suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court against IAC-controlled Match Group, parent company of the app. The lawsuit alleged that her fellow executives and co-founders Rad and Mateen had engaged in discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation against her, while <b>Tinder's</b> corporate supervisor, IAC's Sam Yagan, did nothing. IAC suspended CMO Mateen from his position pending an ongoing investigation, and stated that it [...] "acknowledges that Mateen sent private messages containing 'inappropriate content,' but it believes Mateen, Rad and the company are innocent of the allegations".|$|R
50|$|A fire piston ignites a {{combustible}} substance that holds an ember (e.g. charcloth) by rapid compression of air. Similar to how a Diesel engine works, rapid compression of air heats the interior to 400-700°F, {{well above the}} <b>tinder's</b> autoignition temperature.|$|R
50|$|In 1991 {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the company needed to refocus the various activities and hence Mr Haines acquired Dr <b>Tinder’s</b> shareholding in Desktop Engineering Ltd and then sold off the software development to Dr Trinder. Thus the company could focus on the software and systems activity.|$|R
25|$|A {{variation}} on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuel wood {{with a pile of}} <b>tinder</b> between them, and small kindling laid over the tops of the logs, above the <b>tinder.</b> The <b>tinder</b> is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed <b>tinder,</b> and the larger kindling is placed {{over the top of the}} logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuel wood, and soon the logs catch fire from it.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the fire}} is built, {{the next step is}} to light the <b>tinder,</b> using either an {{ignition}} device such as a match or a lighter. A reasonably skillful fire-builder using reasonably good material only needs one match. The <b>tinder</b> burns brightly, but be reduced to glowing embers within half a minute. If the kindling does not catch fire, the fire-builder must gather more <b>tinder,</b> determine what went wrong and try to fix it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinder</b> lights {{easily and}} is used to start an {{enduring}} campfire. It is {{anything that can be}} lit with a match and is usually classified as being thinner than your little finger. A few decent natural tinders are birch bark, cedar bark, and fatwood, where available; followed by dead, dry pine needles or grass; a more comprehensive list is given in the article on <b>tinder.</b> Though not natural, steel wool makes excellent <b>tinder</b> and can be started with steel and flint, or a 9 volt battery without difficulty.|$|E
5000|$|Flint {{and steel}} used to strike sparks were {{superseded}} by ferrocerium (sometimes {{referred to as}} [...] "flint", although not true flint, [...] "mischmetal", [...] "hot spark", [...] "metal match", or [...] "fire steel"). This man-made material, when scraped with any hard, sharp edge, produces sparks that are much hotter than obtained with natural flint and steel, allowing use of {{a wider range of}} <b>tinders.</b> Because it can produce sparks when wet and can start fires when used correctly, ferrocerium is commonly included in survival kits. Ferrocerium is used in many cigarette lighters, where it is referred to as [...] "flint".|$|R
50|$|After <b>Tinder's</b> clear success, {{many others}} tried {{creating}} their own dating applications and dating websites such as Match.Com created applications for convenience. ARC from Applause, a research group who specializes in gathering insights on app economy, conducted a research study on how 1.5 million U.S consumers rated 97 {{of the most popular}} dating apps. The research results indicated that only 11 apps scored 50 or greater (out of 100) with more than 10,000 reviews from the app store. These include: Jaumo, OKCupid, happn, SCRUFF by Perry Street, Moco by JNJ Mobile, GROWL by Initech, Skout, Qeep by Blue Lion mobile, MeetMe, Badoo, and Hornet. An app with a 50+ score was considered successful. Other popular applications like Bumble, Grindr, eHarmony, and Match scored 40 or less.|$|R

They tweet while watching television, talk back to advertising. The state of connection is ubiquitous, with the phone the first thing people check in the morning, and most sleeping with it within arm’s reach.

50|$|Simeon Coffin of Newbury, Massachusetts {{arrived in}} 1764 and {{lived for a}} time in a wigwam, {{although}} the first permanent settlement took place in 1770. Known as the north parish of Sanford, the community was set off and incorporated as a district on February 4, 1794. Sawmills and gristmills operated by water power at the streams. A log jail was built in 1803, with a brick jail in 1869. The courthouse was built in 1806, the year Alfred became the shire town of York County. It was incorporated as a town in 1808, named in honor of King Alfred the Great. Land would be set off to Sanford in 1828, and annexed from Waterboro in 1847. The Rochester & Portland Railroad entered from Waterboro in 1864, connecting to Rochester, New Hampshire in 1871. More than 30 trains passed through Alfred daily between 1910 and 1920, but use would decline in the age of automobiles. Passenger service ceased in 1949, with the final train departing in 1961. A severe drought in Maine <b>tindered</b> the Great Fires of 1947, burning 4500 acre of woodland and two residences in the town.|$|R

Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;-- that's not good. Best spill it?--wait. I'll cure myself of this. I'll hold the musket boldly while I think.--I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and doom,-- that's fair for Moby Dick. It's a fair wind that's only fair for that accursed fish.--The very tube he pointed at me!--the very one; this one--I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing I handle now.--Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead {{reckoning}} of the error-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear {{that he would have}} no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship's company down to doom with him?--Yes, it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant-- put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,--in there, he's sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can't withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say'st the men have vow'd thy vow; say'st all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!-- But is there no other way? no lawful way?--Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man's living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law.--Aye, aye, 'tis so.-- Is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, <b>tindering</b> sheets and skin together?-- And would I be a murderer, then, if"--and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket's end against the door.|$|R
25|$|In an {{alternative}} method, {{a large piece}} of fuel wood or log can be placed on the ground next to the <b>tinder</b> pile. Then kindling is placed with one end propped up by the larger piece of fuel wood, and the other resting on the ground, so that the kindling is leaning over the <b>tinder</b> pile. This method is useful in very high winds, as the piece of fuel wood acts as a windbreak.|$|E
25|$|A {{log cabin}} fire-build {{likewise}} {{begins with a}} <b>tinder</b> pile. The kindling is then stacked around it, as {{in the construction of}} a log cabin. The first two kindling sticks are laid parallel to each other, {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>tinder</b> pile. The second pair is laid on top of the first, at right angles to it, and also on opposite sides of the <b>tinder.</b> More kindling is added in the same manner. The smallest kindling is placed over the top of the assembly. Of all the fire-builds, the log cabin is the least vulnerable to premature collapse, but it is also inefficient, because it makes the worst use of convection to ignite progressively larger pieces of fuel. However, these qualities make the log cabin an ideal cooking fire as it burns for a long period of time and can support cookware.|$|E

25|$|Dryer lint, which {{collects}} on the {{lint screen}} of a clothes dryer, is highly flammable and therefore presents a fire hazard. However, {{because of this}} flammability, dryer lint may be collected for use as <b>tinder,</b> although burning man-made fibres can produce toxic fumes.|$|E
25|$|A cross-fire {{is built}} by {{positioning}} {{two pieces of}} wood with the <b>tinder</b> in between. Once the fire is burning well, additional pieces of wood are placed on top in layers that alternate directions. This type of fire creates coals suitable for cooking.|$|E
25|$|USC {{maintains}} a strong tradition of innovation and entrepreneurship, with alumni having founded {{companies such as}} Lucasfilm, Myspace, Salesforce.com, Intuit, Qualcomm, Box, <b>Tinder,</b> and Riot Games.

25|$|As noted above, dryer lint burns readily. Although {{this may}} present a hazard in the household, {{it also means}} that lint makes {{excellent}} <b>tinder</b> for starting fires.

25|$|Mycology is {{the branch}} of biology {{concerned}} with the study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and their use to humans {{as a source for}} <b>tinder,</b> medicinals (e.g., penicillin) as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. Published in Florence, this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic classification of grasses, mosses and fungi.

25|$|The Leatherman spent {{each night}} in a {{different}} 'cave' on his route where he had usually left a supply of firewood and <b>tinder</b> to start a fire soon after he arrived. The fire's heat would warm the stone sides of the 'cave' {{and allow it to}} stay warm throughout the night. Most of the cave's provided an opening for the fire's smoke to exit while still providing shelter from cold wind and rain. The Leatherman would accept food and drink (and occasional lodging and/or treatment when ill) from concerned charitable citizens along the route.|$|E
25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little <b>tinder,</b> too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen.

Metal fire rings generally {{do a good job of}} keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E
