50|$|<b>Torrefaction</b> is a {{thermochemical}} {{treatment of biomass}} at 200 to 320 °C (392 to 608ºF). It is carried out under atmospheric pressure {{and in the absence}} of oxygen, i.e. with no air. During the <b>torrefaction</b> process, the water contained in the biomass as well as superfluous volatiles are released, and the biopolymers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) partly decompose, giving off various types of volatiles.The final product is the remaining solid, dry, blackened material that is referred to as torrefied biomass or bio-coal.|$|E

50|$|For most applications, wood must be dried before use, {{either in}} air or kilns. Some luthiers prefer further {{seasoning}} for several years.

50|$|Retification {{refers to}} the French word rétification, which is the {{abbreviation}} of réticulation (creation of chemical bonds between polymeric chains) and <b>torréfaction</b> (roasting). Wood in this process must have a moisture content at 12% or lower which can be attained through simple drying processes. The wood is then placed in a high nitrogen atmosphere {{with no more than}} 2% oxygen content.|$|E
50|$|Biomass {{can be an}} {{important}} energy source. However, nature provides a large diversity of biomass with varying characteristics. To create highly efficient biomass-to-energy chains, <b>torrefaction</b> of biomass in combination with densification (pelletisation or briquetting) is a promising step to overcome logistic economics in large-scale sustainable energy solutions, i.e. make it easier to transport and store it. Pellets or briquets are lighter, drier and stable in storage as opposed to the biomass they are made of.|$|E
50|$|An {{energy density}} of 18-20 GJ/m³ — {{compared}} to the 26 to 33 gigajoules per tonne heat content of natural anthracite coal — can be achieved when combined with densification (pelletizing or briquetting) compared to values of 10-11 GJ/m³ for raw biomass, driving a 40-50% reduction in transportation costs. Importantly, pelletizing or briquetting primarily increases energy density. <b>Torrefaction</b> alone typically decreases energy density, though it allows the material to be more easily pelletized or briquetted.|$|E
50|$|Biomass energy can be {{produced}} from combustion of waste green material to heat water into steam and drive a steam turbine. Bioenergy can also be processed through a range of temperatures and pressures in gasification, pyrolysis or <b>torrefaction</b> reactions. Depending on the desired end product, these reactions create more energy-dense products (syngas, wood pellets, biocoal) that can then be fed into an accompanying engine to produce electricity {{at a much lower}} emission rate when compared with open burning.|$|E

50|$|Torrefied biomass can be {{produced}} {{from a wide variety}} of raw biomass feedstocks while yielding similar product properties. Most woody and herbaceous biomass consists of three main polymeric structures: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Together these are called lignocellulose. <b>Torrefaction</b> primarily drives moisture and oxygen-rich and hydrogen-rich functional groups from these structures, resulting in similar char-like structures in all three cases. Therefore, most biomass fuels, regardless of origin, produce torrefied products with similar properties with the exception of the ash properties, which largely reflect the original fuel ash content and composition.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{conversion}} processes use heat as {{the dominant}} mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form. Also known as thermal oil heating, it {{is a type of}} indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system. The basic alternatives of combustion (<b>torrefaction,</b> pyrolysis, and gasification) are separated principally by {{the extent to which the}} chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed (mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature).|$|E
50|$|During the process, the biomass {{typically}} loses 20% of {{its mass}} (bone dry basis) and 10% of its heating value, with no appreciable change in volume. This energy (the volatiles) {{can be used}} as a heating fuel for the <b>torrefaction</b> process.After the biomass is torrefied it can be densified, usually into briquettes or pellets using conventional densification equipment, to increase its mass and energy density and to improve its hydrophobic properties. The final product may repel water and thus can be stored in moist air or rain without appreciable change in moisture content or heating value, unlike the original biomass from which it is made.|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, Carmichael {{decided to}} take a 3-month sabbatical from the coffee {{industry}} and his business, La Colombe <b>Torrefaction.</b> He arranged to be dropped off on Nagigia, a tiny island in the South Pacific with only about 150 inhabitants. “The idea was to go back in time… to learn from the indigenous people there how to survive,” said Carmichael. He spent {{two and a half months}} surfing, spearing fish and building a hut. It became a turning point in his life. “During that time, I thought, ‘You know what, it’s very, very clear for you, my friend: Adventure and endurance is just part of your life.

50|$|Carmichael and Iberti opened La Colombe <b>Torrefaction,</b> {{their first}} European-style café in May 1994 on 19th Street near Philadelphia’s Rittenhouse Square Park. In the beginning, they would roast {{their own unique}} blends {{in the back of}} their café, and after {{struggling}} at first like most startup businesses, the demand for their coffee among restaurants began to increase exponentially. In December 1994, they opened a roastery in a warehouse in the city’s Port Richmond neighborhood. Now, La Colombe is served in some of the most elite restaurants throughout the U.S. with top-rated cafés located in Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Seoul, South Korea and plans to open nearly 100 more establishments throughout the U.S. within the next five years.|$|E
50|$|Huge {{quantity}} of imported coal {{is being used}} in pulverised coal-fired power stations. Raw biomass is not suitable {{for use in the}} pulverised coal mills as they are difficult to grind into fine powder due to caking problem. However 100% biomass can be fired after <b>Torrefaction</b> in the pulverised coal mills for replacing imported coal. Torrefied biomass plants can be integrated with existing pulverised coal-fired power stations using the available hot flue gas as heat source. Cofiring dry biomass up to 20% heat input with coal is also possible directly in pulverised coal-fired power stations without facing caking problem. North west and southern regions can replace imported coal use with biomass where surplus agriculture/crop residue biomass is burnt in the fields causing pollution problems. As traditional use of biomass is being replaced by LPG at faster pace, biomass burning in agriculture fields would become major source for causing higher level air pollution.|$|E
50|$|The use {{of straw}} in {{large-scale}} biomass power plants is becoming mainstream in the EU, with several facilities already online. The straw is either used {{directly in the}} form of bales, or densified into pellets which allows for the feedstock to be transported over longer distances. Finally, <b>torrefaction</b> of straw with pelletisation is gaining attention, because it increases the energy density of the resource, making it possible to transport it still further. This processing step also makes storage much easier, because torrefied straw pellets are hydrophobic. Torrefied straw {{in the form of}} pellets can be directly co-fired with coal or natural gas at very high rates and make use of the processing infrastructures at existing coal and gas plants. Because the torrefied straw pellets have superior structural, chemical and combustion properties to coal, they can replace all coal and turn a coal plant into an entirely biomass-fed power station. First generation pellets are limited to a co-firing rate of 15% in modern IGCC plants.|$|E
