5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{can lead}} to death {{as a result of}} a number of complications: severe infections, blood clots, and cardiac arrest likely due to autonomic neuropathy. Despite optimum care <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> in about 5% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes such as lithium-6, {{as well as}} some {{beryllium}} and boron {{are generated}} in space through cosmic ray spallation. <b>This</b> <b>occurs</b> when a high-energy proton strikes an atomic nucleus, causing large numbers of nucleons to be ejected.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} for the clot to break off and migrate (embolise) to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. An analysis of earlier case reports concludes that <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> in about 10% of cases, but has a very poor prognosis.|$|E

5|$|The {{absorption}} band of simple cations shift toward shorter wavelength {{when they are}} involved in more covalent interactions. <b>This</b> <b>occurs</b> during hydration of metal ions, so colourless anhydrous ionic compounds with an anion absorbing in the infrared can become colourful in solution.|$|E
5|$|The {{gestation}} period averages 192.2 days, after which one young is born, although twinning has been observed. Both {{males and females}} will disperse in the wild, <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> between 16 and 27 months.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. <b>This</b> <b>occurs</b> because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E

5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.|$|E
5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} {{animal is}} limited to the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup of carbon dioxide and lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. Respiratory complications tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When <b>this</b> <b>occurs,</b> the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E

5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, {{the energy of the}} electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. <b>This</b> <b>occurs,</b> for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. <b>This</b> <b>occurs</b> due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E
5|$|Histamines are {{proteins}} {{associated with}} many allergic reactions. When the UV radiation or light {{comes in contact}} with a person with solar urticaria, histamine is released from mast cells. When <b>this</b> <b>occurs,</b> the permeability of vessels near the area of histamine release is increased. This allows blood fluid to enter the vessels and cause inflammation. Antihistamines suppress {{the activity of the}} histamine.|$|E

5|$|In {{the long}} term {{there will be a}} {{switchover}} from analogue to digital radio when the AM and FM services will cease. The government has set criteria on the coverage and proportion of digital listening before <b>this</b> <b>occurs.</b> As of 2017 these criteria have not yet been reached and a switchover is unlikely before 2020.|$|E
5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually <b>this</b> <b>occurs</b> when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Most Lodges {{have some}} sort of social calendar, {{allowing}} Masons and their partners to meet in a less ritualised environment. Often coupled with these events is the obligation placed on every Mason to contribute to charity. <b>This</b> <b>occurs</b> at both Lodge and Grand Lodge level. Masonic charities contribute to many field, such as education or disaster relief.|$|E
