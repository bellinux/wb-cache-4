40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem for}} the application of a <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber</b> is to minimize the response of a structural system, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration or to maximize the energy dissipated by <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber.</b> The development of explicit optimal absorber parameters is challenging for a clamped structural system since the fixed points no longer exist in the frequency response curve. This paper aims at deriving a set of simple design formula of <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber</b> with nonlinear viscous damping based on the frequency tuning for harmonic load for a damped structural system under white noise excitation. The vibration absorbers being considered include tuned mass damper (TMD) and liquid column vibration absorber (LCVA). Simple approximate expression for the standard deviation velocity response of <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber</b> for damped primary structure is also derived in this study to facilitate the estimation of the damping coefficient of TMD with nonlinear viscous damping and the head loss coefficient of LCVA. The derived results indicate that the higher the structural inherent damping the smaller the supplementary damping provided by a <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber.</b> Furthermore, the optimal damping of <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber</b> is shown to be independent of structural damping when it is tuned using the frequency tuning for harmonic load. Finally, the derived closed form expressions are demonstrated to be capable of predicting the optimal parameters of <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> with sufficient accuracy for preliminary design of <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> with nonlinear viscous damping for a damped primary structure.

40|$|<b>Tuned</b> {{vibration}} <b>absorbers,</b> {{in various}} disguises, still {{form the basis}} of vibration suppression for light and flexible structures. These simple auxiliary components may be tuned at critical frequencies of the structure to be controlled. Tuning frequencies may be constant (in case of passive absorbers) or varied (in case of semi-active and active <b>absorbers).</b> <b>Tuning</b> ensures a strong interaction, and facilitates the transfer of the harmful energy from the problem structure to the absorber. The task then becomes to dissipate the transferred energy rapidly in the absorber, before it has a chance to return the energy back to the structure. Returning the energy back to the structure, when the rate of dissipation in the absorber is not fast enough, manifests itself as a beat, significantly deteriorating the control performance. The obvious solution to avoid the undesirable beat is to include dissipative components {{in the design of the}} <b>tuned</b> <b>absorber.</b> However, such an inclusion has two consequences. First, the effectiveness at the tuning frequency is sacrificed, at a level proportional to the amount of damping in the absorber. Second, and more critically, dissipative components are high maintenance components by nature, rendering the damped <b>tuned</b> <b>absorber</b> to be less practical. A particle damper is presented in this paper which can dissipate energy rapidly while maintaining the <b>tuning</b> of the <b>absorber</b> effectively. Simple experiments are detailed to demonstrate the tuning, and the level of dissipation. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>tuned</b> {{vibration}} <b>absorber</b> {{has become}} an effective device for vibration control in many engineering applications. However, using the <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber</b> introduces a new resonance peak into the frequency response of the primary system and can actually increase the vibration of the primary system.

A number of simulations and experiments have been carried out to test the performance of the new control plan.

40|$|A {{structure}} {{under the}} influence of a harmonic excitation may start vibrating violently when the applied frequency is slowly approaching any one of its natural frequencies.

The absorbers are submerged spring-loaded flaps, with stiffnesses of the springs being adjusted for tuning to any specific (rigid-body) mode of the platform (heaving, pitching, etc.), whereas actual design of the flaps should provide the desired amount of drag-induced damping. Mean square response analysis {{of the system is}} made for the case of a narrow-band random excitation due to ocean waves by using method of moments in conjunction with statistical linearization (with Gaussian closure) for quadratic damping term. Extensive parametric study is made of the efficiency of vibration control through the use of absorbers, as represented by the root-mean-square (RMS) response reduction factor. In particular, the efficiency increases with the absorber/platform mass ratio, and it may be of some practical importance even at values of this ratio as small as 1 %. The importance of the excitation bandwidth is demonstrated. It is shown that, whereas optimal damping of the absorber depends on the level of wave excitation, the RMS response reduction factor is fairly constant within a rather broad range of (nonlinear) damping, so that adjusting absorber damping for storm level may not be necessary.

40|$|For {{application}} in damping treatments, elastomeric materials {{should have a}} high damping loss factor, but this is inevitably linked to a strong temperature-dependence of the dynamic properties. A methodology is developed that allows a material to be formulated for a particular damping application where temperature-dependence {{has to be taken}} into account. The methodology is applied to the case of a <b>tuned</b> <b>absorber</b> system used for damping the vibration of a railway track. This is required to be effective over a temperature range - 20 °C to 40 °C. To investigate the effect of the temperature on the performance of a rail damper, a simple Timoshenko beam model of the track vibration is used, to which are added single-frequency and dual-frequency <b>tuned</b> <b>absorbers.</b> The results show that a high noise reduction can be achieved for the optimum stiffness, provided that the loss factor is between about 0. 25 and 0. 4. In order to study the generic effects of high damping versus constant stiffness, the time-temperature superposition principle is used to convert frequency-dependence to temperature-dependence for a notional material with constant loss factor. This is used in the prediction of decay rates and thereby noise reduction. In addition, a weighted noise reduction is studied by using measured rail temperature distributions. This temperatureweighted noise reduction allows a single number measure of performance to be obtained which can be used to assess various elastomeric materials {{in order to determine the}} optimum material for a given situation. Two types of viscoelastic material, butyl and EPDM rubbers with various amount of fillers and plasticisers are investigated. The properties of both rubbers have been measured over the range of temperatures for frequencies 300 - 3000 Hz. For this a test rig had to be modified. For butyl, the best combination of filler and plasticiser gives temperature weighted noise reductions up to 5. 9 dB(A). Butyl rubber is suitable for use in the rail absorber giving high noise reductions between 0 °C and 40 °C. The best EPDM compound gives a temperature-weighted noise reduction up to 6. 2 dB(A).

In this paper, vibration dynamics of a pneumatic hand-held impact machine (HHIM) equipped with a nonlinear <b>tuned</b> vibration <b>absorber</b> (NLTVA) is in focus. The considered HHIM has the same parameters as the existing conventional one with respect to piston weight, impact energy and operating frequency. The paper presents the mathematical and computational models of vibration dynamics of the HHIM with NLTVA as well as the experimental set-up developed for model validation. The advantage of using a nonlinear spring is shown and how the effective vibration reduction frequency of the NLTVA can be made to follow the excitation frequency and thereby in principal achieving the same conditions as is the case for <b>tuned</b> pendulum <b>absorbers</b> for torsional vibrations where the resonance frequency follows the engine order.

40|$|Damping {{devices for}} railway tracks have been {{developed}} {{in recent years in}} which a <b>tuned</b> mass-spring <b>absorber</b> system is formed by an elastomeric material and embedded steel masses. The loss factor and stiffness of the elastomer are very important for the performance of the system but, unfortunately, both properties are sensitive to changes in the temperature. Although having a high loss factor gives good noise reduction, it also means greater variation of stiffness, and consequently tuning frequency, with temperature. Conversely, with lower loss factors the tuning frequency can be kept close to the target but a smaller noise reduction is achieved. To investigate the effect of the temperature on the performance of a generic rail absorber, a simple Timoshenko beam model of the track is used. To this is added a single-frequency continuous <b>tuned</b> <b>absorber.</b> The noise reduction at each frequency is estimated from the ratio of the track decay rates of treated and untreated rails. There is a physical link between the damping loss factor and the stiffness variation with temperature, of which account must be taken. The rate of change of stiffness with log frequency is established by assuming a constant value of loss factor. Using the time-temperature superposition principle, this is expressed in terms of temperature dependence. This is used in the prediction of decay rates and thereby noise reduction at different temperatures. This leads to an assessment of the relative importance of using a high damping loss factor or a temperature-independent stiffness. Finally, a method of weighting the noise reduction at different temperatures is investigated. A distribution of rail temperatures at a site in the UK is used to develop a weighting procedure.
