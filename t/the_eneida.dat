40|$|Els estudiosos del Curial han relacionat fàcilment l’enamorament de l’africana Camar amb els amors –també africans– d’Enees i Dido. Tanmateix, els ha passat desapercebuda la figura de la màrtir romana Perpètua de Cartago, jove estudiosa de l’Eneida, que fou lligada a un pal i exposada als lleons, entre altres aspectes biogràfics relacionables amb el personatge curialesc de Camar. La revisió de les Actes del martiri (versions A i B, divulgades ensems) i de la novel·lada Passio Perpetuae (segle III) permet detectar coincidències argumentals i connexions intertextuals amb la novel·la cavalleresca del segle XV. El fet que aquestes fonts foren fàcilment accessibles a Itàlia (Milà, Nàpols), però no a la Península Ibèrica, reforça la idea –generalment acceptada per la crítica– d’un Curial e Güelfa escrit en relació amb la cort napolitana d’Alfons el Magnànim. El tractament paròdic que l’anònim fa de les fonts devocionals, d’altra banda, resulta també especialment interessant per a caracteritzar-lo intel·lectualment i per a interpretar l’obra com cal.
