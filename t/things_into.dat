5|$|Archaea are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. Archaea share this defining feature with the bacteria {{with which they were}} once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living <b>things</b> <b>into</b> bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, and thereby split the prokaryote domain.|$|E
5|$|Organisms {{were first}} {{classified}} by Aristotle (Greece, 384–322 BC) during his {{stay on the}} Island of Lesbos. He classified beings by their parts, or in modern terms attributes, such as having live birth, having four legs, laying eggs, having blood, or being warm-bodied. He divided all living <b>things</b> <b>into</b> two groups: plants and animals. Some of his groups of animals, such as Anhaima (animals without blood, translated as invertebrates) and Enhaima (animals with blood, roughly the vertebrates), as well as groups like the sharks and cetaceans, are still commonly used today. His student Theophrastus (Greece, 370–285 BC) carried on this tradition, mentioning some 500 plants and their uses in his Historia Plantarum. Again, several plant groups currently still recognized {{can be traced back}} to Theophrastus, such as Cornus, Crocus, and Narcissus.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Indian Ayurveda {{tradition}} independently {{developed the}} concept of three humours, resembling that of the four humours of ancient Greek medicine, though the Ayurvedic system included further complications, such as the body being composed of five elements and seven basic tissues. Ayurvedic writers also classified living <b>things</b> <b>into</b> four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb, eggs, heat & moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of a fetus in detail. They also made considerable advances {{in the field of}} surgery, often without the use of human dissection or animal vivisection. One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BCE. It was also an early materia medica, describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the last series, Rachel returns from London and tells Adam that she aborted the baby, and their {{relationship}} seems over for good. They both start seeing other people—he one of Pete's colleagues (Rosie Cavaliero) and she a man much younger than her (Hugh Dancy)—but reconcile after Adam is diagnosed and treated for testicular cancer in Episode 5. David is made redundant at work and decides to be a stay-at-home dad for Josh. After some interference from Karen, he takes a new job. Their relationship improves from the first series; they spend their wedding anniversary in Paris and Karen announces in Episode 6 that she is pregnant. Pete and Jenny's marriage deteriorates when she reveals she {{had a crush on}} Adam. Pete later sleeps with a co-worker— with whom Adam was also briefly involved—and Jenny tells him {{to move out of the}} house. They decide to give their marriage another chance when Adam's cancer puts <b>things</b> <b>into</b> perspective. In Episode 6, all three couples see in the new millennium on a trip to Lindisfarne, where Pete and Jenny's relationship worsens again as the others' improve.|$|E
5|$|Someone paints butts on Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) {{warehouse}} mural. Distraught, she {{demands to}} know the vandal's identity, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) upstairs and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural using vulgar language and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nelly both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight take <b>things</b> <b>into</b> their own hands by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he {{will always be there}} for her if she needs someone.|$|E

25|$|In particular, Equity Theory {{research}} has tested employee sentiments regarding equitable compensation. Employee inputs {{take the form}} of work volume and quality, performance, knowledge, skills, attributes and behaviors. The company-generated outcomes include rewards such as compensation, praise and advancement opportunities. The employee compares his inputs relative to outcomes; and, then, extrapolating to the social context, the employee compares his input/outcome ratio with the perceived ratios of others. If the employee perceives an inequity, the theory posits that the employee will adjust his behavior to bring <b>things</b> <b>into</b> balance.|$|E
25|$|Although the 1990 NLCS lasted six games, that year's ALCS {{and more}} importantly, the World Series, lasted only {{four out of}} seven {{possible}} games. To put <b>things</b> <b>into</b> proper perspective, by one estimate, CBS lost $5 million for each playoff game not played and US$15.4 million for each World Series game not played. At {{the end of the}} day, CBS lost $12 million to $15 million on each of the League Championship Series and World Series games not played, for a total of $36 million to $45 million.|$|E

25|$|Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and Descartes were, with {{going too}} much into details in efforts to explain the metaphysics of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him {{to admit that they}} are metaphysically distinct: to be a human is to be a {{composite}} of soul and body, and the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of <b>things</b> <b>into</b> those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.|$|E
25|$|Being-in-the-world is Heidegger's {{replacement}} for {{terms such as}} subject, object, consciousness, and world. For him, the split of <b>things</b> <b>into</b> subject/object, as we find in the Western tradition and even in our language, must be overcome, as is indicated by the root structure of Husserl and Brentano's concept of intentionality, i.e., that all consciousness is consciousness of something, {{that there is no}} consciousness, as such, cut off from an object (be it the matter of a thought or of a perception). Nor are there objects without some consciousness beholding or being involved with them.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} use emergy (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, {{budgets for}} the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform <b>things</b> <b>into</b> another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by adaptive reuse systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of the products are used to make an entirely different product.|$|E

25|$|The Magician's Nephew {{suggests}} {{two opposing}} approaches to nature, a good approach associated with Aslan as creator and an evil approach associated with human deviation from divine intentions and the harmony {{of a natural}} order. On the one hand there is the beauty of Aslan's creation of Narnia, which is suggested as having a natural order {{by the use of}} musical harmony to bring landscapes and living <b>things</b> <b>into</b> being. There is also a distinct order to the process of creation, from earth to plants to animal, which evokes the concept of The Great Chain of Being. Lewis himself was a strong believer in the intrinsic value of nature for itself, rather than as a resource to be exploited. This is perhaps reflected in how Aslan also gives speech to spiritual aspects of nature, such naiads in the water and dryads in the trees. Andrew Ketterley and Jadis represent an opposite, evil approach of bending the forces of nature to human will for the purpose of self gain. They see nature solely as a resource to use for their plans and thus disturb and destroy the natural order.|$|E
25|$|Further {{settlement}} {{took place}} after Goodna was proclaimed {{a village in}} 1856. In the following year Joseph and Ellen (née Thompson) Broad built a store on the site, and sold the store later to Edwin Pitt, son of Charles and Mary Pitt. Edwin and his wife Cecilia (née Thompson sister of Ellen Broad) ran the store as a mixed business and Cecilia was the postmistress (see Aldines). They survived the 1893 Brisbane flood but a little later built Pitt's Hotel Cecil on the store site. It was later burnt down and the RSL is now on that site. Edwin and Cecilia's daughter Zora Brenda Pitt grew up and learnt to ride in Goodna and she became Royal National Show champion woman rider in the early 1900s, and the cemetery opened in 1859. By 1863 {{there was a small}} run to Holmes Inn, where Harriet Holmes was postmistress.The Congregational Church was also opened in 1863. It was built by Mr ES Thomas who was also the lay preacher. Mr Thomas was an Ipswich Councillor and the local JP. As a JP he also filled the role of acting magistrate on occasions. He built the now heritage listed house at 43 William Street and owned the adjacent general store and bakery. Mr Thomas originally operated a general store in Brisbane Road but this was flooded in 1893. They had to move their best <b>things</b> <b>into</b> {{the top floor of the}} nearby hotel. There was one acting police sergeant and a constable by 1868. W. Law established himself as a blacksmith in 1870, the year in which the Goodna State School opened.|$|E
500|$|Some of Ibn Khaldūn's thoughts, {{according}} to some commentators, anticipate the biological theory of evolution. In 1377, Ibn Khaldūn wrote the Muqaddimah in which he asserted that humans developed from [...] "the world of the monkeys," [...] in a process by which [...] "species become more numerous" [...] In chapter 1 he writes: [...] "This world with all the created things in it has a certain order and solid construction. It shows nexuses between causes and things caused, combinations of some parts of creation with others, and transformations of some existent <b>things</b> <b>into</b> others, in a pattern that is both remarkable and endless." ...|$|E

500|$|While Vitalogy {{had shifted}} away from the earlier albums' {{accessible}} compositions and polished production, No Code represented a deliberate break from Tens stadium sound, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rock songs. It stood out {{with its emphasis on}} subtle harmony ("Off He Goes"), Eastern influences ("Who You Are"), and spoken word ("I'm Open"). Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs [...] "Who You Are" [...] and [...] "In My Tree". Irons stated, [...] "To turn my drum music into a song is pretty challenging, but the guys have been really supportive of me doing it, and we've worked some <b>things</b> <b>into</b> a few songs."

500|$|Evolve was {{inspired}} by hunting games Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter. Members of Turtle Rock Studios, including Robb and Ashton, thought that the gameplay of these hunting games, such as [...] animal-tracking, was seldom incorporated in an action game. As a result, {{they came up with}} the original concept of Evolve in which, if players failed at hunting the animals, they could be attacked by their targets. Instead of typical big game animals such as elephants and lions, the team imagined it to be a [...] "King Kong", which changed to an alien monster. The team picked a sci-fi setting, allowing them to add creative and unrealistic <b>things</b> <b>into</b> the game. The team also took the concept of boss battles, and expanded upon it by using the concept as a key idea when developing Evolve. The team envisioned Evolve as a video game version of Predator. The goal of Evolve was to create an experience that was new to video game players.|$|E
