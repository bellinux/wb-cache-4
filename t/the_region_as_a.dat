40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{importance}} of dealers network management cost planning. Author offer to us the model of dealers network management cost optimization that was developed on a basis of logistic curve function. The model is proposed for sales planning of regional dealers network. Author offers an example of planning the sales and necessary costs for getting them on the market of boiler manufactures. Before building a multiple regression model clusterization of regions of Ukraine is used in the article. For such a clusterization author provides to us percentage of gasified apartments in rural areas where there is no heating in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indicator of potential buyers; the percentage of total income population in <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indicator of consumer power; the percentage of gasification in rural apartments <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indicator of readiness to purchase. Author shows how with the help of multiple regression model can be obtained a rate of market reaction, which shows the change in sales depending on the cost of managing a dealer network. As a result the recommendation concerning the sales level of dealers network and cost for managing it for boiler manufacturers are proposed. ?????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ???????? ???????????? ?????? ?? ?????????? ????????? ?????. ??????? ???????????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ? ??????????? ??? ????? ?????? ?? ????? ??????? ??????...|$|R
