Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album. Titled The Hole <b>Truth...</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nothing</b> Butt, it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what would become an extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged {{on for more than}} three years.|$|E

5000|$|In 1897, Leo Tolstoy, in his What is Art?, criticized Baumgarten's book on aesthetics. Tolstoy opposed [...] "Baumgarten's trinity [...] - [...] Good, <b>Truth</b> <b>and</b> Beauty…." [...] Tolstoy {{asserted}} that [...] "these words {{not only have}} no definite meaning, but they hinder us from giving any definite meaning to existing art…." [...] Baumgarten, he said, claimed {{that there are three}} ways to know perfection: [...] "Beauty is the perfect (the absolute) perceived by the senses. Truth is the perfect perceived by reason. The good is the perfect attained by the moral will." [...] Tolstoy, however, contradicted Baumgarten's theory and claimed that good, <b>truth,</b> <b>and</b> beauty have <b>nothing</b> in common <b>and</b> may even oppose each other. [...] …the arbitrary uniting of these three concepts served as a basis for the astonishing theory according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure…came to be regarded as the highest art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the empty amusement of idle people.(What is Art?, VII.) ...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: The {{first full}} and {{sustained}} discussion of Parfit's views on objectivity in ethics Leading philosophers respond to Parfit's criticisms and advance {{our understanding of}} the arguments An essential companion volume to Parfit's On What Matters, Volume Three In the first two volumes of On What Matters Derek Parfit argues that there are objective moral <b>truths,</b> <b>and</b> other normative <b>truths</b> about what we have reasons to believe, and to want, and to do. He thus challenges a view of the role of reason in action that {{can be traced back to}} David Hume, and is widely assumed to be correct, not only by philosophers but also by economists. In defending his view, Parfit argues that if there are no objective normative <b>truths,</b> nihilism follows, <b>and</b> <b>nothing</b> matters. He criticizes, often forcefully, many leading contemporary philosophers working on the nature of ethics, including Simon Blackburn, Stephen Darwall, Allen Gibbard, Frank Jackson, Peter Railton, Mark Schroeder, Michael Smith, and Sharon Street. Does Anything Really Matter? gives these philosophers an opportunity to respond to Parfit's criticisms, and includes essays on Parfit's views by Richard Chappell, Andrew Huddleston, Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter Singer, Bruce Russell, and Larry Temkin. A third volume of On What Matters, in which Parfit engages with his critics and breaks new ground in finding significant agreement between his own views and theirs, is appearing as a separate companion volume...|$|R

2500|$|According to the {{redundancy}} {{theory of}} truth, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. [...] For example, making {{the assertion that}} [...] "'Snow is white' is true" [...] is equivalent to asserting [...] "Snow is white". [...] Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. [...] This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held {{that the use of}} words like fact <b>and</b> <b>truth</b> was <b>nothing</b> but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a [...] "linguistic muddle".|$|R
