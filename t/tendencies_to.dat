5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that the {{handling}} of armoured forces during the campaign left much to be desired. During the beginning of Guderian's attack in northern Poland, his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while, preventing a faster advance. It was only after Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the Battle of Bzura that Guderian's armour was fully unleashed. There were still lingering <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> reserve Germany's armour, even if in independent divisions, to cover an infantry advance or the flanks of advancing infantry armies. Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign, losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs, and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany's armored strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of silicon is generally nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour of silicon. Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds of silicon. The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds of silicon (see organosilicon).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the loss}} of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling {{newspapers}} and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger {{turned out to be one}} of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic <b>tendencies,</b> <b>to</b> pursue a career as a performer.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that {{feelings}} of regret are elicited by events appraised as goal incongruent and caused by the self {{and that they are}} characterized by a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair the event. Study 1 investigated whether the appraisal of self-agency increases the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair. Participants played a game in which goal-congruent and goal-incongruent events were caused by themselves (self-agency) or by a die (circumstances-agency). The <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair was measured via behavior and self-reports. Self-agency increased feelings of regret but not the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair. Moreover, our data rejected the idea that regret is more than other negative feelings associated with the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair. Study 2 confirmed the findings of Study 1 using autobiographical recall. Both studies provide support for a relation between self-agency and feelings of regret, but not between self-agency and the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair nor between the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> repair and feelings of regret. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal. Antimony has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys {{with one or more}} metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead and bismuth. Antimony has fewer <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like arsenic, antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with arsenic. This is explained by the poor shielding afforded the arsenic nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive antimony is amphoteric; pentapositive antimony is (predominately) acidic. Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, antimony forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate Sb(NO3)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise acidic pentoxide Sb2O5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of a}} hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E

25|$|Postmodernism {{describes}} a broad movement that {{developed in the}} mid- to late 20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture and criticism which marked a departure from modernism. While encompassing {{a broad range of}} ideas, postmodernism is typically defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony or rejection toward grand narratives, ideologies and various tenets of universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, moral universalism, absolute truth, and objective reality. Instead, it asserts to varying degrees that claims to knowledge and truth are products of social, historical or political discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irreverence and self-referentiality.|$|E

The autopsy showed that Ellen’s reproductive parts had not developed normally, and she had been unable to bear children.

Yet the explicit ego is very intricately organized and has self-protection mechanisms that act as a repressive barrier to subconscious tendencies. Since spiritual progress requires all subconscious <b>tendencies</b> <b>to</b> gradually pass through the conscious part of the mind and become refined and eventually eliminated, the explicit ego has to be weakened, under certain conditions, to permit this to happen.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{positive}} {{benefits associated with}} interpersonal forgiveness, the current investigation examined the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive in romantic relationships. Two studies tested {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive mediates the association between attachment models of self and other and relationship satisfaction in dating (n 184) and marital relationships (n 96). In addition, the extent <b>to</b> which the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive predicts forgiveness of an actual transgression was examined among married couples. The <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive partially mediated the relation between model of other (relationship partner) and satisfaction for those in dating relationships and for husbands. For those in marital relationships, the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive partially mediated the relation between model of self and satisfaction. In addition, for wives, endorsing a greater <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive was related to forgiveness of an actual transgression, regardless of the severity of that transgression. For husbands, endorsing a greater <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive was related to forgiveness of an actual transgression, but only for more severe transgressions. Results are discussed in terms of who is more likely to forgive and the role that the <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> forgive plays in romantic relationships. Interpersonal forgiveness is gaining increased attention (Emmons, 2000; McCullough, 2000; Worthington, 1998 a), as it is thought to promote long-term physical and mental health benefits (Berry, Worthington, Parrott, O’Connor, &Wade, 2001;McCullough et al., 1998).
