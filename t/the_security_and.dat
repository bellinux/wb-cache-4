5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and {{continuing}} throughout the 1980s, {{the intensity of}} Bahrain's political situation sharply increased. Al-Jamri, who was then participating in several petitions, was questioned multiple times and put under strict surveillance by <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>and</b> Intelligence Service. In 1984, the Islamic Enlightenment institution, with which al-Jamri was associated, was closed by the government. The government also closed other places of meeting and prohibited public seminars. Al-Jamry however opened his house for daily meetings, also offering a weekly space for public debates; he continued to do so despite several government attempts to stop him.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th century, {{recurrent}} civil wars, {{attacks from}} Bulgaria and Serbia in the Balkans and the devastation caused by ever-increasing Turkish raids hastened {{the collapse of}} the Byzantine state, which would culminate in its final fall to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Several emperors after Andronikos II also tried to re-build a fleet, especially in order to secure <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> hence the independence of Constantinople itself from the interference of the Italian maritime powers, but their efforts produced only short-term results.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially based on the {{principle}} of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system. The government attaches a high priority to <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E

5|$|On 17 June 1936, all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united under {{the purview of}} Himmler and the SS. Himmler and Heydrich thus became {{two of the most}} powerful men in the country's administration. Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular uniformed police). In September 1939, <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> police agencies, including the Sicherheitspolizei (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), headed by Heydrich. This further increased the collective authority of the SS.|$|E

5|$|After the Joker assaults Gotham City Hall, he {{is caught}} by Batman {{and taken to}} Arkham Asylum, which {{temporarily}} houses {{many members of the}} Joker's gang, who were transferred after a fire at Blackgate Prison. Believing the Joker allowed himself to be captured, Batman accompanies him into the asylum. The Joker's plan is revealed as Harley Quinn takes control of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> the Joker escapes into the facility, aided by a corrupt guard who kidnaps Commissioner Gordon. The Joker threatens to detonate bombs hidden around Gotham City if anyone tries to enter Arkham, forcing Batman to work alone. Tracking Quinn to the medical facility to rescue Gordon, Batman is exposed to the Scarecrow's fear toxin and hallucinates, seeing Gordon's death and the corpses of his parents talking to him. After fighting off Scarecrow, Batman finds and subdues Quinn before rescuing Gordon. The Joker then directs Batman to the captured Bane, who has been experimented on by asylum doctor Penelope Young. The Joker frees Bane and Batman is forced to fight him, during which Quinn escapes. Afterward, he goes to a secret Batcave installation he had hidden on the island, where Batman restocks his gadgets.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
