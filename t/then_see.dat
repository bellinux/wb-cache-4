5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could <b>then</b> <b>see</b> the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They <b>then</b> <b>see</b> Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to dig a trench to divert the lava away from the town.|$|E
5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They <b>then</b> <b>see</b> someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace speak to a mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} many small Scottish islands, Papa Stour's {{population}} peaked in the 19th century and {{has experienced a}} significant decline since <b>then</b> (<b>see</b> e.g. Mingulay). By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen 'fairly elderly' residents, but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline. A croft and five sheep were offered free of charge to incomers which brought a flood of applicants. By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33. However, by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious discord between islanders led to several court cases. A number of people left the island and the school closed. By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left. The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011-11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E
5|$|Meermins crew, now led by Krause's {{assistant}} Olof Leij, {{managed to}} communicate with the militia on shore by means of messages in bottles, and persuaded them to light the signal fires for which the Malagasy still on board were waiting. On seeing the fires, the Malagasy cut the ship's anchor cable and allowed the ship to drift towards the shore, after which she ran aground on an offshore sandbank. The Malagasy could <b>then</b> <b>see</b> the militia on the shore preparing to come to the ship's assistance, and realised that their situation was hopeless; they surrendered and were once again shackled. Captain Muller, ship's mate Daniel Carel Gulik and Krause's assistant Olof Leij were tried in the Dutch East India Company's Council of Justice; all three were fired from the Company, while Muller and Gulik were also stripped of their rank and wages. The slaves were not tried, but the two surviving leaders of the mutiny, named in Dutch East India Company records as Massavana and Koesaaij, were sent to Robben Island for observation, where Massavana died three years later; Koesaaij survived there for another 20years. In 2004 an ongoing search was begun for Meermins remains.|$|E
5|$|They {{eventually}} meet up {{with the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), {{who is trying to}} outrun giant monsters made up of morphed-together penguins. Finn and Jake <b>then</b> <b>see</b> their father, Joshua, knitting a scarf. The scarf turns into the King Worm, and the duo give chase. On the top of a mountain, they find the worm frozen, and Finn manages to shatter it, seemingly waking the two from their dream state. However, Finn soon discovers that he is still dreaming and that Jake was not actually with him, but rather another figment of the dream. The King Worm actually presents himself and taunts Finn. Finn, however, unleashes his subconscious fears, and the emotional trauma begins to destroy the dreamscape, weakening King Worm's hold. Eventually, the fears become so powerful that the King Worm is defeated, and Finn wakes up in the real world. He and Jake promptly evicted the King Worm from their house.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They <b>then</b> <b>see</b> that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E
5|$|Thongs and Octopus {{are taken}} to the triad boss, who insists the baby is his grandson, only to be proven wrong by the blood test. Driven mad, the boss places the baby in a deep freeze room next to Max's corpse so the baby can be with his son, {{prompting}} Thongs and Octopus {{to fight for the}} baby. The two end up trapped in the room with two minions, but are saved when Inspector Mok arrives with the Landlord, who swiftly cracks the lock to the room. Thongs and Octopus run to the garage with the comatose baby, where Thongs attempts to revive him with a makeshift defibrillator powered by a car battery from a Pagani Zonda. Despite his efforts, the baby does not come to and is driven off in an ambulance, where his heart is found to be beating weakly. Imprisoned for kidnapping, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord volunteer for a mock capital punishment demonstration during an open day, using the opportunity to apologise to their loved ones. After the demonstration, Inspector Mok informs the three that their sentences have been further reduced by the Department of Justice. Thongs, Octopus, and the Landlord <b>then</b> <b>see</b> the baby alive and well with his parents. As a token of appreciation for saving the baby's life, Thongs, Octopus and the Landlord are offered jobs by the Lee family as a bodyguard, chauffeur and head of security respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundary}} between Canada and the United States along the Alaska Panhandle was only vaguely defined <b>then</b> (<b>see</b> Alaska boundary dispute). There were overlapping land claims from the United States' purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 and British claims along the coast. Canada requested a survey after British Columbia united {{with it in}} 1871, but the idea {{was rejected by the}} United States as being too costly, given the area's remoteness, sparse settlement, and limited economic or strategic interest.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, the {{regiment}} was retitled as the Wiltshire Regiment (Duke of Edinburgh's). The regiment's two battalions returned to policing the British Empire. The 1st Battalion {{would serve as}} part of the Dublin garrison during the Irish War of Independence. After the treaty, the 1st Battalion would <b>then</b> <b>see</b> service in Egypt in 1930 and Shanghai in 1931. The battalion was then made part of the Singapore garrison in 1932, where it would remain for four years. In 1936, the battalion would be assigned to India.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and <b>then</b> <b>see</b> if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E

Patrick then leaves after Robin says her work is more important then her family. Patrick soon files for divorce. It's revealed that Robin lied, and Jason is actually still alive. Victor threatened Robin into keeping quiet by having Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) run Patrick's car off the road while he, Emma, and Sabrina were inside. Sabrina and Patrick's son, Gabriel, {{died as a result of}} the accident. Robin agrees to the divorce, despite being heartbroken.|$|E
25|$|Round 2 – Antenora: {{the second}} round is named after Antenor, a Trojan soldier who betrayed his city to the Greeks. Here lie the Traitors to their Country: those who {{committed}} treason against political entities (parties, cities, or countries) have their heads above the ice, but they cannot bend their necks. Dante accidentally kicks the head of Bocca degli Abati, a traitorous Guelph of Florence, and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met. Also punished in this level are Buoso da Duera (Ghibelline leader bribed by the French to betray Manfred, King of Naples), Tesauro dei Beccheria (a Ghibelline of Pavia; beheaded by the Florentine Guelphs for treason in 1258), Gianni de' Soldanieri (noble Florentine Ghibelline who joined with the Guelphs after Manfred's death in 1266), Ganelon (betrayed the rear guard of Charlemagne to the Muslims at Roncesvalles), and Tebaldello de' Zambrasi of Faenza (a Ghibelline who turned his city over to the Bolognese Guelphs on Nov. 13, 1280).
