5|$|The 1965–66 {{season was}} one of the best (but painful) periods for Nea Salamina; the team arguably played the best {{football}} in Cyprus. The team contended for the championship until the last game of the season and lose its first cup final. In a game against APOEL at the old GSP stadium, Nea Salamina was leading 3–0. In the 62nd minute, an APOEL player hit a Nea Salamina's player; an APOEL grabbed and hid a linesman's flag. The game was halted, and the CFA ordered a rematch. The dispute lasted more than three weeks; in the meantime Nea Salamina was defeated by the bottommost team, Aris Limassol F.C.. In the penultimate match of the tournament Omonia and Salamina were tied for first place on points, and Olympiacos was one point behind. In the game against Olympiakos Nicosia Nea Salamina was leading 2–1, but Olympiakos tied the game in allegedly excessive extra time. After clashes in the last few seconds, the game was halted and ordered replayed. Omonia was in first place with 50 points; Nea Salamina was second with 47 and Olympiakos third with 46. With a victory over Olympiakos Nea Salamina would win the championship, since it had more goals than Omonia. On 31 May 1966 many buses and cars drove from Famagusta to Nicosia, where Nea Salamina was defeated 6–3. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>defense</b> in the league, which had allowed fifteen goals in nineteen games, allowed six in one game. For a second time, Nea Salamina finished third. This defeat affected team morale in the cup final with rival Apollon Limassol; although it was favored, the team lost 4–2. During this period Salamina had <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>defense</b> in the league, with 21 goals in 20 games (a team record).|$|E

Structures, such as bridges, that must unavoidably be in flood hazard areas should be designed to withstand flooding. Areas most at risk for flooding could be put to valuable uses that could be abandoned temporarily as people retreat to safer areas when a flood is imminent.|$|E

Keys to the victory were tackle Brad Benson's neutralizing of Redskins pass rusher Dexter Manley, who had 18.5 sacks on the season, and the team's defense. After the game, John Madden remarked: [...] "Last year, I thought the Bears had <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>defense</b> I had ever seen.
