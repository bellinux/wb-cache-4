5|$|The Xbox SmartGlass app {{provides}} {{extended functionality}} on Xbox One, allowing devices running Windows Phone, Windows 8, iOS and Android {{to be used}} as a companion device for Xbox One features, such as powering on the console, a remote control, accessing messages and the Activity Feed, purchasing content, and providing integration with certain games and content. The SmartGlass app can also be used to stream live television to Android and Windows devices if the console is using a USB digital television <b>tuner.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 2005, {{several other}} EyeTV {{products}} had been introduced, {{such as the}} EyeTV for DTT, the EyeTV EZ and the EyeTV Wonder. The EyeTV for DTT (digital terrestrial TV) is a small USB-powered device with an antenna for receiving free over-the-air television broadcasts. It received a 4 out of 5 rating in TechRadar. A review in The Register gave it an 85 percent rating. The Eye TV Wonder was only available from July 2005 to January 2006, before being discontinued and replaced with the Eye TV EZ. The EZ was a basic, entry-level product with an analog <b>tuner</b> for watching TV on a Mac computer.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, the EyeTV HD {{product for}} {{recording}} high-definition {{cable and satellite}} programming was introduced. Because cable and satellite signals are encoded, the device must be connected to a <b>tuner</b> from a television provider. Then it provides remote controls, recording and DVR-functionality from a connected computer. A Macworld review gave the product {{four out of five}} stars. A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 Standard Firebird V {{will not}} feature the classic banjo <b>tuners</b> but Steinberger {{gearless}} <b>tuners,</b> <b>tuners</b> with the tuning key on the back, and locking mechanisms {{on top of}} the headstock. Gibson stated that they will no longer be creating banjo <b>tuners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After the Strobe Center 5000, Peterson <b>Tuners</b> re-designed their {{mechanical}} strobe tuning {{line and}} introduced {{a line of}} AutoStrobe series <b>tuners.</b> These selected the note automatically and offered programmability for advanced users. Besides the Strobe Center 5000, the AutoStrobe <b>tuners</b> are the only mechanical strobe <b>tuners</b> still made. Models include: ...|$|R
5000|$|Many 6-string [...] "upscale" [...] {{models from}} 1978-1983 {{instruments}} had adjustable sealed <b>tuners,</b> but the 12-string models continued with the covered (non-adjustable) [...] "economy" [...] <b>tuners</b> (14:1 ratio.) Others continued on using the cheaper <b>tuners.</b>|$|R
5|$|The EyeTV Diversity is a USB-powered {{device with}} dual tuners for {{receiving}} {{over the air}} television broadcasts. The tuners can be used simultaneously for an optimized signal, or one <b>tuner</b> {{can be used to}} record a channel, while another is used to watch a separate show. Diversity was first introduced in November 2006. A driver in 2009 added compatibility with Windows 7. A review in TechRadar gave EyeTV Diversity five out of five stars. PC Advisor and Pocket-Lint both gave it four out of five stars.|$|E
5|$|The EyeTV W was {{introduced}} in November 2013. It is a small 44 gram device that receives free digital over-the-air television broadcasts and makes it available to portable devices through a wireless hot spot. A review in Macworld said it was portable, {{easy to use and}} had good battery life, but noted that users can't connect to other wi-fi networks and watch TV at the same time. It gave the product 4 out of 5 stars. An EyeTV Mobile device for iPads was announced at the 2011 International Franchise Conference as the first <b>tuner</b> for the new Freeview system in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Lexus {{first entered}} the {{motorsport}} arena in 1999 when its racing unit, Team Lexus, fielded two GS 400 race {{vehicles in the}} Motorola Cup North American Street Stock Championship touring car series. In its 1999 inaugural season, Team Lexus achieved its first victory with its sixth race at Road Atlanta. Led by Sports Car Club of America and International Motor Sports Association driver Chuck Goldsborough, based in Baltimore, Maryland, Team Lexus capitalized on the debut {{of the first generation}} Lexus IS by entering three IS 300s in the third race of the 2001 Grand-Am Cup season at Phoenix, Arizona. Team Lexus won its first IS 300 victory that year at the Virginia International Raceway. In 2002, Team Lexus' competitive efforts in the Grand-Am Cup ST1 (Street <b>Tuner)</b> class achieved victories in the Drivers' and Team Championships, as well as a sweep of the top three finishes at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Quebec, Canada.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the Plus and Deluxe Plus, {{which usually}} {{featured}} Sperzel <b>tuners,</b> the Strat Ultra {{was the first}} guitar to feature Schaller staggered locking machine heads. Anyhow {{it is common to}} find Sperzel <b>tuners</b> on older Strat Ultra and Plus Deluxe models can feature Schaller locking <b>tuners</b> too.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{traditional}} layouts of <b>tuners</b> {{are called}} [...] "3+3" [...] (3 top <b>tuners</b> and 3 bottom ones) and [...] "6 in line" [...] <b>tuners,</b> though many other combinations are known, especially for bass guitars and non-6-string guitars. When {{there are no}} machine heads (i.e. <b>tuners</b> are not needed or located in some other place, for example, on guitar body), the guitar headstock may be missing completely, as in Steinberger guitar or some Chapman stick models.|$|R
5|$|That night, FBI agents wait at {{the concert}} hall for Barnett's arrival. Barnett, who goes {{completely}} unseen due to his youthful appearance, poses as a piano <b>tuner.</b> He shoots Scully in the chest during the recital and then flees, taking the cellist hostage. Mulder doesn't hesitate this time around and fires at Barnett, fatally wounding him. Scully is revealed to have survived the attack, having worn a bullet-proof vest. Despite the efforts of doctors and a mysterious CIA agent to resuscitate Barnett, he dies, and takes the secrets of Ridley's research to the grave. The episode ends with the camera zooming in on locker number 935 in a train station, implying the secrets along with Barnett's precaution, a bomb, are contained within and one day will be discovered.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, Jack {{displayed}} a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. Jack used {{a number of}} effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would be otherwise impossible with a regular guitar. When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 <b>tuner</b> pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets. In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings.|$|E
5|$|Edward Elgar {{was born}} in the small village of Lower Broadheath, outside Worcester, England. His father, William Henry Elgar (1821–1906), was raised in Dover and had been apprenticed to a London music publisher. In 1841 William moved to Worcester, where he worked as a piano <b>tuner</b> and set up a shop selling sheet music and musical instruments. In 1848 he married Ann Greening (1822–1902), {{daughter}} of a farm worker. Edward was the fourth of their seven children. Ann Elgar had converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before Edward's birth, and he was baptised and brought up as a Roman Catholic, to the disapproval of his father. William Elgar was a violinist of professional standard and held the post of organist of St. George's Roman Catholic Church, Worcester, from 1846 to 1885. At his instigation, masses by Cherubini and Hummel were first heard at the Three Choirs Festival by the orchestra in which he played the violin. All the Elgar children received a musical upbringing. By the age of eight, Elgar was taking piano and violin lessons, and his father, who tuned the pianos at many grand houses in Worcestershire, would sometimes take him along, giving him the chance to display his skill to important local figures.|$|E

50|$|The last MyStar was {{the model}} T500. It was a four-tuner set-top box {{equipped}} with two satellite <b>tuners</b> and two terrestrial <b>tuners</b> available both for viewing and recording standard definition digital free-to-air services including full {{electronic program guide}} data for Seven Network, WIN Television, Prime Television and Network Ten. (ABC, SBS and ABC2 continue to be provided via satellite). However, only two <b>tuners</b> can be used because the processor is not capable of handling all four <b>tuners</b> at once.|$|R
50|$|Many first-generation HD Radio <b>tuners</b> had {{insensitive}} <b>tuners,</b> {{which caused}} issues with reception quality. The HD Radio signal is 10 to 20 dB below a station's analog signal. In addition {{it has been}} noted that the analog section of some <b>tuners</b> displays inferior reception capabilities compared to older non-digital models.|$|R

25|$|The {{best known}} brand in strobe <b>tuner</b> {{technology}} is Peterson Tuners who in 1967 marketed their first strobe <b>tuner,</b> the Model 400. Other companies, such as Sonic Research, TC Electronic, and Planet Waves, sell highly accurate LED-based true strobe tuners. Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates {{the appearance of}} a strobe. However, the accuracy of these tuners in strobe mode, while sufficient for most tuning, is no better than in any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic <b>tuner</b> to measure frequency, only displaying {{it in a way that}} imitates a strobe <b>tuner.</b>|$|E
25|$|A clip-on <b>tuner</b> clips {{on to an}} instrument—such as {{onto the}} {{headstock}} of a guitar or the bell of a trombone. A vibration sensor built into the clip tranmits the instrument vibrations to the tuning circuitry. The absence of a microphone makes these tuners immune to background noise, so musicians can tune in noisy environments, including while other musicians are tuning. The clip-on <b>tuner</b> was invented in 1995 by Mark Wilson of OnBoard Research Corporation, which marketed it as The Intellitouch <b>Tuner</b> Model PT1.|$|E
50|$|In {{about four}} hours one day in 1963, Keith and Bump drew the {{prototype}} for a more streamlined version of Scruggs’s <b>tuners.</b> In 1964, after showing the <b>tuners</b> to Scruggs, Keith and Bump went into business {{with a couple of}} thousand dollars and began assembling the <b>tuners</b> (which they had made locally) in Bump’s garage.|$|R

50|$|Many {{electronic}} <b>tuners</b> used by musicians emit {{a tone of}} 440Hz, {{corresponding to}} a pitch of A above Middle C (A4). More sophisticated <b>tuners</b> offer a choice of other reference pitches to account for differences in tuning. Some specialized <b>tuners</b> offer pitches used commonly on a particular instrument (standard guitar tuning, fifth intervals for string instruments, the open tones for various brass instruments).|$|R

5000|$|During {{this period}} Optonica still offered analog AM-FM <b>tuners</b> and amplifiers, but new digital <b>tuners</b> and amps were now offered with a Toroidal power {{transformer}} that allowed for high {{performance in a}} smaller size, offering {{two to three times}} the capacity of conventional transformers. This allowed for the new digital <b>tuners</b> and receivers to be much smaller in size, compared with the conventional line of products.|$|R
25|$|Some {{versions}} of Microsoft Windows, as supplied, allow ClearType {{to be turned}} on or off, with no adjustment; other versions allow tuning of the ClearType parameters. A Microsoft ClearType <b>tuner</b> utility is available for free download for Windows versions lacking this facility. If ClearType is disabled in the operating system, applications with their own ClearType controls can still support it. Microsoft Reader (for e-books) has its own ClearType <b>tuner.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The FCC stated that, as of March 1, 2007, all {{televisions}} must {{be equipped}} with digital <b>tuners,</b> but stores that had TV sets with analog <b>tuners</b> only could continue to sell analog-tuner TV sets.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{expensive}} <b>tuners</b> {{also include}} an on-board speaker that can sound notes, either to facilitate tuning by ear or {{to act as}} a pitch reference point for intonation practice. Some expensive <b>tuners</b> provide an adjustable read time that controls at what time interval the circuitry assesses pitch. The combination of all the above features makes some <b>tuners</b> preferable for tuning instruments in an orchestra. These are sometimes called [...] "orchestral tuners".|$|R
50|$|Older, Fresno-area-based {{terrestrial}} <b>tuners</b> may/may {{not receive}} the Channel 32 broadcast(s).
