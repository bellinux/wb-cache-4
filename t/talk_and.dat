5|$|I believe few plays {{have ever}} adventured {{into the world}} under greater {{disadvantage}} than this. First, as it succeeded a comedy which, for the continued space of twenty-eight nights, received as great (and as just) applauses, as ever were bestowed on the English Theatre. And secondly, as it is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> admiration of the town.|$|E
5|$|In late November, after most of {{the initial}} <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> {{speculation}} about the video, its creator and purpose had died down, a Twitter account was opened under the name Parker Warner Wright.

5|$|Karlheinz Stockhausen {{employed}} {{noise in}} vocal compositions, such as Momente (1962–64/69), {{in which the}} four choirs clap their hands, <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> shuffle their feet, in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds {{as well as to}} incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by the performers.|$|E

The researchers proposed that ideas about <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> drawing derived from interactions between children and the design students could be useful for discerning possibilities for children’s classroom <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> drawing. The purpose of the study, therefore, was to provide insight into how <b>talking</b> <b>and</b> drawing could be used as tools for thinking about designs and how those insights could provide direction for teaching design technology in elementary classrooms...|$|R

5|$|Dragon Quest II is a {{role-playing}} video game. It {{allows the}} player to control {{more than one}} character, each of whom has their own characteristics, {{and it is the}} first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members {{during the course of the}} game. The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had only met one person with whom he could <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E

5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E

Prime minister Azhari described this as seditious <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> threatened to use force to prevent secession from Sudan by the south. In May 1955 Isma'il al-Azhari announced that Sudan would seek complete independence, a reversal of the earlier NUP position in favor of union with Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Offitt's {{membership}} has tired of endless <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> plans a general strike, {{a fact of}} which Farnham is informed by Mr. Temple, a salty-talking vice president of a rolling mill. An element among the strikers also plans to loot houses along Algonquin Avenue, including Farnham's. The strike begins, paralyzing Buffland's commerce, though it is initially nonviolent. Neither the mayor nor the chief of police, when approached by Farnham, are willing to guard Algonquin Avenue. Farnham proceeds to organize Civil War veterans, and purchases weapons to arm them. After Farnham's force rescues the mayor from being attacked, he deputizes them as special police—on condition there is no expense to the city.|$|E
