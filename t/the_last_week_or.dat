500|$|In July 2015, Greg Berlanti, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said: We've just been breaking into it over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so actually ... so we're, really, excited about it. We've got a great story lined up for {{towards the end of}} the fall, early winter. This year our real hope is to make a crossover that's even bigger, and even more rewarding for the audience than the last years. The scripts for the [...] "Heroes Join Forces" [...] crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim.|$|E

[...] On 8 May 2016, Oldfield announced via his Facebook group page that the new Ommadawn project with the tentative title of Return to Ommadawn is finished, and he is awaiting a release date from the record company. He also suggested that he may soon be starting work on a possible fourth Tubular Bells album.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1995, {{there was}} a {{leadership}} election for the Conservative Party, in which Major resigned {{as leader of the}} party and stood in the election. Powell wrote, [...] "He says to the Sovereign: I no longer am leader of the majority party in the House of Commons; but I am carrying on as your Prime Minister. Now I don't think anybody can say that—at least without inflicting damage on the constitution". To seek to offer advice to the Queen whilst unable to feel they could command a majority in the Commons was [...] "tantamount to treating the monarch herself with disrespect and denying the very principle in which our parliamentary democracy is founded". After Major's challenger, John Redwood, was defeated, Powell wrote to him, [...] "Dear Redwood, you will never regret the events of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two. Patience will evidently have to be exercised—and patience is the greatest of the political virtues—by those of us who want to keep Britain independent and self-governed".|$|E

50|$|Adult D. opalescens {{move off}} the {{continental}} shelf {{by day and}} can be found to depths of 500 m. Adult shoals return to the surface at night to hunt. At some point these shoals move on shore to spawn where aggregations can reach million of individuals. Originally it was thought that the adults died after spawning, as the egg beds were often littered with dead squid. Now there is debate as to how long adults live after their first egg deposition and whether they can spawn repeatedly over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months of their lives.|$|R
40|$|From a {{time when}} electoral shifts in The Netherlands were minor tremors hardly detect-able to other than the {{political}} seismologists, elections now produce changes of greater force on the political Richter scale, easily noticeable by even the most casual observer. The decline in religious voting since the mid 1960 s and the breakdown in socialization whereby younger voters no longer automatically follow the patterns of their parents have greatly increased the ‘floating vote’. As many as one-third of the voters now switch their preference between elections, and almost one-fifth of the voters now say that they determine this preference during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> days before <b>the</b> election.

40|$|From {{an initial}} {{focus on the}} care of people in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> days of life, the {{principles}} and practice of palliative care have been increasingly recognized as beneficial for people earlier in their disease trajectory, {{from the point of}} diagnosis (Ahmedzai & Walsh, 2000; World Health Organization, 2005). Yet {{the reality is that the}} majority of patients receiving care from hospice and specialist palliative services are in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> months, <b>weeks,</b> <b>or</b> days of life (Eve, Smith, & Tebbit, 1997; Lamont & Christakis, 2002). In addition, although the relevance of palliative care to people who die from conditions other than cancer is increasingly recognized (Addington-Hall & Higginson, 2001), the majority of patients currently receiving care in most settings have cancer, with most of the remainder having AIDS or neurological conditions such as motor neurone disease. This article focuses on the challenges of working as a researcher with people with advanced, progressive disease who are coming to the end of their lives. Our empathy with and compassion for our fellow human beings facing the end of their lives can cause us to find the idea of palliative care research rather unsettling, and to even question whether it is an appropriate pursuit. To address this satisfactorily we need, I think, a clear sense of the potential benefits of research in this area, the risks of not doing such research, and the ethical dimensions of such research...|$|R

He changes the laws so that his Granddaughter can be the heir to the throne. By <b>the</b> <b>last</b> story his mind is starting to go, and he starts seeing the ghost of his long lost friend Achaka. He starts forgetting many of the details of his story, having to have Gwendolyn fill in the gaps whenever possible, and even put together the pieces to tell the final outcome of the story. That night he passes away but left a letter for his granddaughter to read, telling her to find her own legacy, and not live off of his.|$|R
