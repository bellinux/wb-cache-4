5|$|The Mariners faced much {{adversity}} in the Newcastle region {{because of}} the Australian Rugby League's Newcastle Knights team being already well established in the region. The club played its home games at <b>Topper</b> Stadium and missed out on the finals of the 1997 Super League season, but made the grand final of the World Club Challenge.

5000|$|It is {{a popular}} {{assumption}} in newspaper strip fan circles that World War II is what killed the <b>toppers.</b> I'll grant you {{that it was the}} coup de grace, but <b>toppers</b> were on the wane well before then. 1935 seems to be the last year when <b>toppers</b> are truly ubiquitous, and thereafter many papers started dropping them in favor of half-page versions of the A-list strips. <b>Toppers</b> become decidedly rare as of about 1940, though many cartoonists kept producing them long thereafter. Some later <b>toppers</b> are so rare as to make one wonder if they ever actually ran in any newspaper—the only evidence I've found of some is on original art.|$|R

5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart <b>topper</b> it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is so hard to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
