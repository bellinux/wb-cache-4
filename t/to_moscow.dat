They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky <b>to</b> <b>Moscow</b> and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed <b>to</b> <b>Moscow</b> either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven <b>to</b> <b>Moscow,</b> but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Information about Wallenberg {{after his}} {{detention}} is mostly speculative; {{there were many}} witnesses who claim to have met him during his imprisonment. Wallenberg was transported by train from Debrecen, through Romania, <b>to</b> <b>Moscow.</b> The Soviet authorities may have moved him <b>to</b> <b>Moscow</b> {{in the hope of}} exchanging him for defectors in Sweden. Vladimir Dekanozov notified the Swedish government on 16 January 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet authorities. On 21 January 1945, Wallenberg was transferred to Lubyanka prison and held in cell 123 with fellow prisoner Gustav Richter, who had been a police attaché at the German embassy in Romania.

30|$|For the EU {{to secure}} its short and medium term energy needs, it {{may need to}} placate Russian {{concerns}} and cater <b>to</b> <b>Moscow’s</b> demands for regional domination and neighbourly suzerainty.

5|$|This victory {{ultimately}} cost Napoleon his army, as {{it allowed}} the French emperor {{to believe that}} the campaign was winnable, exhausting his forces as he went on <b>to</b> <b>Moscow</b> to await a surrender that would never come. Historian Rhiem notes that the Borodino victory allowed Napoleon to move on <b>to</b> <b>Moscow,</b> where—even allowing for the arrival of reinforcements—the French Army only possessed a maximum of 95,000men, who would be ill-equipped to win a battle {{due to a lack of}} supplies and ammunition. The Grande Armée suffered 66% of its casualties by the time of the Moscow retreat; snow, starvation, and typhus ensured that only 23,000men crossed the Russian border alive. Furthermore, while the Russian army suffered heavy casualties in the battle, they had fully recovered by the time of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow; they immediately began to interfere with the French withdrawal, costing Napoleon much of his surviving army.|$|E
