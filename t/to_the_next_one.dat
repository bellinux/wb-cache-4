5|$|The game's puzzles {{are divided}} into groups set on {{different}} planets. Players generally must complete each puzzle in order to progress <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> but the game includes optional harder puzzles. Final boss levels, called out as defense levels, complete each planet; here, the player must efficiently create chemicals and deliver them in a timely manner, once the reactor systems have been started, to trigger defense systems to ward off attacking enemies before they destroy a control structure.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness is an {{isometric}} platform game {{in which}} the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a trackball, though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim {{of the game is}} for the player to complete six maze-like, isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock {{at the end of a}} race is carried over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil: Revelations is a {{survival}} horror game where the player controls the on-screen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} the environment and enemies. In the game's single-player campaign, the player must complete a series of scenarios collected together into episodes. Most of the scenarios involve the player controlling Jill Valentine aboard a ghost ship in the Mediterranean Sea, but some require the player to play as other characters in different settings. To finish a scenario and proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> the player must complete certain objectives such as solving puzzles, defeating a boss, collecting keys that open doors to new areas, and reaching a specific point in the game, among others.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating {{him through a}} maze of consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one</b> in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E

25|$|Water wheel {{technology}} {{was developed to}} a high level during the Roman period, a fact attested both by Vitruvius (in De Architectura) and by Pliny the Elder (in Naturalis Historia). The largest complex of water wheels existed at Barbegal near Arles, where the site was fed by a channel from the main aqueduct feeding the town. It is estimated that the site comprised 16 separate overshot water wheels arranged in two parallel lines down the hillside. The outflow from one wheel became the input <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one</b> down in the sequence.|$|E
25|$|The player {{controls}} Pac-Man {{through a}} maze of various dots, known as Pac-Dots, as well as four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal of the game is to consume all the Pac-Dots in a stage in order to proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one.</b> Between some stages, one of three intermission animations plays. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touch Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus life at 10,000 points by default—DIP switches inside the machine can change the required points to 15,000 or 20,000, or disable the bonus life altogether. The number of lives can be set to 1 life only or up to five lives maximum. High score cannot exceed 999,990 points; players may exceed that score, but the game keeps the last 6 digits.|$|E
25|$|Apart from writing, the {{fundamental}} priestly sciences were arithmetics and calendrics. Within the social {{group of the}} priests at court, it had by Classical times become customary to deify the numbers {{as well as the}} basic day-unit, and – particularly in the south-eastern kingdoms of Copan and Quirigua – to conceive the mechanism of time as a sort of relay or estafette in which the 'burden' of the time-units was passed on from one divine numerical 'bearer' <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one.</b> The numbers were personified not by distinctive numerical deities, but by some of the principal general deities, who were thus seen to be responsible for the ongoing 'march of time'. The day-units (k'in) were often depicted as the patrons of the priestly scribes and diviners (ah k'in) themselves, that is, as Howler Monkey Gods, who seem to have been conceived as creator deities in their own right. In the Postclassic period, the time-unit of the katun was imagined as a divine king, as the 20 named days still are among the traditional 'day-keepers' of the Guatemalan Highlands. On a more abstract level, the world was assumed to be governed by certain fundamental numbers, first of all the numbers 13 and 20 that, multiplied, defined both the mantic day count and, on a vast scale, the amount of time elapsed before the first day (5 Imix 9 Kumk'u) of the Long Count.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ghost" [...] was {{directed}} by Belgian director Pierre Debusschere. Beyoncé is seen wearing a swimsuit by Seafolly with a nude mesh midsection and her look is also complete with red lips. While creating the video for [...] "Pretty Hurts", she sent a note to director Melina Matsoukas requesting from her to include footage from her childhood as the clip was meant to connect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one</b> on the album, [...] "Ghost". The video openes with a close-up shot of Beyoncé's face lip-syncing the song's lyrics. Various shots of the singer with different outfits and placed at different sets are featured. Other scenes show a dancer with his whole body covered in a white clothing.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics. Blogcritics reviewer Aaraon Peck applauded the Perry and Doofenshmirtz B-Plot, considering it {{as both the}} official Pret episode and {{an example of the}} series' ability to allow [...] "adults [...] enjoy the humor" [...] and not strictly focusing on the entertainment of younger viewers. Conversely, Ed Liu of Toon Zone was critical of the episode and other early episodes available on The Fast and the Phineas, calling them [...] "way too manic for their own good, never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> and refusing to sit still for any length of time." [...] The production staff reacted positively to the episode, and said that they [...] "really liked" [...] its outcome.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV, Beyoncé stated that the songs put altogether tell a complete story and noted that each song was a subsequent continuation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one.</b> She concluded, [...] " [...] this whole journey of this group of women trying to find love. And truly they find it because they love themselves and find it in themselves. It's friendship, it's love, it's maturity and growth, and it's everything that we wanted it to be." [...] For {{the music of the}} album, the group tried challenging themselves, working with different arrangements, trying to create an original sound; to succeed in this, they were influenced by The Emotions, Jodeci and SWV mixing elements of their music. Destiny Fulfilled is predominantly an R concept album tracing a woman's relationship journey. Critics further found elements of soul music, dance and hip-hop. The album is mostly composed of mid and slowtempo balladry following the opening two songs; Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that the ballads showcased [...] "the girliness in the trio, musically and lyrically". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine found elements of middle of the road music in the ballads.|$|E

500|$|During {{the shuffle}} format era, the show {{introduced}} a new lifeline, [...] "Jump the Question", which {{was able to be}} used twice in a single game for seasons nine through twelve. At any point prior to selecting a final answer, a contestant could use Jump the Question to skip the current question and move on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one,</b> thus reducing the number of questions they had to correctly answer. However, if the contestant used Jump the Question, they did not gain any money from the question they chose to skip (for example, a contestant would not gain the typical $100,000 if they jumped to the $250,000 question). This lifeline could not be used on the $1 million question, since it is the final question in the game. The [...] "Plus One" [...] lifeline, introduced in season thirteen, allows a contestant to bring a companion with him or her to the podium for help in answering a question. The introduction of this lifeline reduced the number of Jump the Question lifelines available from two to one. On occasional specially designated weeks, starting with a Halloween-themed week that aired from October 29 to November 2, 2012, the shuffle format used a special lifeline called [...] "Crystal Ball", which allows the contestant to see the money value of a round one question prior to giving an answer. Jump the Question was removed {{at the end of the}} show's thirteenth syndicated season. For the show's fourteenth season, during a special week of college shows, players got another lifeline called [...] "Extra Help", played similarly to [...] "Plus One" [...] and allowing for another companion to help the player; however, it could only be used after [...] "Plus One" [...] was used.|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, {{the band}} rented {{a home in}} the San Diego luxury {{community}} of Rancho Santa Fe, planning to record the entire album there. In addition to the home being converted into a studio, pay-per-view pornography was on continuous play, and it included a space to [...] "smoke hella weed" [...] in the garage. The trio ditched their typical previous recording process (writing and demoing several songs and recording them in a studio one instrument at a time) and instead approached each song together. The band [...] "attacked" [...] each song and worked on three to four songs per day, simply moving on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one</b> when feeling [...] "burned out" [...] on a track. The band also had fun at the home studio; DeLonge commented, [...] "If I wasn’t smoking half of Colombia I probably ran up $3 million in adult film charges." [...] The band recorded at the home until April 2003, when the owners of the house [...] "kicked them out." [...] Barker, unwilling to leave Moakler, would drive from Los Angeles to San Diego each day. He subsequently left that spring to tour with Transplants, leaving the band with a variety of drum tracks to listen to while he was gone. The band regrouped after being [...] "kicked out" [...] by the owners of the house they were recording in and began recording at Rolling Thunder studios until the band left to perform a couple of summer shows in Canada and Japan, where they premiered several songs live. The in-studio antics and behind the scenes moments were recorded and posted on the official Blink-182 website throughout 2003, as well as on a MTV album release segment.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Carey's debut album, which {{featured}} a more contemporary pop and R background, Emotions {{proved to be}} far different. It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel, R, soul, pop and 1960s and 1970s influences. The album's lead single [...] "Emotions" [...] borrowed heavily from 1970s disco, and flaunted Carey's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register. The song's lyrics were described as [...] "joyful" [...] by author Chris Nickson, and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover. One of the album's more gospel infused songs, [...] "And You Don't Remember," [...] featured organ chord changes and held minimal production {{in order to give}} the vocals a more [...] "raw and sixties feel." [...] It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to Motown ballads, with the inclusion of soft church choir vocals, and sole musical arrangement by Carey. Its lyrics reflected the song's raw chorus, telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend, and quickly forget about her and moves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>one.</b> After the heartbreak, the protagonist asks him [...] "Don't You Remember" [...] all those things he had promised her, and the things they had spoken and dreamed about doing together. [...] "Can't Let Go," [...] the album's second single, is a slow ballad, featuring sad and yearning lyrical content. The song's introduction featured minor chord changes, and drew influence from fifties balladry. For the duration {{of the first half of}} the song, Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers, eventually leading to the belted crescendo and falsetto and whistle finish. Of the ten tracks on the album, Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on [...] "Make It Happen," [...] which told of Carey's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia. It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God. Nickson described its instrumentation as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "very Motownish," [...] as well as noting its soft gospel infusion. Critically, the most anticipated song on the album was Carey's collaboration with King. It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres. According to Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation: ...|$|E
