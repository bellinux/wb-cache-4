Rove {{told the audience}} [...] "My contribution to this was <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reporter, which is a lesson about talking to reporters, the words 'I heard that too,'...Remember, the underlying offense of Armitage talking to Novak was no violation. There was no indictment." ...|$|E

Although he heads the 6th largest bank in Canada, {{he was the most}} compensated banking executive in 2015. He was criticized for sitting on too many boards as CEO, however Vachon rebutted the claim saying that it was [...] "odd" [...] <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> CEO, [...] "you can’t sit on an external board even though your company is a major shareholder.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe {{may have}} {{significantly}} contributed to Van Gogh's poor health. [...] When {{he lived in}} Paris, absinthe was a popular drinks among artists. Paul Signac commented that Van Gogh drank steadily drinks of brandy following drinks of absinthe. By the time Van Gogh left Paris he was in very poor health and known <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend that drinking and smoking left him [...] "seriously sick at heart and in body and nearly an alcoholic." [...] According to author Doris Lanier, author of [...] "Absinthe the Cocaine of the Nineteenth Century": Many of Van Gogh's symptoms following his arrival in Paris are indicative of absinthe poisoning: stomach and nervous system problems, hallucinations and convulsions.|$|E

2500|$|Wood modeled and did local commercials. He got {{his first}} break in the video for Paula Abdul's [...] "Forever Your Girl", {{directed}} by David Fincher. This {{was followed by a}} pivotal role in the TV film, Child in the Night, and a minor role in Back to the Future Part II. Nine-year-old Wood auditioned for a role in Kindergarten Cop, but was told by director Ivan Reitman that his performance was not believable, which Wood later said was [...] "a harsh thing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nine-year-old". Playing Aidan Quinn's son in Avalon and Tin Men garnered professional attention for Wood; Avalon received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards. A small part in Richard Gere's Internal Affairs was followed by the role of a boy who brings estranged couple Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson back together in Paradise (1991). Wood co-starred with Mel Gibson and Jamie Lee Curtis in Forever Young (1992) and Joseph Mazzello in Radio Flyer.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} {{volume of the}} book A Positively Final Appearance (1997), Guinness recounts grudgingly giving an {{autograph}} to a young fan {{who claimed to have}} watched Star Wars over a hundred times, on the condition that the boy promise to stop watching the film because [...] "this {{is going to be an}} ill effect on your life". The fan was stunned at first but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently). Guinness is quoted as saying: [...] "'Well', I said, 'do you think you could promise never to see Star Wars again?' He burst into tears. His mother drew herself up to an immense height. 'What a dreadful thing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> child!' she barked, and dragged the poor kid away. Maybe she was right but I just hope the lad, now in his thirties, is not living in a fantasy world of second hand, childish banalities." [...] Guinness grew so tired of modern audiences apparently knowing him only for his role of Obi-Wan Kenobi that he would throw away the mail he received from Star Wars fans without reading it.|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

60|$|To {{what do you}} {{attribute}} this improvement?--Partly to {{the healthy}} and proper efforts which {{have been made to}} elevate the working classes; partly, I am sorry <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ambitious desire throughout the nation always to get on <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point which it has not yet reached, and which makes one man struggle with another in every way.
