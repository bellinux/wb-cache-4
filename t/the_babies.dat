5|$|Seeing {{the damage}} they've done, <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> quickly rush back downstairs as the projectionist notices the {{incredible}} mess {{and tries to}} save the film unsuccessfully. Grandpa Lou finds them after getting some snacks from the concession stand (he comments on the mess <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> caused, telling Larry and Steve how in his time {{they knew how to}} keep a work place clean). Grandpa Lou takes them back with him to the Dummi Bears movie, which catches in the projector and melts The Land Without Smiles at the climax, leaving most of the audience groaning. <b>The</b> <b>babies</b> smile at each other at this, while Grandpa Lou eats some popcorn.|$|E
5|$|As in , Baby Mario and the Yoshi clan must rescue Baby Luigi, who was {{snatched}} by Bowser's minion, Kamek, {{who also}} wanted to kidnap every baby around the world. However, this time the Yoshis have the combined assistance of both Baby Peach and Baby Donkey Kong, {{as well as the}} stork, who escaped the botched capture by the Magikoopa. They later join with Baby Wario and Baby Bowser, who offer their specialized abilities so that the group may proceed. However, Baby Wario's lust for treasure leads him to abandon his duties while Baby Bowser was captured by Kamek (who is actually the future Kamek that appears throughout the forts and castles), and later kicked out by the Adult Bowser, who came from the future, for his baby counterpart insults him. Baby Bowser then joined the group until he noticed Kamek and after him, leaving Yoshi and the other babies to continue their journey. Much later in the game, Kamek's sinister plan for kidnapping <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> around the world has been revealed. He and Bowser travels back in time in search of the star children—seven babies whose hearts possess unimaginable power necessary for him to conquer the universe. Despite kidnapping all of <b>the</b> <b>babies,</b> they couldn't find a single star child. Yoshi's group later arrives at Bowser's castle and Baby Wario and Baby Bowser, arguing for after the treasure from Bowser's castle. They later joined the group and as they arrived at the final room, Baby Bowser betrays them, claiming that Yoshi and the other babies wanted Bowser's treasure in his castle.

5|$|They then wander to the {{concessions}} stand. There <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> find popcorn, orange and grape sodas, lids, napkins, cups, candy bars, ketchup, mustard and straws (the two teenage employees in charge, Larry and Steve, don't notice <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> because they're arguing over comic books). Tommy checks the popcorn both for Reptar, while Phil and Lil take {{interest in the}} soda dispensers, pushing the buttons and spilling the soft drinks on the counters and floors until eventually they get stuck continuously pouring soda. Meanwhile, Chuckie, after sampling some candy, notices some stairs leading up while Phil and Lil start playing with the ketchup and mustard dispensers by the hot dog sections. Phil & Lil plays with straws and spill all the straws. After Chuckie points out the stairs, Tommy concludes they'll find Reptar upstairs. As soon as <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> leave, the two teenagers notice the massive mess and scream.|$|E
50|$|Later, Bartell {{discovered}} that {{two women and}} <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> were seen around Deer Creek. The detective also {{was able to find}} <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> <b>The</b> witness testified that Norton left <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> with a boy, and asked him to take <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> home. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> was unharmed, but her clothing was covered with blood.|$|R
50|$|Angel {{tries to}} get to <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> but <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> falls. Kit sees <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> fall and catches him. Angel and Solly come down with <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> safely wrapped in Kit's jacket.|$|R
5000|$|Look for <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> belly button. If {{the belly}} button is visible while <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is latched, <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> not {{comfortable}} enough to latch well.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes that {{appeared}} in the storyboard and animatic were reordered or dropped altogether in {{the final version of the}} episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A scene in which <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Alan and Tequila {{discover}} a hidden {{passage in the}} hospital leading to Wong's arsenal. They are confronted by Mad Dog, who engages them. Wong arrives {{at the hospital and}} has all the patients, police officers and staff taken hostage. After fighting their way to the main lobby, Alan and Tequila liberate the kidnapped patients and police officers. Pang evacuates the lobby while police detective Teresa Chang (Teresa Mo) goes to the maternity ward to organize evacuating <b>the</b> <b>babies.</b> Alan and Tequila continue fighting gangsters until they find Mad Dog. While Tequila goes to assist Chang with <b>the</b> <b>babies,</b> Alan and Mad Dog find themselves in a standoff with a group of patients caught in the middle. They slowly put their guns down and offer the patients safe passage, until Wong appears and shoots them all. An enraged Mad Dog shoots Wong's gun out of his hand. Wong shoots and kills Mad Dog while Alan escapes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>babies</b> {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return the lizard to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> sneak into the ice rink and present the lizard to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens to possess a phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the ice rink.|$|E
5000|$|Don't let <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> get {{too warm}} during sleep. Keep <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> warm during sleep, {{but not too}} warm. <b>The</b> <b>baby's</b> room should be at a {{temperature}} that is comfortable for an adult. Too many layers of clothing or blankets can overheat <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b>|$|R
50|$|Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Janet Waldo) is {{instructed}} {{to look after}} <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> while his mother goes out. However, Jeannie pays {{more attention to the}} telephone than her actual babysitting. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to where it came from simply results in <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> escaping from <b>the</b> pram again. During one escape, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> and is promptly attacked, scratched and bit. This time, Tom angrily brings <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> away from her.|$|R
5000|$|Do {{not allow}} smoking around <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Don't smoke {{before or after}} the birth of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and make sure no one smokes around <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b>|$|R
5|$|The battle {{system is}} similar to its predecessor's, with the {{effectiveness}} of an attack dependent on the timing accuracy of separate actions. The battles still consist of turn-based attacks executed by Mario and Luigi, although these are compounded by the babies' actions during an attack. The Bros. movesmoves performed by Mario and Luigi collectivelyhave been replaced by Bros. Items, which are finite attacks that are gained in the overworld. Similar to the Bros. moves, these are more damaging attacks that can be performed by all 4 characters collectively. Only the adults receive damage, even though <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> will become vulnerable once their respective partners have been eliminated from battle. The elimination of babies will also affect battle as some Bros. Items will become disabled, and the party {{will not be able}} to defend itself with hammers, which are wielded exclusively by <b>the</b> <b>babies.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{an internship}} {{and a trip}} abroad for postgraduate studies, DeLee was ready {{to set up a}} medical practice by the age of 25. Noting that obstetric care in Chicago was often inadequate, he opened a clinic on Chicago's Maxwell Street after consulting with the noted social worker Jane Addams. Early on, DeLee provided prenatal care to the neighborhood's women, but <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> were delivered by midwives in the area. Over time, hundreds of women began having their babies delivered by DeLee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to adopt this systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the birth}} of a baby, Kumajwk gives a secret name to <b>the</b> newly born <b>baby</b> which is not told to anybody, and Lomajwk {{receives}} <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and starts nursing <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> <b>The</b> Kumajwk ties navel of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and cuts it. Till the natural fall of <b>the</b> <b>baby’s</b> navel, <b>the</b> Kumajwk and the Lomajwk are treated as Kunsu (unholy/unsanctity).|$|R
50|$|The police train {{their guns}} on Tsotsi, {{ordering}} {{him to return}} <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> However, John urges them to lower their weapons {{so that he can}} retrieve <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> himself. As Tsotsi holds <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in his arms, John convinces him to give up <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Tsotsi emotionally hands <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to John, then is told to put up his hands and turns himself in as the film ends.|$|R
5000|$|Make sure <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> {{face and}} head stay {{uncovered}} during sleep. Keep blankets and other coverings away from <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> mouth and nose. The {{best way to}} do this is to dress <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in sleep clothing so there will not have to use any other covering over <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> If using a blanket or another covering, make sure that <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> feet are at the bottom of the crib, the blanket is no higher than <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> chest, and <b>the</b> blanket is tucked in around the bottom of the crib mattress.|$|R
5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} want <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> to die like their mother, he decides to hatch the eggs, and {{secretly}} keeps the eggs warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, the eggs eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from the eggs, whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|As {{the patrons}} leave due to not {{receiving}} a refund, the pictures going black {{when they were}} getting to important scenes, and complain about {{the taste of the}} popcorn (due to the mess <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> have made in the concession stand), Stu is angry at the fact that The Land Without Smiles went out at the climax. But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, but at a different theater. As Grandpa Lou eats a candy bar in the back seat, Tommy takes notice of a flashing Reptar billboard as they drive by.|$|E
5|$|First {{appearing}} in Dead 'Ard and Warrior, The Black Currant returned {{in a series}} of White Dwarf Thrud strips titled Thrud the Destroyer. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating <b>the</b> <b>babies.</b> The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow's self-published Thrud the Barbarian comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.|$|E
50|$|In the {{resulting}} commotion, the priest is knocked over, <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is sent flying, and Rothko breaks free. The man catches <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and chases Rothko {{out of the}} church, only to see the dog struck by a vehicle. The dying dog tells the man that he should now seek out legal counsel from <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> before he dies. When the man asks to speak to <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> father punches him.|$|R
60|$|More pleased than {{he dared}} confess to {{himself with the}} praise of this common girl, Mr. James North assented. Then would he see <b>the</b> <b>baby?</b> He would, and Trinidad Joe having already seen <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> and talked of <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> and felt <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> and indeed had <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> offered to him in every way during the past night, {{concluded}} to give some of his valuable time to logging, and left them together.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the next}} day the Ochai {{performs}} Lampra Puja (Akatha, Bikatha, Twibuk Kalikha Raja, Sangrongma Mwtai) in the name of <b>the</b> newborn <b>baby</b> and name <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> and announces <b>the</b> name given to <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in <b>the</b> name giving ceremony. On the same day, the Kumajwk and the Lomajwk wearing new dresses and wrapping <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> with <b>the</b> new clothes they come out of the house along with the archery, who throws arrows in all possible directions, to drive out the evil spirits and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is shown <b>the</b> sun, moon, and made to touch the earth and brought back home after cleaning the feet of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> by <b>the</b> mother of <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> <b>The</b> Kumajwk and the Lomajwk offer all sorts of domestic equipments, cut nails and hair of <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and offer rice (mai, chakhwi, mwkhwi, mwitru, thai-tharua, kwtwi-thalwi, anwa) to <b>the</b> newborn <b>baby.</b> In that occasion, all invitees give Ayuk bokmwng (Blessings for long life) and offer money to <b>the</b> newly born <b>baby.</b>|$|R
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a hollowed out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of <b>the</b> <b>babies.</b> The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E
5|$|Becky, still crushed {{over her}} {{betrayal}} by Steve, stays with Roy and Hayley. While Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) is in prison, Becky takes part in helping Hayley {{take care of}} baby Hope (Harriet Atkins and Sadie Pilbury), whom she grows very close to and struggles to hand her back to Fiz. Becky is upset when she discovers that Tracy is pregnant with Steve's twins. Becky goes on a business meeting with Steve and attempts to seduce him, while Tracy suffers a miscarriage. Tracy assumes Steve is sleeping with Becky and goes to see her. Tracy falls {{down the stairs and}} pretends to have only just lost her babies and blames Becky. When everyone turns against her, Becky gets drunk and burns photographs of herself and Steve which causes a fire in her flat. Becky is saved from the fire by Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and vows to gain revenge on Tracy. Becky begins dating Danny Stratton (Jeremy Sheffield) who later reveals that Tracy lost <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> before her fall.

5|$|Ella tells Thomas {{about the}} deal with Rumpelstiltskin. Seeking to avoid {{fulfilling}} this deal, Thomas, Charming, Grumpy, and The Blue Fairy (Keegan Connor Tracy) {{come up with a}} plot to capture Rumpelstiltskin by luring him into signing another contract. Hours later, Ella and Rumpelstiltskin meet to sign the deal. Ella lies to him and says she is expecting twins and will give him both of <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> in exchange for improving the crops and wealth of the kingdom. A skeptical Rumpelstiltskin agrees, but as he signs the contract, he is rendered powerless due to a special red quill pen, that was created by The Blue Fairy. He is captured, but Thomas disappears soon after. Ella demands that Rumpelstiltskin tell her what has happened, but he claims not to have done anything. He reminds her that all magic has a price, and that until her debt is paid she will never see Thomas again.|$|E
5000|$|And to {{take full}} {{advantage}} of LAM, it is best that <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> face not be covered when feeding. Routinely covering <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> reduces <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> access to oxygen and visual contact with the mother, which trains <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to speed up the suckling process and thus reduces the time period, rendering LAM less effective.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the natural}} fall of baby’s navel, to purify {{the house where}} <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was born, <b>the</b> <b>baby’s</b> mother, kumajwk, lomajwk and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> itself, an Ochai is {{requested}} to perform Lampra Puja and give name to <b>the</b> newly born <b>baby.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jatakarman is {{the first}} post-natal rite of passage for a new born baby, in ancient texts of Hinduism. It celebrates <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> birth, {{as well as the}} bonding of the father with <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> During a {{traditional}} Jātakarman ritual, the father welcomes <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> by touching <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> lips with honey and ghee (clarified butter). Sometimes, this ritual is marked with recitation of Vedic hymns. The first significance of the hymns is explained in Gryhasutra texts to be medhajanana (Sanskrit: मेधाजनन), or to initiate <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> mind and intellect in the womb of the world, after <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> body formation has completed in the womb of the mother. The second part of the hymns wish <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> a long life.|$|R
5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie {{to pick a}} {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother.

Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Todd jumps bail and {{arrives in}} Port Charles upon {{learning}} that Starr {{has been involved}} in a car accident that resulted in the deaths of Cole and Hope. Todd thinks local mobster Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) is responsible for the deaths and seeks revenge.

5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was shot, <b>the</b> crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> into co-operation. One scene required <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> to suckle Chan's nipple. <b>The</b> <b>baby</b> was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|R
