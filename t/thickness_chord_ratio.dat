5000|$|Joseph Smith and {{the design}} team were aware of a paper on compressibility, {{published}} by A D Young of the R.A.E, in which he described {{a new type of}} wing section; the maximum thickness and camber would be much nearer to the mid-chord than conventional airfoils and the nose section of this airfoil would be close to an ellipse. In November 1942, Supermarine issued Specification No 470 which (in part) stated: A new wing has been designed for the Spitfire with the following objects: 1) To raise as much as possible the critical speed at which drag increases, due to compressibility, become serious. 2) To obtain a rate of roll faster than any existing fighter. 3) To reduce wing profile drag and thereby improve performance. The wing area has been reduced from [...] to [...] and a <b>thickness</b> <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 13% has been used over the inner wing where the equipment is stored. Outboard the wing tapers to 8% thickness/chord at the tip.|$|E
50|$|For comparison, modern low Mach number {{aircraft}} have root <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0.14 - 0.20.|$|R
5000|$|The FX 66-S-196 profile, with a <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> {{of almost}} 20%, made it {{possible}} to build a light and economical spar. This was important because in the late sixties glass fibre was the only affordable reinforcement material - carbon was still too expensive.|$|R
40|$|A 1 / 9 {{scale model}} of an {{existing}} executive type jet transport refitted with a supercritical wing was tested on in the 8 foot transonic pressure tunnel. The supercritical wing had the same sweep as the original airplane wing but had maximum <b>thickness</b> <b>chord</b> <b>ratios</b> 33 percent larger at the mean geometric chord and almost 50 percent larger at the wing-fuselage juncture. Wing pressure distributions and fuselage pressure distributions {{in the vicinity of}} the left nacelle were measured at Mach numbers from 0. 25 to 0. 90 at angles of attack that generally varied from - 2 deg to 10 deg. Results are presented in tabular form without analysis...|$|R
40|$|An airfoil {{family of}} {{helicopter}} rotor blades was designed. Three airfoils with <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratios</b> of 12, 9, and 7 % were designed. Their improved performance in two dimensional rotor mockup wind tunnel tests led to {{testing of the}} tapered blades on four bladed rotors in a wind tunnel and flight tests on the Dauphin series of helicopters, confirming the expected gains...|$|R
50|$|The Marais was a mid wing {{cantilever}} monoplane with wing of rectangular plan out to blunted tips, {{thick in}} section {{with a maximum}} <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 17% and mounted without dihedral. It was built around two spruce box spars, with its leading edges and tips covered in plywood and the rest with fabric. 3 m long broad ailerons were mounted on the rear spar.|$|R
50|$|The {{one-piece}} {{wing of the}} Couzinet 10 was 900 mm thick at the root, a <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 18%, and thinned continuously out to the tip. In plan each wing was trapezoidal, though long tips {{produced an}} approximately elliptical form. Long, narrow-chord ailerons filled most of the straight part of the trailing edges. It was entirely wooden, built around two box spars and plywood covered.|$|R
50|$|The four wings, {{labelled}} A to D had root <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratios</b> of 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30. The trials {{showed that}} the thickness {{had little effect on}} maximum speed: wing B was faster than A by 5 m.p.h. (less than 3%) and the other wings fell between. The maximum speed given below is for the D wing, as are the dimensions and weights.|$|R
50|$|The Cobra was a {{cantilever}} {{low wing}} monoplane {{with a wooden}} structure covered in plywood, which had an outer thin aluminium skin bonded to it. The single spar wings had a maximum <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 16.5%; in plan they were unswept and straight tapered. There was 6° of dihedral. The ailerons were fitted with electrically operated trim tabs and the inboard flaps were hydraulically powered.|$|R
25|$|The wing had {{a span of}} , with a {{wing area}} of 279 sq ft (29.6 sq m). It was {{designed}} {{with a small amount}} of inverted gull wing bend; the inner sections had a 1° anhedral, while the outer sections, attached just outboard of the undercarriage legs, had a dihedral of 5½°. The airfoil was a NACA 22 wing section, with a <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 19.5% at the root tapering to 12% at the tip.|$|R
2500|$|The Deltaviex, {{its name}} {{derived from the}} Delta VX design of Aliette at ONERA and built by SNCASO at Brétigny, was {{intended}} to explore lateral control by blown flaps instead of ailerons. Despite its name {{it did not have}} a delta wing but wings which were strongly swept and straight tapered to pointed tips. [...] The leading edge sweep was 70°, that of the trailing edge about 40° and the <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> less than 6%.|$|R
50|$|The wing had {{a span of}} 41 ft, with a {{wing area}} of 279 sq ft (29.6 sq m). It was {{designed}} {{with a small amount}} of inverted gull wing bend; the inner sections had a 1° anhedral, while the outer sections, attached just outboard of the undercarriage legs, had a dihedral of 5½°.

2500|$|This {{was to be}} an {{improved}} F.1 using a wing with a 6% <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> and powered by a Bristol Orpheus with simplified reheat (BOr.12SR), developing 8000 lbF (35.6 kN) thrust. A prototype wing was built but not mated to a fuselage or engine. It was anticipated {{that this would be}} capable of M 1.5 and have a [...] "marked increase in rate of climb" [...] Development was ended because Bristol declined to back development of the reheat.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} high aspect ratio {{supercritical}} wings {{in combination with}} a representative wide body type fuselage were tested in the Langley 8 foot transonic pressure tunnel. The wing parameters investigated include aspect <b>ratio,</b> sweep, <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio,</b> and camber. Subsequent to these initial series of tests, a particular wing configuration was selected for further study and development. Tests on the selected wing involved the incorporation of a larger inboard trailing edge extension, an inboard leading edge extension, and flow through nacelles. Range factors for the various supercritical wing configurations are compared with those for a reference wide body transport configuration...|$|R
50|$|The D-34 {{was a small}} {{single seat}} sailplane, all {{variants}} having a wingspan of only 12.65 m. The first three variants shared a common, single piece, wing of straight tapered plan with a root to tip <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2.03 and an area of 8.0 m2. There were small, cigar shaped tip fairings, termed salmons. The profile was the thick (21% <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio)</b> NACA 644621, intended to produce laminar flow over the front 40% of the wing. It was formed around a three box spar of pine and plywood, its cells filled with plastic foam. The spar was less deep than the wing and the surface profile was shaped in ply over {{a small number of}} full chord ribs plus a carefully shaped plastic foam block filling.|$|R
25|$|Another {{example of}} the Bf 109's {{advanced}} design {{was the use of}} a single, I-beam main spar in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip, with a <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.|$|R

5000|$|The graph {{shows that}} the {{greatest}} amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached (which in early-20th century aviation was called the [...] "burble point"). This angle is 17.5 degrees in this case but changes from airfoil to airfoil. In particular, for aerodynamically thick airfoils (<b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratios</b> of around 10%), the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same camber. Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles (but also work efficiently in inverted flight). The graph shows that, as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, the lift produced by the airfoil decreases.|$|R
50|$|The HKS-1 was a tandem {{two seat}} {{sailplane}} first flown in 1953, {{designed to be}} fast but also to fly slowly for soaring in thermals. Its designers chose a 14% maximum <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> NACA airfoil, capable of maintaining laminar flow over the front 50% of the wing at lift coefficients between 0.5 and 0.9. They noted that {{the first of the}} laminar designs, the Ross-Johnson RJ-5, only achieved its potential after its flaps and spoilers were removed and the underside aileron hinge gaps carefully sealed, so decided to remove all hinged control surfaces and replaced them by wing warping. To do this, the trailing edge had to be flexible and controllable from wing root to tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{designer}} Wolf Lemke {{decided to}} retain the wing area of the LS3 but with a double trapezoid wing plan approaching the ideal elliptical shape. A new profile with higher speed potential was selected, the FX 81-K-130 developed in 1981 by University of Stuttgart aerodynamicist Franz Xavier Wortmann. Albeit having a <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of only 13%, this conservative profile has a remarkably benign behaviour that pays handsomely in terms of ease of handling and tolerance to environmental conditions. A slightly thicker version of this profile was developed with Prof. Wortmann for the outer wing, assuring healthy stall characteristics without requiring any washout. Profiles of the same family were selected for the slender, wide-span horizontal stabiliser.|$|R
40|$|A {{low speed}} airfoil, the GA(W) - 2, - a 13 % <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> airfoil was evaluated. The wing of a Beech Sundowner was {{modified}} at by adding balsa ribs {{and covered with}} aluminum skin, to alter the existing airfoil shape {{to that of the}} GA(W) - 2 airfoil. The aircraft was flown in a flight test program that gathered wing surface pressures and wake data from which the lift drag, and pitching moment of the airfoil could be determined. After the base line performance of the airfoil was measured, the drag due to surface irregularities such as steps, rivets and surface waviness was determined. The potential reduction of drag through the use of surface coatings such as KAPTON was also investigated...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} study of thick wind turbine section shapes in the test section of the UC Davis wind tunnel at a chord Reynolds number of one million is presented. The goals {{of this study are}} to validate standard wind tunnel wall corrections for high solid blockage conditions and to reaffirm the favorable effect of a blunt trailing edge or flatback on the performance characteristics of a representative thick airfoil shape prior to building the wind tunnel models and conducting the experiment. The numerical simulations prove the standard wind tunnel corrections to be largely valid for the proposed test of 40 % maximum <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> airfoils at a solid blockage ratio of 10 %. Comparison of the computed lift characteristics of a sharp trailing edge baseline airfoil and derived flatback airfoils reaffirms the earlier observed trend of reduced sensitivity to surface contamination with increasing trailing edge thickness...|$|R
40|$|The engine blade design {{optimization}} program STAEBL (Structural Tailoring of Engine Blades) {{is available at}} the NASA Lewis computer facility. The analysis capabilities of this program were extended to typical loading conditions for SSME turbopump blades including thermal and pressure loading. Input files for representative SSME blade designs were developed and sample optimization studies for these blades completed. The structural tailoring program combines a general optimization package and a finite element blade analysis package. The analysis package's capabilities include natural frequency, maximum stress, and forced response computation, and fatigue life and flutter analysis. Optimization is performed using the feasible directions method. The current design is modified by perturbing the design variables so that the design constraints are satisfied while the objective function, such as blade weight, is reduced at the maximum rate.

40|$|Inviscid {{transonic}} flow results are provided at design and off design conditions for two supercritical laminar flow control airfoils. The newer airfoil, with its lower suction requirements for full chord laminar flow, {{has a higher}} design Mach number, steeper pressure gradients, a more positive pressure level in the forward region of the lower surface, and a recovery to a less positive pressure at the trailing edge. The two dimensional design Mach numbers for the two airfoils are 0. 755 and 0. 730 at a common design lift coefficient of 0. 60, and their <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratios</b> are 0. 131 and 0. 135, respectively.

50|$|The Acrostar is a {{conventionally}} arranged {{low wing}} single engine aircraft. The wing is straight tapered, {{the leading edge}} slightly swept and the trailing edge unswept. The aerofoil section, designed by Eppler, is quite thick with a <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 20%. It is a symmetric section and mounted at zero incidence. There is also zero dihedral. Full span control surfaces are fitted, flaps inboard and proportionally moving ailerons outboard. The ailerons are balanced not by the usual horn or hinge line extensions but by small surfaces which project beyond the wingtips. Unusually, both ailerons and flaps are coupled to the elevator position; this camber changing control system, together with the highly symmetric wing, produces the same control characteristics for normal and inverted manoeuvres. The basic idea in this arrangement {{was to keep the}} centerline of the fuselage horizontal in both normal and inverted horizontal flight. The result, beside this, is good controllability in low speed ballistic flight, around zero G.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} the aero-elastic optimal design, the realization and the verification {{of the wind}} tunnel scale model blades for the DTU 10 MW wind turbine model, within LIFES 50 + project. The aerodynamic design {{was focused on the}} minimization of the difference, in terms of thrust coefficient, with respect to the full scale reference. From the Selig low Reynolds database airfoils, the SD 7032 was chosen for this purpose and a proper constant section wing was tested at DTU red wind tunnel, providing force and distributed pressure coefficients for the design, in the Reynolds range 30 - 250 E 3 and for different angles of attack. The aero-elastic design algorithm was set to define the optimal spanwise <b>thickness</b> over <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> (t/c), the <b>chord</b> length and the twist to match the first flapwise scaled natural frequency. An aluminium mould for the carbon fibre was CNC manufactured based on B-Splines CAD definition of the external geometry.

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{design and}} rig test {{evaluation of a}} small counter-rotating turbine system is described. The advanced turbine airfoils were designed and tested by Pratt & Whitney. The technology represented by this turbine is being developed for a turbopump {{to be used in}} an advanced upper stage rocket engine. The advanced engine will use a hydrogen expander cycle and achieve high performance through efficient combustion of hydrogen/oxygen propellants, high combustion pressure, and high area ratio exhaust nozzle expansion. Engine performance goals require that the turbopump drive turbines achieve high efficiency at low gas flow rates. The low mass flow rates and high operating pressures result in very small airfoil heights and diameters. The high efficiency and small size requirements present a challenging turbine design problem. The shrouded axial turbine blades are 50 percent reaction with a maximum <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> near 1. At 6 deg from the tangential direction, the nozzle and blade exit flow angles are well below the traditional design minimum limits. The blade turning angle of 160 deg also exceeds the maximum limits used in traditional turbine designs...|$|R

50|$|The {{wing of the}} Korvet has no sweep and is of {{constant}} chord, with 1.5° dihedral; its thick airfoil section has a <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0.15. It is a single spar, riveted duralumin covered structure, apart from its full span slotted flaperons, which are fabric covered, and GFRP sandwich, down turned, buoyant wing tips which support the wings when the aircraft is moored. Later aircraft have remodelled tips which include integral miniature float bodies to provide stability at speed on the water; they may also have separate flaps and ailerons. The wing is braced to the mid-fuselage by a single streamlined strut on each side, {{with the assistance of}} jury struts. Cabane struts carry the wing over the cabin. The tail unit is a GFRP structure with a straight edged, tapered, swept fin and balanced rudder which carries the unswept, straight edged tailplane, braced from above, a little above the upper fuselage line. The elevators are split by the rudder; the port surface has a trim tab.|$|R
40|$|Turbomachinery blades are an {{integral}} part of air breathing propulsion systems, gas and steam turbines and other energy conversion devices. The blade design is a very important process since it defines component performance. A parametric approach for the blade geometry design has been implemented. A variety of three dimensional blade shapes can be created using only a few basic parameters and limited interaction with a CAD system. Using a general approach for creating the blade geometries makes the process easy and robust for creating 3 D blade shapes for various turbomachinery components. The geometry of the blade is defined by a very basic set of geometric and aerodynamic parameters. Parameters such as flow angles, axial <b>chord,</b> <b>thickness</b> to <b>chord</b> <b>ratio</b> and streamline meridional coordinates are defined. The leading edge and trailing edge are defined by curves as part of the input. Using these parameters, a specified number of 2 D airfoils are created and are radially stacked on the desired stacking axis. The sweep and lean perturbations of the blade are defined by splines as a function of a few control points. The design tool generates a specified number of 3 D blade sections and each section consists of a defined number of coordinates in the cartesian coordinate system. These section...|$|R
