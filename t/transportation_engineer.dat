5|$|The traffic {{projections}} for the bridge {{at the planning stage}} {{have not been}} achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and <b>transportation</b> <b>engineer</b> that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E

500|$|I-155 {{was built}} on the {{right-of-way}} of former IL121. In the early 1960s, the department of transportation opened IL 98, an east–west two-lane highway running west from downtown Morton to Pekin. Within a few years, the intersection of IL 98 and IL121 would be known as the [...] "Killer Corner," [...] as traffic volumes increased between Springfield and Peoria on IL121. Between when IL98 was opened and when the corner was closed in 1989 for construction of a full interchange, 15 people were killed as a result of automobile accidents at the corner. Led by key supporters—U.S. Representative Robert Michel, former Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) <b>transportation</b> <b>engineer</b> Jack Harland, and pro-freeway organization [...] "Route 121 by '91" [...] chairman Jim Unland—IDOT initiated plans to upgrade IL121 to a four-lane freeway. Near Hopedale, a short portion of IL121 was reconstructed in the early 1970s to replace a bridge over the Mackinaw River. The interchange with I-55 was built, but barricaded to traffic.|$|E

40|$|Finding {{qualified}} entry-level <b>transportation</b> <b>engineers</b> is a {{major concern}} for employers of transportation professionals. The problem has two dimensions: (1) the pool of engineering graduates interested in transportation careers has been shrinking in recent years; and (2) employers indicate that entry-level engineers lack significant exposure to transportation engineering methodologies. The Institute of <b>Transportation</b> <b>Engineers,</b> along with other professional organizations, universities, and engineering firms and agencies, has initiated aggressive programs to attract talented individuals to transportation engineering careers. The problem’s second dimension, however, has generated heated debate between practitioners and educators. This debate has centered on the issue of undergraduate program content for an individual preparing for a career in transportation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the issues relevant to undergraduate preparation of <b>transportation</b> <b>engineers</b> and to develop recommendations for both practitioners and educators that will result in program improvement and increased interest in the transportation profession...|$|R
