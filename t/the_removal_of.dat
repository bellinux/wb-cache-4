The research results indicated that temperature was an important factor influencing <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main pollution indexes. When temperature was {{in the range of}} 5 °C- 8 °C, the promotion effects <b>of</b> enzyme on <b>the</b> <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> CODCr and ammonia nitrogen (NH 3 -N) of sewage by biofilm process were not obvious. However when temperature were in the ranges of 15 °C- 18 °C and 22 °C- 25 °C, enzyme had the high promotion effects on <b>the</b> <b>removals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pollution indexes. Furthermore, within the certain temperature (5 °C- 25 °C), <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> rates <b>of</b> CODCr and NH 3 -N were on the rise with the increase of temperature. When temperature increased from 5 °C- 8 °C to 15 °C- 18 °C, <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> CODCr obviously increased, but when temperature continued to increase to 25, the rise trend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> rate <b>of</b> CODCr became slow.
