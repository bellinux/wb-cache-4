5|$|Losing the undersheriff {{position}} left Wyatt Earp {{without a}} job in Tombstone; however, Wyatt and his brothers were beginning {{to make some money}} on their mining claims in the Tombstone area. In January 1881, Oriental Saloon owner Mike Joyce gave Wyatt Earp a one-quarter interest in the faro concession at the Oriental Saloon in exchange for his services as a manager and enforcer. Gambling was regarded as a legitimate profession, comparable <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> or member of clergy, at the time. Wyatt invited his friend, lawman and gambler Bat Masterson, to Tombstone to help him run the faro tables in the Oriental Saloon. In June 1881, Wyatt also telegraphed another friend and gambler from Dodge, Luke Short, who was living in Leadville, Colorado, and offered him a job as a faro dealer.|$|E

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{rationale for}} many of the hearsay exceptions is that the circumstances of a particular statement make them reliable enough to be heard by a trier of fact.

25|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive genetic blood disorder {{which leads to}} alterations {{in the shape of}} red blood cells. Not only can SCD impact the immune system, but it can lead to complications with memory. Children with SCD have shown impairments in event-based prospective memory. They may struggle with aspects of daily life that require prospective memory, such as forgetting to do homework even with a schoolbag nearby. More importantly, it is more difficult to manage the disease as they can forget about when to take medication or go <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> appointment. These effects can also persist into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|While {{in-house}} production had ceased, the BBC {{hoped to find}} an independent production company to relaunch the show. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th series was still in production. Segal's negotiations eventually led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as a co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1million viewers), it was less so in the United States and {{did not lead to}} a series.|$|E

25|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have added medical sensors into these toilets, which can measure the blood sugar {{based on the}} urine, and also measure the pulse, blood pressure, and the body fat content of the user.

The data may automatically be sent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> through a built-in internet-capable cellular telephone. However, these devices are still very rare in Japan, and their future commercial success is difficult to predict. A voice-operated toilet that understands verbal commands is under development.

25|$|Another detail which casts {{doubt on}} the story is the fact that, {{according}} to Blair, {{there was never any}} Dr. Thorne in the employ of the Army or indeed of the Federal Government in the 1860s.

Thorne claimed that he was taken captive by Navajos in 1854, and that during his captivity he had discovered a rich gold vein. Thorne related his claims to three U.S. soldiers in about 1858.
