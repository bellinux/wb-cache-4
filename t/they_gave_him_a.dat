5|$|Born in Enfield, London, Boucaud {{joined the}} youth system at Queens Park Rangers in 2000 {{and after the}} club lost their Academy status {{he moved to the}} Reading youth system towards the end of 2001. After {{breaking}} into Reading's reserve team, he signed a professional contract with the club on 25 March 2002 that contracted him at the club until the summer of 2004. Boucaud was pursued by Premier League club Arsenal, but stayed with Reading as <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> three-year contract. He was loaned out to Second Division club Peterborough United {{until the end of the}} 2002–03 season on 27 March 2003 and he made his debut two days later as an 85th minute substitute in a 5–1 victory away to Mansfield Town. He finished the season with six appearances for Peterborough.|$|E
5|$|In Kinkladze's {{first season}} at the club, Dinamo won a league and cup double. However, due to the ongoing Georgian Civil War, during 1993 the Dinamo Tbilisi {{management}} sought to put their players in a more stable environment. As part of this, Kinkladze was sent on loan to 1. FC Saarbrücken in Germany. Kinkladze made his Saarbrücken debut in a 2. Bundesliga match against Tennis Borussia Berlin, a 2–2 draw on 4 March 1994. He was unable to settle into the side at Saarbrücken, rarely playing a full 90 minutes, and was sent off in a 1–3 defeat to Hertha Berlin. At {{the end of the}} season, Kinkladze returned to Tbilisi to resume his career in Georgia, where he was named the national Player of the Year for 1993. Dinamo president Merab Jordania was still uncomfortable with Kinkladze playing in Georgia amid political instability, and offered the player to Atlético Madrid for approximately £200,000; <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> trial, but no contract. He then trained with Real Madrid's reserves, where he caught the eye of Boca Juniors scouts, who took him to Argentina for a month's loan. Kinkladze met his childhood hero Diego Maradona, but did not gain a permanent contract, as manager Silvio Marzolini regarded him as too similar to Boca's Argentine international playmaker Alberto Márcico.|$|E

Cameron stated, [...] "They were like, 'Oooooohkaaaaaay – a three-hour romantic epic? Sure, that's {{just what we}} want. Is there {{a little bit of}} Terminator in that? Any Harrier jets, shoot-outs, or car chases?' I said, 'No, no, no. It's not like that.'"

500|$|Moon's {{lifestyle}} {{began to}} undermine his health and reliability. During the 1973 Quadrophenia tour, at the Who's debut US date at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California, Moon ingested {{a mixture of}} tranquillisers and brandy. During the concert, Moon passed out on his drum kit during [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again." [...] The band stopped playing, {{and a group of}} roadies carried Moon offstage. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> shower and an injection of cortisone, sending him back onstage after a thirty-minute delay. Moon passed out again during [...] "Magic Bus," [...] and was again removed from the stage. The band continued without him for several songs before Townshend asked, [...] "Can anyone play the drums? – I mean somebody good?" [...] A drummer in the audience, Scot Halpin, came up and played the rest of the show.|$|E
500|$|The Nova Scotia {{legislature}} {{recognized the}} growing power of industrial unions in the 1930s by passing what historian Stephen Henderson calls [...] "Canada's {{first piece of}} modern labour legislation". Although Macdonald's governing Liberals and the opposition Conservatives agreed {{on the need to}} protect union rights, the parties vied with each other to take credit for the Trade Union Act. In January 1937, Premier Macdonald carried a bottle of bootleg rum to a meeting with union officials in Sydney, Cape Breton where <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> draft bill based on the American National Labor Relations Act. Before the Macdonald government could introduce the bill in the legislature, the Conservatives presented a similar one of their own. The legislation faced opposition from the Canadian Manufacturers' Association during public hearings, but Liberals and Conservatives combined to pass it unanimously. The new Trade Union Act required employers to bargain with any union chosen by a majority of their employees. It also prohibited employers from firing workers for organizing a union.|$|E

500|$|Tracy {{appeared}} in four movies in 1937. <b>They</b> <b>Gave</b> <b>Him</b> <b>a</b> Gun went largely unnoticed, but Captains Courageous {{was one of}} the major film events of the year. Tracy played a Portuguese fisherman in the adventure movie, based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling. He was uncomfortable feigning a foreign accent, and resented having his hair curled, but the role was a hit with audiences and Tracy won the Academy Award for Best Actor. Captains Courageous was followed by Big City with Luise Rainer and Mannequin with Joan Crawford, the latter of which took good billings at the box office. With two years of hit movies and industry recognition, Tracy became a star in the United States. A 1937 poll of 20 million people to find the [...] "King and Queen of Hollywood" [...] ranked Tracy sixth among males. Tracy was reunited with Gable and Loy for 1938's Test Pilot. The film was another commercial and critical success, permanently cementing the notion of Gable and Tracy as a team.|$|E
500|$|The {{first sight}} of Australia on 12 January 1836 {{reminded}} him of Patagonia, but inland the country improved and he was soon filled with admiration at the bustling city of Sydney. On a journey into the interior he came across a group of aborigines who looked [...] "good-humoured & pleasant & they appeared far from such utterly degraded beings as usually represented". <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> display of spear throwing for a shilling, and he reflected sadly on how their numbers were rapidly decreasing. At a large sheep farm he joined a hunting party and caught his first marsupial, a [...] "potoroo" [...] (rat-kangaroo).

That evening he saw the even stranger platypus and noticed that its bill was soft, unlike the preserved specimens he had seen. Aboriginal stories that they laid eggs were believed by few Europeans.|$|E
500|$|Wise called The Haunting {{one of his}} top ten {{or twelve}} {{favorites}} among the films he made, commenting that it was his favorite filmmaking experience. Ettington Park, (now the Ettington Park Hotel), with its grounds near the village of Ettington, Warwickshire, was used for exterior shots of Hill House. According to actor Russ Tamblyn, Wise approached a society that kept track of British haunted houses, and <b>they</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> list of such places. [...] Production designer Elliot Scott was sent around the country to look at each house, and Wise personally selected Ettington Park. [...] Some of the cast and crew were housed in Ettington Park during exterior shooting. However, the [...] location did not sit well with Harris and Bloom who upon arriving at Ettington Park thought it was [...] "scary looking outside", and Wise had to reassure them. Interior sets were constructed and shot at the MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. The interior sets were designed by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as a [...] "major contributor" [...] to The Haunting. The sets were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style. All rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Actor Richard Johnson said that the sets created a subdued feeling among the cast and crew.|$|E

500|$|Growing up in New Zealand without {{television}} {{until the}} 1960s, Dale developed {{a love of}} theatre and amateur dramatics. His first performance was for a school concert, {{at the age of}} 13, doing an impression of comedian Shelley Berman. His parents became founding members of an amateur theatre in Auckland called [...] "The Little Dolphin Theatre". Dale often operated the stage equipment used to produce weather effects, and whenever he was on stage he loved the applause. Although a skilled rugby player, Dale opted to move into drama instead because [...] "the acting fraternity didn't like footballers and the footballers didn't like actors. [...] Acting gave me the same buzz and there was the chance of a longer career." [...] He gave up rugby at the age of 21 because it was not considered a workable career at the time, and he had to support his family. Acting roles were limited in New Zealand so Dale worked in multiple jobs, including as a male model, a car salesman and a realtor. While working as a milkman he heard the disc jockey at his local radio station resign during a broadcast. Dale went over to the station and told the managers he could do a better job. <b>They</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> trial and then signed him up for the afternoon show, which led to him landing his first TV role, and at the age of 27 he decided to become a professional actor.|$|E
