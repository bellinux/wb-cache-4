5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal. If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E

Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E

It is a common practice by Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) to redesign their teacher education programs {{from time to time to}} be more relevant in the needs of every school offering basic education. This study investigated the need to develop self-mastery skills among teacher education students at Batangas State University – College of Teacher Education. It dwelled on the concept of Morato [1] who enumerated the seven self-mastery skills namely, <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> think; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> intuit; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> feel; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> do; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> communicate; <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> lead; and <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> be.

Working backwards from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> live without crutches or {{end up in}} wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E

He made his stage debut in December 1920 with Growcott's St Nicholas Players at the St Nicholas Hall, Brighton, a converted bacon factory. He played a gendarme in an adaptation of Les Misérables, and was soon entrusted with larger parts including Banquo in Macbeth and Malvolio in Twelfth Night.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to be shared firmly among all stakeholders — be they parents, teachers, providers or policymakers-that education begins at birth and that children develop and learn in their very first years, which are critical for socio-emotional development, self-regulation, language development, and initial socialization. Education should not be a narrow concept (like academic training) to be monopolized by the education sector, but is to be understood in a broad sense, necessitating good physical and mental health care and involving <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> be, <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn,</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> live together, which comprise the ‘four pillars of learning’ as put forward by the UNESCO Delors Report (1996). At the same time, ‘care’ — as understood as nurture and protection for well-being and warm and responsive relationship — fosters motivation <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and <b>to</b> achievemeaningful <b>learning</b> and later academic success.
