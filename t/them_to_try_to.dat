25|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of the forensic entomologist to adequately instruct on the collection and handling of all specimen evidence. Even though, it is upon <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> ensure efficient collections, they cannot always prevent inept actions; because of this, the FE can refuse improper analyses and tests performed on the evidence. It is important that the FE is diligent with the procedures and collection, so that when in court, the opposing side can’t question the findings.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the game at the University of San Diego, the Cougar's offense was the star, with Jambga {{assisting}} Ebbesen with one crossing pass and then sending a second to Hull, who was one-on-one with a charging keeper.In the second half, the SIUE defense seemed to be playing with the USD offense, as if daring <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> score by repeatedly taking the ball away and giving it right back for the Toreros to make another attempt. When the defenders were not blocking or stealing, Dal Santo made five saves, and the Cougars got the 2–0 win.|$|E

25|$|Chimei (赤眉) refers, as an {{umbrella}} term, {{to one of}} the two major agrarian rebellion movements against Wang Mang's Xin dynasty, initially active in the modern Shandong and northern Jiangsu region, that eventually led to Wang Mang's downfall by draining his resources, allowing the leader of the other movement (the Lülin), Liu Xuan (Emperor Gengshi of Han) to overthrow Wang and temporarily establish an incarnation of the Han dynasty under him. Eventually, Chimei forces would overthrow Emperor Gengshi and place their own puppet emperor, Liu Penzi, on the throne briefly, before the Chimei leaders' incompetence in ruling the territories under their control, which matched their brilliance on the battlefield, to cause the people to rebel against them, forcing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> withdraw home. When their path was blocked off by Liu Xiu (Emperor Guangwu)'s newly established Eastern Han regime, they surrendered to him.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} couple of years, Laurinaitis stayed out of the wrestling ring, {{collecting}} on an insurance policy from Lloyd's of London while Hegstrand competed all over the world. Near the end of 1995, Laurinaitis' back had finally recovered enough for him to return to active competition. Three years after everyone thought the Road Warriors had ended, they reunited and signed a contract with World Championship Wrestling. Upon their return in January 1996, they immediately started a feud with the Steiner Brothers, who returned in March, and Harlem Heat, before moving on to challenge the WCW Tag Team Champions Sting and Lex Luger. The Road Warriors had several shots at the champions but never won the title in the six months they were with the company. The Steiner Brothers also arrived shortly after the Warriors did, and feuded with <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prove who the best team of all time was. The Steiners got the better of the feud and the Warriors left WCW in June 1996.|$|E
25|$|Neoteny {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other species. It {{is important to note}} the difference between partial and full neoteny when looking at other species in order to distinguish between juvenile traits that are only advantageous in the short term and traits that provide a benefit throughout the organism’s life; this might then provide some insight into the cause of neoteny in those species. Partial neoteny is the retention of the larval form beyond the usual age of maturation with the possibility of the development of sexual organs progenesis, but eventually the organism still matures into the adult form; this can be seen in Lithobates clamitans. Full neoteny is seen in Ambystoma mexicanum and some populations of Ambystoma tigrinum, which remain in their larval form for the duration of their life. Lithobates clamitans is partially neotenous: it delays its maturation through the winter season, because it is not advantageous for it to metamorphose into the adult form until there are more resources available: it can find those resources much more easily in the larval form. This would fall under both of the main causes of neoteny; the energy required to survive in the winter as a newly formed adult is too costly, so the organism exhibits neotenous characteristics until a time when it is capable of better survival as an adult. Ambystoma tigrinum retains its neotenous features for a similar reason, however the retention is permanent {{due to the lack of}} resources available throughout its lifetime. This is another example of an environmental cause of neoteny in that the species retains juvenile characteristics because the environment limits the ability of the organism to fully come into its adult form. A few species of birds show partial neoteny. A couple of examples of such species are the manakin birds Chiroxiphia linearis and Chiroxiphia caudata. The males of both species retain their juvenile plumage into adulthood, but they eventually lose it once they are fully mature. In certain species of birds the retention of juvenile plumage is often linked to the molting times within each species. In order to ensure there is no overlap between the molting and mating times, the birds may show partial neoteny in regards to their plumage so that the males do not attain their bright adult plumage before the females are prepared to mate. In this instance, neoteny is present because there is no need for the males to molt early and it would be a waste of energy for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> mate while the females are still immature.|$|E

500|$|The {{market for}} science fiction {{expanded}} dramatically the following year; several new magazines were launched, including Startling Stories in January 1939, Unknown in March (a fantasy companion to Astounding, also edited by Campbell), Fantastic Adventures in May, and Planet Stories in December. [...] All of the competing magazines, including {{the two main}} extant titles, Wonder Stories and Amazing Stories, were publishing space opera, stories of interplanetary adventure, or other well-worn ideas {{from the early days}} of the genre. [...] Campbell's attempts to make science fiction more mature led to a natural division of the writers: those who were unable to write to his standards continued to sell to other magazines; and those who could sell to Campbell quickly focused their attention on Astounding and sold relatively little to the other magazines. [...] The expansion of the market also benefited Campbell because writers knew that if he rejected their submissions, they could resubmit those stories elsewhere; this freed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write to his standards.|$|E
500|$|Upon being {{medically}} {{cleared to}} return to the ring, Orton was reinjured in a motorcycle accident. [...] He returned to Raw on September 1, criticizing all the champions, including World Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, who he berated and slapped for letting Cryme Tyme steal their belts. This inspired <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> gain Orton's respect. They achieved this at Unforgiven when, with new stablemate Manu, they assaulted World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, forcing him to vacate his title before his scheduled defense that night. Orton returned to the ring on the November 3 Raw, losing to Punk by disqualification when DiBiase interfered. In retaliation, Orton punted DiBiase in the head. On the December 1 Raw, Orton proposed that he, Rhodes and Manu form an alliance. The stable, called The Legacy, debuted the next week, defeating Batista and Triple H, Orton's former Evolution stablemates, in a three-on-two handicap match.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the release}} of the Byrdmaniax album, The Byrds' {{producer}} and manager, Terry Melcher, resigned amid accusations of overdubbing strings, horns, and a gospel choir onto that album without the band's consent. [...] The Byrds' annoyance over Melcher's additions to Byrdmaniax prompted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rectify the situation by quickly recording a new album, this time produced by themselves. [...] Despite a heavy touring schedule—resulting from the band being an in-demand fixture on the live concert circuit—The Byrds were eager to release another studio album as soon as possible.|$|E

2500|$|The leading {{elements}} of the First Brigade spread out to match their opponents' configuration, and for two hours the combatants fired at each other through blinding clouds of smoke. The 10th Connecticut relieved the exhausted, but not badly bloodied, 25th Massachusetts, but they too could not advance. No progress was made until the Second Brigade arrived, and its commander, Brig. Gen. Jesse L. Reno, ordered <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> penetrate the [...] "impenetrable" [...] swamp on the Union left. Brig. Gen. John G. Foster then ordered two of his reserve regiments {{to do the same}} on the right. About this time, Brig. Gen. John G. Parke came up with the Third Brigade, and it was immediately sent to assist. Although they were not coordinated, the two flanking movements emerged from the swamp at nearly the same time. Reno ordered his 21st Massachusetts, 51st New York, and 9th New Jersey to attack. As they were firing on the Confederates, the 23rd Massachusetts, from the First Brigade, appeared {{on the other end of}} the line. The defensive line began to crack; noting this, Foster ordered his remaining forces to attack. Under assault from three sides, the Confederates broke and fled.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, {{documentary}} filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of {{a meeting}} Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his players to deliberately try to injure several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, {{even if it meant}} hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree's ACL, injure tight end Vernon Davis' ankles and go after kick returner Kyle Williams specifically because he had a history of concussions. He also appeared to put a bounty on quarterback Alex Smith; according to Pamphilon, after Williams told his men to hit Smith in the chin, [...] "then he rubs his thumb against his index and middle fingers – the cash sign – and says, I got the first one. I got the first one. Go get it. Go lay that motherfucker out." [...] Pamphilon, who was doing a documentary on Steve Gleason and his fight against Lou Gehrig's Disease, released the audio to Yahoo! Sports without Gleason's approval. However, the Saints were not penalized for illegal hits during that game, which they lost 36–32.|$|E
