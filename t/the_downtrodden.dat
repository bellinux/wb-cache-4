5|$|Ramachandran {{was an avid}} fan {{of action}} heroes like Errol Flynn, John Barrymore, and Douglas Fairbanks. Throughout the 1950s, he acted in films that {{justified}} his status as an action hero. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum portrayed him as a swashbuckling action hero who also has a Robin Hood-like agenda of serving the poor and <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> with the treasure he finds in the cave.|$|E
5|$|Anbe Vaa {{marked the}} first time AVM Productions had written a script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already {{completed}} script. AVM Productions' founder A. V. Meiyappan's son M. Saravanan, one of the film's producers, recalled in 2013 that, as a fan of M. G. Ramachandran, it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner. For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice, but when he did, he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden.</b>|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E

"The lowest, <b>the</b> most <b>downtrodden,</b> <b>the</b> most miserable of Shikastans {{will watch}} the wind moving a plant, and smile; will plant a seed {{and watch it}} grow; will stand to watch {{the life of the}} clouds.

He also helped to develop cricket, netball, carnival, and several foundational Black community institutions in Montreal, many of which continue to enrich the Montreal community.|$|E
25|$|As {{a pioneer}} of the cinema of Mexico, Moreno helped usher in its golden era. In {{addition}} to being a business leader, he also became involved in Mexico's tangled and often dangerous labor politics. Although he was a political conservative, his reputation as a spokesperson for <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> gave his actions authenticity and became important in the early struggle against charrismo, the one-party government's practice of co-opting and controlling unions.|$|E
50|$|The 16th {{century was}} the time of Andrea Palladio, who left many {{outstanding}} examples of his art with palaces and villas in the city's territory, which before Palladio's passage, was arguably <b>the</b> most <b>downtrodden</b> and esthetically lacking city of the Veneto.|$|R
50|$|Probably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} and influential twentieth century minister was the Rev William Dick. In {{an area of}} enormous deprivation, the chapel became, under his inspired leadership, a beacon of hope for <b>the</b> dispossessed and <b>downtrodden.</b> <b>The</b> church's efforts to help {{improve the lives of}} the local population, already struggling before being hit by the Blitz, were seen {{as an integral part of}} its Christian mission.|$|R
50|$|Patricia Doreen Coombs (27 August 1926 - 25 May 2002) was an English actress. She {{specialised}} in {{the portrayal}} of <b>the</b> eternal <b>downtrodden</b> female, comically under the thumb of stronger personalities. She was known for many roles on radio, film and television sitcoms.|$|R
25|$|The {{brutality}} of the RCMP in its treatment of <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> protesters provoked a major public outcry. The next day, ten thousand people turned out to a protest at the Powell Street Grounds (today's Oppenheimer Park). Because there was little chance of a jury of peers convicting the rioters, Branca convinced the Attorney-General to stay most of the charges, and of the 23 charged, only two were convicted but received only small fines that were paid by sympathizers.|$|E
25|$|Isis was worshipped as {{the ideal}} mother and wife {{as well as the}} patroness of nature and magic. She was the friend of slaves, sinners, {{artisans}} and <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden,</b> but she also listened to the prayers of the wealthy, maidens, aristocrats and rulers. Isis is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-headed deity associated with king and kingship (although in some traditions Horus's mother was Hathor). Isis is also known as protector of the dead and goddess of children.|$|E
25|$|The Cisco Kid is {{a half-hour}} American Western {{television}} series starring Duncan Renaldo {{in the title}} role, The Cisco Kid, and Leo Carrillo as the jovial sidekick, Pancho. Cisco and Pancho were technically desperados, wanted for unspecified crimes, but instead viewed by the poor as Robin Hood figures who assisted <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> when law enforcement officers proved corrupt or unwilling to help. It {{was also the first}} television series to be filmed in color, although few viewers saw it in color until the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|From {{the sociological}} point of view, it also {{strengthens}} {{both physically and}} mentally <b>the</b> socially <b>downtrodden</b> in a religious way.

25|$|Ambedkar's {{political}} philosophy {{has given rise}} to a large number of political parties, publications and workers' unions that remain active across India, especially in Maharashtra. His promotion of Buddhism has rejuvenated interest in Buddhist philosophy among sections of population in India. Mass conversion ceremonies have been organised by human rights activists in modern times, emulating Ambedkar's Nagpur ceremony of 1956. Some Indian Buddhists regard him as a Bodhisattva, although he never claimed it himself. Outside India, during the late 1990s, some Hungarian Romani people drew parallels between their own situation and that of <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> people in India. Inspired by Ambedkar, they started to convert to Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Jim Young, {{formerly}} {{defensive coordinator}} at Michigan, {{was hired to}} turn around <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> Wildcats football program. Improvement came immediately, as Young's team surprised the nation with an 8–3 record in his first season. Young's Wildcats went on to post records of 9–2 in 1974 and 1975, the latter ending with a #13 and #18 ranking in the Coaches' and AP Polls, respectively. In a rebuilding year, Young's team posted a 5–6 record in 1976 to cap Young's mark of 31–13 in four seasons. Young departed Arizona after the 1976 season to accept the head football coach position at Purdue. He {{was inducted into the}} College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{acceptance}} of Revelation into the canon has from the beginning been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was heterodox, and what was even heretical. Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature (its purpose is offering hope to <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden),</b> and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context. Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century {{to make sense of}} what the author may have intended.|$|E

25|$|In Travancore the {{caste system}} was more rigorously {{enforced}} than {{in many other}} parts of India up to the mid-1800s. The rule of discriminative hierarchical caste order was deeply entrenched in the social system and was supported by the government, which had transformed this caste-based social system into a religious institution. In such a context, the belief in Ayyavazhi, apart from being a religious system, served also as a reform movement in uplifting <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> section of the society, both socially and as well religiously. The rituals of Ayyavazhi constituted a social discourse. Its beliefs, mode of worship, and religious organisation seem to have enabled the Ayyavazhi group to negotiate and cope with, and resist the imposition of authority. The hard tone of Vaikundar towards this was perceived as a revolution against the government. So the King Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma initially imprisoned Vaikundar in the Singarathoppu jail, where the jailor Appaguru ended up as a disciple of Vaikundar. Vaikundar was later set at liberty by the King.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{the site}} where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and {{eventually}} concludes {{that it has been}} dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Within their dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> working classes have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks. Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that {{due to a lack of}} any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi. His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.|$|E
25|$|Development {{arrives in}} Ilmorog as the {{government}} begin to build the Trans-Africa road through the village, which brings an increase in trade. Karega returns to Ilmorog, telling of his slow spiral into alcoholism before finally securing work in a factory. After getting fired from the factory, he returns to Ilmorog. The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages changes into the town of New Ilmorog. The farmers are told that they should fence off their land and mortgage parts of it {{to ensure that they}} own a finite area. They are offered loans which are linked to their harvest turnout to pay for this expense. Nyakinyua dies and the banks move to take her land. To prevent this Wanja sells her business and buys Nyakinyua's land. She opens up a successful brothel in the town, and is herself one of the prostitutes. Munira goes to see her to attempt to rekindle their romance, but is met with only a demand for money. He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel, and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, he pours petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill to watch it burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire. Munira is sentenced with arson; later, Karega learns that the corrupt local MP was gunned down in his car whilst waiting for his chauffeur in Nairobi.|$|E

500|$|In the 1830s, few {{sought the}} {{immediate}} eradication of slavery. [...] The abolitionist movement {{was young and}} only recently had figures such as William Lloyd Garrison taken on the fight. Stevens's reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers. Richard Current in 1942, suggested {{it was out of}} ambition; Fawn Brodie, in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of Stevens, suggested it was out of identification with <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden,</b> based on his handicap. Trefousse, in his 1997 work, also suggested that Stevens's feelings towards <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> were a factor, combined with remorse over the Butler case, but that ambition was unlikely to have been a major motivator, as Stevens's fervor in the anti-slavery cause inhibited his career.|$|E
500|$|Although {{hinted at}} {{indirectly}} in some poems, Riley wrote very little on serious subject matter, and actually mocked attempts at serious poetry. Only {{a few of}} his sentimental poems concerned serious subjects. [...] "Little Mandy's Christmas-Tree", [...] "The Absence of Little Wesley", and [...] "The Happy Little Cripple" [...] were about poverty, the death of a child, and disabilities. Like his children's poems, they too contained morals, suggesting society should pity <b>the</b> <b>downtrodden</b> and be charitable.|$|E
