500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. I knew {{that it was going to}} be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews. The series stars Lauren Vélez (Maria LaGuerta), David Zayas (Angel Batista) and Erik King (James Doakes), all previously starred in the American HBO television drama series Oz.|$|E
2500|$|Geneticist Bryan Sykes and {{his team}} at Oxford University report that DNA {{analysis}} of presumed Yeti (or [...] "Abominable Snowman") samples {{may have come from}} a hybrid species of bear produced from a mating between a brown bear and a polar bear. According to Sykes, [...] "I think this bear, which nobody has seen alive, may still be there and may have quite a lot of polar bear in it. It may be some sort of hybrid and if its behaviour is different from normal bears, which is what eyewitnesses report, then I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> well be the source of the mystery and the source of the legend." ...|$|E

And she's all the more intoxicating when she's serious; and when she's {{forgotten}} your whole worthless existence she's ten thousand times more fascinating than and other girl when she's going right for you. There's a kind of look comes into her eyes--kind of absence, rapture, don't you know--when she's serious, that brings your heart right into your mouth. She makes you think {{of some of those}} pictures--I want to tell you what she said the other day at a picnic when we were off getting blueberries, and you'll understand that she isn't like other girls--that she has a soul fall of--of--you know what, Boardman. She has high thoughts about everything. I don't believe she's ever had a mean or ignoble impulse--she couldn't have."

5000|$|Suminagashi (墨流し), {{which means}} [...] "floating ink" [...] in Japanese, is a Japanese variant; the oldest example {{appears in the}} 12th-century Sanjuurokuninshuu (三十六人集), located in Nishihonganji (西本願寺), Kyoto. Author Einen Miura states that the oldest {{reference}} to suminagashi papers are in the waka poems of Shigeharu, (825-880 CE), a son of the famed Heian era poet Narihira (Muira 14). Various claims have been made regarding the origins of suminagashi. Some <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have derived from an early form of ink divination. Another {{theory is that the}} process may have derived from a form of popular entertainment at the time, in which a freshly painted sumi painting was immersed into water, and the ink slowly dispersed from the paper and rose to the surface, forming curious designs.|$|E
50|$|Stephanie Rothman {{admitted}} the film's commercial reception was disappointing. She thought {{the problem may}} have been the movie:Fell between two stools. It's not a traditional horror film nor a hard-core exploitation movie. In some places it was booked into art theatres. In others it had one week saturation release in drive ins and hard top theatres. There was no consistent distribution pattern for it because people responded differently to it and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be part of the problem. Also it was an independent producer. There were a lot of other competing vampire movies at the time with star names... But the film has not been forgotten. It keeps popping up at festivals and retrospectives which is interesting because it did not draw attention to itself upon how well it did at the box office.|$|E
5000|$|An {{interview}} with Jung {{on the design}} and illustration of the 1974 poster The Man with the Golden Gun elaborated on his creative process: [...] "The actual painting is done on 20x30 double-weight illustration board, half of a standard 30x40 board. I used acrylics, I can use it transparently or opaquely; it dries quickly and is permanent and can be reworked. I'd use airbrushing for large areas of background, color pencils, and inks and dyes and tempera and whatever else I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> give me the desired result. Sandpaper. Brillo. A single-edge razor blade. Whatever works." [...] Jung often used family members as models. For the Star Wars poster design, with Frank Frazetta in mind as his final illustrator, Jung posed his son Jeff as Luke Skywalker and his wife Kay as Princess Leia. After discussions with Don Smolen of Smolen, Smith and Connolly, {{it was decided that}} Jung would execute the illustration.|$|E

5000|$|John Simmons, {{son of a}} National Security Agency (NSA) employee, {{supposedly}} grew up {{amid the}} spy community in Washington, D.C. during the Cold War. It was life as normal, {{as far as he}} knew, to live at remote electronic listening posts, to [...] "pop in and out of Washington every once in a while," [...] to attend a different school and make new friends every two years. That didn't bother him at all. [...] "It was fun, and it helped me prepare for this wacky life style." [...] He attended the University of North Carolina and then spent a year abroad at the University of Kent in Canterbury. He studied theatre and history ("not theatre history", he emphasizes), then ended up dropping the theatre and graduating in history and journalism. [...] "I like history more than anything. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be why I make fun of the news. The kind of stupidity that's going on now has just been repeated through the centuries; it's nothing new." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding Truman's {{views on}} red scares in the United States, Lowenthal commented: [...] When {{he came back}} from service in the Army in the First World War, he was disgusted with the {{hysteria}} that prevailed in some quarters in 1919 and 1920, and I think he never forgot that -- that disgust that he had acquired. You may remember -- I don't mean to say that Mr. Truman mentioned this specifically -- there was a magazine published by a man named Guy Empey.... A good many people were greatly excited and there was a good deal of [...] "treat them rough stuff" [...] during World War I and {{for a year or two}} or three afterward. I think that burned into Mr. Truman, who had been engaged in active fighting in France during the war, that such things should go on...You know, there was during World War I bitterness against the Socialists and against the IWW, not against, to any extent, the Bolsheviks; that came later. You read about that period. They threw Victor Berger, the Socialist, out of the Congress. Mr. Truman was disgusted with such excitement, and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been part of his make-up from childhood onward, but I'm only guessing.|$|E
5000|$|Dawkins {{was very}} {{critical}} of the United States government under George W. Bush, especially his Iraq War decisions. He criticized Bush by stating that [...] "George W. Bush says that God told him to invade Iraq (a pity God didn't vouchsafe him a revelation {{that there were no}} weapons of mass destruction)." [...] Dawkins has also said that he thinks American politicians should pay more attention to America's secular crowd. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be a lesson politicians need to learn, that they don't only need to suck up to the Catholic lobby and the Jewish lobby and Islam, that lobby. Maybe the nonbelievers lobby is a lot more powerful than they realize." [...] Also, Dawkins thinks that U.S. politicians should not invoke religion in their policies. [...] "Politicians shouldn't be promoting religion as part of their government legislation." [...] Dawkins has also expressed his belief that Bush was not actually elected in the controversial 2000 U.S. presidential election through an editorial in The Guardian: September 11 was your golden Pearl Harbor. This was how you'd get elected in 2004 (not re-elected, elected). You would announce a War on Terror. American troops would win. And you would be the victorious warlord, swaggering in a flight suit before a Mission Accomplished banner. It worked in Afghanistan. But then those puppeteers moved on to their long-term project: Iraq.|$|E

5000|$|John and I wrote 'She's Leaving Home' together. It was my inspiration. We'd seen a {{story in}} the {{newspaper}} about a young girl who'd left home and not been found, {{there were a lot of}} those at the time, and that was enough to give us a story line. So I started to get the lyrics: she slips out and leaves a note and then the parents wake up ... It was rather poignant. I like it as a song, and when I showed it to John, he added the long sustained notes, and one of the nice things about the structure of the song is that it stays on those chords endlessly. Before that period in our song-writing we would have changed chords but it stays on the C chord. It really holds you. It's a really nice little trick and I think it worked very well.While I was showing that to John, he was doing the Greek chorus, the parents' view: 'We gave her most of our lives, we gave her everything money could buy.' I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> have been in the runaway story, it might have been a quote from the parents. Then there's the famous little line about a man from the motor trade; people have since said that was Terry Doran, who was a friend who worked in a car showroom, but it was just fiction, like the sea captain in [...] "Yellow Submarine", they weren't real people.|$|E
5000|$|At Wimbledon, King {{defeated}} Pam Shriver in a two-hour, forty minute fourth round match 5-7, 7-6, 10-8 after King saved a {{match point}} in the second set and recovered from a 4-2 (40-0) deficit in the third set with Shriver serving. In a quarterfinal that took two days to complete, King lost to two-time defending champion and top-seeded Navratilova 7-6, 1-6, 10-8. The beginning of the match was delayed until late afternoon because of rain. Because she wore eyeglasses, King agreed to start the match then on condition that tournament officials immediately suspend the match if the rain resumed. During the first set, drizzle began to fall; however, the chair umpire refused to suspend the match. King led in the tiebreaker 5-1 before Navratilova came back to win the set, whereupon the umpire then agreed to the suspension. When the match resumed the next day, King won 20 of the first 23 points to take a 5-0 lead in the second set and lost a total of seven points while winning the set in just 17 minutes. In the third set, Navratilova broke serve to take a 2-0 lead before King broke back twice and eventually served for the match at 6-5. King then hit four volley errors, enabling Navratilova to break serve at love and even the match. King saved three match points while serving at 6-7 and three more match points while serving at 7-8. During the change-over between games at 8-9, King's eyeglasses broke {{for the first time}} in her career. She had a spare pair, but they did not feel the same. King saved two match points before Navratilova broke serve to win the match. King said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be the single match in my career that I could have won if I hadn't had bad eyes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Most reviews {{have been}} {{favorable}} with Paul Parcellin of Film Threat {{noting that the}} musical sequences have high production values and seem designed to stand alone as music videos. Though complimentary of the film, he further notes that [...] "...the occasional use of unnecessary graphical element here and there - washed out color, frames rendered in high contrast so that the scene looks like a cartoon - that distract from the story rather than tell it", but granted [...] "To be fair, this is a movie made by musicians who are admittedly taking a stab at filmmaking for the first time. You’ve got to admire their tenacity in getting the thing done." [...] Film Threats overall rating of the film was a 3.5 out of 5 stars or a [...] "Great" [...] rating. [...] Allan Mayes of Ol' Skool Rodz magazine gave a mixed review: [...] "The acting in HRGSTW is bad, but we <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> be on purpose. The soundtrack, from KsK is good and the movie flows right along. We’d suggest watching it with friends rather than alone, because you’re {{going to want to}} laugh and comment on it. And it’s a hot rod movie. When's the last time we had one of those?" [...] and Daniel Strohl of Hemmings eWeekly concurred when he wrote [...] "if you intend to watch Hot Rod Girls Save the World, don’t expect your typical film viewing experience". Blue Suede News found that Jimmie Davies did a credible job as Detective Lloyd and opined that they enjoyed the work of Melene Marie Brown and Kimberly Lynn Layfield, but felt the film could have benefited from tighter editing, as 122 minutes was [...] "a bit longish".|$|E

5000|$|David [...] "Rek" [...] Lee of HipHopDX {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Legends Never Die isn’t a perfect album. The {{sequencing}} is a bit off at times, as it inexplicably jumps from aggressive, lyrical tracks to more subdued conscious records. Also, some of the production feels dated even for an “underground record.” But overall, it’s an album embedded with enough humor, knowledge, and obscure Hip Hop references (“I’m a whooligan like James Caan’s son…”) that will force listeners to keep this one in rotation. R.A. the Rugged Man might not care about an industry exec or releasing music on a consistent basis, but his love for the art is undeniable because he’s only getting better. The champ is here." [...] Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album an eight out of ten, saying [...] "Legends Never Die" [...] is noticeably more intense lyrically, with RA adopting his multi-syllable style which shows influences of Big Pun. [...] "Definition of a Rap Flow" [...] is the perfect example of how refined RA is at his art. The only person I can <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> match him for breathless flow is Esoteric, or Pun himself. This relentless verbal assault follows on [...] "Media Midgets" [...] which carries on RA's hatred of the industry, critics and everything else in between. This is a theme which understandably ran through [...] "Die Rugged Man, Die" [...] as it was his ten years-late debut, but having now established himself with regular work and clearly not toning his act down for radio, the anti-industry message seems redundant at times." [...] Sean Ryon of XXL gave the album an XL, saying [...] "With {{the exception of a few}} fillers, Legends Never Die is a truly compelling entry in the two-decade discography of R.A. the Rugged Man. It’s an album armed with exceptionally mastered production, stunning guest features and raw, emotional delivery from R.A.." ...|$|E
