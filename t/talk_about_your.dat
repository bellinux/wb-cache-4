500|$|That September, Yeats {{proposed}} to 25-year-old Georgie Hyde-Lees (1892–1968), known as George, {{whom he had}} met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends—"George... you can't. He must be dead"—Hyde-Lees accepted, and the two were married on 20 October. Their marriage was a success, {{in spite of the}} age difference, and in spite of Yeats's feelings of remorse and regret during their honeymoon. The couple went on to have two children, Anne and Michael. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband [...] "When you are dead, people will <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry and the Potters couple their rough-edged {{music with}} themed lyrics, which define the band {{as much as}} the costumes. The straight-forward but quirky {{presentation}} of adolescent concerns and direness in the simplest of worries gives the songs their easy likeability. They poke fun at awkward situations from the books. For example, in the song [...] "The Human Hosepipe", they sing, [...] "Maybe you shouldn't have brought up Cedric Diggory/ Because I'd rather not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> dead ex-boyfriends over coffee." [...] Two other examples of the bands distinctive take on teenage angst are seen in the song [...] "Save Ginny Weasley" [...] where they sing, [...] "Are you petrified of being petrified?" [...] and the song [...] "The Godfather." [...] where the gothic or mock-morbid line [...] "Why do I always think that I am going to die?" [...] is sung to an up-beat tune.|$|E

Stack called their dance {{down the aisle}} [...] "utterly joyous and sweet, a showcase for how music can transform everyday events." [...] He added that their [...] "individual vows [...] really lovely, {{even though they did}} seem to be more about their kids than their significant others". TV Guide listed it amongst [...] "The Most Memorable TV Weddings", and commented [...] "If you made it through the vows without shedding a tear you have no soul." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club praised the [...] "genuinely sweet chemistry" [...] between O'Malley and Rosemont, and found the processional dance [...] "nicely moving" [...] though unoriginal. He too commented on the focus on Kurt and Finn in their vows, but conceded, [...] "if you'd been a single parent that long, you'd probably <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> kids a lot too." [...] He expanded: ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make it real. I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E
2500|$|McGraw's {{advice and}} methods have drawn {{criticism}} from some fellow psychotherapists {{as well as}} from some laymen. McGraw's critics regard advice given by him to be at best simplistic, and at worst, ineffective. The National Alliance on Mental Illness called McGraw's conduct in one episode of his television show [...] "unethical" [...] and [...] "incredibly irresponsible". McGraw said in a 2001 South Florida newspaper interview that he never liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that [...] "I'm not the Hush-Puppies, pipe and 'Let's <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> mother' kind of psychologist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Austin's rise {{to stardom}} {{began at the}} 1996 King of the Ring. He began using his {{trademark}} finishing maneuver, the Stone Cold Stunner; with this new technique, he won the King of the Ring tournament. After defeating Marc Mero in the semi-finals, Austin defeated Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts in the finals. The Stunner debuted on June 8, 1996 on Superstars when he defeated jobber Jason Arndt, who later became known as Joey Abs {{a member of the}} Mean Street Posse. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous promo during his coronation, telling Roberts, [...] "You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! <b>Talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> Psalms, talk about ... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!". Austin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an un-telegraphed stroke of luck. Triple H was originally scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring, but was punished for the infamous Curtain Call incident that had transpired earlier that year. [...] "Austin 3:16" [...] ultimately {{became one of the most}} popular catchphrases in wrestling history and subsequently the slogan became one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history. It is also credited as the iconic moment that began the WWF's [...] "Attitude Era".|$|E
