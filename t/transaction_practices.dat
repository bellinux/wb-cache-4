40|$|LatAm’s {{political}} stability, vigorous growth, and the liberalisation of {{the electricity}} markets coupled with the privatisation of their main companies account for the region’s recent protagonism. As a result, deal activity in the LatAm’s power industry increased substantially in the last decade, {{and understanding of the}} main challenges faced during the post-merger integration stage of the M&A process became critical for firms using M&A as a tool to accomplish corporate objectives. However, M&A practitioners cannot resort to the literature, as studies pertinent to the LatAm’s power industry are still incipient.  In view of the above, the value of this research lies in the insights gained by examining current practice in post-merger integration in the LatAm’s power industry with the aid of semi structure interviews with seasoned M&A executives. Furthermore, by comparing current practice and the literature on the matter, a novel comprehension of the topic in the LatAm’s power industry context is established, and future discussion via cross-pollination of experiences is facilitated and energized.  Collectively, the research’s findings provide the following considerations for current and future M&A experts in the LatAm’s power industry, particularly those responsible of leading the post [...] merger integration process. Taking a conservative stance on synergy assessment, and concentrating the post-merger integration to deliver rather conservative results, and when possible to capitalise on new sources of value creation are determinants of successful deals in the LatAm’s power industry; the highly regulated nature of the business, and the latent risks related to the political and social views about the role of private investors in the provision of public services support this recommendation.  Due diligence is not a ‘hygiene factor’ but a determinant of successful post [...] merger integration; due diligence should be carried out to match up the entire post-merger integration process, identify hurdles and levers to drive the transformation, estimate {{how long it would take}} to realise synergies, and understand how the target’s management practices, routines, idiosyncrasy, and beliefs need to be moulded to make the achievement of the deal objectives possible.  LatAm’s power companies should rely on the best practices of post-merger integration outlined in the literature in topics such as planning, measurement and monitoring, human resources, and communication in order to enhance the predictability and reassessment of the process, facilitate employees’ buy-in and management of stakeholders’ expectations, and minimise disruption of day-to-day activities. However, as long as the integration is anchored to the deal’s value drivers, flexibility should be allowed to adapt the plan in the meantime.  Standard views about leadership, culture, organisation, and speed of integration should be avoided, as these post-merger integration topics are conditional on the deal type, and the extent to which target and acquirer firms’ organisation, processes, and culture need to change after the <b>transaction.</b> <b>Practices</b> related to these topics should be designed and deployed according to an in-depth examination of the integration approach required by the deal.  Practitioners should ensure that ‘buy teams’ and ‘integration teams’ are connected; in particular, senior professionals from technical and operational positions should be involved in the planning and design of the post-merger integration to estimate synergies and risks. Furthermore, people in the ‘buy teams’ should be held accountable also for the success of the post-merger integration.  There is no cookie-cutter approach to post-merger integration in the LatAm’s power industry; considerably more contingent research, and in-depth case studies are required in order to avoid getting in standard views of post-merger integration.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays with specific objectives. The overall objective is, however, to seek a further understanding {{of the issue of}} cross-border residential transaction markets. While the first two essays focus specifically on transaction processes and costs in a number of selected countries, the two subsequent essays shift their attention towards the EU’s Internal Market and the impact of differences between the countries, with relation to the transparency of transaction markets. The research is primary based on studies of written sources, subject-specific literature and legislation. The main message is that organization of the transaction process affects transaction costs in different ways. It can be argued that efficiency is associated with a lowering of transaction costs. The efficiency of different structures depends on our perspective. Transparency is associated with the organisation of transactions and their needs, though the term is somewhat unclear. Generally, the term may refer to the ability of transaction participants to observe information concerning the transacting process, thereby increasing their knowledge to make informed decisions. Thus {{it can be argued that}} a better basis for the decision-making process presupposes information disclosure, more standardized <b>transaction</b> <b>practices,</b> synchronized legal systems, and both legible and transparent regulations. This leads to the design of a transparency system, which is based on an understanding of the need for the system and its goal. Although reaching transparency will be both complex and time-consuming, this study draws attention to certain key aspect of the need to encourage transparency. The first two essays focus on how residential transactions are organized in selected countries and on the costs for carrying out these transactions. Essay II works with two hypotheses concerning the relation between the organizational structure and the transaction costs. The study shows that transaction processes and costs differ considerably between the countries and as a result it is difficult to arrange the countries in a clear way according to their rules. Moreover, there is no clear connection between a broker’s education level and how large a part in the process s/he plays. The total transaction costs excluding taxes vary from approximately 3 up to 8. 5 percent. The costs are lower when the recording system is well arranged, when a broker has a bigger part in the process and when a conveyancer is impartial. In the countries where a broker has a higher education level and plays bigger part in the process, the broker’s commission is not any higher when compared to other countries in the study. The study shows also that transaction costs are lower in the countries where the broker has a more neutral role and where fewer parties are involved in the process. Thus in order to avoid high transaction costs, it is important to avoid situations where both buyer and seller have their own agents. Furthermore, the availability of standardized information about properties may increase the efficiency of the market even though it increases the short run transaction cost. Essay III provides a theoretical framework for an analysis of the concept of transparency in residential property transactions within the EU’s internal market and tries to identify the essential factors that need to be addressed with respect to transparency of procedural, regulative and economic features. Essay IV seeks a further understanding of the issue of transparency in the residential property transaction market and attempts to define the state of transparency on the basis of selected EU-countries, in accord with five specific dimensions. The essential points are that an increase in cross-border transactions increases demand for easy access to information in other countries, and that the studied literature focuses on the coordination of legal systems, which produces systems that are more uniform and legally secured, and on broadening the mortgage market. Some of the aspects analysed in the study are far from transparent while others may be considered relatively transparent. The degree of transparency in the EU’s internal market is determined by how transparency is defined, since something may be transparent based on a certain criteria but not on others, especially when the concept is a relative one and subject to changes. The study raises some key aspect as a basis for discussion about the encouragement of transparency. QC 2011112...|$|E

5000|$|Beyond {{resulting}} in substantial political and economical shifts, globalization has also affected {{social and cultural}} practices between people. According to citizenship scholars like Andrew Vandenberg, such acts of globalization eventually [...] "ended the constraints {{of space and time}} that conditioned all earlier human <b>transactions,</b> <b>practices,</b> and therefore identities. With the growth and distribution of technology, more {{people all over the world}} have come to establish personal relationships with one another. Former state-regulated formal encounters are now replaced by modern informal and all the more frequent interactions. Rapid world economic growth has consequently led to international migrations. In recent years, in conjunction with globalization, increased instances of uncontrolled and predominantly illegal international migrations contribute to opportunities for escalating transnational identities. Because obvious ties surface between immigrants, their home countries, and the receiving countries, the civic ramifications are widespread. Thus international immigration contributes to loosening individual state ties. Once in their host countries, immigrants form social networks while maintaining ties to their homeland. Some organizations function in both countries, which serves to further enhance the notion that international migrants act as transnational citizens in multiple lands.|$|R
