5|$|Gefjon appears {{prominently}} as the allegorical {{mother of}} Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in the forty-page Swedish Romantic poem Gefion, a Poem in Four Cantos by Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll (1770–1835). A fountain depicting Gefjun driving her oxen sons <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> plough (The Gefion Fountain, 1908) by Anders Bundgaard stands in Copenhagen, Denmark, {{on the island}} of Zealand, as in the myth. The Gefion family, a family of asteroids, and asteroid 1272 Gefion (discovered in 1931 by Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth) both derive their names from that of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{completion}} on 10 March 1945, 801, 828, 880, and 1771 Squadrons reembarked {{with a total}} strength of 48 Seafires, 21 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and a dozen Fireflies, the largest air group aboard a British carrier thus far. Implacable departed six days later to join the BPF and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 25 March. While passing through the Suez Canal, a strong gust of wind forced her ashore and it took her escorting tugboats five hours <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off. Undamaged, she proceeded on her voyage and reached Sydney on 8 May 1945 (V-E Day).|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons end up staying inside {{during an}} acid {{rainstorm}} caused by The Republican Party's latest {{decision to make}} caring for the environment a felony offense {{to play a game}} of Monopoly. When it is revealed that Bart has been cheating by using Lego bricks as hotel pieces, Bart threatens Lisa and Homer assaults him. Marge and Lisa try to pry them apart. Despite her inability to talk, Maggie calls the police on her family before taking hold of Marge and attempting <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off Homer. With help from an edible taffy-like substance and a robot, the entire Simpson family is arrested for causing a domestic disturbance.|$|E
5000|$|Susan Kushner: Ramona's rival. Ramona {{is always}} tempted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> at <b>her</b> blond curly hair.|$|R
60|$|Pearl laughed, and {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> away <b>her</b> hand. But the minister held it fast.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] Björk {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out <b>her</b> {{performance}} at the Sydney Big Day Out under doctor's orders following swelling on her vocal cords.|$|R
5|$|Webb {{demonstrated}} his aggressiveness when {{he attempted}} to sortie on the first spring tide (30 May) after taking command, but Atlantas forward engine broke down after he had passed the obstructions, and the ship ran aground. She was not damaged although it took over a day <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> free. He planned to make another attempt on the next full tide, rejecting Mallory's idea that he wait until the nearly complete ironclad Savannah was finished before his next sortie. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont, commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, had ordered the monitors Weehawken and Nahant into Wassaw Sound. Commander John Rodgers in Weehawken had overall command of the two ships.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying (ovipositing) {{involves}} {{not only}} the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate, but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem. The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own, something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection. If successful, a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously; this activity takes up {{much of the time}} that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture. Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg-laying, and when the female submerges to deposit eggs, the male may help <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out of the water.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
60|$|There {{were plenty}} of hands willing <b>to</b> help <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> in. Paul stepped out on to the beach, and looked around for some one to whom he could make himself understood.|$|R
50|$|In the variant Andrew Lang included, {{the woman}} saw a {{neighbor}} of hers, kept prisoner as a nurse, {{and was able to}} tell her husband how <b>to</b> rescue <b>her,</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> down from riding fairies as in Tam Lin.|$|R
6000|$|When Betty {{came into}} the room a few minutes later <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off <b>her</b> father's boots she found him sitting like one transfixed. He held out the letter, saying, [...] "Read that, child." ...|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Braunschweig {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise in June and July, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. During torpedo training on 16 February 1905, Wörth ran aground off Stollergrund; Braunschweig unsuccessfully attempted <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> free and other ships were called to come to Wörths aid. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. On 22 November, Prince Heinrich boarded the ship in Kiel, which then steamed to Denmark to take Prince Carl of Denmark to Norway, where he was crowned Haakon VII of Norway. Braunschweig was back in Kiel by 30 November. On 14 December, Braunschweig was replaced as the deputy commander's flagship by the battleship , which had larger facilities for a command staff.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
60|$|Then came discovery, {{the baron}} {{descending}} as a thunderbolt, the banishment of the squire, the lady driven {{at last to}} wed the young knight, her weeping and bewailing herself under his ill-treatment, which extended <b>to</b> <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> about by the hair, {{the return of the}} lover, notified by a song behind the scenes, a dangerously affectionate meeting, interrupted by the husband, a fierce clashing of swords, mutual slaughter by the two gentlemen, and the lady dying of grief on the top of her lover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it was a}} grand {{thing for}} you <b>to</b> do--to <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out of the water, Dave, and {{she ought to be}} {{exceedingly}} grateful. Just the same, I don't think I like her very much," [...] and Jessie pouted a little.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{motioned for}} his {{companion}} <b>to</b> help him <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> up, and then stole {{through the woods}} as noiselessly as a shadow.|$|R
5|$|While Lowestoffe was sailing {{through the}} Caicos passage late on 10 August, Pamplin {{realised}} that the strong currents known {{to run through}} the channel had reversed direction and Lowestoffe was running into shallow waters. He attempted to avoid grounding, but to no avail, and the Lowestoffe ran broadside onto Little Inagua (“Heneaga”) Island. The crew threw stores and equipment overboard to lighten the ship, and boats came from other ships in the convoy to try <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off. The attempts to refloat her failed and her crew abandoned her by mid-afternoon. The only casualties were five men who drowned when their boat capsized in the surf. The change in currents also caused the wreck of five merchantmen. In the late afternoon of 11 August Acasta left Bonetta and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy.|$|E
25|$|General Slocum {{experienced}} {{a series of}} mishaps following her launch in 1891. Four months after her launching, she ran aground off Rockaway. Tugboats had to be used <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> free.|$|E
25|$|In January 1806, {{while under}} the command of Lieutenant Martin White, she {{grounded}} off Rysum, in the River Ems, East Friesland. When White went ashore to supervise attempts <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off, a party of Dutchmen from a schuyt landed and captured him. Manlys master, William Golding, decided to surrender her. Dutch gun-boats then captured her. The subsequent court martial stripped Golding of his rank for conduct unbecoming an officer and ordered him to serve a two-year term as a seaman. The board also reprimanded White for not having lightened Manly before trying <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off.|$|E
50|$|In September 2015, a {{pregnant}} woman wearing the hijab was attacked by teenagers in Montreal, when they tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off <b>her</b> hearscarf, causing her to fall. Quebec's National Assembly responded by passing a unanimous resolution against Islamophobia.|$|R
5000|$|One error {{can be seen}} in the Bateson's Belfry sequence. When the lid is {{wrenched}} off {{the casket}} and Lesley-Anne Down bends in <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> out <b>her</b> [...] "brother," [...] Donald Sutherland's eyes twitch from left to right.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] said Albert Lee <b>to</b> his sister, <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> one side, [...] "quite right--the Archfiend {{himself is}} upon us!" ...|$|R
25|$|Oceanus' {{daughters were}} filled with fear, but the young Artemis bravely {{approached}} and asked for bow and arrows. Callimachus then tells how Artemis visited Pan, {{the god of the}} forest, who gave her seven bitches and six dogs. She then captured six golden-horned deer <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> chariot. Artemis practiced with her bow first by shooting at trees and then at wild beasts.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 {{incident}} {{became an}} international news story, {{and shortly after}} the attack {{a woman who had}} lived in the same area as Herold came forward with information that back in 1996 the chimpanzee had bitten her hand and tried <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> into a vehicle as she greeted him. She claimed to have complained to the Herolds and to police. The police stated they have no records of any such complaint.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} with Eustace Scrubb, who was {{introduced}} in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and his classmate Jill. They are unhappy at their school, where bullying is left uncorrected. One day they are beset by bullies, and Eustace suggests that they ask for Aslan's help. They blunder through a temporary gate and {{find themselves in a}} Unknown Place, atop an immense cliff. Jill, showing off, moves too close to the edge, and Eustace falls off trying <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> back.|$|E
50|$|If {{the player}} <b>to</b> be slapped <b>pulls</b> <b>her</b> or {{his hand away}} fast enough, the person who {{attempted}} to slap the hand is out.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} home Anne sank upon a stool outside the door, {{fatigued}} with her excursion. Her first act was <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> off <b>her</b> shoe--it {{was a difficult}} matter; but John stood beating with his switch {{the leaves of the}} creeper on the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Mariner will be here, too. A foursome. Tell Mrs. Barker <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> up <b>her</b> {{socks and}} give us {{something}} pretty ripe. Soup, fish, {{all that sort of}} thing. She knows. And let's have a stoup of malvoisie from the oldest bin. This is a special occasion!" ...|$|R
25|$|Seine {{underwent}} a refit at Chatham Dockyard between June and July 1803, with Milne recommissioning her in May for the North Sea. However, {{shortly after her}} return to service she grounded on a sandbank to the northward of Terschelling on 21 July 1803. That evening Milne had ordered the pilots to keep her out of shallow water and they had assured {{him that she was}} safe; forty minutes later she struck. The crew labored all night and well into the morning, with the assistance of two passing merchant vessels <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off and to lighten her, but to no avail. At about 11:30am the crew abandoned Seine; they set fire to her as they left to prevent the French recapturing her.|$|E
25|$|Nimrod sailed from Cork on 13 January 1828 for the Clyde. A gale {{developed}} during the night that damaged her and caused her to take on water. As she approached Anglesey Sparshott decided to take refuge at Holyhead. She {{was able to get}} into the harbour and anchor. The wind changed direction and she lost her anchor and the wind and sea drove her onto a ridge of rocks. By midnight of 14 January it became possible to get a line to shore and get the crew off her. Over the next few days her stores were landed and on 12 February the steamer Harlequin was able <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> off the rocks. The Navy judged her not worth repairing. She was sold to Rowland Robert & Co. on 22 February for £510. The subsequent court martial acquitted Sparshott, his officers, and men of her loss.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May Comus {{sent her}} boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended {{by a strong}} fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed felucca, which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The {{boarding}} party, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Watts, cleared her deck of her crew and the boats started <b>to</b> <b>pull</b> <b>her</b> out (the Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay pulled on a hawser. Eventually the boarding party cut the hawser and the boats succeeded in pulling the felucca out, an operation they conducted under fire. The felucca was the packet ship San Pedro de Apostol, which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, San Pedro de Apostol had captured the Lord Keith, which had been sailing from London to Mogador.|$|E
60|$|A {{few of them}} stood up, {{moving out}} into the aisle, toward the lounge and the {{cocktail}} bar. Beside Thacher the girl got <b>to</b> <b>her</b> feet, <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> jacket around her shoulders.|$|R
60|$|The low sun {{made the}} water all purple and pinkish, with golden {{lights on the}} barrels of the long swells, and blue and green {{mackerel}} shades in the hollows. Each schooner in sight seemed <b>to</b> be <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> dories towards her by invisible strings, and the little black figures in the tiny boats pulled like clockwork toys.|$|R
60|$|She did not reply, {{though she}} had to fight herself <b>to</b> keep from <b>pulling</b> <b>her</b> gun and {{shooting}} at him. She guided the running horse back into the trail, rapidly leaving Creech out of sight.|$|R
