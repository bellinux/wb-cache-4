40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> legislative <b>drafting</b> process and <b>the</b> drafter’s {{role in the}} production of quality legislation - looking in particular at questions surrounding the way drafters handle <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> process, <b>the</b> issue of permission to <b>draft,</b> <b>drafting</b> <b>instructions,</b> <b>drafting</b> manual, <b>the</b> drafter’s skills, the quality of legislation, and applying Thornton’s five stages of <b>drafting</b> process. <b>The</b> author argues that Drafters should adopt Thornton’s five stages of <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> process (understanding <b>the</b> proposal, analysing the proposal, designing the law, composing and developing <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> and <b>the</b> scrutiny of <b>the</b> <b>draft)</b> in order {{to improve the quality of}} legislation. The author also identifies any gaps in the process and the problems drafters encounter, which directly or indirectly affect the quality of the legislation they produce. The discussion is supported with arguments put forward by different legal experts and legal professionals. Examples are drawn from the Sierre Leone and Rwandan jurisdictions based on interviews with drafters from five key Rwandan legislative institutions, namely: the Ministry of Justice, the Rwandan Senate, the Rwandan Parliament, the President’s office and the Prime Minister’s office...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA preliminary study was completed that measured the operational and technical feasibility of video teleconferencing (VTC) at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). As {{a part of}} the fact-finding effort, a VTC Round Table was convened in order to define the nature of the problems that prompted NPS to consider VTC as a possible solution. Potential opportunities for utilizing VTC {{to improve the quality of}} education offered by NPS were discussed, and various alternatives for installing a system were considered. It was concluded that the operational and technical feasibility were convincing enough to justify the continuation of VTC implementation at NPS. The economic aspects were viewed to be of secondary importance because case studies indicate that the quantitative benefits such as travel displacement have been overshadowed by the qualitative gains such as increased productivity. This study recommends that NPS move ahead with its plans to implement a "full-feature" VTC system and install it in a new academic building currently under construction. Additionally, this study acknowledges the findings of <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> DoD <b>instruction</b> "Teleconferencing Activities, Systems and Networks" which endorses the use of the Federal Telecommunications System (FTS) 2000 for long-haul network services. It is recommended that NPS utilize the FTS 2000 Compressed Video Teleconferencing System (CVTS) for its VTC needs, and lease the VTC equipment with an option to buy. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the current}} {{scenario}} in multilingual documentation generation and the types of tools currently being used in support of the translation task, and discuss their shortcomings. We examine emergent trends in the document industry, observing a reorganisation of the workflow which mirrors a shift of attention from translating to authoring and from the ergonomics of post-editing the target text to the ergonomics of producing the source text. We argue that these trends invite the design and development of new tools for the task of producing multilingual texts, and that multilingual generation provides the appropriate technology, shifting attention to an even earlier stage in the authoring process, that of specifying the semantics of the text to be produced. We describe a prototype system which exploits this technology to meet the expressed needs of authors and translators by supporting them in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of multilingual <b>instructions.</b> We suggest that, in the futur [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{previous}} studies on jury instructions have {{been confined to}} legalese such as the lexical and syntactic features of jury instructions. This study, drawing on reported cases on jury instructions from the Hong Kong judiciary, aims to examine jury instructions in Hong Kong to better explore how jury instructions are given in Hong Kong, being a common-law jurisdiction, and to argue that Grice’s Cooperative Principle can be usefully adopted to examine jury instructions in order to {{shed some light on}} <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of jury <b>instructions.</b> <b>The</b> study argues that the principle of rationality, a deeper-level of observance of Gricean maxims, which underlies the Cooperative Principle, has interpretative force on jury instructions in the case of non-observance of conversational maxims, and that, in the court judgments examined, non-observance of the fundamental communicative principle usually constitutes a good ground for appeal, although the opposite is also true. It therefore provides a pertinent demonstration of the differences of the operation of Gricean maxims in lay and legal contexts. Department of Englis...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{validity}} of parent-reported height, weight and body mass index (BMI) values of children (aged 4 - 10 years), when measured at home by means of newly developed <b>instruction</b> <b>leaflets</b> in comparison with simple estimated parental reports. Design: Randomised controlled trial with control and intervention group using simple randomisation. Setting: Belgian {{children and their parents}} recruited via schools (multistage cluster sampling design). Participants: 164 Belgian children (53 % male; participation rate 62 %). Intervention: Parents completed a questionnaire including questions about the height and weight of their child. Parents in the intervention group received <b>instruction</b> <b>leaflets</b> to measure their child's weight and height. Classes were randomly allocated to the intervention and control groups. Nurses measured height and weight following standardised procedures up to 2 weeks after parental reports. Outcome measures: Weight, height and BMI category of the child were derived from the index measurements and the parental reports. Results: Mean parent-reported weight was slightly more underestimated in the intervention group than in the control group relative to the index weights. However, for all three parameters (weight, height and BMI), correlations between parental reports and nurse measurements were higher in the intervention group. Sensitivity for underweight and overweight/obesity was respectively, 75 % and 60 % in the intervention group, and 67 % and 43 % in the control group. Weighed for classifying children in the correct BMI category was 0. 30 in the control group and was 0. 51 in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although mean parent-reported weight was slightly more underestimated in the intervention than in the control group, correlations were higher and there was considerably less misclassification into valid BMIcategories for the intervention group. This pattern suggests that most of the parental deviations from the index measurements were probably due to random errors of measurement and that diagnostic measures could improve by encouraging parents to measure their children's weight and height at home by means of <b>instruction</b> <b>leaflets...</b>|$|R

40|$|Usually, {{infants and}} {{children}} contract the HIV infection from the mother during pregnancy, delivery or breastfeeding: AIDS is a chronic disease. Effective treatment requires a combination of several different antiretroviral medications one {{to three times a}} day. It is a complex treatment especially for children. Patient compliance is a determining factor of the AIDS therapy. Adherence to medications among children and adolescents appears to be frequently suboptimal(1, 2). The major point of clinical pharmacy is to provide children and their families with knowledge, skills and tools to manage antiretroviral treatment(3, 4).

30|$|Finally, {{this review}} found a {{weakness}} {{reported on the}} loss of manualized instructions that regulate the data analysis. Saxena et al. (2015, p. 492) {{pointed out that the}} initial version of the new scale “did not contain manualized instructions for raters, so it lacked objective anchor points for choosing specific ratings on many of its questions”. Therefore, an important detail that should have the attention of future researchers are instructions that determine the application methods of the new scale. Pasquali (2010) suggests that when <b>drafting</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructions,</b> the researcher should define the development of operational strategies that will enable the application of the instrument and the format in which it will be presented and decide both how the subject’s response will be given for each item and the way that the respondent should answer each item. The researcher should also define how the scale scores would be analyzed. In addition, the instructions need to be as short as possible without confusion to the subjects of the target population, should contain one or more examples of how the items should be answered, and should ensure that the subject is free of any related tension or anxiety.|$|R
