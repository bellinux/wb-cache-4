50|$|In August 1862, {{while the}} American Civil War was being waged, the United States (Union) {{government}} began taxing {{a variety of}} goods, services and legal dealings. To confirm that taxes were paid a 'revenue stamp' was purchased and appropriately affixed to the <b>taxable</b> <b>item,</b> which would in turn pay the tax duty involved.|$|E
50|$|In the {{continuation}} of providing funding for the Spanish-American War Congress authorized a tax {{on a wide range}} of goods and services including various alcohol and tobacco products, tea and other amusements and also on various legal and business transactions (such as Stock certificates, bills of lading, manifests, and marine insurance). To pay these tax dutiesrevenue tax stamps were purchased and affixed to the <b>taxable</b> <b>item</b> or respective certificate. There are seventeen stamps in this issue which occur in denominations ranging from Â½-cent to 50-dollars which were printed on double lined watermarked paper. Two types of perforations were used: Rouletted perforations and 'hyphen' shaped perforations. Numerous double transfers occur (doubled image) in this issue.|$|E
50|$|Exemptions {{typically}} {{fall into}} two categories: usage based or entity based. Use based exemptions are when an otherwise <b>taxable</b> <b>item</b> or service is used {{in a manner that}} has been deemed exempt. The resale exemption is the most common use based exemption. Other use based exemptions could be items or services to be used in manufacturing, research & development, or teleproduction. Entity based exemptions are when the item or service is exempt solely because the purchaser falls into a category the state has granted an exempt status. Exempt entities could be government (federal, state or local), non-profit organizations, religious organizations, tribal governments, or foreign diplomats. Every state decides for themselves which use based and entity based exemption they will grant.|$|E

40|$|Built, Operate and Transfer (BOT) is the {{financing}} for a construction project {{in which the}} investor should himself prepare the project financing. He should also be responsible for preparing the materials, equipment, and other facilities which are needed for the project equipment. The compensation {{is that he will}} be given the right to operate and to benefit its economy in a certain time. Cooperative agreement by using BOT system is not only between the government and private sector but also between non-government and private sector. There is no obstacle in BOT agreement between the government and private sector in levying BPHTB and Final PPh (income tax) on land and building rights transfer, while obstacle in the same case is found in BOT agreement between non-government and private sector; the obstacle is also found in levying BPHTB and Final PPh on the land and building rights transfer in BOT transaction. The judicial obstacle {{is that there is no}} specific regulation on BOT transaction in Article 85, paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 of PDRB law as <b>taxable</b> <b>item</b> in levying BPHTB and Final PPh on land and building rights transfer, while Final PPh on land and building rights transfer is levied tax payable as it is stipulated in the provision of the Decree of the Minister of Finance No. 635 /KMK. 04 / 1994 as it is finally amended to the Regulation of the Minister of Finance No. 243 /PMK. 03 / 2008...|$|E

500|$|Income earned {{and saved}} {{would not be}} taxed until spent under the proposal. [...] Households at the extreme high end of {{consumption}} often finance their purchases out of savings, not income. Economist Laurence Kotlikoff states that the FairTax could make the tax system much more progressive and generationally equitable, and argues that taxing consumption is effectively the same as taxing wages plus taxing wealth. [...] A household of three persons (this example will use two adults plus one child; the rebate does not consider marital status) spending $30,000 a year on <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> would devote about 3.4% of total spending (/$30,000 spending) to the FairTax after the rebate. The same household spending $125,000 on <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> would spend around 18.3% (/$125,000 spending) on the FairTax. [...] At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact and the rate approaches 23% of total spending. [...] Thus, according to economist Laurence Kotlikoff, the effective tax rate is progressive on consumption.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea behind}} this act {{is that by}} {{creating}} more and better hunting experiences for people through habitat management and hunter education, more <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> will be purchased, which would then provide more funding for management and improvement. [...] The habitat improvement may also stimulate the eco-tourism {{sector of the economy}} by creating jobs in areas where people tend to visit for hunting or aesthetic reasons.|$|R
50|$|An excise or {{excise tax}} is any duty on {{manufactured}} goods which is levied {{at the moment}} of manufacture, rather than at sale. Excises are often associated with customs duties (which are levied on pre-existing goods when they cross a designated border in a specific direction); customs are levied on goods which come into existence - as <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> - at the border, while excise is levied on goods which came into existence inland.|$|R
50|$|Sales {{taxes are}} imposed by most states and some localities {{on the price}} at retail sale of many goods and some services. Sales tax rates vary widely among {{jurisdiction}}s, from 0% to 16%, and may vary within a jurisdiction based on the particular goods or services taxed. Sales tax is collected by the seller {{at the time of}} sale, or remitted as use tax by buyers of <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> who did not pay sales tax.|$|R
500|$|A household's {{effective}} {{tax rate}} on consumption would vary with the annual expenditures on <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> and the fixed monthly tax rebate. The rebate would have the greatest effect at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or below. The lowest {{effective tax rate}} under the FairTax could be negative due to the rebate for households with annual spending amounts below poverty level spending for a specified household size. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. A person spending at the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 0%, whereas someone spending at four times the poverty level would have an effective tax rate of 17.2%. Buying or otherwise receiving items and services not subject to federal taxation (such as a used home or car) can contribute towards a lower effective tax rate. The total amount of spending {{and the proportion of}} spending allocated to <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> would determine a household's effective tax rate on consumption. [...] If a rate is calculated on income, instead of the tax base, the percentage could exceed the statutory tax rate in a given year.|$|R
5|$|The budget also {{included}} changes to {{products and services}} that {{are subject to the}} sales tax, effective October 1, 2006. The newly <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> included downloaded music, ringtones, movies and books; shipping and handling; drapery and carpet dry cleaning; floor installation; contracted landscaping; self-storage; tanning; massages; tattooing; magazines; investigation and security services such as armored cars and alarm systems; limousines, except for those used in funerals; memberships in health, athletic and shopping clubs; and parking, except for employee parking, parking at municipal meters and parking already subject to municipal parking taxes.|$|R
5000|$|The FairTax {{legislation}} would apply a 23% federal retail {{sales tax on}} the total transaction value of new retail goods and services purchases; in other words, consumers pay to the government 23 cents of every dollar spent (sometimes called tax-inclusive [...] - [...] as income taxes are calculated). The assessed tax rate is 30% if the FairTax {{is added to the}} pre-tax price of a good like traditional U.S. sales taxes (sometimes called tax-exclusive). The effective tax rate for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebates. The rebates would have the greatest impact at low spending levels, where they could lower a household's effective rate to zero or a negative rate. At higher spending levels, the rebate has less impact, and a household's effective tax rate would approach 23% of total spending. For example, a household of three spending $30,000 a year on <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> would devote about 6% of total spending to the FairTax after the rebate. A household spending $125,000 on <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> would spend around 19% on the FairTax. The rebate would be paid in twelve monthly installments equal to 23% of poverty level spending for each household size and is meant to eliminate the taxation of necessities and make the plan progressive. [...] Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if Americans perceive the monthly FairTax rebate as additional income, instead of a return on taxes paid, the tax rate could be viewed as proportional. Laurence Kotlikoff, Boston University economist, stated that Bartlett's assessment was flawed psychology or political science, and not based on economics or perceptions under the current tax system.|$|R
40|$|In a socially-oriented {{country the}} {{development}} standard {{is determined by}} the living standards of population. The article is devoted to a comprehensive presentation of tax mechanism influencing the quality of Russiansâ life, based on the interdependence of tax revenue and spending. The article comprehensively presented and explained variable combination of tax techniques and tools, influencing the financial component of the living standard of the population (individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activities), including: the type and level of tax required and elective elements of the tax, tax residency, tax audits and combating tax evasion. The author presents the elements of tax mechanism of influence on the financial component of the living standards of Russians. As the main indicator for evaluating the impact of the tax mechanism on the living standards, the author proposed the indicator of tax burden, calculated both as the total size and as a structure: the objects of taxation (income, property and indirect taxation) and tax levels (Federal, regional and local). The author points to a slight increase in tax burden of the Russians since 2006 and 2015, against a significant growth of the amount of tax paid by them and the amount of cash income; predominance of income and Federal taxes in the structure of tax burden; a slight change {{in the structure of the}} tax burden on <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> and tax rates...|$|R
30|$|Concerning {{the burden}} or {{redistribution}} effects of indirect taxes, {{there has been}} much study in the literature. The methods adopted by the author include micro simulation and general equilibrium analysis. Based on industry and household data, the micro simulation method is more suitable for figuring out the effects of the industry-related policy adjustments. In conducting research using this method, a key point is the estimation of the VAT and/or business tax included in the prices of the goods or services purchased by the households. Some studies directly take the statutory rates of VAT or business tax as the tax burden rates of the specific expenditure items of the households (Liu and Nie 2004; 2009), others determine the tax burden of the household expenditure items through measurement of the tax burden of various industries on the basis of input-output data and then match the industries in the input-output table with the household expenditure items. Considering the fact that China levies VAT or business tax on different goods or services, and the applicable rates and credit rules vary across different <b>taxable</b> <b>items</b> even within the VAT regime, the method based on input-output data can achieve more accurate results. However, in measuring the tax burden of each industry, earlier studies (Nie and Liu 2009; 2010; Tamaoka 1994) considered only the tax burden at the last stage in supplying the relevant goods and services and ignored the taxes included in the prices of the inputs and shifted finally to the households. More recent studies (Scutella 1999; Nie and Yue 2013) made important progress by including the input taxes in overall tax burden, but since the analysis is based on the data of collected tax revenue and leads to results reflecting the combined effects of tax system and tax administration, their method is still problematic for evaluating the effects of tax reform.|$|R

40|$|Like most {{developing}} countries, Uganda faces serious fiscal {{challenges in}} her effort to mobilize and effectively use resources for poverty reduction. however, {{the tax base}} remains small {{as reflected in the}} low tax-to-GDP. the government is under internal and external pressure to increase its domestic revenue collection and i turn, reduce its dependency on donors. In response to the pressure the government endeavored to maintain fiscal discipline, partly by raising taxes. the consequences of this move on the poor remains unclear. the main {{purpose of this paper is}} to throw light on the effects of alternative reforms to existing tax system on those households living in poverty. The analysis was carried out using the nationally representative Uganda national household survey of 1999 / 00 (UNHS I) using micro-simulation techniques. the key findings emerging from the analysis are: Increasing value added tax (VAT) other taxes unchanged will increase the tax burden of the poor but the non-poor households will continue paying more taxes relative to their expenditures that the poor households; Zero rating of the key <b>taxable</b> consumer <b>items</b> consumed by the poor would have little fiscal consequences. the amount of revenue forgone is less than the graduated tax (head tax) forgone; and the largest portion of the tax burden born by the poor households originates from VAT followed by excise duties and graduated tax.
