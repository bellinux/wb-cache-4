30|$|FESEM is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used method for observing PAAs’ microstructure, since FESEM can not only observe the surface, but also the <b>transverse,</b> <b>tilt</b> and cross-sections, as well as analyze the elemental composition by the energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Figure 3 a, 3 b is the typical surface and cross-sectional FESEM images of typical PAAs, respectively. The view field of FESEM is so wide that we can relocate the targets quickly, and that a systematically study on PAA microstructure can be accomplished in short time. Another advantage of FESEM is its low requirements on sample preparation, since the micro-scale roughness and nano-scale height fluctuations can be easily overcome by adjusting the distance between sample and probe and focusing process.|$|E
40|$|X-ray free {{electron}} lasers (XFELs) are innovative research tools {{able to produce}} high-power and short radiation pulses for multiple scientific applications. We present a new method to produce XFEL radiation with much higher power and shorter pulse lengths than the ones obtained at standard XFEL facilities. This will enable new kinds of experiments in scientific fields such as nonlinear optics and bioimaging. The scheme is based on introducing a <b>transverse</b> <b>tilt</b> to the electron beam, thus limiting the fraction of the bunch able to produce XFEL radiation. In {{the first part of}} the undulator beam line only the tail of the electron bunch lases. Then, by properly delaying and correcting the trajectory of the electron beam between some undulator modules, all the electrons can contribute to the amplification of a very short XFEL pulse. Apart from being efficient, our method is flexible since by tuning the tilt amplitude one can obtain shorter or more energetic XFEL pulses. The scheme can readily be applied since, besides the standard components of an XFEL facility, it only needs small chicanes between certain undulator modules. We have confirmed the validity of our proposal with numerical simulations done for the SwissFEL case...|$|E

Both the derivation of our model, which goes beyond conventional Gaussian flux liquid hydrodynamics, {{and its relationship to}} other approaches used in the literature are discussed. We focus on the response to a <b>transverse</b> <b>tilting</b> field which is controlled by the tilt modulus, c 44, of the flux array. We show that interaction effects can enhance c 44 even in infinitely thick clean materials. This enhancement can be interpreted as the appearance of a disentangled flux-liquid fraction. In contrast to earlier work, our theory incorporates the nonlocality of the intervortex interaction in the field direction. This nonlocality is crucial for obtaining a nonvanishing renormalization of the tilt modulus in the thermodynamic limit of thick samples. Comment: 20 pages, 3 figures (submitted to PRB...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{formulate}} a computational {{framework for the}} characterization and performance optimization of gravity tables. Segregation of a multi-dispersed population of grains is assessed using a comprehensive numerical framework integrating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with a Discrete Element Method (DEM) setup in the open-source software OpenFOAM. We have carried out combined qualitative and quantitative assessments of process conditions, such as deck shape, deck inclination (longitudinal and transverse), vibration speed and fluidizing air velocities at the surface. We assess the performance of our framework by employing a quantitative metric rhostat, which represents the efficiency of separation in terms of density {{differences between the two}} separated product fractions. Additionally, qualitative flow behaviour is evaluated by examining relevant velocity and material distribution trends. We show that these separation profiles are highly sensitive to changes in the design and process conditions, with the presence of discernible optimal operating points. For the chosen gravity table, we have identified a longitudinal tilt of 6 degrees, an eccentric speed between 300 and 350 RPM, deck air velocities of up to 1. 5 m/s and a <b>transverse</b> <b>tilt</b> of 0. 75 degrees as a set of optimal operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing [© Elsevier Ltd. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] sensitivities in laser vibrometry are the consequence of measurement noise generated by surface motions other than that on-axis with the incident laser beam(s), such as transverse and tilt vibrations or rotation. Concentrating solely on commercial laser vibrometers to maximise value to the vibrometer user, this paper quantifies pseudo-vibration sensitivities for five single beam instruments (for translational vibration measurement) and two parallel beam instruments (for angular vibration measurement) across a range of surface treatments and roughnesses. <b>Transverse,</b> <b>tilt</b> and rotation sensitivities are quantified for the single beam instruments. In-plane rotation, rotation and tilt sensitivities are quantified for the parallel beam instruments. Estimates of sensitivities for parallel beam instruments based on related quantifications for single beam instruments are shown to offer order-of-magnitude agreement. Further confirmation is provided of the benefits of smaller laser beams for measurements on tilting or rotating surfaces and of larger beams for measurements on surfaces with transverse motion. For rotor vibration applications, lower sensitivities are found for a focus location on the shaft rotation axis rather than its surface. Based on experimental evidence, refinements to the test methods are suggested with a view towards the formation of a Standard. These comprise placing limits on surface flatness and rotor out-of-roundness, inclusion of agreed ranges for target displacement amplitude and rotor diameter, and acknowledgement of the importance of focus location for rotation sensitivities...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents fundamental {{research in the field}} of laser vibrometry for the application to vibration measurements. A key concern for laser vibrometry is the effect of laser speckle which appears when a coherent laser beam scatters from an optically rough surface. The laser vibrometer is sensitive to changes in laser speckle which result from surface motions not {{in the direction of the}} incident beam. This adds speckle noise to the vibrometer output which can be indistinguishable from the genuine surface vibrations. This has been termed ‘pseudo-vibration’ and requires careful data interpretation by the vibration engineer. This research has discovered that measurements from smooth surfaces, even when no identifiable speckle pattern is generated, can produce noise and therefore reference to speckle noise, in such circumstances, is inappropriate. This thesis has, therefore, adopted the more general term of pseudo-vibration to include noise generated from any surface roughness or treatment, i. e. including but not limited to speckle noise. This thesis develops and implements novel experimental methods to quantify pseudovibration sensitivities (<b>transverse,</b> <b>tilt</b> and rotation sensitivity) with attention focussed on commercially available laser vibrometers and consideration is given to a range of surface roughnesses and treatments. It investigates, experimentally, the fundamental behaviour of speckles and attempts to formulate, for the first time, a relationship between changes in intensity to pseudo-vibration sensitivity levels. The thesis also develops and implements models for computational simulation of pseudo-vibrations using the fundamental behaviour of speckles. The combination of experimentation and simulation improves current understanding of the pseudo-vibration mechanisms and provides the vibration engineer with a valuable resource to improve data interpretation. Two experimental methods of quantifying pseudo-vibration sensitivity are developed and successfully applied in the evaluation of <b>transverse,</b> <b>tilt</b> and rotation sensitivity for two models of commercial laser vibrometer. These evaluations cover both single beam (translational vibration measurement) and parallel beam (for angular vibration measurement) modes. The first method presented requires correction of the vibrometer measurement with an independent measurement of genuine velocity to produce an iii apparent velocity dominated by the required noise components. The second method requires a differential measurement using two vibrometers to cancel common components such as genuine velocity, leaving only uncorrelated noise from each measurement in the resulting apparent velocity. In each case, a third measurement is required of the surface motion component causing pseudo-vibration and this is used to normalise the apparent velocity. Pseudo-vibration sensitivity is then presented as a map showing the spectral shape of the noise, as a mean and standard deviation of harmonic peaks in the map and as a total rms level across a defined bandwidth. The simulations employ a novel and effective approach to modelling speckle evolution. Transverse and tilt sensitivity are predicted for the first time and are verified by the experimental study. They provide the vibration engineer with the potential to estimate pseudo-vibrations using a simple piece of software.

We identified different universality classes and computed the critical exponents and universal amplitudes describing geometric and velocity-force characteristics. In contrast to uncorrelated disorder, the statistical tilt symmetry is broken {{resulting in a}} nontrivial response to a <b>transverse</b> <b>tilting</b> force. For instance, the vortex lattice in disordered superconductors shows a new glass phase whose properties interpolate between those of the Bragg and Bose glasses formed by pointlike and columnar disorder, respectively. Whereas there is no response in the Bose glass phase (transverse Meissner effect), the standard linear response expected in the Bragg glass gets modified to a power law response {{in the presence of}} disorder correlations. We also studied the long distance properties of the O(N) spin system with random fields and random anisotropies correlated as 1 /x d−σ. Using FRG we obtained the phase diagram in (d, σ, N) -parameter space and computed the corresponding critical exponents.

40|$|In sharp-bend-flow the {{hydrodynamic}} phenomena {{are different}} than in straight channel flow. Flow separation and hdelical flow {{are the most important}} sharp-bend-flow phenomena and they have a major morphological effect. Literature states that the transverse water surface tilt {{is an important factor in}} determining the internal processes of flow separation and helical flow and that flow depth and roughness influence the <b>transverse</b> <b>tilt.</b> Literature also states that the effects of flow separation are flow recirculation, contraction of the main flow, a shear layer, shear layer-induced vorticity, interaction between hydraulic phenomena and separation-sediment interaction. The exact causes and internal processes of flow separation remain unknown. Experimental laboratory data-sets of surface flow structures were analyzed and several maps were made to try to fill the knowledge gap. The results showed that an increase in flow depth and/or Froude number both lead to an increase in transverse water level tilt, thus promoting helical flow and flow separation by creating an adverse pressure gradients. The flow separation creates a sharp transition in flow velocity that starts halfway the inner bend and diffuses downstream while creating vorticity. Flow recirculation was not significant in the constant width bend, but outer bank widening was likely the cause of considerable flow recirculation. The larger the flow depth the smaller the extent of the recirculation zone. The shear layer “flaps” with a period of approximately 13 seconds over 6 % of the flow width. An increase in flow depth resulted in a downstream movement of the shear layer and an increase in the Froude number caused the downstream end of shear layer to bend towards the inner bend...|$|E

The laser beam spot diameter has a large influence on the pseudo-vibration sensitivity. Transverse sensitivity has been quantified as around 0. 03 % and 0. 01 % (per order) of the transverse velocity of the surface for beam spot diameters of 100 μm and 600 μm respectively. Larger beam spots have been shown to significantly reduce transverse sensitivity and measurements from smoother surfaces have also shown a reduced level of transverse sensitivity. Tilt sensitivity has been quantified at about 0. 1 μms- 1 /degs- 1 and 0. 3 μms- 1 /degs- 1 (per order) of angular velocity of the surface for beam spot diameters of 100 μm and 600 μm respectively. Smaller beam spot diameters significantly reduce tilt sensitivity. The surface roughness or treatment has been shown to have little effect on the level of tilt sensitivity. Rotation sensitivity has been quantified at approximately 0. 6 μms- 1 /rads- 1 and 1. 9 μms- 1 /rads- 1 (per order) of rotation velocity of the rotor for 90 μm and 520 μm. Smaller beam spot diameters have shown a significant reduction in rotation sensitivity and measurements on smoother surfaces have shown a reduced rotation sensitivity. Focussing the laser beam approximately on the rotation axis has also shown a significant reduction in rotation sensitivity. Parallel beam rotation sensitivity has been quantified at 0. 016 degs- 1 /rads- 1 and it is demonstrated that this can adequately be estimated using the single beam rotation sensitivity.

40|$|The seismic {{waves that}} spread {{out from the}} {{earthquake}} source to the entire Earth are usually measured at the ground surface by a seismometer which consists of three orthogonal components (Z (vertical), N (north-south), and E (east-west) or R (radial), T (transversal), and Z (vertical)). However, a complete representation of the ground motion induced by earthquakes consists not only of those three components of translational motion, but also three components of rotational motion plus six components of strain. Altough theoretical seismologists have pointed out {{the potential benefits of}} measurements of rotational ground motion, they were not made until quite recently. This was mainly because precise instruments to measure ground rotational motion were not available. The measurement of rotational motion induced by earthquakes is relatively new in the field of seismology. To the best of our knowledge, the first experiment to measure ground rotational motion using rotational sensor was done by Nigbor (1994 }. He successfully measured translational and rotational ground motion during an underground chemical explosion experiment at the Nevada Test Site using a triaxial translational accelerometer and a solid-state rotational velocity sensor. The same type of sensor was also used by Takeo (1998 } for recording an earthquake swarm on Izu peninsula, Japan. However, because of the limitation of the instrument sensitivity, this kind of sensor was only able to sensing the rotational ground motion near the earthquake sources of other artificial sources. Another type of rotational sensor was assembled using two oppositely oriented seismometers. This is possible since in principle the rotational component of the ground motions is equal to half the curl of the ground velocity. This kind of sensor was intensively researched and developed by the seismology group in Institute of geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences. However, they report several problems especially due to the small differences in the seismometer's response function. Like the solid state rotational sensors, this sensor was only able to measure rotational motion near the seismic sources. The application of the Sagnac effect for sensing the inertial rotation using optical devices were intensively investigated, since the advent of lasers in the sixties. However, the first application of a ring laser gyroscope as a rotational sensor applied in the field of seismology was reported by Stedman et al. (1995 }. Fully consistent rotational motions were recorded by a ring laser gyro installed at the fundamental station Wettzell, Germany (Igel et al., 2005). They showed that the rotational motions were compatible with collocated recordings of transverse acceleration by a standard seismometer, both in amplitude and phase. They mentioned that "standard" rotational sensors with sufficient resolution may be possible in the near future. Among the other type of rotational sensor, ring lasers seem more reliable in seismic applications since it has been provenable to sensing the ground rotational motion from near source as well as teleseismic earthquake events with a broad magnitude range (Igel et al., 2007 }. In earthquake engineering, observations of rotational components of seismic strong motions may be of interest as this type of motion may contribute to the response of structures to earthquake-induced ground shaking. Most of rotational/torsional studies of ground motion in earthquake engineering are so far still carried out by indirect measurements. It can be done since the rotational component of motion is a linear combination of the space derivatives of the horizontal component of the motion. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there are no comparison of array-derived rotation rate and direct measurement from rotational sensors mentioned in the literature. The first objective of my thesis is to study the effect of noise and various uncertainties to the derivation of rotation rate and to compare directly the result with the ring laser data. Here we present for the first time a comparison of rotational ground motions derived from seismic array with those observed directly with ring laser. Our study suggest that - given accurate measurements of translational motions in an array of appropriate size and number of stations - the array-derived rotation rate may be very close to the "true" rotational signal that would be measured at the center of the array (or the specific reference station). However, it is important to note that it may be dangerous to use only the minimally required three stations as even relatively small noise levels may deteriorate the rotation estimates. Furthermore, it is clear that the logistic effort to determine rotations from array is considerably larger than direct measurements. In the light of this, the necessity to develop field-deployable rotational sensors with the appropriate resolution for use in local and regional seismology remains an outstanding issue. More recently, Igel et al. (2005) introduced a method to estimate the horizontal phase velocity by using collocated measurements from a ring laser and seismometer. A simple relationship between transverse acceleration and rotation rate (around a vertical axis) shows that both signals should be in phase and their ratio proportional to horizontal phase velocity. Comparison with synthetic traces (rotations and translations) and phase velocities determined in the same way showed good agreement with the observations. The second objective of my thesis is to study the accuracy of phase velocity determination using collocated measurement of rotational and translational motion and derive the Love wave dispersion curve using spectral ratio for both synthetic and real observed data. Whether the accuracy of the dispersion curves derived with the approach presented in this thesis is enough for tomographic purposes remains to be evaluated. Nevertheless, the results shown here indicate that through additional measurements of accurate rotational signals, wavefield information is accessible that otherwise requires seismic array data. However, to make this methodology practically useful for seismology will require the development of an appropriate high-resolution six-component broadband sensor. Efforts are underway to coordinate such developments on an international scale (Evans et al., 2006). The ground tilt is generally small but not negligible in seismology, especially in the strong-motion earthquake. It is well known that the tilt signal is most noticeable in the horizontal components of the seismometer. Ignoring the tilt effects leads to unreliable results, especially in calculation of permanent displacements and long-period calculations. The third objective of my thesis is to study the array-derived tilt, a further application of measuring tilt. An interesting result concerning tilt study based on a synthetic study is the possibility to derive the Rayleigh wave phase velocity as well as Rayleigh wave dispersion curve from collocated measurement of tilt rate and translational motions. The synthetic study shows that there is a frequency dependent phase velocity from collocated radial acceleration and <b>transverse</b> <b>tilt...</b>|$|E

40|$|Depositional {{models of}} axial fluvial systems in half-grabens {{predict that the}} fluvial-sandstone {{percentage}} increases towards the down-thrown side of a fault, because channel systems tend to migrate {{to the area of}} maximum subsidence. This is at the expense of mudstone, but floodplain deposition occurs near faults occasionally. The models assume gradual, <b>transverse</b> <b>tilting</b> and no external base-level change, and their applicability to cases involving tectonics and/or sea-level change may therefore be restricted. Here a quantitative analysis is presented on a subsurface dataset from an Upper Pennsylvanian cyclothem succession, which formed under conditions of differential subsidence and fluctuating sea level. The studied interval is wedge-shaped and shows a systematic thickness increase from 165 to 245 m, controlled by syndepositional fault-block tilting. It comprises three depositional units, bounded by coal groups. These units display an upward change from wedge-shaped (75 - 120 m) to tabular (42 - 55 m). Despite their variable thickness the units contain almost equal amounts of ~ 45 m of floodplain deposits, plus ~ 5 m of encased channel sandstones, in all boreholes. Where units are thicker, the remaining thickness comprises fluvial-braidplain sandstone. This arrangement indicates that the units represent equal time periods, during which background subsidence allowed the deposition of thin channel sands and overbank muds on a level floodplain. Occasional tilting produced additional accommodation space, which was completely filled by sand-dominated braided systems. The temporary cessation of floodplain-mud deposition suggests that aggradation of the river system could not keep up with floodplain tilting. In addition, bypass of floodplain fines may have been promoted by a basin parallel tilting component. It is shown that (i) cases in which the standard models fully apply, and (ii) cases in which differential subsidence is too strong or too abrupt, can be distinguished by analysing cross-plots of cumulative-sandstone and cumulative mudstone thickness...|$|R

The bearing capacity of a pile group depends on shear stress along the soil-pile interface and normal stress underneath the pile toe while the two would be adversely affected by the unloading process of tunneling. Although extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of tunnel construction on existing single piles, the influence of twin tunnel advancement on an existing pile group is merely reported in the literature. In this study, a series of three-dimensional centrifuge tests were carried out to investigate the response of an existing pile group under working load subjected to twin tunneling at various locations in dry Toyoura sand. In each twin tunneling test, the first tunnel is constructed near the mid-depth of the pile shaft, while the second tunnel is subsequently constructed either next to, below or right underneath the pile toe (Tests G_ST, G_SB and G_SU, respectively). Among the three tests, the 2 nd tunnel excavated near the pile toe (Test G_ST) results in the smallest settlement but the largest <b>transverse</b> <b>tilting</b> (0. 2 %) of pile group. Significant bending moment was induced at the pile head (1. 4 times of its bending moment capacity) due to the 2 nd tunnel T. On the contrary, tunneling right underneath the toe of pile (i. e., Test G_SU) results in the smallest tilting but largest settlement of the pile group (4. 6 % of pile diameter) and incremental mobilisation of shaft resistance (13 %). Due to stress release by the twin tunneling, the axial force taken by the front piles close to tunnels was reduced and partially transferred to the rear piles.

In this investigation, {{an attempt}} using data envelopment {{analysis}} based Taguchi method, is involved in solving the multi-response optimization of the process parameters of rotational speed, <b>transverse</b> speed, tool <b>tilt</b> angle with different tool pin profiles on the stir zone evolution in AA 8011 Aluminium alloys. Three different tool pin profiles (hexagonal, pentagonal pin profiles of High Carbon High Chromium steel and Hexagonal tool pin profile of H 13 steel) {{have been used to}} make the joints at the different combination of process parameters using L 9 orthogonal array. The Vickers hardness and Impact strength are measured to optimize the process parameters using DEA based Taguchi method. It is found that the optimum conditions of rotational speed 660 RPM, transverse speed of 30 mm per minute and tilt angle of 2 degrees with the hexagonal tool pin profile of High Carbon High Chromium steel yielded a good quality weld...|$|R
40|$|We report Monte-Carlo {{simulation}} {{studies of}} some systems consisting of polar rod-like molecules interacting via a pair potential that exhibit liquid crystal phases, attributed with tilt angles of large magnitude. For theoretical {{understanding of the}} microscopic origin of the tilted phases, different systems consisting of prolate ellipsoidal molecules of three different lengths, embedded with two symmetrically placed anti-parallel terminal dipoles are considered. We find {{that the presence of}} a stable tilted phase crucially depends on the molecular elongation which effectively makes dipolar separation longer. We observe that in case of mesogens with <b>transverse</b> dipoles the <b>tilt</b> in the layered smectic phase gradually increases from zero to a large magnitude as we increase the molecular length. However tilt remains weak with molecular elongation for systems with longitudinal dipoles which shows a small tilt at shorter lengths. This is the first work determining the combined contribution of dipolar separation and orientations in generating biaxial liquid crystal phases with large tilt angles...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{was invented}} by Wayne Thomas at TWI (The Welding Institute), and the first patent {{applications}} were filed in the UK in December 1991. Initially, the process {{was regarded as a}} “laboratory ” curiosity, but {{it soon became clear that}} FSW offers numerous benefits in the fabrication of aluminum products. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) has become a major joining process in the aerospace, railway and ship building industries especially in the fabrication of aluminum alloys. The process uses a spinning non-consumable tool to generate frictional heat in the work piece. Worldwide, there are now over 135 licensees of FSW and new techniques and applications are being developed daily. This paper looks at the review, on friction stir welding process, various welding variables like tool rotation, <b>transverse</b> speed, tool <b>tilt,</b> plunge depth and tool design, for the welding of aluminum alloys or various dissimilar alloys. Applications, future aspects and several key problems are also described...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{foundation is}} laid {{for a relatively}} new type of magnets generating uniform <b>transverse</b> field - <b>tilted</b> coil magnets. These consist of concentric nested solenoidal coils with elliptical turns tilted at a certain angle to the central axis and current flowing in opposite directions in the coils tilted at opposite angles, generating a perfectly uniform transverse field. Both superconducting wire-wound and resistive Bitter tilted coils are discussed. An original analytical method is used {{to prove that the}} wire-wound tilted coils have the ideal distribution of the axial linear current density - "cosine-theta". Magnetic fields are calculated for a tilted Bitter coil magnet using an original exact solution for current density in an elliptical Bitter disk. Superconducting wire-wound tilted coil magnets may become an alternative for traditional dipole magnets for accelerators, and Bitter tilted coil magnets are attractive for rotation experiments with a large access port perpendicular to the field.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Measurement Science and Technology [© IOP Publishing] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] sensitivities in laser vibrometry are the consequence of measurement noise generated by surface motions other than that on-axis with the incident laser beam(s), such as <b>transverse</b> and <b>tilt</b> vibrations or rotation. On rougher surfaces, laser speckle is the cause but similar noise is observed in measurements from smoother surfaces. This paper's principal aim is to introduce two experimental methods for quantification, including dedicated data processing, to deliver sensitivities in three forms: a spectral map, a mean level per order and a total rms level. Single and parallel beam vibrometers and different surface roughness or treatment are accommodated, with sensitivities presented for two commercial instruments (beam diameters 90 and 520 mu m). For transverse sensitivity, a total rms level around 0. 05 % is found for the larger beam, a quarter of the level for the smaller beam. For tilt sensitivity, advantage shifts to the smaller beam with a total rms level around 0. 45 mu m s(- 1) /deg s(- 1), less than one-third of that for the larger beam. Levels hold fairly constant across the rougher surfaces, reducing only for a polished surface. For rotation sensitivities (radial vibrations), advantage remains with the smaller beam with a total rms level around 2 mu m s(- 1) /deg s(- 1), compared to 5 mu m s(- 1) /deg s(- 1) for the larger beam, while sensitivity reduces with diminishing roughness. These sensitivities are especially valuable to vibrometer users in instrumentation selection and data analysis...|$|R
40|$|Reflection {{tomography}} in the migrated domain {{can help}} reconstruct heterogeneous, anisotropic velocity fields needed for accurate depth imaging of complex geologic structures, {{such as those}} near salt bodies. The presence of anisotropy, however, increases the uncertainty in velocity analysis and typically requires a priori constraints on the model parameters. Here, we develop a 2 D P-wave tomographic algorithm for heterogeneous transversely isotropic media with a tilted symmetry axis (TTI) and investigate the conditions necessary for stable estimation of the symmetry-direction velocity VP 0 and the anisotropy parameters ǫ and δ. The model is divided into square cells, and the parameters VP 0, ǫ, δ, and the tilt ν of the symmetry axis are defined at the grid points. To increase {{the stability of the}} inversion, the symmetry axis is set orthogonal to the imaged reflectors, with the tilt interpolated inside each layer. The iterative migration velocity analysis involves efficient linearized parameter updating designed to minimize the residual moveout in image gathers for all available reflection events. The moveout equation in the depth-migrated domain includes a nonhyperbolic term that describes long-offset data sensitive to ǫ. Synthetic tests for a model with a “quasi-factorized ” TTI syncline (i. e., ǫ and δ areconstantinsidetheTTIlayer) demonstratethatconvergencetowardthecorrect velocity model requires either strong smoothness constraints or additional information from walkaway VSP (vertical seismic profiling) traveltimes. If the model is known to be quasi-factorized with a linear spatial variation of VP 0, the interval TTI parameters can be obtained just from long-spread reflection data.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in parameter estimation and seismic processing have allowed incorporation of anisotropic models {{into a wide}} range of seismic methods. In particular, vertical and <b>tilted</b> <b>transverse</b> isotropy are currently treated {{as an integral part of}} velocity fields employed in prestack depth migration algorithms, especially those based on the wave equation. Here, we briefly review the state of the art in modeling, processing, and inversion of seismic data for anisotropic media. Topics include optimal parameterization, body-wave modeling methods, P-wave velocity analysis and imaging, processing in the τ–p domain, anisotropy estimation from vertical seismic profiling (VSP) surveys, moveout inversion of wide-azimuth data, amplitude-variation-with-offset (AVO) analysis, processing and applications of shear and mode-converted waves, and fracture characterization. When outlining future trends in anisotropy studies, we emphasize that continued progress in data-acquisition technology is likely to spur transition from transverse isotropy to lower anisotropic symmetries (e. g., orthorhombic). Further development of inversion and processing methods for such realistic anisotropic models should facilitate effective application of anisotropy parameters in lithology discrimination, fracture detection, and time-lapse seismology...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} decade, the {{research}} field using arrays of high-index-contrast near-wavelength dieletric structures on flat surfaces, known as high-contrast metastructures (HCMs) or metasurfaces, has emerged and expanded rapidly. Although the HCMs and metasurfaces share great similarities in physical structures with photonic crystals (PhCs), i. e. periodic nanostructures, many differences exist in their design, analysis, operation conditions, and applications. In this paper, we provide a generalized theoretical {{understanding of the}} two subjects and show their intrinsic connections. We further discuss the simulation and design approaches, categorized by their functionalities and applications. The similarity and differences between HCMs, metasurfaces and PhCs are also discussed. New findings are presented regarding the physical connection between the PhC band structures and the 1 D and 2 D HCM scattering spectra under <b>transverse</b> and longitudinal <b>tilt</b> incidence. Novel designs using HCMs as holograms, spatial light modulators, and surface plasmonic couplers are discussed. Recent advances on HCMs, metasurfaces and PhCs are reviewed and compared for applications such as broadband mirrors, waveguides, couplers, resonators, and reconfigurable optics.

40|$|The southward-younging, oblique, arc-continent {{collision}} {{creates a}} complete spectrum of orogenic stages with different landscape along Taiwan. Although {{there are some}} geodetic measurements available to reveal the current uplift rates across the island, but {{it is often difficult}} to obtain uplift history with larger time scale. In order to understand this complex history and the relationship between the geomorphology and tectonics, we chose eastern flank of the Central Range in Taiwan as our study area and constructed the longitudinal profile of bedrock channel of main rivers in this area (fig. 1) and carried out necessary geomorphic analysis. We carried out two necessary geomorphic analyses: stream power incision model and drainage basin asymmetry as our geomorphic indices to find the uplift patterns. In stream power incision model, we evaluated the normalize steepness index (ksn), which is directly proportion to uplift rate parallel to the longitudinal profile (fig. 2 A); in drainage basin asymmetry method, we calculated the asymmetry factor (AF), which is developed to detect tectonic <b>tilting</b> <b>transverse</b> to flow at drainage basin (fig...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} `tilting' of Mott {{insulators}} of bosons into metastable states. These are described by Hamiltonians acting on resonant subspaces, and have rich possibilities for correlated phases with non-trivial entanglement of pseudospin {{degrees of freedom}} encoded in the boson density. We extend a previous study (arXiv:cond-mat/ 0205169) of cubic lattices {{to a variety of}} lattices and tilt directions in 2 dimensions: square, decorated square, triangular, and kagome. For certain configurations three-body interactions are necessary to ensure that the energy of the effective resonant subspace is bounded from below. We find quantum phases with Ising density wave order, with superfluidity <b>transverse</b> to the <b>tilt</b> direction, and a quantum liquid state with no broken symmetry. The existence of the quantum liquids state is shown by an exact solution for a particular correlated boson model. We also find cases for which the resonant subspace is described by effective quantum dimer models. Comment: 30 pages, 16 figures.

40|$|With the {{increased}} complexity {{and diversity of}} mainstream high performance computing systems, significant effort is required to tune parallel applications {{in order to achieve}} the best possible performance for each particular platform. This task becomes more and more challenging and requiring a larger set of skills. Automatic performance tuning is becoming a must for optimizing applications such as Reverse Time Migration (RTM) widely used in seismic imaging for oil and gas exploration. An empirical search based auto-tuning approach is applied to the MPI communication operations of the parallel isotropic and <b>tilted</b> <b>transverse</b> isotropic kernels. The application of auto-tuning using the Abstract Data and Communication Library improved the performance of the MPI communications as well as developer productivity by providing a higher level of abstraction. Keeping productivity in mind, we opted toward pragma based programming for accelerated computation on latest accelerated architectures such as GPUs using the fairly new OpenACC standard. The same auto-tuning approach is also applied to the OpenACC accelerated seismic code for optimizing the compute intensive kernel of the Reverse Time Migration application. The application of such technique resulted in an improved performance of the original code and its ability to adapt to different execution environments...|$|R
