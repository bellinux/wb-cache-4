5|$|The Analytical Review {{was meant}} <b>to</b> <b>enlighten</b> {{the public as}} well as to simplify {{communication}} between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E

Oliphant also travelled to Berkley to with meet with Ernest Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. After Oliphant informed Lawrence of his report on uranium, Lawrence met with NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant, George B. Pegram, and Arthur Compton to relay the details which Oliphant had directed to Lawrence. Oliphant was not only {{able to get in}} touch with Lawrence, but he met with Conant and Bush to inform them of the significant data the MAUD had discovered. Oliphant’s ability to inform the Americans led to Oliphant convincing Lawrence, Lawrence convincing Compton, and then Kistiakowsky convincing Conant to move forward with nuclear weapons. These actions from Oliphant resulted in Bush taking this report directly to the president.|$|E

25|$|In 1849, the AMA {{established}} a board to analyze quack remedies and nostrums and <b>to</b> <b>enlighten</b> {{the public about}} their nature and their dangers. Relationships were developed with pharmaceutical companies {{in an effort to}} curb the patent medicine crisis and consolidate the patient base around the medical doctor. By the turn of the 20th century, the AMA had created a Committee on National Legislation to represent the AMA in Washington and re-organized as the national organization of state and local associations. Intense political pressure by the AMA resulted in unlimited and unrestricted licensing only for medical physicians that were trained in AMA-endorsed colleges. By 1901, state medical boards were created in almost every state, requiring licentiates to provide a diploma from an AMA-approved medical college. By 1910, the AMA was a powerful force; this was the beginning of organized medicine.|$|E
25|$|When she {{got back}} to the United States she {{submitted}} a very thorough and insightful report to Congress. One of her recommendations was that Congress should create a new State Department Bureau for African Affairs to be overseen by a new {{assistant secretary of state for}} African affairs. Bolton helped to see that this did in fact happen, and Congress created the new bureau in 1958. In addition to sharing information about her trip with Congress through her official report, Bolton also made an impressive effort <b>to</b> <b>enlighten</b> the American people about the diversity of the African continent by creating a film about her trip, entitled Africa: Giant With a Future, 1955. This film is an excellent resource for students and instructors wanting a look at several African countries/colonies in the mid-1950s, and has been made available on DVD by the National Archives. In addition to educating Congress and the general public about Africa, Bolton's trip helped to begin the process of opening doors for women to play a major role in US foreign relations.|$|E
25|$|According to George Johnson, LaRouche sees {{history as}} a battle between Platonists, who believe in {{absolute}} truth, and Aristotelians, who rely on empirical data. Johnson characterizes LaRouche's views as follows: the Platonists include figures such as Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Leibniz. He believes {{that many of the}} world's ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the empirical philosophers (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the metaphysical, embraces moral relativism, and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used <b>to</b> <b>enlighten</b> the world, LaRouche argues, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new dark age in which the world will be ruled by the oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, Black Muslims, Teamsters and pro-life advocates.|$|E

25|$|The Days of Rage {{took place}} {{shortly after the}} June Convention, during {{the second week of}} October that fall. Taking place once again in Chicago, they were a {{consequence}} of the Weatherman faction seizing control of the student-run organization and convincing the group as a whole for the need of a full-fledged revolution. During the Days of Rage, “young radicals invested militant action with special power <b>to</b> <b>enlighten,</b> inspire, and mobilize”. This event “provided a way for them to establish the authenticity of their commitments, to assert their dissident or ‘revolutionary’ identities, and to live what they considered meaningful and engaged lives. The Weathermen had anticipated “at least 25,000 people” were to attend the Days of Rage; however, “instead of the promised 25,000 white youth ready to tear up ‘pig city,’” a mere “700 to 800 people gathered” half of them spectators. The four-day spectacle opened the Weathermen’s eyes to the fact that because of their tactics, they would not gain the support that they had originally intended on gathering.|$|E
25|$|Models who {{publicly}} advocate {{their opinions}} of the fashion industry are growing as well, especially with the criticism and strain placed on their well-beings. Many have notably used Instagram {{as a tool to}} “encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure”.  In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the #DearNYFW campaign, which targeted the fashion industry’s harmful approach towards their bodies. This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experience,  in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start “prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway”. In regards to men falling victims to body image issues, fashion photographer Tarik Carroll released a photo series titled the EveryMAN Project. The prject showcased large-framed queer and transgender men of color, with the purpose of “challenging hyper-masculinity and gender norms, while bringing body-positivity to the forefront”. Furthmore, Caroll aims <b>to</b> <b>enlighten</b> society about body image struggles in men, after hearing the complaints of male models.|$|E
