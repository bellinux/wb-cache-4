50|$|Vallisneria (named {{in honor}} of Antonio Vallisneri) is a genus of {{freshwater}} aquatic plant, commonly called eelgrass, <b>tape</b> <b>grass</b> or vallis. The genus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America.|$|E
5000|$|The lake is {{inhabited}} by phytoplankton, macrophytes and zooplankton which includes 8 species of copepods, 8 species of cladocerans and 11 species of rotifers. Fish recorded include tilapia, catfish and mudfish. Some aquatic plants also inhabit the lake {{such as water}} spinach, water hyacinth, <b>tape</b> <b>grass</b> and Buntót-pusà (lit. [...] "cat's tail", Dysophylla auricularia).|$|E

50|$|Vallisneria spiralis, {{also known}} as {{straight}} vallisneria, <b>tape</b> <b>grass,</b> or eel grass is a common aquarium plant that prefers good light and a nutrient rich substrate. In the wild, {{it can be found}} in tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide. It has narrow, linear leaves that range in colour from a pale-green to reddish up to 3 feet (1 m) long and up to 0.75 inches broad. V. spiralis is monoecious with flowers carried on long spiral stalks that break away from the plant and float on the water's surface. Seeds have not been observed germinating in aquaria. Instead, it most often propagates by runners which can lead to dense stands.|$|E
5000|$|Vallisneria americana, {{commonly}} called wild celery, water-celery, <b>tape</b> <b>grass,</b> or eelgrass, [...] is {{a plant in}} the family Hydrocharitaceae, the [...] "tape-grasses". V. americana is a fresh water species that can tolerate salt, living in salinities varying from fresh water (0 parts per thousand) to 18 parts per thousand, although the limit to the salt tolerance is unclear, and is generally dependent on the duration and intensity of the plants exposure to the saline water [...] V. americana is a deep rooted plant with leaves, approximately one inch wide, {{with the ability to}} rise two or more meters above the clustered base of the plant. Contrary to the implications of one of its common names, wild celery bears little to no resemblance to the celery used as a vegetable. Vallisneria americana grows under water and is consumed by various animals, including the canvasback. The plants themselves are long, limp, flat, and have a green mid-ridge.|$|E

40|$|Here, we {{describe}} an experiment using four nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations {{to investigate the}} effects of nutrient enrichment on the submersed macrophyte Vallisneria natans (<b>tape</b> <b>grass)</b> grown in a sand culture medium. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the influence of nutrient enrichment in the water column on V. natans, especially with regard to anatomical structures. The results showed both the absolute growth rate (AGR) and intrinsic efficiency of light energy conversion of PSII (Fv/Fm) decreased with increasing nutrient levels. Root morphological characteristics, including the total root length (L), root surface area (SA), projected root area (PA), total root volume (V), average root diameter (AD), total root length per volume (LPV), total tips (T) and total forks (F), also showed a generally negative relationship with increasing nutrient concentrations. The anatomical structures of stolons and leaves also changed with nutrient enrichment. The shrinkage of aerenchyma and disappearance of starches and chloroplasts were the main structural changes leading to poor growth. These phenomena, especially the anatomical changes, might be the mechanism underlying the effect of nutrient enrichment on V. natans growth...|$|E

This technique, which is also spatially referenced by input from a global positioning system, has many potential applications in macrophyte studies in shallow lakes, although it has not yet been extensively tested in such habitats using systems of lower sound frequency. This paper reports such a test in two shallow (maximum depth c. 5. 9 m) lakes of the Cotswold Water Park, U. K., using a 200 kHz digital echo sounder (BioSonics DT 6000 and DT-X upgrade) and post-processing analysis using the now commercially available software EcoSAV, which incorporates the algorithms of Sabol et al. (2002). Hydroacoustic assessment of the coverage by macrophytes, mainly Nuttall’s pondweed (Elodea nuttallii) and charophytes (Chara spp.), showed high agreement with those recorded during a simultaneous visual survey by underwater video recording (r 2 = 0. 8478, n = 74, P < 0. 001). Assessment of macrophyte height was also apparently consistent between the two systems, although the video system could not produce quantitative data and so statistical assessment of the agreement was not possible. Repeated hydroacoustic surveys {{over the course of the}} winter of 2003 – 2004 were conducted in one lake and illustrate the application of this new macrophyte survey technique. Such applications include the rapid measurement of mean Percentage Volume Inhabited (PVI), which fell from 12. 15 % (95 % confidence limits, ± 0. 55 %) to 7. 10 % (± 0. 40 %) over the course of the winter...|$|E
