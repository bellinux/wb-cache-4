50|$|In the Irish St Leger at the Curragh on 17 September Transworld was partnered by Tommy Murphy after Lester Piggott {{opted to}} ride the O'Brien stables main hope Valinsky, {{the winner of the}} Geoffrey Freer Stakes. Despite being {{rejected}} by the stable's top jockey, the colt was strongly supported in the betting market and started the 13/2 third choice behind Valinsky and Panamint. The other six runners included Sassabunda, Orchestra (Nijinsky Stakes) and Aristocracy (Whitehall Stakes). Murphy sent Tranworld into the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, shaking off his closest pursuer Valinsky early in the <b>traight</b> and drawing clear of the field to win by four lengths from Orchestra. His victory gave Vincent O'Brien a third consecutive win in the contest after Caucasus in 1975 and Meneval in 1976.|$|E
50|$|After a {{break of}} well over two months Mountain Lodge {{returned}} in the Doncaster Cup in September and came from well off the pace to finish third behind Karadar and Gildoran. The 1983 Irish St Leger, run over {{one and three}} quarter miles at the Curragh Racecourse on 8 October, was {{the first edition of}} the race to be open to older horses instead of being restricted to three-year-olds. Heavy rain in the build-up resulted in very soft ground and conditions were not improved by a thick mist which restricted visibility. The British colt Band (winner of the Cumberland Lodge Stakes) started favourite ahead of Colonial Flag (representing the Vincent O'Brien stable) and Yawa (Grand Prix de Paris) with Mountain Lodge, who was epected to relish the testing conditions, net in the betting on 13/2. The best of the other si runners appeared to be the British four-year-old Khairpour, who had finished ahead of Mountain Lodge at andown and later won the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. Little of the early stages were clearly visible but High Cannon appeared to make the running before Arctic Lord led the field into the straight. Band went to the front in the <b>traight,</b> but Mountain Lodge, ridden by Declan Gillespie, wore down the tiring favourite in the final furlong and won going away by two lengths.|$|E

40|$|A {{laboratory}} apparatus {{has been}} developed that simulates horizontal and vertical brushing movements at various pressures on anterior and posterior shaped teeth. Cleaning efficiency or interproximal access is scored by measuring the removal of soft deposits on pressure-sensitive paper placed around the simulated teeth. In this study, 14 different brushes with varying designs and textures were evaluated. All toothbrushes tested displayed consistent performance across the 3 main factors of brushing motion, tooth shape, and brushing pressure. Cleaning efficiency improved with softer texture and increasing pressure. V-shaped brushes had better interproximal access on posterior shaped teeth, whereas <b>traight</b> multitufted brushes tended to show improved cleaning efficiency scores on anterior shaped teeth. With bristle textures labeled soft, medium, and firm, V-shaped brushes had significantly better cleaning efficiency than straight multitufted toothbrushes of corresponding texture...|$|E

40|$|With {{regard to}} the viscous flow in a large rounded channel exit，the authors 	approximated the {{velocity}} distribution with the polynominal by the same method 	as Pohlhausen's one {{in the theory of}} the boundary layer and the momentum 	equation being expressed with the orthogonal coordinates was solved by the isoclined 	 method. Also， the authors obtained the position of separation point 	experimentally with the aid of the two-dimensional channel to prove the theoretical 	value. The resu 1 ts are summarized as follows. 	(1) The separation point is related to Reynolds number. According as Reynolds 	number becomes smaller，the separation point removes downward along a 	roundness from as <b>traight</b> channel exit，but in case of as mall Reynolds number 	the ca 1 culations are complicated and they are too difficult to obtain the separation 	point exactly. 	(2) The justification of this solution was supported，because the results of the 	theoretical analysis coincided good with the experimental resu 1 ts. However，it 	seems that the region which this theory may apply are Re= 100 ～ 2000. 	(3) The radius of roundness at a channel exit on which this theory may apply 	is limited in the region of a large radius comparatively. When the radius of 	roundness is small，the analysis will be difficu 1 t too...|$|E
