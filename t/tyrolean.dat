5|$|At {{conferences}} in 1946 and 1947, {{the decision was}} made to breed Haflinger horses from pure bloodlines, creating a closed stud book with no new blood being introduced. The <b>Tyrolean</b> Haflinger Breeders' Association established its own stallion center and prohibited private breeders from keeping stallions, thus ensuring that the association maintained 100percent control of breeding stallions. In Bavaria, several young stallions had been saved and breeders could privately own stallions. Bavarian and <b>Tyrolean</b> breeders maintained close ties and cooperated extensively. North <b>Tyrolean</b> breeders were also able to acquire several high-quality older stallions and lower-quality young stallions from South Tyrol. In 1947, the Federation of Austrian Haflinger Breeders was established as a governing organization for the provincial associations. At this time a large-scale breed show was held, attended by visitors from Switzerland, who soon after their return home sent a purchasing commission to Austria and were instrumental in founding the Haflinger population in Switzerland. Southern Tyrol had no difficulty in selling its horses, as all of Italy was in the market to purchase horses, and breeding populations spread as far south as Sicily.|$|E

Discouraged by the lack of local support, the <b>Tyroleans</b> withdrew to the south. They returned to attack again on 29 May in the second battle. Deroy's 5,240 soldiers and 18 guns held their ground, losing 87 dead, 156 wounded, and 53 missing. The 1,200 Austrian regulars and 13,600 <b>Tyroleans</b> lost 90 dead and 160 wounded.

5|$|If {{not for the}} {{presence}} of Haflinger stallions at a stud farm in Stadl-Paura in Upper Austria after World War I, the Haflinger might well not exist in Austria today. Despite these stallions, the Haflinger breeding programs were not on solid footing in Austria, with governmental focus on other Austrian breeds and private breeding programs not large enough to influence national breeding practices. During this time, the breed was kept alive through crosses to the Hucul, Bosnian, Konik and Noriker breeds. In 1919 and 1920, the remaining stallions were assigned throughout Austria, many to areas that had hosted private breeding farms before the war. In 1921, the North <b>Tyrolean</b> Horse Breeders' Cooperative was formed in Zams, and in 1922, the first Haflinger Breeders' Show was held in the same location. Many extant Austrian Haflinger mares were considered to be of too low quality to be used as brood mares, and every effort was made to import higher-quality brood mares from the South Tyrol herds now in Italy. In 1926, the first studbook was established in North Tyrol. In the late 1920s, other cooperatives were established for Haflinger breeders in Weer and Wildschönau, and were able to gain government permission to purchase 100 Haflinger mares from South Tyrol and split them between North Tyrol, Upper Austria and Styria. This single transaction represented one third of all registered mares in South Tyrol, and many others were sold through private treaty, leaving the two regions comparable in terms of breeding-stock populations. In 1931, another breeders' cooperative was established in East Tyrol in Austria, and Haflinger breeding spread throughout the entire <b>Tyrolean</b> province.|$|E

Outnumbered by the Italians, they had to retreat. After the Austrian recovery in 1917, the town was occupied again by the <b>Tyrolean</b> Standschützen. Following Italy's victory in World War I, Ampezzo was (together with central and southern part of Tyrol) definitely ceded to Italy in 1920. Three years later it was torn from Tyrol and incorporated into the province of Belluno, itself part of Veneto region.|$|E

BMI (British Midland) and Mexicana Airlines joined on 1 July, bringing the alliance's membership to 13. The addition of BMI made London Heathrow the only European hub with two alliances. During the year, Emirates considered joining Star Alliance, but decided against it. That year the now-defunct BWIA West Indies Airways, which had entered an alliance with United Airlines, considered becoming a member but did not. In 2000, the alliance also opened its first three business centers (in Los Angeles, Frankfurt, and Bangkok) and announced {{the formation of an}} Alliance Management Team (AMT), the partnership's executive body.

5|$|In {{addition}} to Italian, {{the majority of}} the population speak fluent Ampezzano, a local variant of Ladin, now recognized as a language rather than a dialect. Ladin comes from Latin (like Italian, French and Spanish) and resembles Romansh which is spoken in Switzerland. Maintaining the local language, that is not only spoken by the older people but also by many of Cortina's younger inhabitants, has become a symbol of their attachment to the local mountainous heritage. The community is also proud of its Ladin or <b>Tyrolean</b> culture, that continues to survive despite the increasing pressure it has faced in recent years. Its importance is even beginning to be recognized by the local authorities who in December 2007 decided to use Ladin on signs for the names of streets and villages, in compliance with regulations for the protection of linguistic minorities in force since 1999.|$|E
5|$|Russia possessed thirty-six cavalry {{divisions}} when {{it entered}} {{the war in}} 1914, and the Russian government claimed that its horsemen would thrust deep {{into the heart of}} Germany. Although Russian mounted troops entered Germany, they were soon met by German forces. In the August 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, troops led by German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Lieutenant-General Erich Ludendorff surrounded the Russian Second Army and destroyed the mounted force of Don Cossacks that served as the special guard of Russian General Alexander Samsonov. Other Russian cavalry units successfully harassed retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in September 1914, with the running battle eventually resulting in the loss of 40,000 of the 50,000men in the Austro-Hungarian XIV <b>Tyrolean</b> Corps, which included the 6th Mounted Rifle Regiment. Transporting cavalry created a hardship for the already strained Russian infrastructure, as the great distances they needed to be moved meant that they had to be transported by train. Approximately the same number of trains (about 40) were required to transport a cavalry division of 4,000 as to transport an infantry division of 16,000.|$|E

2500|$|South Tyrol, a disputed {{territory}} in the Alps, was returned to Italy. The [...] "thirty-second decision" [...] of the Council of Foreign Ministers to grant South Tyrol to Italy (4 September 1945) disregarded popular opinion in Austria and the possible effects of a forced repatriation of 200,000 German-speaking <b>Tyroleans.</b> The decision was motivated largely by the British desire to reward Italy, a country far {{more important for the}} containment of world communism. Renner's objections came in too late and carried too little weight to have effect. Popular and official protests continued through 1946. The signatures of 150,000 South <b>Tyroleans</b> did not alter the decision. South Tyrol is today an Italian autonomous province (Bolzano/Bozen) with a German-speaking majority.|$|R
50|$|After Napoleon's {{victory in}} the Battle of Wagram on 5 and 6 July, Lefebvre and Deroy reoccupied Innsbruck.

5|$|The Haflinger, {{also known}} as the Avelignese, is a breed of horse {{developed}} in Austria and northern Italy (namely Hafling in South Tyrol region) during the late nineteenth century. Haflinger horses are relatively small, are always chestnut in color, have distinctive gaits described as energetic but smooth, and are well-muscled yet elegant. The breed traces its ancestry to the Middle Ages; there are several theories for its origin. Haflingers, developed for use in mountainous terrain, are known for their hardiness. Their current conformation and appearance are the result of infusions of bloodlines from Arabian and various European breeds into the original native <b>Tyrolean</b> ponies. The foundation sire, 249 Folie, was born in 1874; by 1904 the first breeders' cooperative was formed. All Haflingers can trace their lineage back to Folie through one of seven bloodlines. World Wars I and II, as well as the Great Depression, had a detrimental effect on the breed, and lower-quality animals were used at times to save the breed from extinction. During World War II, breeders focused on horses that were shorter and more draft-like, favored by the military for use as packhorses. The emphasis after the war shifted toward animals of increased refinement and height.|$|E
5|$|The {{action at}} Wertingen {{convinced}} Mack {{to operate on}} the left (north) bank of the Danube instead of making a direct eastwards retreat on the right bank. This would require the Austrian army to cross to the north at Günzburg. On 8 October Ney was operating under Louis Alexandre Berthier's directions that called for a direct attack on Ulm the following day. Ney sent in Jean-Pierre Firmin Malher's 3rd Division to capture the Günzburg bridges over the Danube. In the Battle of Günzburg, a column of this division ran into some <b>Tyrolean</b> jaegers and captured 200 of them, including their commander Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspré, along with two cannons. The Austrians noticed these developments and reinforced their positions around Günzburg with three infantry battalions and 20 cannons. Malher's division conducted several heroic attacks against the Austrian positions, but all failed. Mack then sent in Ignaz Gyulai with seven infantry battalions and fourteen cavalry squadrons to repair the destroyed bridges, but this force was charged and swept away by the delayed French 59th Infantry Regiment. Fierce fighting ensued and the French finally managed to establish a foothold on the right (south) bank of the Danube. While the Battle of Günzburg was being fought, Ney sent Louis Henri Loison's 2nd Division to capture the Danube bridges at Elchingen, which were lightly defended by the Austrians. Having lost most of the Danube bridges, Mack marched his army back to Ulm. By 10 October Ney's corps had made significant progress: Malher's 3rd division had crossed to the right (south) bank, Loison's 2nd division held Elchingen, and Pierre Dupont de l'Étang's 1st Division was heading towards Ulm.|$|E

50|$|With {{the rise}} to power of Benito Mussolini and Fascism in Italy in 1922 came a strong desire for the Italianization, which {{essentially}} sought {{for the elimination of}} the German language in speech as well as every day use, such as dual language notices on road signs and advertisements. By the commencement of World War II Italy and Nazi Germany converged to form the Axis Powers. With this came an increase of options for German-speaking citizens, who were now permitted to emigrate into the Greater Germanic Reich with better ease or accept the terms of their Italianization. 86% of South <b>Tyroleans</b> complied with resettlement in other German possessions; while most of the aforementioned emigrants later returned, these policies resulted in the permanent exodus of 75,000 of their populace. Linguistic reforms were instituted following the Fascist regime's overthrow in 1945, restoring most of the basic rights of South <b>Tyroleans</b> that had been previously revoked.|$|R
