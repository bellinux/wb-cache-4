40|$|The Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement {{describes}} {{a method of}} evaluating measurement uncertainty that involves attributing an underlying variance to each component of the total measurement error. Assessment of such a variance by statistical methods is known as Type A evaluation of uncertainty, while assessment by any other means is known as <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluation.</b> The involvement of degrees of freedom with Type A evaluation is in accordance with statistical theory. However, the use of “degrees of freedom” with <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluation</b> is an idea primarily developed for practicality, and might be improved upon. That idea {{ignores the fact that}} the underlying distribution of the corresponding error will often be assumed to be blunter than normal, as with a uniform distribution, and it can lead to underestimation of the total error variance. Consequently, an alternative concept for <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluation</b> is presented. The resulting analysis fits easily with the use of degrees of freedom in Type A evaluation and leads to an overall method of evaluation that often permits the proper quotation of shorter uncertainty intervals...|$|E
40|$|For {{measurement}} {{outside the}} laboratory, uncertainty evaluations {{have to be}} model-based. Therefore models should not only represent the measurand but also its environment. For measurement in social science these models will be too complex, therefore instead of white-box models, grey-box (modular-designed) models are preferred. They are much simpler. Uncertainty evaluations of measurements outside the laboratory are more {{of the kind of}} <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluations.</b> In social science, {{due to the lack of}} authoritative scientific institutions, <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluations</b> will be of a different character. In case of measurements based on grey-box models they are the so-called structure-oriented behaviour tests...|$|R
40|$|The Working Group has {{examined}} recent recommendations for evaluating and expressing uncertainty in measurement [Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement, International Organization for Standardization (ISO, 1993) ]. The present publication updates an earlier {{report of the}} IUCr Subcommittee on Statistical Descriptors [Schwarzenbach, Abrahams, Flack, Gonschorek, Hahn, Huml, Marsh, Prince, Robertson, Rollett & Wilson (1989). Acta Cryst. A 45, 63 - 75]. This new report presents the concepts of standard uncertainty, of combined standard uncertainty, and of Type A and <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluations</b> of standard uncertainties. It expands the earlier dictionary of statistical terms, recommends replacement of the term estimated standard deviation (e. s. d.) by standard uncertainty (s. u.) or by combined standard uncertainty (c. s. u.) in statements of the statistical uncertainties of data and results, and requests a complete description of the experimental and computational procedures used to obtain all results submitted to IUCr publications...|$|R

For this purpose, uncertainty estimation {{is one of the}} most crucial points for decision making. The sampling and analytical uncertainty was estimated by two different ways: 1. Identification and quantification of the major contributions through QA/QC data (type A evaluation) or by other sources (<b>type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluation),</b> 2. Direct assessment through specific duplicate measurements.

This was done to identify the obtainable uncertainty levels with these techniques. The result of the analysis is presented. The baseline of the antennas of the two single-channel NBS-type GPS C-V receivers was 2 m, so multi-path influence is not excluded. The uncertainties from statistical origin (Type A evaluation) were determined by means of MDEV and TDEV. The uncertainties from other sources (<b>Type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluation)</b> were determined from calibrations.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an automotive engine {{based on a}} “self-breathing” and “self-humidified” proton exchange membrane fuel cell stack PEM FC connected to a dc brushless electrical motor was measured under variable power load conditions. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on a small scale 150 W engine model. After determining the fuel cell static polarization curve and the time response to power steps, the system was driven to copy on the test bench a “standard urban load cycle” and its instantaneous efficiencies were measured at an acquisition rate of 5 Hz. The integral system efficiency over the entire urban load cycle, comprising the losses of the unavoidable auxiliary components of the engine, was then calculated. The fuel cell stack was operated mainly in “partial” dead-end mode, with a periodic anode flow channel purging, and one test was carried out in “pure” dead-end mode, with no anode channel purging. An uncertainty analysis of the efficiencies was carried out, taking into account either type A and <b>type</b> <b>B</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods, strengthening the discussion about the outcomes obtained for a system based on this novel simplified FC type. For our small scale engine we measured over the standard urban cycle, {{on the basis of the}} H 2 high heating value HHV, a tank-to-wheel integral {{efficiency of}} 18. 2 ± 0. 8...|$|E

40|$|This in vivo study {{evaluated}} the fixation of {{two types of}} titanium implants {{with the use of}} an injectable calcium-phosphate (CaP) cement. The cement was either used to create a cement mantle (Type A implant) or as an additive to press-fit placed titanium plasma sprayed implants (<b>Type</b> <b>B</b> implant). The implants were placed in trabecular bone of the medial femoral condyle of goats and left in place for 2 and 10 weeks. Mechanical evaluation of the implant fixation was done by torque testing. This showed that for the Type A implants the calcium-phosphate cement's performance was significantly inferior (P < 0. 05) to that of polymethylmethacrylate cement fixation. For the two-week <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> implants a significant increase (P < 0. 05) in failure load was found for calcium-phosphate cemented implants compared with just press-fitted <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> implants. Histological <b>evaluation</b> revealed that for Type A implants, failure during torque testing occurred at the implant-cement interface. In contrast, for <b>Type</b> <b>B</b> implants, failure occurred in the bone-implant interface for press-fit-placed devices and in the cement layer for CaP-cemented devices. Further, the CaP cement was found to be overgrown with new formed bone already after 2 weeks of implantation. The cement showed resorption due to regular bone remodeling. On the basis of these observations, it was concluded that the use of injectable CaP cement might facilitate earlier loading of press-fit inserted titanium implants. Nevertheless, the results have to be confirmed in dynamical mechanical as well as loaded in vivo studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Resistance {{strain gauges}} {{have been used}} for the {{measurement}} of strain for more than 50 years; however, research to quantify the inherent uncertainty in a strain-measuring system has been scarce hitherto. Nevertheless, resistive strain gauges are the most widely used tool to measure strain owing to their simplicity, apparent accuracy, low cost, and ease of use. In spite of this, at times they are used improperly, and the sources of error are neglected. Every type of measurement has an uncertainty associated with it. As it is impossible to eliminate error completely, the goal must be to quantify it and to reduce it to a value that is acceptable {{for the purposes of the}} measurement being taken. The novelty of the present research is to put forward a new methodology for determining the uncertainty in a strain gauge measuring system. To achieve this, the principal sources of error that influence the measuring system are formulated in order to develop an error model. Subsequently, the law of propagation of uncertainty is applied, together with a <b>type</b> A and <b>B</b> <b>evaluation</b> approach to determine the combined uncertainty of the entire measuring system, taking into consideration the correlation between variables, when applicable. The new methodology is then applied to a series of strain measurements taken on an aluminium flat bar subject to a bending load, and the results are discussed...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{prognostic}} {{relevance of}} subtypes within <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas is controversial. The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the utility of World Health Organization (WHO) classification in patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymoma. MethodsThis was a retrospective review of 100 patients who underwent thymectomy for WHO <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymoma. Recurrence patterns and survival were compared among subtypes. ResultsThere were 22 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 tumors, 43 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 tumors, and 35 <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 tumors. Incomplete resection occurred in 5 patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 thymoma, 8 with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 thymoma, and 8 with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 thymoma (P = . 87). Of the 79 patients with complete resection, tumor recurrence occurred in 1 (5. 9 %) patient with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1 thymoma, 2 (5. 7 %) with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 2 thymoma, and 2 (7. 4 %) with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 3 thymoma, and all of these patients had Masaoka stage III disease. Disease-free survival at 5 years was 93 %, 85 %, and 82 % in <b>type</b> <b>B</b> 1, B 2, and B 3, respectively (B 1 vs B 2; P =. 79; B 2 vs B 3; P = 0. 6). Disease-free survival at 5 years was 94 %, 100 %, 61 %, and 50 % in Masaoka stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively (I vs II; P =. 26; II vs III; P =. 028; III vs IV; P =. 002). ConclusionsTumor recurrence was significantly associated with advanced Masaoka stage regardless of the WHO subtype of <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas. Given the heterogeneity of WHO <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas, Masaoka stage should always be considered when predicting prognosis and planning adjuvant treatment for patients with <b>type</b> <b>B</b> thymomas...|$|R
