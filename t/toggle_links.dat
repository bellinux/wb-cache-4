40|$|There are {{at least}} two {{articulated}} levers (16, 18) arranged in a mirror image formation and linked to shared outer links (12, 14) have <b>toggle</b> <b>links</b> (20, 22) rigidly connected at an adjustable spacing. The first outer link (12) is connectable to the drive of the press, and the second, lower outer link (14) is connected to a press plunger. An adjustment (32, 34) consists of a linear drive piece joining the <b>toggle</b> <b>links</b> and consisting of a threaded spindle (32) and an adjusting motor (34). Each articulated lever consists of pairs of levers (26, 24; 28, 30) joined by the outer links and by bolts (19) belonging to the inner links. ADVANTAGE - The economically produced coupling enables the length to be altered easily, and induces additional movements while the mechanical press is operating...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a foldable self erecting joint {{which may be}} used to deploy the tetratruss frame of the proposed shuttle launched triangular space station. The frame must be folded into the payload bay of the space shuttle orbiter. To deploy the frame the tubes are automatically unfolded and once in position should remain safely. A pair of hinged, tubular members in which the hinging is located at corresponding portions of the members are used. The opposite edge portions are connected by spring-based <b>toggle</b> <b>links</b> which in the unfolded position of the members are nested against one of the members in substantial alignment and over-center for securely locking the joint in the unfolded position...|$|E
5000|$|Vickers was {{involved}} in the production of numerous firearms. The British tested John Pedersen's design for a semi-automatic rifle between World War I and World War II. Vickers made British version of the rifle, and their version of the Pedersen rifle usually goes by the name [...] "Vickers Pedersen Rifle". The company was also involved in the manufacture of 6000-10000 (6181 is often quoted) Luger pistols in 1922-24. These 1906 pattern pistols were in 9 mm calibre and part of a contract for the Dutch military. The Lugers are identifiable by the inscription [...] "Vickers Ltd" [...] on the forward <b>toggle</b> <b>link.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After the war, Oliver Winchester renamed New Haven Arms the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The company {{modified}} {{and improved}} the basic {{design of the}} Henry rifle, creating the first Winchester rifle: the Model 1866. It retained the [...]44 Henry cartridge, was likewise built on a bronze-alloy frame, and had an improved magazine and a wooden forearm. In 1873 Winchester introduced the steel-framed Model 1873 chambering the more potent [...]44-40 centerfire cartridge. In 1876, {{in a bid to}} compete with the powerful single-shot rifles of the time, Winchester brought out the Model 1876 (Centennial Model). While it chambered more powerful cartridges than the 1866 and 1873 models, the <b>toggle</b> <b>link</b> action was not strong enough for the popular high-powered rounds used in Sharps or Remington single-shot rifles.|$|R
50|$|The Hi-Power, {{like many}} other Browning designs, {{operates}} on the short-recoil principle, where the barrel and slide initially recoil together until the barrel is unlocked from the slide by a cam arrangement. Unlike Browning's earlier Colt M1911 pistol, the barrel is not moved vertically by a <b>toggling</b> <b>link,</b> but instead by a hardened bar which crosses the frame under the barrel and contacts a slot under the chamber, at the rearmost part of the barrel. The barrel and slide recoil together for a short distance but, as the slot engages the bar, the chamber and {{the rear of the}} barrel are drawn downward and stopped. The downward movement of the barrel disengages it from the slide, which continues rearward, extracting the spent case from the chamber and ejecting it while also re-cocking the hammer. After the slide reaches the limit of its travel, the recoil spring brings it forward again, stripping a new round from the magazine and pushing it into the chamber. This also pushes the chamber and barrel forward. The cam slot and bar move the chamber upward and the locking lugs on the barrel re-engage those in the slide.|$|R
2500|$|Apoptosis is {{the process}} of {{programmed}} cell death (PCD) that may occur in multicellular organisms. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. It is now thought that- in a developmental context- cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading the path of [...] "apoptosis", others following a more generalized pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of [...] "apoptosis" [...] such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are <b>toggled</b> or <b>linked</b> in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors.|$|R
60|$|He {{came back}} and crawled half-way up the pile, meaning to reach the top, but stopped and lay flat. An object moved along the highest row, {{and he knew it}} was a man. The fellow's figure showed against the sky, though Charnock {{imagined}} he would have been invisible from above. He waited and felt his heart beat as he clenched the bar. The other did not seem to know he was watched and Charnock resolved to find out what he meant to do. He thought of the chain that held the logs; if this were loosed, the pile would roll into the river and be washed away, but {{it would be impossible to}} slip the fastening <b>toggle</b> while the <b>links</b> were strained. Still one might be nicked with a hacksaw and left to break with the shock when the next log ran down the slide. The man, however, could not get at the chain from the top row.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), {{also called}} 7 TM receptors, form a huge {{superfamily}} of membrane proteins that, upon activation by extracellular agonists, pass {{the signal to}} the cell interior. Ligands can bind either to extracellular N-terminus and loops (e. g. glutamate receptors) or to the binding site within transmembrane helices (Rhodopsin-like family). They are all activated by agonists although a spontaneous auto-activation of an empty receptor can also be observed. Biochemical and crystallographic methods together with molecular dynamics simulations and other theoretical techniques provided models of the receptor activation based on the action of so-called “molecular switches ” buried in the receptor structure. They are changed by agonists but also by inverse agonists evoking an ensemble of activation states leading toward different activation pathways. Switches discovered so far include the ionic lock switch, the 3 - 7 lock switch, the tyrosine <b>toggle</b> switch <b>linked</b> with the nPxxy motif in TM 7, and the transmission switch. The latter one was proposed instead of the tryptophan rotamer toggle switch because no change of the rotamer was observed in structures of activated receptors. The global toggle switch suggested earlier consisting of a vertical rigid motion of TM 6, seems also to be implausible based on the recent crystal structures of GPCRs with agonists. Theoretical and experimental methods (crystallography, NMR, specific spectroscopic methods like FRET/BRET but also single-molecule-force-spectroscopy) are currently used to study the effect of ligands on the receptor structure, location of stable structural segments/domains of GPCRs, and to answer the still open question on how ligands are binding: either via ensemble of conformational receptor states or rather via induced fit mechanisms.
