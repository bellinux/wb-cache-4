50|$|Richard Jordan Gatling (September 12, 1818 - February 26, 1903) was an American {{inventor}} {{best known}} for his invention of the Gatling gun, considered to be the first successful machine gun, though it is not a <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> gun by modern definitions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>True</b> <b>machine</b> code is {{a stream}} of raw, usually binary, data. A {{programmer}} coding in [...] "machine code" [...] normally codes instructions and data in a more readable form such as decimal, octal, or hexadecimal which is translated to internal format by a program called a loader or toggled into the computer's memory from a front panel.|$|R
5000|$|A {{semi-automatic}} pistol will fire {{only one}} shot per trigger pull, {{in contrast to}} a [...] "fully automatic" [...] or machine pistol, which continues to fire as long as the trigger is held or until all rounds have been fired. The Mauser M712 Schnellfeuer (German for [...] "rapid fire"), a modified Mauser C96 pistol, is a notable example of a <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> pistol.|$|R
50|$|The CDD IDE was {{completely}} new {{and based on}} the JPI IDE. It included many professional programmer quality tools: editor, project system, compiler, linker, visual debugger. Gone was the p-code of CPD. The JPI compiler for the Clarion language produced <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> code EXEs, LIBs and DLLs. Binaries could be compiled for Protected Mode allowing DOS programs to use extended memory breaking the 640KB barrier.|$|R
5000|$|Programs {{were stored}} as a [...]BAS source file, using the [...] "SAVE" [...] command. It could be [...] "compiled" [...] into a non-editable binary [...]BAC file, using the [...] "COMPILE" [...] command. This command {{did not produce}} <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> {{language}} programs, but rather a byte code called [...] "tokens". The tokens were interpreted upon execution, {{in a manner similar}} to the more modern Java.|$|R
25|$|The {{machine gun}} {{is defined as}} a fully {{automatic}} firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine. The world's first <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> gun, the Maxim gun, was invented in 1884 by the American inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, who devised a recoil power of the previously fired bullet to reload rather than the crude method of a manually operated, hand-cranked firearm. With the ability to fire 750 rounds per minute, Maxim's other great innovation was the use of water cooling to reduce overheating. Maxim's gun was widely adopted and derivative designs were used on all sides during World War I.|$|R
25|$|The {{machine gun}} is {{typically}} {{considered to be}} a fully automatic firearm, usually designed to fire rifle cartridges in quick succession from an ammunition belt or large-capacity magazine. The Gatling gun, invented and patented in 1861 by Richard Gatling during the American Civil War, was the earliest precursor to a machine gun {{in the sense that it}} had all of the underlying features of reliable loading as well as the ability to fire sustained multiple bursts of rounds, the only drawback being, it had to be manually operated and hand-cranked unlike its 1884 successor, the Maxim gun, which was indisputably the world's first <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> gun.|$|R
50|$|In {{the decades}} after the 1980s, there were {{newspaper}} reports {{about the use of}} the MAC-10 or the Tec-9 in crimes, including gang-related crimes and its use by Dylan Klebold in the Columbine High School massacre. The Tec-9 (known as the AB-10 after 1994), is sold as a semi-automatic weapon, not a machine pistol. However, early open-bolt models could be easily converted to fire fully automatically. Despite this, Klebold's pistol was, in fact, a post-ban AB-10. The majority of criminal uses of the MAC-10/11 and Tec-9 style firearms involve unconverted, semi-automatic versions. Failure to differentiate between the two has led to some confusion over what constitutes a <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> pistol, especially among the news media.|$|R
50|$|Homopolar <b>machines</b> are <b>true</b> DC <b>machines</b> where {{current is}} {{supplied}} to a spinning wheel through brushes. The wheel is inserted in a magnetic field, and torque is created {{as the current}} travels from the edge to {{the centre of the}} wheel through the magnetic field.|$|R

Baroque religious art built <b>true</b> <b>machines</b> {{capable of}} amazing those who approached them. The intent behind such devices was to convert and amaze the faithful, {{as a kind}} of "bait" which could attract them, and make them take into account the teachings of the Catholic Church. In this sense, we seek to identify in religious painting, woodcarving and music of colonial Minas Gerais (Brazil) some artifices employed to provoke wonder and teach the faithful...|$|R
50|$|The gun {{was used}} in one, two and four-barrel versions. The {{ammunition}} was fed by gravity from a hopper above the breech subdivided into separate columns for each barrel. The gunner loaded and fired the multiple barrels by moving a lever {{on the right side}} of the gun forward and backwards. Pulling the lever backwards extracted the fired cartridges, pushing it forward then loaded fresh cartridges into all the barrels, and the final part of the forward motion fired all the barrels, one at a time in quick succession. Hence the gun functioned as a type of volley gun, firing bullets in bursts, compared to the contemporary Gatling gun and the <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> guns which succeeded it such as the Maxim gun, which fired at a steady continuous rate.|$|R
50|$|Since {{virtually}} all video game consoles and arcade cabinets {{designed and built}} after 1980 were <b>true</b> digital <b>machines</b> based on microprocessors (unlike the earlier Pong clones and derivatives), some of them carried a minimal form of BIOS or built-in game, such as the ColecoVision, the Sega Master System and the SNK Neo Geo.|$|R
5000|$|A machine gun, {{as defined}} in the NFA, is [...] "Any weapon which shoots, is {{designed}} to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger." [...] The NFA term machine gun refers to all firearms capable of full automatic fire and includes <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> guns, assault rifles, battle rifles, submachine guns, and machine pistols. The frame or receiver of a machine gun, and any combination of parts intended to make a machine gun, is legally defined as a machine gun. For example, according to the ATF, [...] "A Glock conversion switch is a part designed and intended for use in converting a semi-automatic Glock pistol into a machine gun; therefore, it is a [...] "machine gun" [...] {{as defined in}} 26 U.S.C. 5845(b)." ...|$|R
5000|$|Compactness: <b>True</b> {{front-loading}} <b>machines</b> may {{be installed}} underneath counter-height work surfaces. A front-loading washing machine, in a fully fitted kitchen, {{may even be}} disguised as a kitchen cabinet. These models can also be convenient in homes with limited floor area, since the clothes dryer may be installed directly above the washer ("stacked" [...] configuration).|$|R
50|$|The {{first goal}} removed (for decades, at least) a {{crushing}} limitation of earlier machines: {{running out of}} physical storage. The second enabled substantial improvements in security and reliability. The third enabled the implementation of <b>true</b> virtual <b>machines.</b> Contemporary documents {{make it clear that}} full hardware virtualization and virtual machines were not original design goals for the S/360-67.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} characteristics of a centrifugal pump equipped with a multiple disks rotor specifically designed to operate in the optimal flow regimes. Global measurements are carried out with controlled accuracy while the machine is processing an highly viscous Newtonian lubricating oil in a closed loop system. Results, presented in non dimensional form, indicate that the work transfer is truly efficient, and leads to stable flow conditions all across the performance map. Rotor efficiencies in excess to 80 % are measured {{in a wide range of}} flow coefficients, thus demonstrating that the theoretical achievements of the late 70 s pertaining to the single pair of co-rotating disks can be attained in a <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> environment, provided the optimal wheel flow conditions are preserved. Overall pump efficiency is penalized by inadequate diffusion systems, and not by rotor work transferring mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{semi-automatic}} firearms, {{which require}} one trigger pull per round fired (usually {{due to the}} sear only resetting when the trigger is released), a machine gun is designed to fire {{for as long as}} the trigger is held down. Nowadays the term is restricted to relatively heavy weapons, able to provide continuous or frequent bursts of automatic fire for as long as ammunition lasts. Machine guns are normally used against personnel, aircraft and light vehicles, or to provide suppressive fire, either directly or indirectly. They are commonly mounted on fast attack vehicles such as technicals to provide heavy mobile firepower, armored vehicles such as tanks for engaging targets too small to justify use of the primary weaponry or too fast to effectively engage with it, and on aircraft as defensive armament or for strafing ground targets, though on fighter aircraft <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> guns have mostly been supplanted by large-caliber rotary guns.|$|R
30|$|A bonnet for nodding needs {{first to}} be <b>machined</b> <b>true</b> to the <b>machine</b> virtual pivot (intersection of A, B axes), as is usual practice. The {{nominally}} circular disk of polishing cloth is molded to the bonnet radius and cemented to the bonnet. The periphery of the cloth is then machined, using a sharp tool, to be precisely circular and run true. This requires caution {{in order not to}} damage the bonnet. It is not necessary to machine right through the cloth; a step is sufficient to deliver an influence function with a sharp edge.|$|R

40|$|In {{machining}} simulation, {{there is}} always a trade-off between high level of accuracy, and an abstraction of reliance and truthful simulation environment. Most research work has been devoted towards developing precise models and algorithms, yet still lack the capability to portray the <b>true</b> <b>machining</b> environment. This is due to the difficulty in providing a simulation model of data integrity without continually monitoring the shop-floor activities. This factor is compounded by the use of low language data at shop-floor level that hinders the possibility for design data integration. It must be noted that, shop-floor activities are dynamic in nature.   Even just prior to machining, machining parameters, cutting tools, workpiece and fixture orientations were adjusted where most of these activities are not being captured and considered in the simulation model. This paper introduces a near-real solution to cater for an ingenuous machining simulation environment. The approach taken is by employing machine tool kinematic data model based on STEP/STEP-NC and actual shop-floor status via MTConnect. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{historians of}} {{technology}} consider that <b>true</b> <b>machine</b> tools were born when the toolpath first became {{guided by the}} machine itself in some way, {{at least to some}} extent, so that direct, [...] human guidance of the toolpath (with hands, feet, or mouth) was no longer the only guidance used in the cutting or forming process. In this view of the definition, the term, arising at a time when all tools up till then had been hand tools, simply provided a label for [...] "tools that were machines instead of hand tools". Early lathes, those prior to the late medieval period, and modern woodworking lathes and potter's wheels may or may not fall under this definition, depending on how one views the headstock spindle itself; but the earliest historical records of a lathe with direct mechanical control of the cutting tool's path are of a screw-cutting lathe dating to about 1483. This lathe [...] "produced screw threads out of wood and employed a true compound slide rest".|$|R

40|$|International audienceMachining {{time is a}} major {{performance}} criterion {{when it comes to}} high-speed machining. CAM software can help in estimating that time for a given strategy. But in practice, CAM-programmed feed rates are rarely achieved, especially where complex surface finishing is concerned. This means that machining time forecasts are often more than one step removed from reality. The reason behind this is that CAM routines do not take either the dynamic performances of the machines or their specific machining tolerances into account. The present article seeks to improve simulation of high-speed NC machine dynamic behaviour and machining time prediction, offering two models. The first contributes through enhanced simulation of three-axis paths in linear and circular interpolation, taking high-speed machine accelerations and jerks into account. The second model allows transition passages between blocks to be integrated in the simulation by adding in a polynomial transition path that caters for the <b>true</b> <b>machining</b> environment tolerances. Models are based on respect for path monitoring. Experimental validation shows the contribution of polynomial modelling of the transition passage due to the absence of a leap in acceleration. Simulation error on the machining time prediction remains below 1 %...|$|R
