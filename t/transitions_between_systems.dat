40|$|There is an {{extraordinary}} diversity in genetic systems across species, but this variation remains poorly understood. In part, {{this is because the}} mechanisms responsible for <b>transitions</b> <b>between</b> <b>systems</b> are often unknown. A recent hypothesis has suggested that conflict between hosts and endosymbiotic microorganisms over transmission could drive the transition from diplodiploidy to systems with male haploidy (haplodiploidy, including arrhenotoky and paternal genome elimination [PGE]). Here, we present the first formal test of this idea with a comparative analysis across scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccoidea). Scale insects are renowned for their large variation in genetic systems, and multiple transitions between diplodiploidy and haplodiploidy have taken place within this group. Additionally, most species rely on endosymbiotic microorganisms to provide them with essential nutrients lacking in their diet. We show that species harboring endosymbionts are indeed {{more likely to have a}} genetic system with male haploidy, which supports the hypothesis that endosymbionts might have played a role in the transition to haplodiploidy. We also extend our analysis to consider the relationship between endosymbiont presence and transitions to parthenogenesis. Although in scale insects there is no such overall association, species harboring eukaryote endosymbionts were more likely to be parthenogenetic than those with bacterial symbionts. These results support the idea that intergenomic conflict can drive the evolution of novel genetic systems and affect host reproduction. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Legacy network {{systems and}} {{protocols}} are mostly static and keep state information in silo-style storage, thus making state migration, transformation and re-use difficult. Software-Defined Network (SDN) approaches in unison with Network Function Virtualization (NFV) allow for more flexibility, {{yet they are}} currently restricted to a limited set of state migration options. Additionally, existing systems and protocols are mostly tailored {{to meet the requirements}} of specific application scenarios. As a result, the protocols cannot easily be adapted to novel application demands, organically growing networks, etc. Impeding the sharing of networking and system state, along with lacking support for dynamic <b>transitions</b> <b>between</b> <b>systems</b> and protocols, severely limits the ability to optimally manage resources and dynamically adapt to a desirable overall configuration. These limitations not only affect the network performance but also hinder the deployment of new and innovative protocols as a hard break is usually not feasible and thus full support for legacy systems is required. On the one hand, we propose a generalized way to collect, store, transform, and share context between systems and protocols in both the legacy Internet as well as NFV/SDN-driven networks. This allows us to share state information between multiple systems and protocols from NFs over BGP routers to protocols on all layers of the network stack. On the other hand, we introduce an architecture for designing modular protocols that are built with transition in mind. We argue that the modular design of systems and protocols can remove the key limitations of today’s monolithic protocols and allow for a more dynamic network management. First, we design and implement a Storage and Transformation Engine for Advanced Net- working context (STEAN) which constitutes a shared context storage, making network state information available to other systems and protocols. Its pivotal feature is the ability to allow for state transformation as well as for persisting state to enable future re-use. Second, we provide a Blueprint for Switching Between Mechanisms that serves as a framework and guideline for developers to standardize and ease the process of designing and implementing systems and protocols that support transitions as a first order principle. By means of experimentation, we show that our architecture covers a diverse set of challenging use cases in legacy systems—such as Wireless Multihop Networks (WMNs) —as well as in NFV/SDN-enabled systems. In particular, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by migrating state information between two instances of the PRADS NF in a virtualized Mininet environment, and show that our solution outperforms state of the art frameworks that are specifically built for NF migration. We further demonstrate that a dynamic switch between WMN routing protocols is possible at runtime and that the state information can be reutilized for bootstrapping novel protocol modules, thus minimizing the control overhead...|$|E

A verbal system learns rule-defined (RD) categories and a nonverbal system learns non-rule-defined (NRD) categories. The objective of my dissertation {{is to explore}} the interaction <b>between</b> these <b>systems.</b> The verbal system is dominant in that adults tend to use it during initial learning but may switch to the nonverbal system when the verbal system is unsuccessful. The nonverbal system has traditionally been thought to operate independently of executive functions, but recent studies suggest that executive functions {{may be used to}} facilitate the transition away from the verbal system. Study 1 investigated whether executive functions play similar roles across systems and which, if any, components of executive functions are most important for the verbal and nonverbal systems. The components of executive functions were associated with both types of category learning but played different roles within each system. Study 2 compared the effects of a temporary and continuous executive function disruption for each system. When executive functions were continuously unavailable, the transition to the nonverbal system was hindered, providing evidence that executive functions are needed to <b>transition</b> <b>between</b> <b>systems.</b> For the verbal system, temporary and continuous interference had similar effects, illustrating that any executive function disruption is detrimental to the verbal system. Studies 3 and 4 experimentally manipulated the interaction <b>between</b> <b>systems.</b> Manipulating the order in which categories were learned affected the initial strengths of the systems. Strengthening the verbal system reduced optimal strategy use on subsequent nonverbal categorization, but the opposite was not true. Increasing stimulus knowledge facilitated rule searching and increased optimal strategy use on nonverbal categorization but not on verbal categorization. Conclusions. The current studies illustrate that the <b>transition</b> <b>between</b> <b>systems</b> is disrupted when executive functions are never fully available and when the verbal system is strengthened, but is facilitated when hypothesis testing is expedited. This research provides insight into the interaction <b>between</b> category learning <b>systems</b> and illustrates that the interaction is mediated by executive functions.

We briefly review the factors thought {{to be responsible for}} these transitions, and we provide a synthesis of what has been learned from recent studies of the annual herb Mercurialis annua, in which dioecy (males and females), monoecy (functional hermaphrodites), and androdioecy (males and hermaphrodites) occur in different parts of its geographic range. Previous research on M. annua has revealed the importance of genome duplication and hybridization in the origin of much of the observed variation. Here we show, however, that spatial transitions in the sexual system also occur within the same ploidy level. In particular, we present an analysis, using flow cytometry data, of ploidy variation across a previously unstudied <b>transition</b> <b>between</b> hermaphroditism and androdioecy, in which we find that the sexual-system transition is uncoupled from the shift in ploidy levels. We review recent research that shows that such <b>transitions</b> <b>between</b> sexual <b>systems</b> in M. annua are consistent with differential selection at the regional level for reproductive assurance during colonization. We also present new experimental data that highlight both the importance of the resource status of plants and that of their local mating context in regulating gender strategies and sex ratios.
