5|$|The South West Coast Path Association, a {{registered}} charity, exists {{to support the}} interests of users of the path. The Association was formed in 1973 and since then it has campaigned for improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> and undertakes considerable fundraising to help care for and improve the path. Its services include accommodation guides and completion certificates.|$|E
5|$|The path now turns south again, {{passing the}} village of Perranuthnoe (or Perran) and Perran Sands, then {{skirting}} inland across the neck of Cudden Point to Prussia Cove and Bessy's Cove. A larger sandy beach is Praa Sands after which the path climbs up onto a series of cliff tops such as Trewavas Head. This area shows many signs of Cornwall's mining history with abandoned engine houses such as Wheal Prosper close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|Merit is {{connected}} with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to ancestor worship, but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; {{it is capable of}} attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as the destination a person is reborn. The opposite of merit is demerit (papa), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> to Nirvana itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.|$|E
50|$|We know, and we {{must never}} forget, that every <b>path</b> leads somewhere. <b>The</b> <b>path</b> of {{segregation}} leads <b>to</b> lynching. <b>The</b> <b>path</b> of anti-Semitism leads <b>to</b> Auschwitz. <b>The</b> <b>path</b> of cults leads to Jonestown. We ignore this fact at our peril.|$|R

5|$|NY273 {{followed}} part of {{the former}} routing of the Hampton and Whitehall Turnpike, a privately maintained highway that linked the village of Whitehall to a bridge over the Poultney River near the hamlet of Hampton, where it continued to Poultney, Vermont, in the 19th century. The portion of the turnpike west of East Whitehall became part of US4 in 1927; however, US4 was realigned in the mid-1940s to follow a new, more direct highway between Whitehall and the Vermont state line at Fair Haven, Vermont. NY273 was assigned in 1949 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> of old turnpike; however, the NY273 designation was eliminated in 1980 {{as part of a}} highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Washington County. The former routing of NY273 west of NY22A became County Route18 (CR18).|$|E
5|$|The Forest lies to the north-west of the Castle, and is feared by the Castle's {{inhabitants}} as a {{dark and}} dangerous area. The Wendron Witches and the witch community live there, as does Galen, Sarah Heap's mentor in Physik. The Forest has many mysterious aspects, and is dominated by shape-shifting or carnivorous trees, including Benjamin Heap, wolverines, and secrets. The Forest has a secret way to transport a character <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> leading to the House of Foryx. Sage based the Forest on medieval forests, which were huge and a law unto themselves, free from {{the authority of the}} outside world.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} {{currently}} no passenger train operation in Teaneck, train service is available across the Hackensack River at the New Bridge Landing station in River Edge and at the Anderson Street station in Hackensack. NJTransit's Pascack Valley Line runs north-south to Hoboken Terminal, with connections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>PATH</b> train from the Hoboken PATH station, and with NJT connecting service to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan via the Secaucus Junction transfer station. At Hoboken Terminal, connections are also available to NY Waterway ferry service (to the World Financial Center and other destinations) and to the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail system (serving locations along the Hudson River in Hudson County).|$|E

In this paper, the simulation results are presented <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> capability of <b>the</b> controller <b>to</b> track <b>the</b> reference <b>path.</b> <b>The</b> controller is able <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> <b>path</b> and modify <b>the</b> vehicle speed <b>to</b> suit <b>the</b> <b>path</b> condition. <b>The</b> effectiveness of the controller is shown in this paper whereby identical performance is achieved with the benchmark but with extra curvature adaptation capabilites...|$|R

25|$|Railway lines run close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> {{for most}} of its length. Bowling Station, on the line from Glasgow, is close {{to the start of the}} path. Both Glasgow main line railway {{stations}} are in the centre of the city, only a few hundred yards apart. The line which has run close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>path</b> from Bowling to Glasgow passes through Glasgow Central Station low-level. The railway line which runs close to the rest of the path runs from Glasgow Queen Street Station to Edinburgh Haymarket Station. Trains are frequent on both lines. In Croy, Falkirk and Linlithgow the canal is only a few hundred yards from the railway station. Edinburgh's Waverley Station and Haymarket Station are only a short distance from Lochrin Basin.|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic hoses are key {{components}} used to transfer power in heavy industrial machinery. The routing of these hoses is currently performed {{late in the}} product design process because no accurate physical models of the hoses exist that allow designers <b>to</b> predict <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>the</b> hoses will follow when installed in the machine. Designers must either guess <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>the</b> hose will take based on prior experience or wait until the first product prototype is built in order <b>to</b> experiment with <b>the</b> hose routes.
