40|$|Transcription begins] 15 November 1944 Holland My darling, I’ve {{got hold}} of a money order blank so I’m sending you $ 80. 00 {{to put in the}} bank or preferably to {{purchase}} bonds. You see, one spends practically no money here whatsoever and any commodity that one desires from the native folk is obtained by barter. Are you getting $ 150. 00 per month and a $ 50. 00 War Bond each month[?] It may be a bit late in getting started but you should receive the alione [?] amount each and every month. The weather here is snappy, but not too cold. This part of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> <b>damp</b> which makes the cold nasty. Thanks to my golosher [sic] and plenty of clothing, the cold doesn’t bother me. I’ve sent in one of my other letters a little handmade doily from here. It was given to me as a souvenir. I’m hoping to hear from you regularly even if certain situations prevent me from writing from time to time—you understand. Bye—my love, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
60|$|We {{have now}} only {{to mention the}} turkey-buzzard (Vultur aura), and the Gallinazo. The former <b>is</b> found {{wherever}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> moderately <b>damp,</b> from Cape Horn to North America. Differently from the Polyborus Brasiliensis and Chimango, it has {{found its way to}} the Falkland Islands. The turkey-buzzard is a solitary bird, or at most goes in pairs. It may at once be recognised from a long distance, by its lofty, soaring, and most elegant flight. It is well known to be a true carrion-feeder. On the west coast of Patagonia, among the thickly-wooded islets and broken land, it lives exclusively on what the sea throws up, and on the carcasses of dead seals. Wherever these animals are congregated on the rocks, there the vultures may be seen. The Gallinazo (Cathartes atratus) has a different range from the last species, as it never occurs southward of latitude 41 degrees. Azara states that there exists a tradition that these birds, {{at the time of the}} conquest, were not found near Monte Video, but that they subsequently followed the inhabitants from more northern districts. At the present day they are numerous in the valley of the Colorado, which is three hundred miles due south of Monte Video. It seems probable that this additional migration has happened since the time of Azara. The Gallinazo generally prefers a humid climate, or rather the neighbourhood of fresh water; hence it is extremely abundant in Brazil and La Plata, while it is never found on the desert and arid plains of Northern Patagonia, excepting near some stream. These birds frequent the whole Pampas to the foot of the Cordillera, but I never saw or heard of one in Chile: in Peru they are preserved as scavengers. These vultures certainly may be called gregarious, for they seem to have pleasure in society, and are not solely brought together by the attraction of a common prey. On a fine day a flock may often be observed at a great height, each bird wheeling round and round without closing its wings, in the most graceful evolutions. This is clearly performed for the mere pleasure of the exercise, or perhaps is connected with their matrimonial alliances.|$|R

25|$|The First Bulgarian Empire {{became known}} simply as Bulgaria since its {{recognition}} by the Byzantine Empire in 681. Some historians use the terms Danube Bulgaria, First Bulgarian State, or First Bulgarian Tsardom (Empire). Between 681 and 864 <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> {{also known as the}} Bulgarian Khanate, Danube Bulgarian Khanate, or Danube Bulgar Khanate in order to differentiate it from Volga Bulgaria, which emerged from another Bulgar group. During its early existence, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> also called <b>the</b> Bulgar state or Bulgar qaghanate. Between 864 and 917/927, <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>was</b> known as <b>the</b> Principality of Bulgaria or Knyazhestvo Bulgaria.
