While the coat of arms and the flag were officially adopted as soon as 1919, {{the question of a}} national anthem had to wait. Apart from Poland Is Not Yet Lost, there were other popular patriotic songs which could compete for the status of an official national anthem.|$|E

[...] On the 14 December edition of BBC One's Sunday Politics Scotland, he repeated his pledge to seek election to the Scottish Parliament, and said that he was [...] "determined" [...] to retain every Westminster seat held by Labour. The following day, he announced plans to rewrite Scottish Labour's constitution to give the party greater autonomy over its affairs and bring it [...] "closer to the centre of Scottish life." [...] On 17 December, Murphy announced that he had been given a Holyrood security pass and would be establishing a presence in the Scottish Parliament Building.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} aired {{earlier in the}} United States than elsewhere, thus in early 1993, Rysher TPE, the {{distributor}} that had sold the series to the American market, had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> financing a new season. At this point, the European partners still had not aired the first season, so the decision fell to Rysher. Willing to take the risk, Rysher {{announced that it would}} produce a second season. The France/Canada co-production agreement of the previous season was reconstituted, albeit with some different partners. Gaumont Television (France), Rysher TPE (United States) and Reteitalia (Italy) agreed to renew their participation to a new season. French leading channel TF1 was forced to cancel its participation because it was no longer legally allowed to qualify a show filmed in English as French content, and was replaced by French smaller channel M6, which was still allowed to do so. RTL Plus (Germany) and Amuse Video (Japan) were also no longer part of the co-production, but Gaumont Television president Christian Charret signed Filmline International (Canada) as a new partner. As a result of this new co-production agreement, with less wealthy partners, the budget of the season decreased from US$26.1 million the previous year to $22 million. Half of the funding came from French and other European sources; income per episode from international sales, which had reached $800,000 in the previous season, decreased as well. According to The Hollywood Reporter, pre-production started in April 1993, and filming in June the same year. Like the first season, the second season was divided into two segments; the first segment was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (as the fictional city of Seacouver, Washington, United States), and the second in Paris, France, to secure an acceptable share of European content as part of the co-production agreement. Creatively, the second season was intended to be more action-oriented than the first, but lead actor Adrian Paul refused to do [...] "another kung fu series," [...] insisting that more romance and history be brought in the scripts.|$|E

[...] In an interview with The Associated Press Jagland stated [...] "It is unstable and unpredictable." [...] After the election in 2001, Stoltenberg and his cabinet were forced to resign, with the Labour Party suffering from its worst election campaign results since 1924. With the 98% votes taken, the Labour Party only garnered 24%, falling from 35%. Jagland, the Labor Party leader, commented on the results saying, [...] "We will have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> whether to continue in government after we know the full results".

2500|$|Tiffany {{was created}} as a love {{interest}} for established character, Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), {{though there was a}} purposeful chemistry between the two, producers left an ambiguity over whether the two would get together. Shortly into the characters arrival to the show, James predicted the two would eventually date, stating; [...] "The problem is what they're willing to admit to each other. They have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> whether they're just friends." [...] When Chris returned from holiday in 1996, the two got together in a [...] "very sparky and frustrated kind of way." [...] However it was soon clear that there was a huge problem in their relationship, in that of Chris' flatmate Emily, the polar opposite to Tiffany. The two got engaged and married on Valentine's Day 1996. Chris departed to America with the promise Tiffany would join him when he settled in, however in 1997 Tiffany returned from visiting Chris with the revelation he had cheated on her and the marriage was over.|$|E
2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student. Evaluating personal preferences is important and can take time. One advisor suggests it is important for a student to think through what is best, and choose on this basis, and [...] "do not listen to your friends" [...] since they have different needs and wants. [...] "One of the worst ways <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>about</b> where to go to college is to follow a friend because he or she is having a good time at that school," [...] wrote one advisor. Since [...] "barely half" [...] of students entering college as first-year students ever graduate from college later in their lives, getting the right fit is important for parents and students to avoid wasting money. What is a good fit: ...|$|E
