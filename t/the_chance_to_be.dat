5|$|Chandler {{believed}} that he had enough support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> president.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, the Jets {{won their}} first two games. NFL players then staged a strike; a team {{composed}} mostly of replacement players lost two of the next three games. The locker room was divided after the strike due to the decision of a few players, led by Gastineau, to cross the picket line. The Jets remained in contention in a mediocre AFC East {{through much of the}} season, but dropped all four games in December to finish 6–9, in last place. In 1988, the Sack Exchange era ended as Joe Klecko failed his offseason physical and was waived, linebacker Lance Mehl announced his retirement during training camp, and Mark Gastineau retired midseason, citing personal reasons. In spite of these departures, the Jets finished with an 8–7–1 record. They secured a winning record by ending the season with a victory over the Giants, which cost their in-state rivals a playoff berth. The team performed badly in 1989, finishing 4–12. On December 18, 1989, the Jets hired executive Dick Steinberg from the New England Patriots to take over as general manager. Three days after New York's final game of the season, a 37–0 loss to the Bills at Giants Stadium, Steinberg fired Walton and began to search for the team's 10th coach. The disastrous 1989 campaign cost Walton <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first Jets coach to complete his career with a winning record, a statistic he later admitted he cared about deeply.|$|E
5|$|Raven and NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zybysko were {{involved}} in a rivalry heading into Final Resolution. At Bound for Glory, Raven requested an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match but was denied by Zybysko. This led to Raven assaulting him before being ejected from the arena by security in the storyline. At Genesis, Zybysko offered Raven <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released from his contract, as this was what Zybysko wanted in the storyline. Raven declined the offer and tried to attack Zybysko once again. Instead, Zybysko forced Raven to face P.J. Polaco in a match, which Raven won. This led to Turning Point where Raven once again declined an offer to be released. Zybysko then revealed Chris K as Raven's opponent for the night; Raven was victorious in the encounter. On the December17, 2005 episode of Impact!, Zybysko announced that at Final Resolution Raven would have another opponent and if he won the bout then he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match.|$|E
