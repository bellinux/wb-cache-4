5|$|Fighting <b>Tommy</b> Riley is a 2004 American {{independent}} film {{that tells the}} story of <b>Tommy</b> Riley and Marty Goldberg, a boxer and his trainer, as they work to secure a title shot for <b>Tommy.</b> Their plans are complicated by the unrequited feelings Marty develops for <b>Tommy.</b> When a big-time promoter seeks to acquire Tommy's contract, <b>Tommy</b> endangers his future career because of his loyalty to Marty. Marty, seeing only one way to free <b>Tommy</b> to take his shot, takes his own life.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the night together, Tosh and <b>Tommy</b> return to the hospital as the disruptions intensify, accompanied by Jack. During one disruption, the three witness the 1918 Torchwood team; Jack relays instructions through <b>Tommy</b> {{for them to take}} the 1918 version of <b>Tommy</b> into their custody before the older <b>Tommy</b> arrives. <b>Tommy</b> and Tosh share a goodbye, and Jack briefs <b>Tommy</b> on using the Rift Key before he steps back to 1918 during the next disruption. However, when back in the past, <b>Tommy</b> becomes shell-shocked, and is led back to his bed by nurses; he is unable to operate the Rift Key in his state. At Torchwood's headquarters, Jack and Tosh use the Cardiff Rift to project an image of Tosh into Tommy's mind. <b>Tommy</b> senses some familiarity with Tosh but otherwise does not recognise her. Despite this, Tosh is able to instruct <b>Tommy</b> to activate the Rift Key, and the distortions at the hospital soon dissipate. Recovering from events, Tosh brushes off Owen's sympathy and takes a moment to consider her short time with <b>Tommy.</b>|$|E
