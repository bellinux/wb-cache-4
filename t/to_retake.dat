5|$|A decisive {{skirmish}} {{took place}} on Turnham Green early in the English Civil War. In November 1642, royalist forces under Prince Rupert, marching from Oxford <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> London, were halted by a larger parliamentarian force under the Earl of Essex. The royalists retreated and never again threatened the capital.|$|E
5|$|Throughout November, Japan's top {{military}} {{leaders at the}} IGH in Tokyo continued to openly support further efforts <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> Guadalcanal from Allied forces. At the same time, however, lower-ranking staff officers began to discreetly discuss abandoning the island. Takushiro Hattori and Masanobu Tsuji, each of whom had recently visited Guadalcanal, told their colleagues on the staff that any further attempt <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the island was a lost cause. Ryūzō Sejima reported that the attrition of IJA troop-strength on Guadalcanal was so unexpectedly severe that future operations would be untenable. On 11 December, two staff officers, IJN Commander Yuji Yamamoto and IJA Major Takahiko Hayashi returned to Tokyo from Rabaul and confirmed Hattori's, Tsuji's, and Sejima's reports. They further reported {{that most of the}} IJN and IJA officers at Rabaul appeared to support abandoning Guadalcanal. Around this time, Japan's War Ministry informed the IGH that there was an insufficient amount of shipping to support both the effort <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> Guadalcanal and transport strategic resources to maintain Japan's economy and military forces.|$|E

The Romanian Army defeated the Hungarians and conquered Budapest in August 1919.|$|E
5|$|Although many Pakistanis {{were silent}} about the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision to use force <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the complex. While hardliners {{have been able to}} stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, most people have been tolerant and oppose the militants desire to impose their interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{attack on}} the city was called off after the Iraqi {{occupants}} opened up with heavy fire, prompting the Saudis to reinforce the 7th Battalion with two more companies from adjacent Saudi units. The attempt <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the city had been preceded by a 15-minute preparatory fire from U.S. Marine artillery. However Iraqi fire did manage to destroy one Saudi V-150 armored personnel carrier.|$|E

50|$|By most {{accounts}} Lederman {{was regarded as}} a somewhat brusque man with an aversion <b>to</b> <b>retakes</b> and prima donna behavior and he clashed with McCoy on more than one occasion. He was renowned for his strict filming regimen and for bringing in films on time and under budget, which could only have helped to ensure his constant employment as a director, but was often criticised by critics in that several of his films looked rushed.|$|R
50|$|The exam {{tested the}} individual's {{knowledge}} and experience with hardware, operating systems, telecommunication, systems, programming, and other data processing areas. If one failed a section, only that section needed <b>to</b> be <b>retaken</b> <b>to</b> complete the certification. Initially, most of the hardware, OS, and programming sections were largely IBM-oriented. By the mid-1980s, these sections included references to DEC, UNIX, and other operating systems, vendors, or standards.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the boys}} must pass seven final exams to graduate. Anmar, Hyder and Ali each fail two subjects, and are given the option <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the exams. Anmar passes the retakes and aspires to study English {{literature}} in college, and his family decide to move to the safer region of Arbul now that he has graduated. Hyder also retakes his exams and passes, but his family {{can no longer afford to}} pay for the university fees. Ali chooses not <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the exams, and his family leave Iraq. Mohammad fails four subjects and must repeat his senior year. He chooses to do so at a different school while working at his uncle's scooter repair shop. As the documentary closes, it notes that during the year of filming, two of the boys' classmates were killed, six were kidnapped, and seventy-five left Iraq.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and those of Parliament, Dartmouth initially sided with Parliament. In 1643, Prince Maurice besieged and took the town, whose defences proved vulnerable to a landward attack.

5|$|Early the {{following}} morning, Varley {{was promoted to}} brigadier and took over as commander of the 22nd Brigade from Taylor, who was taken ill. In Varley's place, Major Charles O'Brien, who had previously been the battalion second-in-command, took over command of the battalion. After a brief lull in the fighting in the 22nd Brigade's sector, the Japanese 18th Division attacked again, attempting to take the brigade on its left flank. In response, the 2/18th was sent <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> some of the high ground south-east of the Ulu Pandan and Reformatory Roads late in the afternoon. Attacking with about 60 men, supported by three British armoured cars and artillery fire, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the position after the light failed. The Japanese then pressed heavily against the 22nd Brigade's position, and {{they were forced to}} give ground, falling back to the junction of Buona Vista and Holland Roads, by which time the 2/18th was down to only 250 men.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} year, the sisters trained before moving south {{to defend against}} any American attempt <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the Mariana Islands or the Philippines. Shōkaku was sunk by an American {{submarine}} during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the Americans invaded the Marianas and Zuikaku was sacrificed as a decoy four months later during the Battle of Cape Engano.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> the islands.|$|E

50|$|In 1663, the Dutch {{returned}} <b>to</b> Keelung, <b>retook</b> the fort, strengthened and enlarged it {{and kept}} it until 1668, when they voluntarily gave it up, as the trade in Keelung was not what they expected it to be.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} years of Basil I's reign, Arab raids on the coasts of Dalmatia were {{successfully}} repelled, and the region once again came under secure Byzantine control. This enabled Byzantine missionaries to penetrate to the interior and convert the Serbs and the principalities of modern-day Herzegovina and Montenegro to Orthodox Christianity. An attempt <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> Malta ended disastrously, however, when the local population sided with the Arabs and massacred the Byzantine garrison.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul.

The Eighth Army, battered by the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> lost ground and keep the retreating Chinese forces {{from being able to}} rest.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August, the Serbs {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>retake</b> Šabac, {{but their}} efforts failed.

The communists made additional gains during the year, but failed to overwhelm government forces.|$|E
50|$|The castle was {{eventually}} {{surrendered to the}} Norwegian king, who in turn granted it to Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí, one of his steadfast supporters in the Hebrides.
