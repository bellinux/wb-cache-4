This system is a boon for remote monitoring and automatic <b>tariff</b> <b>updating.</b> This system gives the information regarding meter reading, power cut, total load used and tempering on request or regularly in particular interval through SMS. This information is being sent and received by concerned energy Provider Company with the help of Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) network. Hence this system not only reduces the labor cost and also increase meter reading accuracy and saves both time and money...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the regulatory changes {{proposed for the}} telecommunications sector in Brazil regarding interconnection and unbundling policies. We summarize these policies after the privatization of Telebras, between 1998 and 2005, to be more able to evaluate the reform proposed for 2006, which we divide in nine main topics. They are 1) {{the adoption of the}} methodology of long run incremental cost - LRIC - as a parameter for tariff setting in interconnection, 2) the complementar use of a Fully Allocated Pricing mechanism for the sake of distributing common costs, 3) the abandonment, in practice, of the price cap regime, 4) the introduction of ties among interconnection and end user tariffs, 5) the replacement of the current tariff index (the IGP-DI) by the "Índice de Atualização de Tarifas" - <b>Tariff</b> <b>Updating</b> Index" (IST), 6) the new mechanic for the calculus of the discount factor "X", 7) the introduction of the "significative market power" concept, 8) the transition to a full Bill and Keep" system and 9) the effective use of "unbundling". ...|$|R
50|$|Water tariffs are {{set by the}} Ministry of National Infrastructure and Ministry of Finance, and {{approved}} by the Knesset Finance Committee. <b>Tariffs</b> are <b>updated</b> from time to time according to changes in the Consumer Price Index, electricity rates and the average wage index. The rates vary according to use: domestic, consumption and services, industry and agriculture. Rates for industrial and agricultural use are lower than those for domestic consumption and services. The bulk water tariff is the same throughout the country, regardless of the difference in supply costs.|$|R
40|$|Consumers {{choosing}} fixed-rate contracts {{tend to have}} insufficient usage {{to warrant}} the cost, particularly for new products. We propose and estimate a Bayesian learning model of tariff and usage choice that explains this “flat-rate bias” without relying on behavioral misjudgments or tariff-specific preferences. Consumers face both idiosyncratic and aggregate uncertainty since utility varies across consumers and the mean is unknown. Aggregate uncertainty inflates prior variances causing consumers to heavily weight private signals. Consumers with high posteriors are therefore overly optimistic. Although posteriors are unbiased across products, this productlevel bias conditional on one’s posterior (i. e., “conditional bias”) arises for each product, thereby explaining the flat-rate bias. The consequences of conditional bias are exacerbated by switching costs that deter consumers from changing <b>tariffs</b> after <b>updating</b> their beliefs. We demonstrate the effects of uncertainty and switching costs on tariff choices and assess the pricing implications. We find tariff menus are ineffective screening devices for price discrimination by an online grocer. Predicted revenues increase by 20 percent when the per-use tariff is dropped...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the most}} recent <b>updated</b> <b>tariff</b> rates were assumed to be valid in the years following. Thus, if country j {{reported}} a tariff rate x for HS 8703 in year t, then this rate was applied in years t[*]+[*] 1 and t[*]−[*] 1 in cases {{where there was no}} other tariff rate present. If there was a change of tariff rate x to tariff rate z in year t[*]+[*] 1, the tariff rate z was applied in t[*]+[*] 1 and all years following it. If the tariff rate x was introduced and came into effect in year t[*]−[*] 1, but tariff rate y was applied in all years before year t[*]−[*] 1, then the tariff rate x applies in year t[*]−[*] 1 and all years following it. A value of 1 was added to all tariff rates so that logarithms could be applied.|$|R
40|$|Incluye BibliografíaAbstractUsing a GTAP CGE model/database, {{this paper}} assesses the {{possible}} {{effects of a}} free trade agreement (FTA); between the MERCOSUR and the European Union (EU);. The study takes into consideration the most important recent free trade agreements signed among the Latin American countries, as well as the latest European Union enlargements. With a 2004 + benchmark base scenario where <b>tariffs</b> were <b>updated</b> by the addition of information on trade agreements just signed by Latin American countries, two different policy simulations are addressed: (i); full liberalization, (ii); liberalization excluding sensitive products. The global CGE model allows analyzing direct and indirect socio-economic impacts on subscriber countries as well as on other countries in the region. From {{the point of view of}} the MERCOSUR countries, the results suggest that the FTA would be beneficial to foster their exports, especially in the case of Light manufactures. Imports to MERCOSUR from the EU would be increased, particularly in heavy manufactures sectors. In terms of GDP the results remain positive in the case of all the MERCOSUR countries in all simulated scenarios. However, welfare implications are unevenly distributed in favor of all the MERCOSUR countries in the simulated scenarios. The inclusion of sensitive products in the agreements seems to reduce the magnitude of the results but does not change the direction of the impacts. In any case, active public policies to mitigate the negative effects on sectors, enhance positive impacts and seize dynamic opportunities towards sustainable development must be undertaken. The main conclusion points out a potential complementary trade relationship among these two regions...|$|R
40|$|In the {{recently}} proposed real-time incentives (RTI) fisheries management approach fishers would be allocated fishing-impact credits ('RTIs') to spend according to spatiotemporally varying tariffs. RTI-quota and tariffs {{would be based}} on commercial stock targets, and <b>tariffs</b> could be <b>updated</b> based on real-time CPUE data. The fisher could dynamically choose how to spend his RTIs, e. g. by limited fishing in sensitive areas and fishing longer in less sensitive areas. Using a conceptual simulation framework we explore the feasibility of RTI-management given potential responses by fishermen and {{have a look at the}} internal dynamics of the system. In particular, we consider various tactical decision-making strategies that may be used by fishermen to optimise their fishing activities within the system. In addition, we explore RTI-management in the context of the classical mixed-fisheries problem, where restricting fishing mortality of a vulnerable "choke" species could unnecessarily restrict fishing on other species. We find that the adaptive management explicit in the RTI-system can, in principle, cope with various forms of tactical fisher behaviour, even misreporting, and that the system responds in a coherent and understandable way. We show that RTI-management can, in principle, to a large extent overcome the classical mixed-fisheries problem, since the fishing mortality of a "choke" species can be controlled while simultaneously allowing fishing opportunity for other species. We discuss our findings as a first step of explorations needed towards testing the RTI-system in the context of its practical implementation. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
40|$|The current energy {{models and}} {{infrastructures}} {{need to be}} restructured in order to face the changes in energy consumption, production and management. The adoption of renewable power sources combined with the capability of a more reasonable and autonomous participation on the grid lead to this energy revolution. These changes demand improvements in the way participants act, not only related to the physical electricity grid, but mainly regarding the related services, as energy markets. Since there is no real-life market to test new approaches for smart grid markets, simulations should be used. This work focus on the PowerTAC simulation framework, a top-of-the-art platform in which competitors develop broker agents to enact market companies. In this context, the tariff composition problem plays a fundamental role since customers (both real and simulated) interact with the market by selecting a tariff. Brokers should seek for creating and <b>updating</b> <b>tariffs</b> to be competitive and still profitable. Broker's performance is given by its market share and profit on the market. Current competitors use a centralized approach, with focus on single features to compose tariffs. In this work an alternative approach to this problem is presented. We propose {{the creation of a}} Broker that is inherently a Multi-Agent System - a broker composed by different specialist agents that evaluate different features to compose the final tariff. To validate the results from our work we will analyse the results from the participation of our broker on the PowerTAC, firstly in a local version of the competition against previous years public competitors and secondly, by trying to qualify to the annual competition...|$|R
40|$|In 2014, {{a series}} of reforms, called as the Health Sector Evolution Plan (HSEP), was {{launched}} in the health system of Iran in a stepwise process. HSEP was mainly based on the fifth 5 -year health development national strategies (2011 - 2016). It included different interventions to: increase population coverage of basic health insurance, increase quality of care in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) affiliated hospitals, reduce out-of-pocket (OOP) payments for inpatient services, increase quality of primary healthcare, launch updated relative value units (RVUs) of clinical services, and <b>update</b> <b>tariffs</b> to more realistic values. The reforms resulted in extensive social reaction and different professional feedback. The official monitoring program shows general public satisfaction. However, there are some concerns for sustainability of the programs and equity of financing. Securing financial sources and fairness of the financial contribution to the new programs are the main concerns of policy-makers. Healthcare providers’ concerns (as powerful and influential stakeholders) potentially threat the sustainability and efficiency of HSEP. Previous experiences on extending health insurance coverage show that they {{can lead to a}} regressive healthcare financing and threat financial equity. To secure financial sources and to increase fairness, the contributions of people to new interventions should be progressive by their income and wealth. A specific progressive tax would be the best source, however, since it is not immediately feasible, a stepwise increase in the progressivity of financing must be followed. Technical concerns of healthcare providers (such as nonplausible RVUs for specific procedures or nonefficient insurance-provider processes) should be addressed through proper revision(s) while nontechnical concerns (which are derived from conflicting interests) must be responded through clarification and providing transparent information. The requirements of HSEP and especially the key element of progressive tax should be considered properly in the coming sixth national development plan (2016 - 2021) ...|$|R
