5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries are infected with the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1963, North Borneo {{attained}} self-government. The Cobbold Commission {{was set up}} in 1962 {{to determine}} whether the people of Sabah and Sarawak favoured the proposed union of the Federation of Malaysia, and found that the union was generally favoured by <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>Most</b> ethnic community leaders of Sabah, namely, Mustapha Harun representing the native Muslims, Donald Stephens representing the non-Muslim natives, and Khoo Siak Chew representing the Chinese, would eventually support the union. After discussion culminating in the Malaysia Agreement and 20-point agreement, on 16 September 1963 North Borneo (as Sabah) was united with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore, to form the independent Federation of Malaysia.|$|E

Within 24 hours Rwandan military advisors living in Kinshasa were unceremoniously flown out. <b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> alarmed by this order were the Banyamulenge Tutsi of eastern Congo.

The Washington Post reported on February 22, 2017 Scott Pruitt's potential special interests with the fossil fuel industry as he began his term as the appointed head of the EPA under the Trump administration.

25|$|The 21st century did {{not begin}} well for North Melbourne. Its decade-long onfield potency was in decline, {{questions}} were raised about its financial position and long-term sustainability. Furthermore, three of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> important to the club's success in the 1990s left the club under acrimonious circumstances: CEO Greg Miller left the club, captain Wayne Carey left prior to the 2002 season following an extramarital affair with the wife of teammate and vice captain Anthony Stevens, coach Denis Pagan was lured to Carlton {{at the end of}} 2002. Pagan was replaced by 1996 premiership player Dean Laidley, who had previously been an Assistant Coach at Collingwood from 1999 until the end of season 2002.|$|E
25|$|During the {{recession}} of 2008, SNAP participation hit an all-time high. Arguing in support for SNAP, the Food Research and Action Center argued that “putting more resources quickly {{into the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> likely to turn around and spend it can both boost the economy and cushion the hardships on vulnerable people who face a constant struggle against hunger.” Researchers have found that every $1 that is spent from SNAP results in $1.73 of economic activity. In California, the cost-benefit ratio is even higher: for every $1 spent from SNAP between $3.67 to $8.34 is saved in health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office also rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting growth and jobs in a weak economy.|$|E

500|$|Ibn Rusta was {{the first}} to record a variant of the Hungarians' self-designation; (al-Madjghariyya). According to a {{scholarly}} theory, the ethnonym [...] "Magyar" [...] is a composite word. The first part of the word (magy-) {{is said to have been}} connected to several recorded or hypothetical words, including the Mansi's self-designation (māńśi) and a reconstructed Ugric word for man (*mańća). The second part (-er or -ar) may have developed from a reconstructed Finno-Ugrian word for man or boy (*irkä) or from a Turkic word with a similar meaning (eri or iri). Alan W. Ertl writes that the ethnonym was initially the name of a smaller group, the Megyer tribe; it developed into an ethnonym because Megyer was the most powerful tribe within <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>Most</b> scholars agree that the Hungarian exonym and its variants were derived from the Onogurs' name. This form started spreading in Europe with Slavic mediation.|$|E
500|$|Lafayette's {{reputation}} in France is more problematic. Thomas Gaines, {{in his book}} about Lafayette, noted that the response to Lafayette's death was far more muted in France than in America, and suggested that {{this may have been}} because Lafayette was the last surviving hero of America's only revolution, whereas the evolution of the French government has been far more chaotic. Lafayette's role, especially in the French Revolution, created a more nuanced picture of him in French historiography. To the 19th century historian Jules Michelet, Lafayette was a [...] "mediocre idol", lifted by the mob far beyond what his talents deserved. In their Histoire et dictionnaire de la Révolution française, Jean Tulard, Jean-François Fayard, and Alfred Fierro noted Napoleon's deathbed comment about Lafayette that, if Napoleon had had Lafayette's place during the French Revolution, [...] "the king would still be sitting on his throne". They called Napoleon's comment [...] "not too excessive" [...] and deemed Lafayette [...] "an empty-headed political dwarf [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> responsible for the destruction of the French monarchy". Gaines disagreed, and noted that liberal and Marxist historians have also dissented from that view of Lafayette. As Lloyd Kramer related in a survey of the French public, just before the Revolution's bicentennial in 1989, 57 percent deemed Lafayette the figure from the Revolution they most admired, with Marat and Saint-Just tying for second with 21 percent each: [...] "he [...] clearly had more French supporters in the early 1990s than he could muster in the early 1790s".|$|E

500|$|Breakout {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{earning a}} collective score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic. Heather Phares of Allmusic commented that Breakout title expresses its [...] "purpose nicely" [...] though {{the music was}} not drastically different from Hannah Montana's, adding, [...] "only a handful of songs truly break out from the Montana mold". Though not being impressed by [...] "nothing [...] left to chance", she concluded, [...] "Even if these songs are derivative of much more established pop divas ] and , they provide clues {{to the kind of}} company Cyrus aims to keep. And while Breakout isn't as much of a breakthrough as it could be, it still moves Miley closer to an identity and career outside of Hannah." [...] Kerri Mason of Billboard wrote, [...] "While it's still age-appropriate for minors, Breakout is for the big kids too" [...] and complimented Cyrus for being a [...] "natural-born popstar." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe felt Cyrus mostly succeeded while [...] "trying to please most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> of the time" [...] on Breakout. She summarized, [...] "With Breakout, Cyrus has clearly made a choice to break from the shiny, happy 'Hannah Montana' character, but she hasn't scuffed her sound up so much that her fans won't recognize that she's just being Miley." [...] Chris William of Entertainment Weekly graded the album a B and noted that {{the first half of the}} album was [...] "fun" [...] but the second half became [...] "overly ballad-heavy," [...] assuming that was the more mature side of Cyrus she had promised. Miakel Wood of the Los Angeles Times stated, [...] "In that respect, Breakout is unlikely fodder for the razzle-dazzle road shows and 3-D concert films to come. As a portrait of the artist as a young malcontent, though, it's rarely less than fascinating." ...|$|E

[...] Hunters try to be silent and, though many hunters wear reflective clothing {{so as not to}} become targets for other hunters, they try to hide their movements so as not to startle game. Most bear attacks result from hunters suddenly appearing in front of them, startling a bear into an instinctive act of aggression.|$|E

2500|$|The Scottish {{government}} and pro-independence campaigners {{said that a}} democratic deficit existed in Scotland because the UK was a unitary state {{that did not have}} a codified constitution. The SNP also described the unelected House of Lords as an [...] "affront to democracy". The [...] "democratic deficit" [...] label has sometimes been used to refer to the period between the 1979 and 1997 UK general elections, during which the Labour Party held a majority of Scottish seats but the Conservative Party governed the whole of the UK. Alex Salmond said in September 2013 that instances such as this amounted to a lack of democracy, and that [...] "the people who live and work in Scotland are <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> likely to make the right choices for Scotland". In January 2012, Patrick Harvie said: [...] "Greens have a vision of a more radical democracy in Scotland, with far greater levels of discussion and decision making at community level." [...] The Scottish Government intended that an independent Scotland should have a written constitution which [...] "expresses our values, embeds the rights of our citizens and sets out clearly how our institutions of state interact with each other and serve the people".|$|E
2500|$|Dutch {{social and}} {{political}} life became divided by fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three separate parts based on religion. [...] The economy was not affected. One of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>most</b> responsible for designing pillarization was Abraham Kuyper (1837–1920), a leading politician, Protestant theologian, and journalist. Kuyper established orthodox Calvinist organizations, and also provided a theoretical framework by developing such concepts as [...] "sphere-sovereignty" [...] that celebrated Dutch society as a society of organized minorities. Verzuiling ("pillarization" [...] or [...] "pluralism") after 1850 became {{the solution to the}} danger of internal conflict. Everyone was part of one (and only one) pillar (zuil) based chiefly on religion (Protestant, Catholic, secular). The secular pillar eventually split into a socialist/working class pillar and a liberal (pro-business) secular pillar. Each pillar built a full set of its own social organizations, including churches (for the religious pillars), political parties, schools, universities, labor unions, sport clubs, boy scout unions and other youth clubs, and newspapers. The members of different zuilen lived in close proximity in cities and villages, spoke the same language, and did business with one another, but seldom interacted informally and rarely intermarried. [...] In politics Kuyper formed the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) in 1879, and headed it until 1905.|$|E
