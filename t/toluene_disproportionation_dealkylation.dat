40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of toluene {{alkylation}} with methanol was performed over pure HZSM- 5, mordenite/ZSM- 5 (hybrid of mordenite and HZSM- 5), and ZM 13 (composite mixture of HZSM- 5 and MCM- 41 at pH 13). Experimental runs were conducted using a batch fluidized bed reactor at temperatures of 300, 350 and 400 °C and reaction times of 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 20. s. The rate of toluene methylation and <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> were studied {{on the three}} catalysts (toluene alkylation is usually accompanied by <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> on acid catalyst). Based on the results obtained, a simplified power law kinetic model consisting of three reactions was developed to estimate {{the activation energies of}} <b>toluene</b> methylation and <b>disproportionation</b> simultaneously. Coke formation on catalysts was accounted for using both reaction time and reactant conversion decay functions. All parameters were estimated based on quasi-steady state approximation. Estimated kinetic parameters were in good agreement with experimental results. The order of alkylation ability of the catalysts was found to be ZM 13 > HZSM- 5 > mordenite/ZSM- 5, while the reverse is for <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> (mordenite/ZSM- 5 > HZSM- 5 > ZM 13). Thus, alkylation of toluene is most favorable on ZM 13 due to combined effect of mesoporosity induced through its synthetic route and acid content.

40|$|Since {{distillation}} {{is still}} the most widely used separation technique used in the petrochemical industry, optimisation of these unit operations are important to minimise costs and maximise production. This thesis focuses on the development of a tool using rigorous non-equilibrium distillation models to optimise complex columns. Non-equilibrium distillation models are usually avoided in optimisation studies due to the time required to solve them, but this has been overcome by using a technique called orthogonal collocation in which the profiles in the columns are represented by polynomials of a lower order than would be required normally. This significantly reduces the process times and makes the use of non-equilibrium models a possibility in optimisation studies. The orthogonal collocation technique was applied to a packed distillation column model and shown to be effective in modelling the system. A system consisting of a distillation column with integrated external side reactors was chosen as a case study to investigate the use of the methods. These systems {{have been shown to be}} effective in certain circumstances in literature, when comparing them to other forms of process intensification, such as reactive distillation. The <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> reaction was considered as a potential use for the technology and the optimisation tool was used to find optimum system configurations for achieving maximum toluene conversions and minimum costs. Nonlinear programming techniques were used initially to optimise these systems, but due to the discontinuities associated with multiple side streams, they were replaced by a genetic algorithm. Various system configurations were identified as achieving maximum conversions and minimum costs. These results were used in a comparison with results obtained from a literature study and the results showed significant promise. Unfortunately, the two studies did not have enough in common to truly produce a comprehensive result. This iv lead to further comparisons with another system using the same information. The results obtained in the <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> case study showed that there was some possible benefits for using the side reactor systems, but the conventional system was still 30 and 60 % cheaper in terms of capital and utility costs respectively. Another case study was investigated that looked at the synthesis of methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol. The packed collocation model was used as a comparison with another investigation performed in literature (using equilibrium distillation models). Both showed comparable results, but still had significant differences. Costs were also compared between the side reactor system and a more conventional system for methyl acetate synthesis. The side reactor systems were found to be more cost effective than the conventional system. Additionally, an increase in the number of external reactors resulted in lower utility costs (mainly as a result of lower flow rates in the side streams). Overall, the reaction and process conditions are important considerations when deciding whether or not to use a side reactor system. For the gas phase <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> reaction, the side reactor systems were not cost effective, when compared to the conventional system. However, the liquid phase methyl acetate reaction proved to be more conducive to side reactor systems in terms of cost. This thesis has shown the applicability of using rigorous disequilibrium distillation models in optimisation studies. The side reactor systems have been found to be complex systems that require a holistic approach to find optimum configurations instead of optimising individual process units...|$|R

The catalytic activity of zeolite for the toluene alkylation is approximately proportional {{to the number of}} its mid-strength acidic sites, except for SAPO- 34 with small channels and MOR with strong acidity. Moreover, the acidic sites for catalyzing toluene alkylation are weaker in strength than those for catalyzing <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation,</b> but slightly stronger than those for catalyzing the reaction of methanol to hydrocarbons. On the other hand, zeolites with 12 -membered ring channels may lead to the further alkylation of xylene and the rapid deactivation by coking. Zeolites with 8 -membered ring channels restrict toluene alkylation, only favorable for forming non-aromatic hydrocarbons. As a result, zeolites with 10 -membered ring channels and mid-strength acidity show high catalytic selectivity and activity for methylation of toluene. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|The {{influences}} of carrier gases on catalytic activity {{and stability of}} zeolites in monoalkylbenzene disproportionation reaction have {{been the focus of}} several studies [9, 15, 16, 17, 18] in which hydrogen (H 2) and nitrogen (N 2) were the two most popular candidates for the study of CGE (carrier gas effect). For example, the effect of H 2 carrier gas on catalytic activity has been reported by Gnep and Guisnet [15] for toluene conversion on mordenite zeolite and for ethylbenzene disproportionation on 0.2  wt% Pt/LaNaX zeolite. The decrease in catalytic activity is attributed either due to the decrease in the concentration of intermediate benzylic carbocations [15, 16] or the decrease in Brønsted acidity; both interpretations need the activation of molecular H 2. Schulz-Ekloff et al. [17] investigated the variations of the catalyst conversion rate in the existence of different carrier gases.

The authors disclosed that the degree of conversion during cumene disproportionation on zeolite beta follows the trend N 2  > H 2  > He > CO 2, whereas order was reverse for catalytic stability.|$|R

Ed. 2003, 42, 1156 – 1159, it should have been made clear early on in the manuscript that the synthesis of the ITQ- 13 material was first reported in a patent published in 2002 (T. Boix, M. Puche, M. A. Camblor, A. Corma, US Patent 6 471941 B 1, 2002; reference [12] in the manuscript). Furthermore, owing to an editorial error the reference to this patent was wrongly introduced into the Experimental Section, where reference [13] should read reference [12] and viceversa. We apologize to our readers and to the authors of the above mentioned patent if this mistake has resulted in any misunderstanding". ZSM- 5 (MFI code) is a medium-pore zeolite that has 10 -ring channels with pore diameters of 5. 1 × 5. 5 and 5. 3 × 5. 6 Å, and has been a very successful zeolite for shape-selective catalysis that has found many industrial applications. By considering the structure of ZSM- 5 and the catalytic results obtained in the fields of oil refining and petrochemistry, one could intuitively predict that a medium-pore zeolite with intersecting channels and pore dimensions that are slightly smaller than those of ZSM- 5 should enhance the possibilities for shape-selective catalysis in the fields of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) additives, catalytic dewaxing, <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation,</b> alkylation of aromatics, isomerization of alkylaromatics, and so forth. Herein, we will describe such a zeolite structure (ITQ- 13), which exhibits three sets of intercrossed medium-pore channels; a 9 -ring channel, with a pore aperture of 4. 0 × 4. 9 Å, runs parallel to the crystallographic a axis, a 10 -ring channel system (4. 8 × 5. 7 Å) runs parallel to the c axis, and another 10 -ring set of channels (4. 7 × 5. 1 Å) runs parallel to the b axis.

30|$|Kinetic runs {{were carried}} out in the region free of inter-particle {{diffusion}} effects. This was established by runs carried out with constant W/F (space time expressed as grams of catalyst per hour per mole) but varying liquid feed rates. In the case of zeolite-catalyzed reactions two types of diffusion process are considered: (i) macro-pore between the catalyst pellet particles; and (ii) micro-pore inside the zeolite channels. The above experiments for finding the inter-particle diffusion region show only the absence of film diffusion. Since the channel dimensions of modified zeolite are comparable to those of reactant ethylbenzene and product di-ethylbenzenes and benzene, micro-pore diffusion resistance cannot be avoided. Similar kinetic studies were reported for toluene ethylation [20], isomerization of ethylbenzene and m-xylene [22], <b>disproportionation</b> of <b>toluene</b> [23, 24], methylation of <b>toluene</b> [25] and <b>disproportionation</b> ethylbenzene [26, 27, 28].|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis was conducted over {{a total of three}} years during the period October 1990 to October 1994, and is the sole work of the author, unless indicated otherwise by reference. A series of mildly dealuminated Y zeolites has been prepared by hydrothermal treatment using a low partial pressure of water vapour. These materials, together with samples previously dealuminated under more severe conditions, were characterised by the temperature programmed desorption of ammonia and the catalytic activity for suitable test reactions. Advances in technique permitted simultaneous monitoring of both the deammoniation and dehydroxylation processes. Interesting features were observed in the dehydroxylation traces which were related to changes in the acid site strength and amount of extraframework aluminium. The activity for both n-hexane cracking and <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> reaches a maximum, corresponding to a framework concentration of 25 - 30 structural aluminium atoms per unit cell, consistent with the maximum number of strong acid sites. Slight deviation from this behaviour was noted, with the mildly steamed catalysts having lower activities than would be expected {{on the basis of their}} framework compositions alone. An in-depth analysis of the cracking of n-hexane has revealed that the extent of reaction is also critically dependent on the density of the available acid sites, which is explained in terms of the reaction mechanism. The <b>disproportionation</b> of <b>toluene</b> has highlighted differences in the nature of the extrastructural aluminium. The catalytic activity of the materials is either decreased or enhanced on extraction depending on whether the catalysts have been prepared by mild or severe dealumination. Variations in product distribution with time on stream have been observed and accounted for by changes in the reaction. The lifetime and activity profile of the catalyst could be altered by exposure of the catalyst to small amounts of toluene prior to the main reaction. This supports the concept of active coke enhancing this reaction. Cumene dealkylation was found to proceed on weaker acid sites than the cracking of n-hexane and the <b>disproportionation</b> of <b>toluene,</b> although a maximum in activity was still observed. This indicates that the weakest sites are not capable of catalysing this reaction, and that some heterogeneity of site strength exists between strong and weak acid sites. The dehydration of propan- 2 - 01 was confirmed as a reaction which assesses the total number of acid sites, regardless of strength. However, changes in the selectivity of the products with the strength of the acid sites were found, implying that the formation of di-isopropylether is favoured by strong sites. Deliberate coking of the catalyst surface by exposure to propan- 2 - 01 at elevated temperatures was found to increase the measured activity, in addition to changing the selectivity almost entirely in favour of propene. Extraframework aluminium was found to play an important role in all of the reactions studied. This emphasises the view that although structural aluminium has the larger influence on the overall activity of a catalyst for a particular reaction, the nature of the extraframework aluminium cannot be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{progress}} in chemical reaction engineering and highly active, multi-functional catalysts, the activation of relatively inert alkanes may be achieved. The direct use of short-chain alkanes, especially methane and ethane, as basic chemical feedstocks represents an attractive alternative to alkenes. Significant reserves of alkanes {{are found in}} nature {{in the form of}} wet natural gas, whereas alkenes have to be synthesized via other chemical reactions. The activation of alkanes can be achieved by oxidative and non-oxidative methods. Reactions of oxidative activation are often thermodynamically favored, e. g., due to formation of the stable but economically unattractive by-products water and/or carbon dioxide. In contrast, reactions of non-oxidative activation may produce hydrogen as a valuable by-product, but the equilibrium conversions of such reactions are generally low, and thus, measures have been taken to improve this situation, e. g., shifting equilibrium by removing a product. The alkylation of aromatics with alkanes, in particular, represents a potential new route for the synthesis of important feedstock chemicals such as n-propylbenzene and cumene, ethyltoluenes, and ethylbenzene. Estimates for current worldwide annual production capacities of ethylbenzene and cumene, the two most important chemicals produced by alkylation of aromatics, amount to 25 · 106 t·a- 1 and 10 · 106 t·a- 1, respectively. Conventional alkylating agents, including alkenes, alcohols and alkyl halides, have to be pre-synthesized via other processes, typically from an alkane feedstock. Alternatively, the direct alkylation of aromatics with alkanes may result in reduced costs and process intensification, since alkanes are much cheaper than other typical alkylating agents, abundantly available and pre-synthesis steps can be avoided. Therefore, the focus of the present work has been the heterogeneously catalyzed activation of ethane by direct application of ethane as an alkylating agent during toluene dehydroalkylation to ethyltoluenes on noble metal-loaded zeolite catalysts. Due to the thermodynamic stability of ethane, the desired reaction is strongly limited by equilibrium. Therefore, during the present work efforts were concentrated on experimental work in conjunction with theoretical modeling in order to better understand and hence improve the yield to the title reaction. The effect of pressure was investigated by a non-ideal gas model complemented by kinetic assumptions. At 300 °C, the thermodynamic model is in agreement with experimental results. However, at 350 °C conversions are well over the expected values calculated from the same model. The “supra-equilibrium” {{may be due to the}} formation of hydrogen-rich methane, acting as a hydrogen sink, hence shifting equilibrium towards the formation of ethyltoluenes. This was attributed to the consumption of hydrogen as a result of methane formation. Since methane is mainly formed by consumption of hydrogen, i. e., it is a secondary reaction, the space velocity was varied to improve selectivity to the title reaction. At a high space velocity, the formation of methane can be entirely avoided. Furthermore, the <b>disproportionation</b> of <b>toluene</b> is also absent, resulting in 100 % selectivity to ethyltoluenes and hydrogen. Decreasing the space velocity results in an increase in conversions as well as the yield of ethyltoluenes. However, at space velocities lower than about 3. 0 h- 1, the selectivity to ethyltoluenes decreases since the <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> reaction can compete with the dehydroalkylation reaction. With increasing conversion, C 1 to C 4 alkanes are also formed to a larger extent, as well as other aromatics including benzene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene. A maximum yield of ethyltoluenes is observed at a conversion of 13 % at 90 h on stream and medium space velocities. It is suggested that this maximum is a result of secondary reactions of ethyltoluenes. Hydrocracking experiments confirm that methane forms mainly from secondary reactions of products or reactants. A noble metal is required for a dehydroalkylation catalyst with good activity. However, the noble metal can also promote undesired side reactions including hydrocracking or hydrogenolysis and, mainly, the hydrodealkylation of the reactants and products. Although on Pt/H-ZSM- 5 catalysts the highest toluene conversion is observed, on Pd/H-ZSM- 5 the highest yields to ethyltoluenes can be achieved. This is as a result of Pd being less active for hydrodealkylation. Hence, further experiments in the membrane reactor were carried out using a Pd/H-ZSM- 5 catalyst. Since high selectivity to the desired products can be achieved, the ultimate goal of increased yields can be achieved by improving conversion. This was attempted by application of a membrane reactor, which may improve yields by selectively removing a product and hence shifting equilibrium. Prior to catalytic experiments in a membrane reactor, a model was developed applying fundamental thermodynamics in order to gauge the maximum attainable shift in equilibrium by the selective removal of hydrogen in a membrane reactor. The model considers chemical reaction equilibrium and simultaneously the hydrogen partial pressure equilibrium across the membrane. From the viewpoint of hydrogen recovery, the molar flow of the sweep gas must be about 10 times higher than the molar flow of the alkane to ensure a high hydrogen recovery from the reactor. Under these conditions, an optimum shift in equilibrium can be achieved with a minimum dilution of the hydrogen on the sweep side. Dehydroalkylation reactions show interesting advantages in comparison to, more widely studied, dehydrogenation reactions. Since dehydrogenation reactions typically result in a net increase in the number of moles, low pressure is favored. However, for the membrane reactor, removal of hydrogen means that high conversions can still be maintained at high pressure. However, in the case of dehydroalkylation of toluene with ethane, the number of moles does not change. Thus, in a membrane reactor an increase in conversion can be achieved at higher pressures since more hydrogen can permeate at higher pressure. However, there is a limit to which the equilibrium can be shifted, depending on the thermodynamics of the given reaction. The model suggested here may be applied to simply estimate optimum conditions for specific reactions in order to achieve the highest attainable conversions when applying membrane reactors. The modeling results are confirmed by experimental results. Experiments show that the dehydroalkylation of toluene with ethane can be successfully performed in a membrane reactor. Since the reaction is taking place under mild conditions, the catalytic performance of the bifunctional zeolite in the membrane reactor is stable with time on stream. Experiments demonstrate large improvements with tripled conversion and almost tripled yield to the desired ethyltoluenes by increasing the sweep gas flow rate and the pressure on the reaction side. Selectivity to methane and ethylbenzene, formed from hydrodealkylation reactions that consume hydrogen, is reduced. Increasing pressure has a positive effect on conversion since the net number of moles does not change during this reaction. However, at high pressure, the <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> reaction is dominant. Unfortunately, choosing a low contact time to successfully eliminate the <b>toluene</b> <b>disproportionation</b> is not possible here, since under such conditions the produced hydrogen is swept out of the reaction zone before it can permeate. Hence, a careful optimization of the catalyst and the reaction conditions in the membrane reactor is needed in order to achieve industrially relevant yields. Jüngste Fortschritte in der Reaktortechnik sowie die Entwicklung aktiver, multifunktionaler Katalysatoren ermöglichten die Aktivierung der relativ inerten leichten Alkane. Die Nutzung von kurzkettigen Alkanen, insbesondere von Methan und Ethan, als Ausgangsstoffe für die chemische Industrie bietet eine attraktive Alternative zu den herkömmlich verwendeten Alkenen. Beträchtliche Mengen an Alkanen findet man in Form von Erdgas, wogegen Alkene ausschließlich durch chemische Umsetzung gewonnen werden können. Die Aktivierung von Alkanen kann entweder oxidativ oder nicht oxidativ erfolgen. Die oxidative Aktivierung ist thermodynamisch begünstigt, führt jedoch zur Bildung der wertlosen und unerwünschten Nebenprodukte Wasser und Kohlendioxid. Dagegen kann bei der nicht oxidativen Aktivierung Wasserstoff als wertvolles Nebenprodukt gewonnen werden. Die Umsätze nicht oxidativer Reaktionen sind jedoch sehr gering. Durch das Verschieben des Gleichgewichts der Reaktion, z. B. durch Entfernen eines Reaktionsproduktes, können diese Nachteile abgemildert werden. Die Alkylierung von Aromaten mit Alkanen bietet eine neuartige Möglichkeit zur Herstellung wichtiger Grundchemikalien wie n-Propylbenzol, Cumol, Ethyltoluol und Ethylbenzol. Laut aktuellen Schätzungen beläuft sich die derzeitige Produktionskapazität von Ethylbenzol und Cumol, den beiden wichtigsten durch Alkylierung von Aromaten hergestellten Chemikalien, auf 25 · 106 t·a- 1 bzw. 10 · 106 t·a- 1. Herkömmliche Alkylierungsmittel, wie Alkene, Alkohole und Alkylhalogenide, müssen dabei in einem zusätzlichen Prozessschritt synthetisiert werden. Die direkte Alkylierung von Aromaten mit Alkanen würde daher zu einer erheblichen Kostensenkung und Prozessintensivierung führen, da Alkane preiswerter und leicht verfügbar sind und dadurch ein zusätzlicher Syntheseschritt vermieden werden kann. Aus diesem Grund wurde in der hier vorliegenden Arbeit die direkte Anwendung von Ethan als Alkylierungsmittel in der Dehydroalkylierung von Toluol zu Ethyltoluol an edelmetallhaltigen Zeolithen untersucht. Ethan befindet sich in einer thermodynamischen Senke. Die gewünschte Reaktion ist daher stark thermodynamisch limitiert. Experimentelle|$|R

The use of amines as precursors for initiators is also of interest due to their dispersant properties. Atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) was used to prepare statistical copolymers of n-Butyl methacrylate and C 12 / 15 methacrylate for use as VMs. These copolymers were first of a linear nature demonstrating that ATRP could be used to polymerise this monomer combination to give well defined polymers {{with a high degree of}} control. Thereafter, multi-functional initiators were used to synthesise core first stars with differing numbers of arms. Three, four, five and eight arm stars were successfully synthesised giving well defined polymers. These polymers were tested by Lubrizol for their viscometric properties. All were found to give significant improvements versus Lubrizol’s existing linear polymers in almost all respects. Although the core first stars gave a significant improvement in viscometric properties the costs of the core are relatively high for the application. Therefore the synthesis of arm first stars via ATRP was carried out. Design of experiment (DoE) was used to aid in the optimisation process and to interrelate any factors used in the design. The DoE process indicated two relationships between input factors, one of which was defined numerically. A range of polymers were synthesised on a larger scale for testing by Lubrizol for their viscometric properties. The polymers were found to have exceptional viscosity properties, compared to the baseline sample. The use of amines as precursors for initiators (forming amide initiators) was investigated. 4 -Aminodiphenylamine (ADPA) was synthesised into an initiator suitable for ATRP and used in several polymerisations. It was found to have very low initiator efficiency. For this reason Single Electron Transfer Living Radical Polymerisation (SET-LRP) was employed to polymerise methyl acrylate from this initiator with near 100 % initiator efficiency. A range of other amide initiators were also successfully used in polymerisations. A new solvent system for SET-LRP was also demonstrated. The addition of phenol to <b>toluene</b> promoted the <b>disproportionation</b> of Cu(I) allowing SETLRP to take place. Polymers were synthesised in this solvent mixture with high degrees of control over molecular weight with narrow Polydipersity indexs (PDI).
