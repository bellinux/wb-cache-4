5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E

25|$|Dr. David C. Lane {{proposes a}} {{checklist}} consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book, Exposing Cults: When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical. One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have {{high standards of}} moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret {{the behavior of a}} spiritual teacher by following Ockham's razor and by using common sense, and, should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior. Another point Lane makes is that <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> claim a guru makes, such as the claim to be God, <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> chance is that the guru is unreliable. Dr. Lane's fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus {{are likely to be more}} unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage.|$|E

25|$|As {{the fascination}} with six-day races {{spread across the}} Atlantic from its origins in the United Kingdom, their appeal to base {{instincts}} attracted large crowds.

To prepare for the event, Taylor went to Brooklyn, where he {{became a member of}} the South Brooklyn Wheelmen. An estimated crowd of 6,000 spectators attended the final day of the Madison Square Garden races in December 1896. During these long, grueling races, riders suffered delusions and hallucinations, which may have been caused by exhaustion, lack of sleep, or perhaps use of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Gru {{successfully}} shrinks and steals the Moon, {{and rushes}} back to Earth {{to attend the}} recital—only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's headquarters, Gru surrenders the Moon, but Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered {{that the effects of}} the shrink ray are temporary; <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> object's original size, the faster the shrinkage will wear off. As the Moon starts to expand in Vector's ship, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls just as the Moon explodes out of Vector's ship and launches itself back into orbit, with Vector trapped on it.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmopatic {{findings}} {{are more common}} but less severe in children (severe infiltrative exophthalmos is virtually unknown before mid-adolescence), but besides that, many of the typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism {{in children and adolescents}} are similar to those in adults. An important difference between children and adults with Graves' disease, is that children have not yet developed like adults have (psychological and physiological), and that they are a lot more dependent on their environment. The encephalopathy will have profound effects on children's developing personalities and developing relationship with their environment. Disturbments in bodily development further complicates matters. The consequences for the development and the somatic and psychological wellbeing of the child can be very radical and sometimes irreversible. The earlier a person is affected by thyroid disease, the more the development of personality is affected and <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> delay from their potential development level. The child gets behind in its cognitive, emotional and sexual growth, which, by itself, also influences its processing abilities of the endocrine disease.|$|E

25|$|A dyad is a two-person group; a triad is a three-person group. In a dyad {{a person}} is able to retain their individuality. There is no other person to shift {{the balance of the}} group thereby {{allowing}} those within the dyad to maintain their individuality. In the triad group there is a possibility of a dyad forming within the triad thereby threatening the remaining individual's independence and causing them to become the subordinate of the group. This seems to be an essential part of society which becomes a structure. Unfortunately as the group (structure) becomes increasingly greater the individual becomes separated and grows more alone, isolated and segmented. Simmel's view was somewhat ambiguous with respect to group size. On one hand he believed that <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> group the better for the individual. In a larger group it would be harder to exert control on individual, {{but on the other hand}} with a large group there is a possibility of the individual becoming distant and impersonal. Therefore, in an effort for the individual to cope with the larger group they must become a part of a smaller group such as the family.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> risk, <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E

500|$|As in the mayor's race, {{the contest}} for {{district}} attorney pitted a Democratic reformer, Richardson Dilworth, against {{a representative of}} the Republican machine, Michael A. Foley. Dilworth, like Clark, was a former Republican who had been advocating reform for several years. He had run for mayor unsuccessfully in 1947, with Clark as his campaign manager. In 1949, he was elected City Treasurer. Democratic Party leaders had intended Dilworth to be their candidate for mayor again in 1951, but when Clark announced his candidacy, Dilworth agreed to run for district attorney instead. Foley, a local attorney, had organization backing in the primary but had no success against the Democratic wave in the general election. Dilworth was unopposed in the primary. In November, Dilworth won by almost as large a margin as Clark, taking just shy of 58% of the vote. He told reporters that the victory had a [...] "sobering effect", adding: [...] "the bigger the victory, <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>the</b> responsibility".|$|E
