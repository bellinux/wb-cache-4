25|$|After the American Civil War, {{the western}} Mississippi Valley and the Great Plains to its west, where large fertile lands were available, {{resulted}} in expanding wheat farming. By this time, better <b>tillage</b> <b>equipment</b> was in use, railroads provided {{better access to}} world markets, better trading and warehousing facilities were facilitated, and more particularly introduction of hard winter was introduced. In the 1870s, Turkey red wheat, a hard variety of wheat, {{was introduced to the}} farmlands of Kansas by Russian Mennonite immigrants. This wheat variety spread quickly. New technology substantially enhanced productivity in the 19th century, as sowing with drills replaced broadcasting, cradles took the place of sickles, and the cradles in turn were replaced by reapers and binders. Steam-powered threshing machines superseded flails. By 1895, in Bonanza farms in the Dakotas, it took six different people and 36 horses pulling huge harvesters, working 10 hours a day, to produce 20,000 bushels. Following the invention of the steel roller mill in 1878, hard varieties of wheat such as Turkey Red became more popular than soft, which had been previously preferred because they were easier for grist mills to grind.|$|E

Furthermore, design optimization of soil <b>tillage</b> <b>equipments</b> under uncertainty seeks to design structures which should be both economic and reliable. The originality {{of this research is}} to develop an efficient methodology that controls the reliability levels for complex statistical distribution cases of random tillage forces. This developed strategy is based on design sensitivity concepts {{in order to determine the}} influence of each random parameter. The application of this method consists in taking into account the uncertainties on the soil tillage forces. The tillage forces are calculated in accordance with analytical model of McKyes and Ali with some modifications to include the effect of both soil–metal adhesion and tool speed. The different developments and applications show the importance of the developed method to improve the performance of the soil <b>tillage</b> <b>equipments</b> considering both random geometry and loading parameters. The developed method so-called OSF (Optimum Safety Factor) can satisfy a required reliability level without additional computing time relative to the deterministic design optimization study. Since the agricultural equipment parameters are extremely nonlinear, we extended the OSF approach to several nonlinear probabilistic distributions such as lognormal, uniform, Weibull and Gumbel probabilistic distribution laws...|$|R

For {{measuring the}} forces between the tractor and the mounted implements, three-point hitch dynamometers are used. In this research, an adjustable three-point hitch dynamometer with a draft capacity of 25 kN was designed and built which is made up from two frames {{that one of them}} placed inside the other. The force sensing elements were comprised of a loadcell that was installed between the frames. All mounted tillage implements were able to be tested by this measuring device excluding mounted implements which are powered by PTO and by using this dynamometer, the variations of implements draft force in the different tillage conditions consist of the various work depths and different forward speeds would be studied. After design and construction steps, dynamometer was calibrated, tested and evaluated. Field tests were done by using of four mounted tillage implements and obtained data were compared by obtained data from ASAE D 497. 5 standard formula.

A well directed choice of <b>tillage</b> <b>equipments</b> leads to a better soil protection and enables a higher fertility which is an important requirement for sustainable agriculture. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of different soil {{management systems}} on some physical and chemical properties and the crop production of these sandy soils. This study demonstrates the first results obtained from the year 2006, performed on the long-term land use experiment with the effects of three different factors (deep and shallow tillage; 17 and 28 cm, lime application; +Ca and –Ca and Farmyard manure; +FYM and –FYM) in Berlin-Dahlem (Germany), Humboldt University of Berlin and the ZALF experimental station at Dedelow (Germany) in 5 different tillage systems (no-tillage, mulch; 10 cm, cultivator; 15 cm, plough; 15 cm and plough; 25 cm). The soil heterogeneity were determined and evaluated with the computer program “Surfer” depending on the different depths of the sand and loam layers. The penetration resistances of both experimental fields showed that the deep tillage systems caused a higher compacted zone in deeper soil layers. It was found that there are significant differences in the soil aggregate stability and pH values between the shallow and deep tillage systems in Berlin-Dahlem. The pH values were significantly higher in the deep tillage systems. The soil organic matter contents were found higher in the deep tillage systems but there were no significant differences.

50|$|Flax {{grown for}} seed {{is allowed to}} mature until the seed {{capsules}} are yellow and just starting to split; it is then harvested in various ways. A combine harvester may either cut only {{the heads of the}} plants, or the whole plant. These are then dried to extract the seed. The amount of weeds in the straw affects its marketability, and this, coupled with market prices, determines whether the farmer chooses to harvest the flax straw. If the flax straw is not harvested, typically, it is burned, since the stalks are quite tough and decompose slowly (i.e., not in a single season). Formed into windrows from the harvesting process, the straw often clogs up <b>tillage</b> and planting <b>equipment.</b> Flax straw that is not of sufficient quality for fiber uses can be baled to build shelters for farm animals, or sold as biofuel, or removed from the field in the spring.|$|R
40|$|An {{aggressive}} {{research and}} validation program launched in 1984 in Azuero, Panama, yielded a recommendation advocating zero tillage for maize production. Ten years later, maize farmers in Azuero used three land preparation methods: conventional tillage, zero tillage, and minimum tillage (an {{adaptation of the}} zero tillage technology). This study aimed to quantify the adoption of zero and minimum tillage for maize in Azuero; identify factors influencing adoption of the different land preparation practices; and analyze {{the implications of the}} findings for future maize research and extension. Between 1985 and 1994, farmers in Region I of Azuero changed from conventional tillage to zero (33 %) and minimum tillage (43 %). In Regions II and III, most farmers still practiced conventional tillage in 1994, although 34 % had switched to minimum tillage. Across regions, adoption of conservation tillage was motivated by potential cost savings rather than longer term considerations such as reduced soil erosion. The factors that limit adoption of conservation tillage vary by region. In Region I, adoption of conservation tillage is limited by land rental rather than ownership and by lack of conservation <b>tillage</b> planting <b>equipment.</b> In Regions II and III, lack of information about conservation tillage technology limits the probability of adoption. Future research should examine soil compaction, a key variable for understanding differences between the adoption of minimum and zero tillage. Another area that merits further research is the link between weeds and conservation tillage: several farmers reported using the technology to obtain better weed control. The long-term effects of conservation tillage should also be assessed. Extension in Regions II and III should seek to accelerate adoption of conservation tillage, particularly zero tillage. In Region I, extension should steer the change process from minimum to zero tillage. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

Annual natural rainfall is 400 - 650 mm. Shanxi Province is one of the dry areas of North China and experiences water shortage. Since the area is mountainous, it has low vegetation coverage rate, and experiences loss of soil and water. Shanxi has become one of the fragile agro-ecology provinces in China. The landform and climate conditions of Shanxi are varied such as flat areas, hilly areas, and mountainous areas. The northern area has higher heights and lower air temperature. These areas usually cultivate maize, millet, sorghum, soybean, tuber crops, naked oats, benne and sunflower, etc. The middle and southern parts of Shanxi has plenty of resources such as light, cultivate crops such as maize, wheat, soybean etc., cropping pattern is usually one crop a year and three crops for two years in many districts. In irrigated places, such as in some basins of Linfen, Yuncheng and Jincheng, they carry out plant modes of two crops per year for wheat, maize or soybean. Considering its natural agricultural conditions, Shanxi Province can produce various crops.

40|$|Small holder {{farmers in}} rainfed {{agriculture}} believe that soil tillage {{is needed to}} maximize crop yields. However, as cropping intensity, and hence tillage intensity, increases {{there may be a}} decline in particular physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil which limit crop yield. This is primarily caused by declining soil organic matter, its oxidation being accelerated by tillage, particularly in warmer climates, and exacerbated by the limited return of above-ground biomass to the soil due to its competing use for other purposes. In large-scale commercial agriculture declining soil quality has been effectively addressed by conservation agriculture-cropping systems based on minimum tillage, crop residue retention and appropriate crop rotations and associations, preferably including legumes. This has required development of minimum <b>tillage</b> planting <b>equipment</b> along with herbicide technology to achieve weed control that is traditionally achieved through tillage. However, a shortage of mechanized options suitable for small holder farmers is creating an impediment to the adoption of conservation agriculture practices that would arrest the decline in soil quality in their fields. In South Asia, two-wheel tractors are replacing animal-drawn ploughing in small holder plots. This speeds the tillage operation and hence the turnaround time between crops, which may increase opportunities for crop intensification, but the problems associated with full tillage remain. Over the previous decade planter attachments to two-wheel tractors have been developed which permit seed and fertilizer placement with minimum to zero tillage in a single-pass. Recent tests have demonstrated that use of these implements can produce crop yields equal to or better than conventional tillage involving hand broadcasting of seed and fertilizer. Further, fuel and labour costs, seed and fertilizer inputs and turnaround time between crops can be reduced. In Africa, the introduction of animal-drawn rippers and direct seeders, originally developed for small-scale farmers in Brazil, is considered as a major breakthrough to small-scale farmer mechanization. It significantly reduces labour required for planting and benefits may be even greater if herbicides can be effectively used for weed control. Nevertheless, movement towards minimum tillage with two-wheel tractor mounted planters and animal-drawn direct seeding equipment is constrained by weed management issues. There are problems of availability and of safe and effective use of herbicides by resource-poor farmers and {{there is a need to}} develop more integrated weed management strategies that can be combined with small-scale planters. There is also a need to optimize the performance of small-scale planters to suit farmers' needs in different agro-ecological environments. Tools and concepts are now available to implement conservation agriculture for small holders and thereby increase profitability of their cropping practices and at the same time improve soil quality and sustainability of their livelihoods. However, much more adaptive research and on-farm evaluation is needed across a diverse range of soils, cropping systems and agro-ecological regions to bring conservation agriculture to more small holders...|$|R

From the basic physical properties were evaluated bulk density, total porosity, minimum soil air capacity and soil moisture content. The lower intensity of soil tillage was the more statistically significant increase of bulk density and lower total porosity were observed. The highest values of bulk density were observed after direct sowing. Total porosity was the highest in case of ploughing. The lowest minimum soil air capacity was observed after direct sowing. The highest soil moisture content was on variant with direct sowing and the lowest on ploughing variant. Influence of different soil tillage on water infiltration was not (except extremely wet year 2010) statistically significant. Influence of different intensity of soil tillage on water infiltration was different in each year.
