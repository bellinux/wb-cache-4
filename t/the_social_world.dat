25|$|Though not deterministic, the inculcation of the {{subjective}} {{structures of the}} habitus can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world</b> explains {{the continuity of the}} social order through time. As the individual habitus is always a mix of multiple engagements in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world</b> through the person's life, while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is not a perfect match.|$|E

40|$|Geocaching is a leisure {{game that}} {{appeared}} in the summer of 2000 and it is mainly based on searching and placing geocaches (small boxes) with the help of GPS signal. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate and to review the relationships between the concepts of leisure and tourism in regards to the nature of the game as serious leisure and review <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> organization of it. A qualitative approach with semi-structured personal interviews among 12 players with different levels of involvement in the game has been conducted. The belonging of Geocaching as serious leisure activity has been tested empirically in relation with the trans-situational typologies of <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> theory. Also it has been verified whether <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> theory is fitting the Geocaching reality. The key results brought up concepts of saturation, translated into few game resources that is not allowing the game to be leisure, and retrogression concerning long time players who don’t have a frequent activity in the game. The retrogression players belong in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> tourist typology. Geocaching has been confirmed to be a serious leisure activity, and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>worlds</b> typologies have helped to differentiate the level of geocachers implication in the game. This study can be transferred to other types of <b>social</b> <b>world</b> organization where are involved serious leisure participants...|$|R

25|$|Ultimately, each {{relatively}} autonomous {{field of}} modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex {{of social relations}} where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world,</b> will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as {{a sense of the}} game, a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world,</b> becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often acknowledge, legitimate and reproduce the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.|$|E
25|$|Doxa {{refers to}} the learned, fundamental, deep-founded, {{unconscious}} beliefs, and values, taken as self-evident universals, that inform an agent's actions and thoughts within a particular field. Doxa tends to favor the particular social arrangement of the field, thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore, the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a habitus, being congruous with the objective organization of the field, tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may {{be thought of as}} a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective, external structures and the 'subjective', internal structures of the habitus. In the doxic state, <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world</b> is perceived as natural, taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.|$|E

25|$|Pierre Bourdieu {{developed}} {{a theory of}} the action, around the concept of habitus, which exerted a considerable influence in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> sciences.

25|$|For Bourdieu, <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world</b> has {{gradually}} divided {{into what he}} calls fields. For him, the differentiation of social activities led to the constitution of various, relatively autonomous, social spaces in which competition centers around particular species of capital. These fields are treated on a hierarchical basis—with economic power usually governing—wherein the dynamics of fields arise out of the struggle of social actors trying to occupy the dominant positions within the field. Bourdieu embraces prime elements of conflict theory like Marx. Social struggle also occurs within fields hierarchically nested under the economic antagonisms between social classes. The conflicts which take place in each social field have specific characteristics arising from those fields and that involve many social relationships which are not economic.|$|E

Spearheaded by Khoja, Bohra, Bhatiya shahbandars and Moorish nakhudas who dominated sea navigation and shipping, Gujarat's transactions with the outside world had created the legacy of an international transoceanic empire which had a vast commercial network of permanent agents stationed at all the great port cities across the Indian Ocean. These networks extended to the Philippines in the east, East Africa in the west, and via maritime and the inland caravan route to Russia in the north.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{she argues}} for an ethics based {{precisely}} on {{the limits of}} self-knowledge as the limits of responsibility itself. Any concept of responsibility which demands the full transparency of the self to itself, an entirely accountable self, necessarily does violence to the opacity which marks {{the constitution of the}} self it addresses. The scene of address by which responsibility is enabled is always already a relation between subjects who are variably opaque to themselves and to each other. The ethics that Butler envisions is therefore one in which the responsible self knows the limits of its knowing, recognizes the limits of its capacity to give an account of itself to others, and respects those limits as symptomatically human. To take seriously one's opacity to oneself in ethical deliberation means then to critically interrogate <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world</b> in which one comes to be human {{in the first place and}} which remains precisely that which one cannot know about oneself. In this way, Butler locates social and political critique at the core of ethical practice.|$|E
500|$|Structure and agency, {{sometimes}} referred to as determinism versus voluntarism, form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: [...] "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" [...] In this context 'agency' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas 'structure' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology ("What is <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world</b> made of?", [...] "What is a cause in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>world,</b> and what is an effect?").
