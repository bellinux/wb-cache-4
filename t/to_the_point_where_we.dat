500|$|Fernández's father {{disapproved of}} him {{recording}} a pop album. [...] "It got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> didn't even talk anymore. He put this great distance between us", Fernández recalled. After hearing the final {{mix of the}} album, Vicente Fernández retracted his disapproval and enjoyed the recording. Me Estoy Enamorando was recorded at the Estefans' Crescent Moon Studios in Miami, Florida.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, {{and by the time}} we got around <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E
500|$|Following these tragic events, lead guitarist Dickey Betts {{gradually}} {{took over}} the role as group leader. The band returned to Miami in December to complete work on the album. Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over and sticking us in the ass with B12 shots every day. Little by little by little, we crawled back up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were standing erect".|$|E

500|$|Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{also had}} a {{positive}} review of the episode, writing that [...] "Confidence Man" [...] was [...] "A taut, tense, character-based episode which excelled on the Island and paid off in the flashback as well." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a 82/100, praising Sawyer's performance, and writing {{that it was a}} [...] "a very well written story", but criticized the music montage at the end as being a crutch, explaining that [...] "It’s as if the directors can’t think of any other way to finish the show." [...] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Confidence Man" [...] a B and wrote that [...] "Sawyer’s flashback is really well done", but adds that [...] "Lost—at least at this point in its run—is not calibrated for one of its characters to torture another one. The episode simply doesn’t do enough to get us <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can understand why this event was necessary, and why cooler heads couldn’t have prevailed." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 83rd best of Lost (excluding the finale), writing the episode is [...] "Not bad, but giving Sawyer a big, epic origin story feels kind of beside the point." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{creative}} {{struggle was}} {{evident from the}} outset. Hoppus loved everything regarding Enema of the State — including the music videos and live show — and [...] "wanted to do it again," [...] desiring to create a bigger, better and louder follow-up. DeLonge, however, was striving for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock, which was inspired by post-hardcore bands Fugazi and Refused. Barker, [...] "never simply a punk rock drummer," [...] wanted to challenge himself and was listening to {{a great deal of}} hip hop and heavy metal. The lyrics often turned darker and more introspective for Hoppus, and [...] "love songs became broken love songs." [...] DeLonge rewrote some of his lyrics after listening to songs by Alkaline Trio, feeling as though he needed to [...] "step up his game." [...] DeLonge pushed his guitar style further away from that on Enema of the State: [...] "Arpeggiated guitar hooks became frenetic 1/16th note spasms," [...] wrote Hoppus in 2013. Barker's drum parts were looped and filtered, creating different sounds. For the first time, the trio worked in opposition to one another, and the sessions sometimes became contentious. Hoppus felt that the sessions created an unspoken competition between him and DeLonge, between who could write the better chorus or most clever lyrics. [...] "Our confidence and insecurity begat some heated differences, sometime <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had to leave rooms and cool down," [...] recalled Hoppus. Finn would often smooth over differences with a joke, offering a fresh perspective and advice.|$|E
2500|$|Robertson later said, [...] "Eventually, [...] built us up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> outgrew {{his music}} {{and had to}} leave. He {{shot himself in the}} foot, really, bless his heart, by {{sharpening}} us into such a crackerjack band that we had to go on out into the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically." ...|$|E

Coach Eric Mangini told The Plain Dealer the Browns won't use the brown pants anymore. [...] "It wasn't very well-received," [...] Mangini said. [...] "I hope we can get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can wear fruit on our heads and people wouldn't notice." [...] At the time, the brown pants weren't officially dropped by the team, but simply not used.|$|E

2500|$|In the sixties, Professor Dooge {{was active}} in {{developing}} an international network of hydrology scientists and engineers that stretched from the USA to the then USSR. [...] "These contacts were very beneficial, enabling research taking place {{from all over the}} world to link up in meaningful ways and, in a sense, helping establish an international hydrological community. Initially, we were an informal group of six. This grew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had a committee of 12". [...] Eventually this led to the establishment of the International Commission on Water Resource Systems within the International Association for Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). He served as its President for several years.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} he {{published}} in 1847, Asachi defined {{himself as a}} partisan of [...] "the juste milieu" [...] on language matters, and recommended adopting words and rules of grammar with moderation, and from all sources available. According to the literary critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, [...] " [...] anybody who has ever read anything of what this writer has authored knows {{that he has a}} language of his own, a characteristic one, resembling those of many writers, without resemblig that of anyone else <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> could place him in any category."

2500|$|About the Afghan war, Majid is {{reported}} to have said, [...] "Pakistan has become a [...] "punching bag" [...] in the American media, specifically the CNN."

[...] Ambassador Patterson later replied that his statement was astonishing. [...] In 2007, Majid maintained to the country's media representatives, about the security of country's strategic nuclear arsenals that the nuclear and strategic assets are well protected with robust safeguards and very elaborate security system. Any irresponsible [...] "act by any one against it will be responded very strongly at all levels of command", Majid quoted.|$|E
2500|$|On October 26, 2008, after 8 {{years of}} captivity, the ex-congressman Óscar Tulio Lizcano escaped with the {{assistance}} of a FARC rebel he convinced to travel with him. Soon after the liberation of this prominent political hostage, the Vice President of Colombia Francisco Santos Calderón called Latin America's biggest guerrilla group a [...] "paper tiger" [...] with little control of the nation's territory, adding that [...] "they have really been diminished <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> can say they are a minimal threat to Colombian security," [...] and that [...] "After six years of going after them, reducing their income and promoting reinsertion of most of their members, they look like a paper tiger." [...] However, he warned against any kind of premature triumphalism, because [...] "crushing the rebels will take time."

LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and I would have to say that I shared the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E

Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again. When talking to reporters Eddie said: I was broke, hungry, jobless... yet {{despite the fact that}} all three of us are old-time aviators who did our part {{for the development of the}} industry, we were left out in the cold in the Administration's program of job making. Can you blame us for accepting the lucrative Spanish offer? He later said [...] "This was a mess... and there was always that never-ending jockeying for the power among the factions to contend with, it got <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> did not know who we were fighting and why, and you can say that we are damn glad to be back."
