40|$|The {{potential}} {{of developing countries}} to achieve rapid and sustainable economic growth and reduction {{in the level of}} poverty in part depend on their integration into global markets. These potential gains from global trade could be achieved if all participating countries can limit their barriers to trade, so as to encourage the free flow of goods and services. In reality, this is often not the case as there are various market access barriers to some key exports of developing countries, which make {{it difficult for them to}} take full advantage of the opportunities that abound in global trade. In international trade <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>cost</b> advantage, countries are advised to specialize in the production of commodities in which they have comparative cost advantage over other countries. This will make countries to gain from international trade. African exports prior to this time (during 1950 s and 1960 s) have performed well in terms of the volume and number of products, while the issue of market access barriers to their exports in the markets of their trading partners did not arise. Though, Africa has its strength in the production of primary products that attract fewer restrictions in the developed nations ’ markets (especially in the markets of their colonial masters), continent has however gain from trade in which the returns serve as the bulk of their foreign exchange during these periods...|$|E
40|$|Following Smith¡¯s {{advocacy}} {{of free trade}} and competition, David Ricardo attempts to strengthen his theory of absolute advantage, which excludes from international trade countries which have no advantages over others, by eliminating this weakness. To do so, Ricardo introduces to the economics literature a <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>cost</b> advantage which includes countries {{that do not have}} absolute advantages in international trade. In Ricardo¡¯s framework, these countries can still gain from free trade. We present direct and indirect critiques which reveal that their {{advocacy of}} free trade is questionable. In our direct critiques we find that Ricardo¡¯s attempt is questionable for the following reasons. First, the scale of production of cloth in Portugal and that of wine in England equal 1 even though {{there is no reason to}} believe that two countries have the same scale of production for two different commodities. Second, it is argued that his theory is incomplete because it is based on particular numbers, does not determine the terms of trade, and does not take into account the unintended curtailment of demand in both countries, which in turn can make trade non-beneficial for both countries. In our indirect critiques, first we argue that Ricardo assumes the equality between the relative price and relative labor cost of two commodities even though they are different. Second, it is shown that the outcome of complete specialization in his theory prevents a country from specializing in the production of a commodity that could generate for itself a substantial profit in the long run, locking the country out of industrialization. We then point out that Samuelson who supports Ricardo¡¯s theory to some extent does not consider in his proof the possible destruction of the domestic industry in the case of free trade, even though this might make domestic consumers worse off and also lock a country out of industrialization.

40|$|The article {{considers}} the traditional economic <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> international trade {{based on the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>costs.</b> Thus countries will export products {{in which they have}} advantages in <b>comparative</b> factor <b>cost</b> terms and import those in which other countries have such advantages. It notes that this theory needs to be applied with caution in the modern world. Firstly, advanced factors of production like the educational infrastructure may be more important than the traditional factors of land, labour and capital. Secondly, branded goods distort trade patterns, since they sell on perceived brand value rather than on cost plus. The economic <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>costs</b> still influences where multinationals choose to locate their activities, and still determines prices for commodities.

50|$|Shaikh {{has argued}} in various {{publications}} that neither neoclassical economics nor the great bulk of heterodox economics provides an adequate {{foundation for the}} analysis of developed capitalism. The former is based on a vision of a perfect capitalism which is claimed to optimally and efficiently serve the interests of all of its participants. At the heart of this vision is the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> perfect competition. Much of heterodox economics is in turn based on the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> imperfect competition, i.e., on departures from perfect competition. But the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> imperfect competition is intrinsically dependent on the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> perfect competition. Shaikh argues that even neo-ricardian economics, whose revival was sparked by Sraffa's classic work, relies heavily on the neoclassical concepts of perfect competition and of equilibrium as an attained-and-held state. In place of these notions, Shaikh proposes the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> real competition and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> turbulent regulation. Real competition is competition-as-war, with individual firms seeking to undermine each other by lowering costs and cutting prices. Turbulent regulation is the resulting process of perpetual overshooting and undershooting of actual economic variables (such as prices, wages and profit rates) around their ever-moving centers of gravity. Shaikh has utilized this framework to develop alternate <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> industrial, financial and international competition (the latter rejecting the standard <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>costs).</b> The key element in all cases is the turbulent equalization of profit rates in various spheres of investment. He uses his theoretical structures to explain the actual patterns of industrial prices, profit rates, stock market prices, and exchange rates in the developed world.|$|R
40|$|The main {{factors of}} {{economic}} growth in the mainstream <b>of</b> the economic <b>theory</b> are capital and labor, and the rates of growth are determined by the rate of savings. Alternative tradition of the economic analyses does accent on the structural changes that are taking place in the economic system. This restructuring is the main factor of development. This paper is a brief outline of the formation and evolution <b>of</b> the structuralist <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> economic growth. Elements of structuralism are standing yet in the concept of expanded reproduction <b>of</b> Marx, <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>comparative</b> <b>costs</b> Ricardo, the model Solow. The characteristic of the concept of unequal exchange in international trade associated with the hypothesis Prebisch – Singer, describes the formation of a global system of «center – periphery». We introduce a distinction between the structuralist and neo-classical <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> economic growth associated with the discussions in the Soviet Union on the role of «extensive» and «intensive» growth factors.

The heterogeneity of the technological structure is present both in Soviet economy, as in the market, capitalist economy. The last situation was demonstrated by the concept of «technological stalemate» G. Mensch. As the impact of international economic relations on the economic development of the role of structural analysis will increase.
