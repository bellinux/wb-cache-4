50|$|The {{procedure}} {{of choice for}} congenital facial paralysis is either CFNG or motor donors, both with a free muscle <b>transfer.</b> (<b>Algorithm</b> 2) Incomplete bilateral Moebius syndrome has the same clinical features as the Moebius syndrome, however some motor function is still apparent {{on one side of}} the face. This incomplete syndrome is reanimated with the use of the CFNG and free muscle transfer. The cross facial nerve graft comes from the side with some motor function of the facial nerve. However it first has to be investigated if the motor function of the nerve is strong enough to be separated. A free muscle transfer is always used on the paralysed side, as the muscle is a congenital atrophic muscle. Complete bilateral Moebius syndrome is treated with motor donor nerves on both sides. Optional motor donor nerves are: the masseteric nerve, accessory nerve or hypoglossal nerve. In rare cases when these nerves are also affected, cervical nerve branches can be used. The use of a free muscle transfer is again indicated. The nerve that initially innervated the free muscle transfer is then connected to the provided branches of the motor donor nerve. In Moebius-like syndrome the CFNG is performed, as the facial nerve on the affected side does not have a strong enough motor function. A free muscle transfer is also used, due to the atrophic muscle.|$|E

Large uncertainties in the global sea-air flux estimates are identified due to different gas <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithms,</b> global climatological wind speeds, and seasonal SST and SSS data. The global sea-air flux ranges from - 0. 57 to - 2. 27 Gt/yr, depending on the combination of gas <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithms</b> and global climatological wind speeds used. Different combinations of SST and SSS global fields resulted in changes as large as 35 % on the oceans global sea-air flux. An error as small as plus or minus 0. 2 in SSS translates into a plus or minus 43 % deviation on the mean global CO 2 flux.

40|$|A color <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm</b> between images {{intends to}} modify the colors in the source image by {{borrowing}} the color characteristics from the target image. In this paper, we present a novel automatic color <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm</b> between images. This algorithm is able to proceed on color transfer with no user intervention, and produce visually plausible resultant images. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, our algorithm is the first to achieve this kind of automation. Our technique consists of an image segmentation algorithm, a swatch merging algorithm, and a pattern recognition algorithm. The image segmentation algorithm generates a number of swatches with different features in the source and target images. The swatch merging algorithm merges a particular swatch with its neighbors in the source image when it fails to pass the normality test. The pattern recognition algorithm then automatically matches these swatches for color transfer. We develop a boundary transition algorithm to make possible a consistent transition between two boundaries of patches. Experimental results demonstrate that, without any user intervention, our technique performs color transfer results with good visual realism. The technique is superior to the original user-intervention color <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm...</b>|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAV) have seen significant development with a current focus on automation. The main area of development that is pushing automation is that of path planning allowing a UAV to generate its own path information that it can then follow to carry out its mission. Little work however has been carried out on transfer path planning. This work attempts to address this shortcoming by developing optimal algorithms for a path planning task to move on to a circular flightpath to carry out a target tracking mission. The work is developed in three main sections. Firstly the <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm</b> itself is derived including gradient analysis for the cost function being applied, adaptation of this cost function into two separate minimising actions and analysis of a cost function issue that introduces a separation distance constraint. The algorithm is tested proving correct constraint activation and cost selection. The second part of this work looks at validating the results of the <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm</b> against the Dubin's car result and a receding horizon approach when applied to the transfer operation. Utilising the cost results from the <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm</b> an efficiency analysis against the equivalent costs from the other methods is carried out. Lastly this work looks at the comparison between the developed <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm</b> and a more flexible transfer approach by developing a new cost function form. A switching cost function is introduced where environmental parameters from the target tracking mission (i. e target position and velocity) are used to switch between a number of applicable cost functions (time minimal, distance minimal and minimum speed transfer). An analysis is carried out to investigate the performance of both the original algorithm and the newly developed switching function based on key target tracking parameter...|$|E
40|$|Recently, various deep-neural-network (DNN) -based {{approaches}} {{have been proposed}} for single-image super-resolution (SISR). Despite their promising results on major structure regions such as edges and lines, they still suffer from limited performance on texture regions that consist of very complex and fine patterns. This is because, during the acquisition of a low-resolution (LR) image via down-sampling, these regions lose most of the high frequency information necessary to represent the texture details. In this paper, we present a novel texture enhancement framework for SISR to effectively improve the spatial resolution in the texture regions as well as edges and lines. We call our method, high-resolution (HR) style <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Our framework consists of three steps: (i) generate an initial HR image from an interpolated LR image via an SISR algorithm, (ii) generate an HR style image from the initial HR image via down-scaling and tiling, and (iii) combine the HR style image with the initial HR image via a customized style <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Here, the HR style image is obtained by down-scaling the initial HR image and then repetitively tiling it into {{an image of the}} same size as the HR image. This down-scaling and tiling process comes from the idea that texture regions are often composed of small regions that similar in appearance albeit sometimes different in scale. This process creates an HR style image that is rich in details, which can be used to restore high-frequency texture details back into the initial HR image via the style <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Experimental results on a number of texture datasets show that our proposed HR style <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithm</b> provides more visually pleasing results compared with competitive methods.

In addition, cost-effectiveness of this approach lies in the fact that applying such a method, valid results concerning driving behaviour and in projection road safety, are not dependent of the availability of high cost and fidelity driving simulators.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Colour <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithms</b> aim {{to apply}} a colour palette, mood or style from one image to another, {{operating}} either in a threedimensional colour space, or splitting the problem into three simpler one-dimensional problems. The latter class of algorithms simply treats {{each of the three}} dimensions independently, whether justified or not. Although they rarely introduce spatial artefacts, the quality of the results depends on how the problem was split into three sub-problems, i. e. which colour space was chosen. Generally, the assumption is made that a decorrelated colour space would perform best, as decorrelation makes the three colour channels semi-independent (decorrelation is a weaker property than independence). However, such spaces are only decorrelated for well-chosen image ensembles. For individual images, this property may not hold. In this work, the connection between the natural statistics of colour images and the ability of existing colour <b>transfer</b> <b>algorithms</b> to produce plausible results is investigated.
