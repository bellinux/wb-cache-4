5|$|Louis XIV of France {{sought to}} knock Emperor Leopold {{out of the}} war by seizing Vienna, the Habsburg capital, and gain a {{favourable}} peace settlement. The dangers <b>to</b> <b>Vienna</b> were considerable: the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin's forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Vendôme's large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the Brenner Pass. Vienna was also under pressure from Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the Duke of Marlborough resolved to alleviate the peril <b>to</b> <b>Vienna</b> by marching his forces south from Bedburg and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Three Cuman assassins murdered LadislausIV on 10July 1290, and Archbishop Lodomer {{subsequently}} dispatched two monks <b>to</b> <b>Vienna</b> {{to inform}} Andrew of the king's death. With the monks' assistance, Andrew left his prison in disguise and hastened to Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{returned}} to Hungary {{at the beginning}} of 1290. On this occasion, Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom, also urged him to come, since the archbishop wanted to dethrone the excommunicated LadislausIV with the assistance of Ivan Kőszegi. Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hahót, an enemy of the Kőszegis, invited him to the fort of Štrigova and captured him. Hahót sent Andrew <b>to</b> <b>Vienna,</b> where Albert I, Duke of Austria, held him in captivity.|$|E

50|$|Though in 1836 a licence {{had been}} issued to the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway <b>to</b> connect <b>Vienna,</b> Ostrava, Kraków and Bochnia, that railway was only built from <b>Vienna</b> <b>to</b> Bohumín on the Austrian and Prussian border, {{and the only}} rail {{communication}} form <b>Vienna</b> <b>to</b> Kraków used Prussian rails in upper Silesia until 1856.|$|R
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the War was {{dragging}} on towards its fourth year, and Zita's brother Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, a serving officer in the Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria-Hungary to make a separate peace with France. Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him <b>to</b> <b>Vienna.</b> Zita's mother Maria Antonia delivered the letter in person.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Kempelen {{was ordered}} by Emperor Joseph II to {{reconstruct}} the Turk and deliver it <b>to</b> <b>Vienna</b> for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his wife. The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk, a request to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed.|$|E
5|$|Political {{conflicts}} in Vienna delayed Austria's {{entry into the}} Third Coalition until 1805. After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801, Archduke Charles—the emperor's brother—took advantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan. He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803–04, but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack, Lieutenant Field Marshal and Quartermaster-General of the Army, implemented his own restructuring. Mack bypassed Charles' methodical approach. Occurring in the field, Mack's plan also undermined the overall command and organizational structure. Regardless, Mack sent an enthusiastic report <b>to</b> <b>Vienna</b> on the military's readiness. Furthermore, after misreading Napoleon's maneuvers in Württemberg, Mack reported <b>to</b> <b>Vienna</b> on the weakness of French dispositions. His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor, Francis II, to enter the conflict against France, despite Charles' own advice to the contrary. Responding to the report and rampant anti-French fever in Vienna, Francis dismissed Charles from his post as generalissimo and appointed his Francophobic brother-in-law, Archduke Ferdinand, as commander.|$|E

5|$|After that war, {{he moved}} to a more prestigious hussar unit (rota), and likely due to a {{reduction}} of the royal army, {{he served in the}} private formation of Władysław Myszkowski and later, voivode Stanisław Lubomirski. In 1635 he might have served as a military adviser to John II Casimir Vasa, and possibly accompanied the king <b>to</b> <b>Vienna.</b> In 1637 he married Zofia Kobierzycka, and later that year he fought in the Pawluk Uprising against the rebellious Cossacks under Pavel Mikhnovych, participating in the battle of Kumejki. He led a cavalry charge at Kumejki which was instrumental for the Polish victory there. Earlier that year he served as a military delegate to the Sejm (parliament) in Warsaw.|$|E

After a trip <b>to</b> <b>Vienna,</b> Walt Disney was {{inspired}} to create four feature films. One of those was The Waltz King, a loosely adapted biopic of Johann Strauss, which aired {{as part of the}} Wonderful World of Disney in the U.S. in 1963. In Mikhail Bulgakov's 1940 (published 1967) novel, The Master and Margarita, Johann Strauss conducts the orchestra during Satan's Great Ball at the invitation of Behemoth.|$|E
5|$|Around 1843, Kogălniceanu's {{enthusiasm for}} change was {{making him a}} suspect to the Moldavian authorities, and his lectures on History were {{suspended}} in 1844. His passport was revoked while he was traveling <b>to</b> <b>Vienna</b> as the secret representative of the Moldavian political opposition (attempting to approach Metternich and discuss Sturdza's ouster). Briefly imprisoned after returning to Iași, he soon after became involved in political agitation in Wallachia, assisting his friend Ion Ghica: in February, during a Romantic nationalist celebration, he traveled to Bucharest, where he met members of the secretive Frăția organization and of its legal front, Soțietatea Literară (including Ghica, Nicolae Bălcescu, August Treboniu Laurian, Alexandru G. Golescu, and C. A. Rosetti).|$|E

5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat <b>to</b> <b>Vienna,</b> the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|From 1793, seven small {{houses at}} {{the east side of}} the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room.

He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts.
