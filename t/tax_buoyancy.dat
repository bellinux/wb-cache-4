40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Bachelor of Business Science-Financial Economics at Strathmore UniversityOne {{of the most important}} measures of efficiency of any tax system in public finance is <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy</b> which is simply the total response of tax revenue to changes in national income. Tax revenue in Africa have been relatively low on average as a percentage of GDP. Since buoyancy echoes the capacity of a tax structure to generate revenues during economic growth, in this study an attempt was made to estimate the buoyancies of income tax, value added tax, import tax, excise tax and total tax revenues in using annual data from 1972 to 2014 in the largest economies in the eastern and southern parts of Africa. It applies the error correction model to measure the short run estimate of <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> the long run estimate of <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and the level of convergence between the short run estimate and the long run estimate. The results suggest that the tax systems for both countries are buoyant both in the long run and short run with an average speed of adjustment between the long run and the short run estimates...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made in the present to provide an {{empirical}} content to differential coefficient of tax [revenue] buoyancy during post tax reform period in India by fitting a double-log regression model with an interaction variable to the stationary time series data based on Augmented - Dicky Fuller [ADF] and Phillips-Parron [PP] Tests. The period after 1992 is considered as post tax reform period to look at the prognostications of tax reforms that had been initiated by the government of India. The regression results illustrate that the estimate of constant gross <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy</b> is positively significant and more than unity during pre tax reform period illuminating that gross tax is moderately elastic. From this upshot it can be comprehended that a one percent increase in income leads to increase the gross tax revenue by more than one percent, all else equal. Further it can be understood that the average propensity to tax [ratio of Gross Tax Revenue to Gross Domestic Product] was increasing with the increase in Gross Domestic Product during pre tax reform period. The regression coefficient of interaction variable is significantly negative and stumpy showing a downward shift in the degree of <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy</b> during post tax reform period. The estimate of the <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy,</b> which was just above the unity during pre tax reform period, is less than unity during post tax reform period evincing the fact that the gross Tax is relatively inelastic. From this it can also be understood that the average propensity to tax is declining with the increase in Gross Domestic Product during post tax reform period. Thus the estimates of gross <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy</b> during pre and post tax reform periods are not stable. ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of a destination-based VAT in all but eight states starting April 2005, there is need for a good baseline indicator of <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancies</b> in states in the period immediately preceding. This to provide such a base, with buoyancies estimated over a 23 -year span starting in 1980 - 81. If estimated over a sufficiently long period of time, the buoyancy coefficient essentially estimates the underlying revenue-generating properties of the system with endogenised tax policy. A log linear trend fit over the entire period showed serial correlation, which is eliminated for all but one state, Assam, with {{the introduction}} of structural breaks. A third specification, including the log of the per cent share of industry in the domestic product, eliminates serial correlation for Assam, and improves the goodness-of-fit for some other states. In all but six states, the sign of the change in the buoyancy coefficient at the break is positive. Where the buoyancy-enhancing break occurs in the late 1990 s, the spurt in tax effort might have been an endogenous response to the expenditure shock from implementation of the higher salary scales recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission. ...|$|R
40|$|Mexico's {{tax system}} is a paradox. The tax policy and tax {{administration}} reforms of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s delivered a tax structure that {{is in many ways}} comparable, if not superior, to that in many OECD countries. However, Mexico's tax system continues to perform in some fundamental ways, in particular in its ability to raise adequate revenues, worse than the tax system of many developing countries. The basic objective of this evaluation is to try to explain this paradox. In doing that we will compare the revenue performance of Mexico's tax system to that of other developing and developed countries and examine Mexico's <b>tax</b> system <b>buoyancy</b> and elasticity over time. The evaluation will also take stock of the recent performance of Mexico's tax system vis-a-vis other important objectives of any tax system. In particular, we will examine the vertical and horizontal distribution of tax burdens, the relative distortions or excess burdens introduced by the tax system in the decisions of economic agents, and its relative complexity and impact on tax administration and taxpayer compliance costs. The main objective of the evaluation is to identify the most important avenues for reform in tax policy, tax administration, and the political economy of tax reform in Mexico. The improvements in Mexico's tax structure have been many during the last 10 to 15 years. Examples in the area of income taxation include the practically full indexation of personal and enterprise profit tax for inflation, the full integration of these two taxes to avoid the double taxation of dividends, and the application of a minimum tax on gross assets, to which the enterprise profit tax is creditable, to combat tax evasion. The structures of the VAT and excise taxes are also on the whole quite adequate. While many nuisance taxes were eliminated, the standard tax rates for the main taxes are similar to or slightly below international averages. The effective marginal rates of taxation on new investment, as also reviewed below, {{have been found to be}} below those of most OECD and Latin American countries, thus creating a favorable atmosphere for domestic and foreign investment. And yet, with all these good characteristics, Mexico's tax system has not been able to generate much more that 10 to 11 percent of tax revenues in relation to GDP. The most important issue before proceeding with tax reform, especially if the most important objective is to increase the revenue adequacy of the system, is to explain what factors may account for this enduring low tax effort.

We find that, for aggregate tax revenues, short-run <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy</b> does not significantly differ from one in the majority of countries; yet, it has increased since the late 1980 s so that tax systems have generally become better automatic stabilizers. Long-run buoyancy exceeds one in about half of the OECD countries, implying that GDP growth has helped improve structural fiscal deficit ratios. Corporate taxes are by far the most buoyant, while excises and property taxes are the least buoyant.

40|$|Demand for {{increased}} public expenditure due to enhanced political consciousness {{and implementation of}} investment programmes through mechanism(s) infected with diseconomies are the two important forces among several others to put increased pressure on the fiscal resources available within a state. Short-term measures undertaken by a Sate viz., dependence on federal transfers and resorting to overdraft evidently has their respective detrimental implications on fiscal health of the state. The remedial approach pervasively suggested by the contemporary fiscal strategists to tackle the ever-increasing fiscal gap moves towards attaining an appropriate degree of financial self reliance. Thus, the obvious solution of fiscal restructuring dwells on an in-depth understanding of the fiscal system of a state particularly on a temporal analysis of the indicators that throw light {{on the performance of}} a tax system in respect of two objectives: (i) siphoning off into the state exchequer the collection of revenue without endangering the incentive for private savings and investment and (ii) helping to release resources for private investment by reducing private consumption. While the indicators like the compound growth rate and marginal tax rates do not take in to account the taxable capacity, the tax ratio and the tax efforts measures generally fail to indicate the responsiveness of the tax structure to changes in state’s income over time. Thus the temporal analysis of tax responsiveness in terms of Elasticity and Buoyancy becomes imperative to have an evaluative insight into the effectiveness of a state’s tax system. The present study is an attempt in this regard by taking the States of North Eastern Region for the period 1963 - 64 to 2000 - 01. The study reveals that most of the States in the region have failed miserably in mobilizing resources to meet ever increasing public expenditures and thereby are suffering from dependency syndromes.

40|$|As most {{developing}} countries strive to achieve Economic growth and development, {{it has been}} quite a challenging issue to attain a balance in their fiscal policy management. Most of these countries have faced a prolonged (persistence) budgetary deficit caused by the increasing growth in their public expenditures more than in their incomes. The most important puzzling question has been why is there a slow revenue mobilization in {{developing countries}}? It was realized in the mid 1980 s by the World Bank studies that this slow revenue growth has been due to their poor fiscal design policies. Hence according to the Ahwad and Stern (1991), SAP design for developing country’s tax reforms was accorded a top priority. Meanwhile Sohota (1961) earlier pointed out the role of tax reforms {{as one of the}} important and a major ingredient to economic development of a nation. Cameroon in Sub Saharan Africa faced this problem in mid of 1980 s. The country was not only heated by a recession but faced a prolong budget deficit problem from 1986 - 1994. Since 1990 two major tax reforms were implemented in 1994 and 1999 to restructured the country‘s tax policies for revenue mobilization in order to overshadow the deficit scenario. It is rather unfortunate that since the reform package were implemented; there has been little or no work done so far to assess the success or influence of the reforms on indirect tax revenue raising capability. It is this challenge or knowledge gap that I was motivated to cover in this piece of work. Due to the large scope of taxation, this issue of tax revenue mobilization is restricted only to the indirect tax reform in Cameroon. The major pre-rogatives of this work involve; -An exposition of the indirect tax structure of Cameroon and the trends of tax revenue growth. -To investigate if the tax reforms did improve the initial tax revenue situation or rather helped to engineer the response of the tax system to changes in the tax bases for the purpose of raising sufficient revenue requirement for the economy. -To identify which indirect tax hurdles become more responsive (flexible) or remain rigid after the tax reform, as well as which of the indirect taxes responded to revenue increases depend on discretionary power influence than by natural response (elasticity). -Finally, what are the conceivable implications of the indirect tax outcomes to the tax policy makers of the country? Methodology: I used the model of <b>tax</b> elasticity and <b>buoyancy,</b> estimated from a tax function, an approach used by similar works in other developing countries by Prest 1962; Sohota 1961; Lavin 1968; Mansfield 1972; Chellah 1971. The tax elasticity is the responsiveness of the tax revenue growth relative to the change in the tax bases excluding any external influence on the revenue growth {{such as the use of}} discretion, changes in tax rates and so on while Buoyancy is similar but involves measurement of total tax revenue that encompasses all other external influences. Within the indirect taxes, the sales/VAT taxes (STV) as the main consumption tax and Custom duty/imports (CTM) from international strand were utilized as samples for the analysis. The GDP used as the main tax base, with one proxy base (actual base) for each tax sample. The total imports of goods and services (TMGS) as the proxy base for custom duty tax and private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) for the expenditure taxes. Time series data on tax revenue from 1980 - 2003 were used basically due to difficulties of getting tax revenue data in an extended period for Cameroon. Data on sales/VAT taxes and custom duty tax were obtained from Cameroon tax department of the ministry of finance and Central Bureau of National statistics while that on GDP, PFCE and TMGS, were obtained from World Bank Development Indicator. The data on discretionary tax revenue were not available at all in Cameroon. Thus, I finally adopted the Dummy variable techniques used by Singer (1968) to capture the effect of tax reforms and in estimating the tax elasticity of the indirect taxes in Cameroon. Hence from a given tax function, a series of regressions were ran using the Eview and stata as the main statistical software package. RESULT: The overall results of the tax reforms on revenue mobilisation in Cameroon showed a progressive trend. The impact of the 1994 and 1999 tax reforms in regards to revenue raising tended to vary depending on the specific tax and the respective tax basis. The empirical finding of the impact of the 1994 tax reforms on STV showed a decline in the intercepts of 22 % and 24. 5 % for GDP and PFCE respectively. The long run effects of the elasticity response (slopes shifts) resulted to a positive increase in STV revenue of 0. 039 and 0. 311 from GDP and PFCE. Similarly the CTM experienced a decline in the intercepts that resulted to a decrease in it tax revenue from the pre- reform level by 19 % and 43 % out of GDP and TMGS. The elasticity response shows an elastic increase in slope by 0. 056, an indicated rise in CTM revenue by 5. 6 %. On the contrary, there was inelastic decline in slope of 0. 54 for TMGS. This implies decrease in CTM revenue by 54 %, which was only in the short run due to the reduction in tax rate intended to counter the effects of rising prices cause by devaluation of the country currency in 1994. In respect to the 1999 tax reform impact, the VAT showed a positive shift in the intercept of 10. 35 % and 3. 43 % in respect to GDP and PFCE as tax bases, with an insensitive response of slope (elasticity) alteration. The interpretation of the stated empirical findings of this work are that a decline in intercepts signifies an autonomous lost (leakage) of tax revenues. On the other hand elasticity response due to changes in slope in a positive direction indicates an increase in revenue due to increase tax rate by reform and an inelastic response of a decline in the slope indicates falling tax revenue due to a cut in tax rate. One very interesting realisation of this slope interpretation is the opposite effects on the tax base, where the underline tax bases decline in the post 1994 tax reform except for TMGS due to a cut in CTM rate. A comparative analysis of the stated result of the difference indirect tax hurdles showed that CTM become more responsive to revenue yield than STV in the post 1994 reform period. VAT remains rigid to revenue mobilisation after the 1999 tax reform. Other findings of the research from the analysis of elasticity and buoyancy with regards to the third objective indicated that before tax reforms in Cameroon; both indirect tax samples had an inelastic response to changes in their bases, while the post reforms, result of the STV became more responsive (elastic) and the customs duty remained inelastic. Again there were indications of dominant use of discretion in mobilising revenue than through in-built response of the elasticity. The final outcome of these results and it implications that warrant some policy intervention are the realised lost in revenue, inelastic response of the tax bases which threaten sustainability future tax revenue flow and the ultimate effects of unpredictable use of discretion in the country tax system. Few recommendations have been suggested in the light of improving the situation...|$|R

Total expenditure of the Central Government as a proportion of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has not increased during the 1990 s when compared to the 1980 s. But the composition of expenditure has shifted more towards revenue expenditure. An emphasis on expenditure allocation with targeting at a detailed level and innovative tax reforms aimed at more revenue mobilisation are necessary to achieve qualitative fiscal correction, But this is often stymied for political economic reasons. Procrustean fiscal correction aiming merely at deficit targeting is not a very desirable method.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} trade and revenue impact of trade liberalization. The purpose is to address the {{following}} issues: to {{examine the effect of}} trade liberalization on the volume of imports and exports, taxation, and its association with the enhancement of the performance of overall tax system. An empirical analysis is conducted by, first, adding liberalization factors to the import and export demand functions to assess their impact on imports and exports. The results indicate that, for Thailand, trade liberalization does not lead to the deterioration in the trade balance. Instead, it helps improve export performance. However, trade deficit may still occur due to a high income elasticity of demand for imports, rooted from its import structure. Although trade liberalization is not found {{to be associated with the}} problem of trade imbalance, the fiscal imbalance may still persist due to the mechanism of tariff reduction. In order to deal with the fiscal problem, the government needs to implement domestic tax reform. The consequence of reform may vary since liberalization impacts on taxation differ greatly depending on various factors. The study examines its effect on taxation, by applying a tax effort model and employing a two-way fixed effect approach. The results suggest that tax reform in less developed and developing countries, by moving away from trade tax to domestic taxes, may be inapplicable since domestic taxes may also severely suffer from liberalization. However, tax reform is still necessary and thus the study applies the concept of <b>tax</b> <b>buoyancy</b> and elasticity to evaluate the ability of Thailand’s tax system to mobilize its revenue after the reform. The results reveal that the tax system as a whole is buoyant and elastic due to the high tax-to-base buoyancy of corporate income tax, especially in the post-AFTA period. The main findings from empirical studies have important policy implications for tax strategies of Thailand and other developing countries.
