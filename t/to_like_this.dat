500|$|Magnus's English {{accent was}} not well {{received}} by some critics.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him {{when he was a little}} kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

500|$|Aadisht Khanna from Mint was {{disappointed}} with the book and gave a negative review.

Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes you appreciate why that earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously backs away from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, {{in this case a}} glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E

500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] good you can't help {{wondering}} {{why no one}} thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation {{of what it takes}} to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{believing that the}} film [...] "leaves you breathless with curiosity, as it teases itself with the {{directions}} it might take. To watch the film is {{to be actively involved}} in the challenge of its creation." [...] He later added the film to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] collection. At the end of 2009, Ebert named the film one of the best of the decade. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film a four star rating, and praised Kaufman's writing, stating [...] "Screenwriting this smart, inventive, passionate and rip-roaringly funny is a rare species. So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on Being John Malkovich, in 1999." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking. And the climax, the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self-critically explains how so many others derail, is bananas." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek felt Meryl Streep had not [...] "been this much fun to watch in years", while Mike Clark of USA Today gave a largely negative review, mainly criticizing the ending: [...] "Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior <b>to</b> <b>like,</b> <b>this</b> could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot." ...|$|E

He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers' strikes (the frequent strikes at British Leyland during the time of the series' original transmission were often mentioned), and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode [...] "The Germans" [...] he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. The best he can say is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between [...] "wogs" [...] and [...] "niggers"—but in a manner innocent of malice or bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode [...] "Communication Problems" [...] in which Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{almost universally}} praised the novel upon its publication, {{primarily}} citing the compelling character portrayal of 11-year-old lead detective, Flavia de Luce. Reviewers have called Flavia brilliant, bold, irresistible, incorrigible, precocious, adorable, and unique. For Canadian Literature, Beverly Haun wrote [...] "Flavia is a gem of a character; her precocity offset by her emotional vulnerability makes a winning combination." [...] Marilyn Stasio for The New York Times Book Review agreed, proclaiming Flavia [...] "impressive as a sleuth and enchanting as a mad scientist," [...] but [...] "most endearing {{as a little}} girl who has learned how to amuse herself in a big lonely house." [...] Reviewer Paula Todd for The Globe and Mail (Canada), however, was not impressed. Calling Flavia [...] "too much of a caricature to appeal to the subtlety-seeking adult mystery reader," [...] she declared the language [...] "often tedious" [...] and the references [...] "too obscure" [...] for younger readers. Todd wrote [...] "the burning question a few chapters in is not whodunit, but who wants to read it? To whom, exactly, is this book meant to appeal?" [...] Other reviewers have noted strong appeal {{to a wide range of}} readers. Michele Leber for Library Journal noted [...] "appeal for cozy lovers and well beyond" [...] while Francisca Goldsmith for School Library Journal suggested [...] "mystery fans, Anglophiles, and science buffs will delight" [...] in The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie. Judy Coon for Booklist insisted [...] "only those who dislike precocious young heroines with extraordinary vocabulary and audacious courage can fail <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> amazingly entertaining book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Daniel Lanois {{says that}} the most {{progress}} on [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] was made at Melbeach, the Edge's newly purchased home in seaside Monkstown. According to Lanois, the song's performance came from a 20-minute jam that he dedicated an extensive {{amount of time to}} editing into a final arrangement, [...] "for a song that was never a song, that was only ever a jam." [...] He said, [...] "It was one of those songs that was born partially by surgery – the editing of the structure was a really big part of it." [...] Recording engineer Dave Meegan helped develop the song with a mix that he made at Melbeach. Wanting it to sound like Led Zeppelin, Meegan adjusted a monitor mix to make it [...] "really heavy sounding." [...] Lanois was inspired by what he heard, as the song up to that point was being treated softly. He quickly summoned the band, who went with the primary engineer Flood to Windmill Lane Studios. There, in a warehouse next door, the crew used a public address system to play an acoustic recording of Mullen's drums, which was then re-recorded inside the warehouse. Lanois called it a [...] "really elaborate kind of rock and roll chamber". The result, according to Meegan, [...] "made [...] sound like John Bonham", while Lanois said they sounded [...] "tankier". He added, [...] "it introduced a mid-range that the high-hat seemed <b>to</b> <b>like.</b> <b>This</b> new sonic emphasis on the high-hat made every hit more relevant... The inherent low-frequency punch of the PA also added a level of excitement to the bass drum. The overall sensation was a chestier one." ...|$|E
