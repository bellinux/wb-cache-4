2500|$|Bernini {{was born}} in Naples in 1598 to [...] Angelica Galante and Mannerist {{sculptor}} Pietro Bernini, originally from Florence. He was the sixth of their thirteen children. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was the definition of childhood genius. He was “recognized as a prodigy {{when he was only}} eight years old, [...] he was consistently encouraged by his father, Pietro. His precocity earned him the admiration and favor of powerful patrons who hailed him as ‘the Michelangelo of his century’”. In 1606 his father received a papal commission (to contribute a marble relief in the Cappella Paolina of Santa Maria Maggiore) and so moved from Naples to Rome, taking his entire family with him. Sometime thereafter, word about the great talent of the boy Gian Lorenzo got around and he soon caught the attention of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, nephew to the reigning pope, Paul V, who spoke of the boy genius to his uncle. Bernini was therefore presented before Pope Paul V, curious to see if the stories about Gian Lorenzo's talent were true. The boy improvised a sketch of Saint Paul for <b>the</b> <b>marveling</b> pope, and this {{was the beginning of the}} pope’s attention on this young talent. Once he was brought to Rome, he never left. Rome was Bernini’s city. “For Bernini there could be only one Rome. ‘You are made for Rome,’ said Pope Urban VIII to him, ‘and Rome for you’”. It was in this world of 17th-century Rome and religious power that Bernini created his greatest works.|$|E

60|$|Among memorable {{custodians}} in Italy was one whom we saw at Pisa, {{where we}} stopped {{on our way}} from Leghorn after our accident in the Maremma, and spent an hour in viewing the Quattro Fabbriche. The beautiful old town, which every one knows from the report of travellers, one yet finds possessed of the incommunicable charm which keeps it forever novel to the visitor. Lying upon {{either side of the}} broad Arno, it mirrors in the flood architecture almost as fair and noble as that glassed in the Canalazzo, and its other streets seemed as tranquil as the canals of Venice. Those over which we drove, on the day of our visit, were paved with broad flag-stones, and gave out scarcely a sound under our wheels. It was Sunday, and no one was to be seen. Yet the empty and silent city inspired us with no sense of desolation. The palaces were in perfect repair; the pavements were clean; behind those windows we felt that there must be a good deal of easy, comfortable life. It is said that Pisa {{is one of the few}} places in Europe where the sweet, but timid spirit of Inexpensiveness--everywhere pursued by Railways--still lingers, and that you find cheap apartments in those well-preserved old palaces. No doubt it would be worth more to live in Pisa than it would cost, for the history of the place would alone be to any reasonable sojourner a perpetual recompense, and a princely income far exceeding his expenditure. To be sure, the Tower of Famine, with which we chiefly associate the name of Pisa, has been long razed to the ground, and built piecemeal into the neighboring palaces, but you may still visit the dead wall which hides from view the place where it stood; and you may thence drive on, as we did, to the great Piazza where stands the unrivaledest group of architecture in the world, after that of St. Mark's Place in Venice. There is the wonderful Leaning Tower, there is the old and beautiful Duomo, there is the noble Baptistery, there is the lovely Campo-Santo, and there--somewhere lurking in portal or behind pillar, and keeping out an eagle-eye for <b>the</b> <b>marveling</b> stranger--is the much-experienced cicerone who shows you through the edifices. Yours is the fourteen-thousandth American family to which he has had the honor of acting as guide, and he makes you feel an illogical satisfaction in thus becoming a contribution to statistics.|$|E

Aged 6, Morris moved {{with his family to}} the Georgian Italianate mansion at Woodford Hall, Woodford, Essex, which was {{surrounded}} by 50 acres of land adjacent to Epping Forest. He took an interest in fishing with his brothers as well as gardening in the Hall's grounds, and spent much time exploring the Forest, where he was fascinated both by the Iron Age earthworks at Loughton Camp and Ambresbury Banks and by the Early Modern Hunting Lodge at Chingford. He also took rides through the Essex countryside on his pony, and visited the various churches and cathedrals throughout <b>the</b> country, <b>marveling</b> at their architecture. His father took him on visits outside of the county, for instance to Canterbury Cathedral, the Chiswick Horticultural Gardens, and to the Isle of Wight, where he adored Blackgang Chine.

Kasliwal did the most he could to obtain precious gems to work with for his pieces. He once rode through the mines of Golconda accompanied by winding roads to acquire a rare stone.|$|R

40|$|Developed {{from two}} papers read at Cambridge in October, 1928 (to the Arts Society at Newnham and the Odtaa at Girton), A Room of One's Own {{is a book}} written by Virginia Woolf which {{examines}} the nature and ramifications {{of the relationship between}} the masculine artistic consciousness that has dominated art and fiction, and the feminine artistic consciousness that has been denied expression. This relationship, the author suggests, is unbalanced, unhealthy, and can be rectified only by establishing an androgynous consciousness; that is, a recognition that in each person's mind, male and female traits exist and must cooperate before truly great work can be achieved. The book begins by tracing the narrator's visits to two colleges, the first for men, the second for women. In the men's college, she sits at the bank of a river to reflect on the nature of women and fiction, then walks through <b>the</b> campus, <b>marveling</b> at <b>the</b> opulent buildings, and finally has a sumptuous lunch of partridges, sole, wine and cream. Later, at the women's college, she notes the austere surroundings, the lack of "amenities," and the simple food, which cause her to "burst out in scorn at the reprehensible poverty of our sex" (p. 21) ...|$|R
