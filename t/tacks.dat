5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little <b>tacks</b> in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of <b>tacks,</b> and me and Guy and Jon spent a couple of hours pushing <b>tacks</b> into the piano hammers.|$|E

Abyss, now joined by Rhino, {{went on to}} feud with both Reign and Rellik leading into Turning Point. The four were promoted to fight in a Match of 10,000 <b>Tacks</b> at the event, but Rhino ended up being replaced by Raven due to an injury. Abyss and Raven won the contest at Turning Point.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} <b>tacks.</b> In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay.

5|$|TNA held a No Disqualification {{match between}} Abyss, who was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell, and Sabu next. Its duration was 11 minutes and 30 seconds. This was originally promoted as Abyss versus Sabu, however, a No Disqualification stipulation was added during the event. In a No Disqualification match, weapons are legal, as well as outside interference, with a victor determined only by pinfall or submission. In the final minutes, Abyss retrieved a bag of thumbtacks which were hidden under the ring. He then poured the contents onto the ring mat before slamming Sabu back-first into the <b>tacks</b> with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The Match of 10,000 <b>Tacks</b> was up next, pitting Abyss and Raven against Black Reign and Rellik. Rhino was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} a part of the match, but was removed due to a neck injury he sustained in a previous match; he was replaced with Raven. The encounter lasted fourteen minutes and forty-one seconds. Raven forced Reign through a table covered with thumbtacks during the contest. The team of Abyss and Raven won the bout, after Abyss slammed Rellik into a pile of thumbtacks and then gained the pinfall victory. Abyss required stitches as a result of this match.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was between A.J. Styles and Abyss, {{in which the}} winner {{received}} an NWA World Heavyweight Championship match at Hard Justice. Its duration was 18 minutes even. The match began on the outside as Styles performed a front-flip onto Abyss, who {{was standing in the}} doorway of the cage. Later, as Styles was about to enter the cage, Abyss slammed the door twice into Styles, while the second door slam the second hit him in the face and caused him to crash to the floor and to bleed from the forehead. During the contest, Abyss used a steel chain as a weapon to help open up Styles' wound more. At one point, Abyss opened a bag and poured a large number of thumbtacks onto the mat, then proceeding to try to slam Styles into them. Styles countered and slammed Abyss face-first into the <b>tacks</b> instead with his signature maneuver, the Styles Clash. Near the end of the contest, Styles climbed the steel cage and stood on the top, but Abyss grabbed and threw the referee into the cage wall, causing Styles to fall and barely hang on. Abyss then followed by climbing the cage and by hanging Styles by the neck for a brief time with the steel chain. Then, Styles performed a sunset flip powerbomb and slammed Abyss into the <b>tacks</b> back-first. He followed by covering for the three count, winning of the encounter and earning his future title match.|$|E

5|$|Chesbro {{was sold}} by Richmond to the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 7, 1899 for $1,500 ($ in current dollar terms). He made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Pirates on July 12, 1899. He {{recorded}} a 6–9 win–loss {{record for the}} 1899 Pirates. After the season, on December 8, 1899, Chesbro was traded with George Fox, Art Madison, John O'Brien, and $25,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to the Louisville Colonels for Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke, Bert Cunningham, Mike Kelley, <b>Tacks</b> Latimer, Tommy Leach, Tom Messitt, Deacon Phillippe, Claude Ritchey, Rube Waddell, Jack Wadsworth, and Chief Zimmer. The Louisville club dissolved that offseason, and Chesbro, Fox, Madison and O'Brien were assigned to Pittsburgh in March as the National League (NL) reduced from 12 to eight teams.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a No Surrender Dog Collar {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the {{challenger}} Abyss, who was accompanied by James Mitchell. The encounter lasted 19 minutes and 17 seconds. In a Dog Collar match, both competitors are tied together at the neck by a long steel chain that {{is attached to a}} dog collar. The match is fought under no disqualification rules; in this case the only way to win was by pinfall. Abyss crashed through a table at ringside after Raven pushed him off the stage. Abyss removed the collar during the match and retrieved a bag of thumbtacks. He then poured them over the mat and ripped Raven's shirt off, before attempting to slam him into them. Cassidy Reilly interfered in the contest stopping Abyss. Later, Cassidy was shoved off the ring apron by Abyss and he crashed through a table. Raven followed by slamming Abyss back-first into the <b>tacks</b> with a powerbomb and covered for a near-fall. Abyss also gained a near-fall on Raven after slamming him into the mat back-first with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver. Raven finally won the contest following forcing Abyss head-first into thumbtacks with his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver to retain the championship. Following the bout, a segment took place between Raven and Jeff Jarrett, which ended when Rhino made his TNA debut and tackled Raven with his signature Gore maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, <b>tacks,</b> called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve patient outcome {{and quality of life}} after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, resorbable {{fixation}} devices have been developed to allow adequate mesh fixation while minimizing accompanying side-effects as <b>tack</b> erosion and adhesion formation. In experimental set-up, 24 pigs were treated by laparoscopic mesh placement. Two different meshes (PP/ORC and PP/ePTFE) and four fixation devices were evaluated: a 6. 4 mm poly(D,L) -lactide pushpin (<b>tack</b> I), a 6. 8 mm poly(D,L) -lactide with blunt tip (<b>tack</b> II), a 4. 1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) (<b>tack</b> III) and one titanium <b>tack</b> (control <b>tack).</b> A first group of animals (n = 12) was euthanized after 2 weeks survival and a second group (n = 12) after 6 months. At euthanasia, a relaparoscopy was performed to assess adhesion formation followed by laparotomy with excision of the entire abdominal wall. Tensile strength of the individual fixation systems was tested {{with the use of a}} tensiometer by measuring the force to pull the <b>tack</b> out of the mesh. Additionally, the foreign body reaction to the fixation systems was evaluated histologically as was their potential degradation. At 2 weeks the tensile strength was significantly higher for the control <b>tack</b> (31. 98 N/cmA(2)) compared to the resorbable devices. Except for <b>tack</b> II, the tensile strength was higher when the devices were fixed in a PP/ePTFE mesh compared to the PP/ORC mesh. After 6 months only <b>tack</b> III was completely resorbed, while <b>tack</b> I (9. 292 N/cmA(2)) had the lowest tensile strength. At this time-point similar tensile strength was observed for both <b>tack</b> II (29. 56 N/cmA(2)) and the control <b>tack</b> (27. 77 N/cmA(2)). Adhesions seem to be more depending on the type of mesh, in favor of PP/ePTFE. At long term, the 4. 1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) <b>tack</b> was the only <b>tack</b> completely resorbed while the 6. 8 mm poly(D,L) -lactide <b>tack</b> with blunt tip reached equal strengths to the permanent <b>tack...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractTracking, the pick-up of {{bituminous}} materials by paving equipment tires, can occur when <b>tack</b> coat emulsion was not appropriately applied. This tracking {{can result in}} the existing pavement {{with little or no}} <b>tack</b> coat left in the wheel paths, leading to slippage and delamination. A special <b>tack</b> coat material, trackless <b>tack,</b> which does not track or pick up on paving equipment, has been developed. While researches have been conducted on the trackless <b>tack</b> shear strength evaluation, little work has been done on its cracking performance. Interface cracking performance of one type trackless <b>tack</b> at two application rates was evaluated using the composite specimen interface cracking (CSIC) test. The testing system involves repeated tensile loading and monitoring of the rate of damage development (reduction in stiffness) on composite specimens. Results indicated that trackless <b>tack</b> interface reduced the pavement top-down cracking performance as compared with conventional <b>tack</b> coat. However, it was reported in literature that trackless <b>tack</b> had superior shear strength than conventional <b>tack.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that both shear strength along the interface and cracking resistance across the interface should be evaluated for any interface bond agents...|$|R
