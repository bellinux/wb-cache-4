60|$|At this <b>the</b> Herr <b>Mayor</b> {{scratched}} his head, and hemmed and hawed. No; Jacob could not marry Gretchen yet, {{for he had}} always said and sworn {{that the man who}} should marry Gretchen should bring with him a plough that could go of itself, and plough three furrows at once. If Jacob would show him such a plough as that, then he might marry Gretchen and welcome. That was what <b>the</b> Herr <b>Mayor</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, {{shortly before}} the twentieth anniversary of the riots, an {{editorial}} in The Jewish Week wrote: [...] "A divisive debate {{over the meaning of}} pogrom, lasting for more than two years, could have easily been ended if <b>the</b> <b>mayor</b> simply <b>said</b> to <b>the</b> victims of Crown Heights, yes, I understand why you experienced it as a pogrom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was a fool, Mistress Anthony," [...] <b>the</b> <b>mayor</b> <b>said</b> angrily, [...] "ever {{to yield}} to your persuasions in that matter. It was unfortunate, of course, that the boy's father, the husband of your Cousin Margaret, should have been turned out of his living by the Sectarians, as befell {{thousands}} of other clergymen besides him.

6000|$|... "The boy {{is not a}} bad boy," [...] <b>the</b> <b>mayor</b> <b>said,</b> well pleased as he {{laid down}} the letter. [...] "It may be that I have judged him too harshly, seeing that he set himself against what was best for his welfare. Still, one cannot expect men's heads on boys' shoulders, and he writes dutifully and properly. I believe it is the fault of Andrew Carson, who was forever edging me on by reports of the boy's laziness and carelessness. He {{certainly}} has a grudge against him, and he assuredly exceeded his place and authority when he lifted his hand against my wife's cousin. It seems to me truly that I have acted somewhat hastily and wrong headedly in the matter. I shall give Master Carson notice {{that at the end of}} a month I shall require his services no longer--the fellow puts himself too forward. That will please Mary; she never liked him, and women in these matters of likes and dislikes are shrewder than we are. Perhaps when she hears that he is going, and reads this letter, which I will forward to her by the carrier, she may come back to me. I certainly miss her sorely, and the household matters go all wrong now that she is away. She ought not to have said things to me; but no wise man thinks anything of what a woman says when she's angry; and now that I think things over, it certainly seems to me that she had some sort of warrant for her words. Yes, I certainly don't know what can have come over me, unless it was that fellow, Andrew Carson. Richard Anthony has not been considered a bad fellow else he would never have become the Mayor of Southampton; and for fifteen years Mary and I have got on very well together, save for the little disputes which have arisen from her over masterful disposition. But she is a good wife--none could wish for better--though she is given to flame out at what she considers unrighteous dealings; but every woman has her faults, and every man too as far as that goes, and upon the whole few of them have less than Mary. I will write to her at once." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If {{you must}} hang somebody, {{then let it}} be me," [...] <b>the</b> <b>mayor</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr Pecksniff was {{observed}} too, closely. When {{he talked to}} <b>the</b> <b>Mayor,</b> they <b>said,</b> Oh, really, what a courtly man he was!
