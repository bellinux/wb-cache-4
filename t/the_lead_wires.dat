Compliant bonding is a unique method of forming this type of solid state bond between a gold lead and a gold surface since heat and pressure is transmitted through a compliant or deformable media. The use of the compliant medium ensures the physical integrity of the lead by controlling the extent of wire deformation.

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> and deliverying <b>the</b> ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> <b>the</b> onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|R

50|$|A Thermosonic bond {{is formed}} using {{a set of}} {{parameters}} which include ultrasonic, thermal and mechanical (force) energies. Figure 1 shows a diagram of a Thermosonic Bonding machine which includes a magnetostrictive or piezoelectric-type transducer {{which is used to}} convert electrical energy into vibratory motion which is known as Piezoelectricity. The vibratory motion travels along the coupler system, a portion which is tapered to serve as the velocity transformer. The velocity transformer amplifies the oscilliatory motion and delivers it to a heated bonding tip. It is akin to a friction bond, since the introduction of ultrasonic energy (via a bonding tool vertically attached to an ultrasonic transformer or horn) simultaneously delivers a force and vibratory or scrubbing motion to the interfacial contact points between a pre-heated deforming lead-wire and the metallized pads of a silicon integrated circuit (Figure 2). In addition to the delivery of thermal energy, the transmission of ultrasonic vibratory energy creates an ultrasonic softening effect by interacting at the atomic lattice level of <b>the</b> preheated <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> These two softening effects dramatically facilitates <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> deformation by forming the desirable contact area using relatively low temperatures and forces. As a result of the frictional action and ultrasonic softening induced in <b>the</b> preheated <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> during <b>the</b> bonding cycle, thermosonic bonding can be used to reliably bond high melting point <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> (such as gold and lower cost aluminum and copper) using relatively low bonding parameters. This ensures that the fragile and costly silicon integrated circuit chip is not exposed to potentially damaging conditions by having to use higher bonding parameters (ultrasonic energy, temperatures or mechanical forces) to deform <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> in forming <b>the</b> required contact area during the bonding process.|$|R

40|$|For {{calculations}} and measurements of transient characteristics of groundings, {{the current and}} potential lead wires are frequently used accordingly to inject the current into the grounding and find the grounding potential rise (GPR). The results of the {{calculations and}} measurements can be dependent on {{the location of the}} current and potential lead wires due to mutual influence between them and the grounding wire. It is important to determine to what extent the location of the wires influences the calculation results for the grounding with a simple configuration. Notably, in contrast to the measurements, for the calculations it is possible to locate wires vertically, also the potential lead wire can be replaced by the integral of the electric field. For the calculations the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) has been used in the work. In order to estimate to what extent the calculated GPR can be influenced by location of the wires, calculations with different wires locations have been carried out. An analysis of the calculation results has been made. There are calculation methods in which the injection of the current and calculation of the GPR are performed without the current and potential lead wires. The method based on the telegrapher's equations is one of such methods. In order to determine what location of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> gives the same calculation results as those of the method that uses the telegrapher's equations, a comparison of calculation results of two methods has been made. Based on the calculation results it can be concluded that the calculated transient characteristics depend to a different extent on such factors as mutual location of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> and the grounding wire, replacing the potential lead wire by the integral of the electric field, electrical parameters of the soil. Location of one of <b>the</b> <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> above the grounding wire significantly reduces the calculated GPR.

Although the study was primarily concerned with the errors of the thermistors when used in Meteorological rocket soundings between about 70 km and 30 km altitude the results are also valid for other applications of these thermistors at all altitudes down to sea level. Several distinct sources of error are present, and these have each been discussed and estimates of their magnitude made from laboratory tests. In general, all errors increase rapidly above about 50 km. Certain items which had not been fully considered in previous discussions of this problem hale been shown to be highly significant.
