5|$|Meanwhile, Jack's Valentine's dinner {{plans with}} his girlfriend Elisa (Salma Hayek) are {{postponed}} {{when they have to}} attend church. Jack calls his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy), telling him to hold his dinner reservations. Before they can leave church, Elisa tells Jack that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to confession. After horrifying the priest (Zak Orth) with his admissions, Elisa becomes furious with Jack and breaks up with him. Later, however, she laments her fight with Jack. After finding a McFlurry coupon in the collection plate, she believes it is a sign from God because both she and Jack love the McDonald's dessert. The two reconcile their relationship as a result, and spend Valentine's Day together at a McDonald's.|$|E
5|$|The first book, The Quest Begins, {{shows how}} {{each of the}} four bears are either {{abandoned}} or separated from their parents. Kallik is separated from her mother and brother when a pod of orcas (killer whales) eat her mother, while her brother was still {{on the other side of}} the canal, thinking they were both dead. After this, Kallik travels to find her brother. Toklo is abandoned by his mother after his brother, Tobi, dies and his mother sees how the salmon is disappearing, and left Toklo to travel alone. Lusa was born and raised in a zoo. Her story intertwines with Toklo's after his mother is brought to the zoo and Lusa hears of the wild. Hoping to leave her home, she escapes the zoo and looks for Toklo. Meanwhile, Toklo finds Ujurak injured and helps him; they begin to travel together. They meet up with Lusa at the end of the book. By Great Bear Lake, the four bears have joined together and they try to go to the Arctic. Although Kallik finds her brother Taqqiq, he has joined a group of bullying bears who kidnap a black bear cub. Taqqiq sees that what he did was wrong and joins the questing bears but he soon leaves the group in the third book when he feels he does not belong with them. The remaining four cubs learn of a place called the Last Great Wilderness in the third book, where there is plentiful food and shelter. After defying hardships such as hunger and bear hunters, they finally make it to the Last Great Wilderness. However, even though they are there, Ujurak, who leads the journey, feels that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> further, into the Arctic. In Fire in the Sky, the bears leave the Last Great Wilderness and travel towards the Arctic. In the sixth and final book of the first series, Spirits in the Stars, the four bears make it to Star Island, a place where many polar bears live. They find a sick mother polar bear and her cub. The mother dies from sickness and the four bears look after her cub. Toklo finds that he also struggles with his urge to become a brown bear and travel alone. The bears save the polar bears that inhabit Star Island by destroying an oil rig that was poisoning the seals that they eat, but Ujurak dies in an avalanche while saving the others. Yakone, a young white bear who lived on the strange Star Island with the sick bears, is added to the group of bears on the last page of the book.|$|E

5|$|Despite Scotland {{having the}} {{advantage}} in the group, thanks to a superior goal difference, {{they went into the}} game as underdogs due to a number of their senior players being unavailable due to either injury or suspension, and because they had lost to Wales in the return fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow the previous March. Despite this, Scotland achieved the draw <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the next stage of qualifying, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating Wales from the competition.|$|R
25|$|Although {{distinguishing}} between different {{branches of the}} social scientific studies of law allows us to explain and analyse {{the development of the}} sociology of law in relation to mainstream sociology and legal studies, such potentially artificial distinctions are not necessarily fruitful {{for the development of the}} field as whole.

Upon revealing an embarrassing secret of the guard's, the man lets them in without hesitation.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} too many {{civilian}} aircraft {{and not enough}} airfields to support them. This meant many government civilians couldn't get <b>to</b> where <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on time. The Special Air Mission was created to ensure military airplanes were available to transport government employees between military bases. SAM Aircraft also had priority to land at civilian airfields, although this practice became less common as years went on.|$|R

He insists <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the tunnel, but Abraham will not risk Eugene's life as there are sounds of walkers from within it, and decide {{it is time to}} part ways. He {{provides}} Glenn and Tara some supplies and flashlights, and tells them to retreat to the road if they get stuck, before they drive off. In the tunnel, Tara apologizes to Glenn, believing her actions in trusting The Governor led to the death of many of Glenn's friends, including Hershel, Maggie's father. Glenn accepts her apology, but then they are suddenly set on by walkers. Tara's injury slows them down and they appear trapped when suddenly Maggie (Lauren Cohan), Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green), and Bob (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) appear from {{the opposite end of the}} tunnel, along with Abraham, Eugene, and Rosita. They clear out the walkers to allow Glenn and Tara to escape. Glenn and Maggie have a tearful reunion, and then proper introductions are made. Tara keeps quiet about her role in Maggie's father's death. While Abraham insists they continue to Washington D.C., the collective group, including Eugene, agree they should finish the trip to Terminus, as their friends may also be there. The merged group finally reach Terminus, a secured trainyard, and enter with ease. A woman named Mary (Denise Crosby) welcomes them and offers them some meat.|$|E
500|$|With the film's success, it was {{immediately}} decided to finish Superman II. Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler {{did not ask}} Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, [...] "I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as {{he has nothing to}} say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me." [...] Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. As a result, Kidder was only given a cameo appearance for Superman III, and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, [...] "It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds." [...] Two more films, Superman III (1983) and [...] (1987), were produced. Superman Returns was released in 2006. Director Bryan Singer credited the 1978 Superman as an influence for Superman Returns, and used restored footage of Brando as Jor-El. [...] also was released in 2006.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

50|$|Drying {{off in the}} boat, {{the three}} commisserated on losing Rebecca Stein again, but were glad to have {{recovered}} half of the spear tip—O'Neal had secretly swapped Dieterhoffmann's spear tip bundle with a bundle containing the Celtic weapon fragment. They spied a submarine snorkel, closing to provide an escort for the Nazis on the ferry. An underwater mine exploded, causing O'Neal and the spear tip to be knocked out of the ship. After grabbing the spear tip, Indiana dove in to pull O'Neal to safety.

2500|$|Another {{highlight}} in {{the debate}} happened when candidates were asked by Chris Matthews if <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Congress to get authorization to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities, if they were president of the United States. While Hunter, Huckabee, McCain, Thompson and Giuliani replied they would not obtain Congressional authorization {{if there was an}} imminent threat from Iran. Romney replied, [...] "You sit down with your attorneys and (they) tell you what you have to do..." [...] Paul advocated obtaining Congressional authorization, which he claimed is mandated by the US Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{children}} {{no longer}} wear diapers when past {{two to four}} years of age, depending on culture, diaper type, parental habits, and the child's personality. [...] However, it is becoming increasingly common for children as old as five to still be wearing diapers because of their parents' neglect or the child's opposition to toilet training. [...] This can pose a number of problems if the child is sent to school wearing diapers, including teasing from classmates and health issues resulting from soiled diapers. [...] Teachers' groups—who are attributing the epidemic to an increase in full-time day care use—are requesting that diapered children be banned from the classroom. [...] The disposable diaper industry has been accused of encouraging this trend by manufacturing diapers in increasingly larger sizes. [...] "uper-comfortable diapers" [...] have also been criticized; the advanced technology in modern diapers wick wetness away from skin, leaving the child oblivious to their accident and when <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the toilet. [...] Paediatric nurse June Rogers claims that the attitude of parents {{plays a major role in}} the problem, and that toilet training is simply not a priority for many of them.|$|E
2500|$|He is {{eventually}} {{rescued from the}} castle by his son, and they learn that Donovan is also working with the Nazis. Henry convinces Indiana that the Grail must not {{be taken by the}} Nazis and that <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Berlin to reclaim his Grail diary to complete the quest. During the course of the adventure, Marcus is captured and when Indiana goes to battle the Nazis, Henry tries to rescue Marcus himself. During the course of the battle, Henry blows up a truck full of Nazis, saving Indiana's life. Eventually, working together, Marcus and Henry manage to escape the tank they're trapped in. When Indy nearly falls to his death off a cliff after fighting Nazis on a tank, Henry is horrified when he thinks his son has died, and is greatly relieved when Indy reveals himself to be alive and well. Henry is shot by Donovan in the film's climax, but Indiana finds the Grail in time and uses it to heal his wounds. Henry returns the favor by rescuing Indiana from a rift (created when Elsa crosses a seal with the Grail), imploring his son to let the Grail go, even calling him by his nickname [...] "Indiana" [...] {{for the first time and}} implying that he cares more about Indiana than the Grail.|$|E
50|$|The {{music of}} Flayed Disciple is {{composed}} by every band member; the lyrics on 'Death Hammer' {{were written by}} Tolfree and Whyte. Their lyrical content has come up against some controversy in recent times, as the themes of serial killers, rape, murder, paedophilia and atheism feature in most songs. The musical style is heavily influenced by the early 80's thrash metal scene from the Bay Area of California. Bands such as Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer are the reason they started writing music. Recently, heavier bands such as Cannibal Corpse, Demolition Hammer, Napalm Death and Deicide have provided the influence <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> from a thrash band to a thrash/death crossover.|$|R
5000|$|By 1972, Summit {{once again}} made a {{proposition}} and had convinced Lockheed {{that with the}} competition in the field, {{and the success of}} their work, <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> commercial. It was then that Dialog was established as a commercial information retrieval business. It became an independent company and was a success from that point on (Summit, 2002). [...] In 1981, Dialog Information Services became a subsidiary of Lockheed Corporation and in 1988 they were purchased for $353 million by Knight-Ridder, Inc.

Within days of the modification teams arrival on the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) all F-14 Tomcats had complete ROVER capability. Before ROVER, ground controllers had to rely on [...] "visual talk-ons" [...] to hunt enemy ground forces and would use a map to guide pilots where <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> A joint VF-31/VF-213 investigation revealed that {{it would be possible to}} modify the F-14D Super Tomcat with off-the-shelf technology for only 800 dollars per aircraft.|$|R
60|$|I {{tell this}} little story at some length, as an {{instance}} of what these islands have cost us in blood and treasure. I have heard it regretted that we restored Martinique to the French, and kept St. Lucia instead. But in so doing, the British Government acted {{at least on the}} advice which Rodney had given as early as the year 1778. St. Lucia, he held, would render Martinique and the other islands of little use in war, owing to its windward situation and its good harbours; for from St. Lucia every other British island might receive speedy succour. He advised that the Little Carenage should be made a permanent naval station, with dockyard and fortifications, and a town built there by Government, which would, in his opinion, have become a metropolis for the other islands. And indeed, Nature had done her part to make such a project easy of accomplishment. But Rodney's advice was not taken--any more than his advice to people the island, by having a considerable quantity of land in each parish allotted to ten-acre men (i.e. white yeomen), under penalty of forfeiting it to the Crown should it be ever converted to any other use than provision ground (i.e. thrown into sugar estates). This advice shows that Rodney's genius, though, with the prejudices of his time, he supported not only slavery, but the slave-trade itself, had perceived one of the most fatal weaknesses of the slave-holding and sugar-growing system. And well it would have been for St. Lucia if his advice had been taken. But neither ten-acre men nor dockyards were ever established in St. Lucia. The mail-steamers, if <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into dock, have, I am ashamed to say, to go to Martinique, where the French manage matters better. The admirable Carenage harbour is empty; Castries remains a little town, small, dirty, dilapidated, and unwholesome; and St. Lucia itself is hardly to be called a colony, but rather the nucleus of a colony, which may become hereafter, by energy and good government, a rich and thickly-peopled garden up to the very mountain-tops.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the pilots}} for Banquet Light would be {{students}} {{who had not yet}} graduated. The scheme required that trainee pilots were introduced to bombing at an early stage in their instruction – just in case <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into action immediately. Instructors were told to [...] "take every opportunity to carry out practice bombing." [...] However, with no dummy bombs available early in 1940, training exercises were carried out with the aircraft flown from the front cockpit by instructors and house bricks were thrown over the side from the rear cockpit.

25|$|The FCC model {{predicts the}} {{specific}} form of reverse dominance display needed by female coalitions resisting would-be dominant or philanderer males. Females <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> signal 'No' by constructing themselves as inviolable using red cosmetics. To assert ritual power, <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> periodically on 'sex strike'. To defend themselves physically against harassment by non-kin males, defiant females <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> {{draw on the}} support of male kin—sons and brothers—as members of their reverse dominance coalitions. In order to reverse signals of sexual availability, it was logical to sing and dance an unmistakable message: 'Wrong species, wrong sex, wrong time!'. On this basis, FCC theory leads us to expect 'divine' or 'totemic' spiritual entities depicted in early rock art to be therianthropic ('wrong species'), gender-ambivalent ('wrong sex') and blood-red ('wrong time') (figure h).|$|R
