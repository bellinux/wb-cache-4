5|$|A valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, {{elevated}} {{air current}} that emerges above {{the intersection of}} <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20m/s (45mph or 72km/h) at a height of 40–200 m above the ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation, but are significantly weaker.|$|E
5|$|After Davis's death {{early in}} 1915, Lord Carnarvon {{acquired}} the concession to excavate <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> <b>and</b> he employed Howard Carter to explore it. After a systematic search, they discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922.|$|E

5|$|U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt camped with John Muir near Glacier Point {{for three}} days in May 1903. During that trip, Muir {{convinced}} Roosevelt {{to take control of}} <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> the grove away from California and give it to the federal government. On June 11, 1906, Roosevelt signed a bill that did precisely that, and the superintendent's headquarters was moved from Wawona to Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the county}} {{line in the}} town of Caton, NY225 {{continues}} west through the gully for another , slowly rising in elevation as it heads past a small number of isolated homes. The creek reaches its source near NY225's junction with the southern terminus of CR34 (Whiskey Creek Road), at which point the route ascends out of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> heads southwest across lightly developed, relatively level terrain to the small hamlet of Caton. In the center of the community, NY225 intersects CR32 (Caton–Seeley Creek Road) and CR120 (Tannery Creek Road). NY225 turns northwest at this intersection, becoming Caton Road as it follows Caton Creek out of the hamlet.|$|E

5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single carriageway road, coming out of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> up to {{the crest of the}} Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} {{connection}} between Tyrol and Milan, the Grisons {{and in particular the}} Val Müstair became strategically important to the Habsburgs. The Umbrail Pass in the Val Müstair connects the Vinschgau valley (Val Venosta) in southern Tyrol with the Valtellina in northern Italy. Furthermore, the Habsburgs and the Bishop of Chur had been quarrelling over the judicial rights over the region for some time. On January 20, 1499, Habsburg troops occupied <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> plundered the Benedictine Convent of Saint John at Müstair, but were soon driven back by the forces of the Three Leagues, and an armistice was signed already on February 2 in Glurns (Glorenza), a village in the upper Vinschgau.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} on Apollo 17 {{show that the}} valley is composed primarily of feldspar-rich breccia in the large massifs surrounding <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> basalt underlying the valley floor, covered by an unconsolidated layer of regolith, or mixed materials, formed by various geologic events. Taurus–Littrow {{was selected as the}} Apollo 17 landing site after the other candidates were eliminated for various reasons. The landing site was chosen with the objectives of sampling highland material and young volcanic material in the same location.|$|E

5|$|Derwent Valley Mills is a World Heritage Site {{along the}} River Derwent in Derbyshire, England, {{designated}} in December 2001. It {{is administered by}} the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership. The modern factory, or 'mill', system was born here in the 18th century to accommodate the new technology for spinning cotton developed by Richard Arkwright. With advancements in technology, it became possible to produce cotton continuously. The system was adopted throughout <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> <b>and</b> later spread so that by 1788 there were over 200Arkwright-type mills in Britain. Arkwright's inventions and system of organising labour was exported to Europe and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Each October the Chew Valley Arts trail {{takes place}} in venues around the valley during which over 50 local artists display their works in such media as painting, printmaking, sculpture, {{decorative}} glass, pottery, photography, jewellery and sugar craft. <b>The</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> lakes have been an inspiration to artists {{and there is a}} small art gallery at Chew Valley Lake. Live music and comedy events take place in local pubs and village halls, with the village of Pensford holding a music festival every year.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Yosemite National Park, tourists began to travel into the Merced Canyon and Yosemite Valley as early as 1855. The first roads were constructed into Yosemite Valley in the 1870s. The first was Coulterville Road, followed by Big Oak Flat Road, a trading route from Stockton to Merced Canyon. Environmental movements led by John Muir and Robert Underwood Johnson convinced the U.S. Congress to establish Yosemite National Park in 1890. With {{the creation of the}} national park tourism to <b>the</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>and</b> the Merced River increased significantly, leading to many other roads being built throughout the upper Merced River watershed. Other national forests protecting more of the Merced River upper basin followed, including Sierra National Forest and Stanislaus National Forest.|$|E

5|$|Excavations at {{the pyramid}} of Sahure in Abusir under the {{direction}} of Miroslav Verner and Tarek El-Awady in the early 2000s provide a picture of the royal family of the early 5th Dynasty. In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen Neferhetepes II. She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf, as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf, which makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further confirmed by the discovery of Sahure's cartouche in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at Saqqara, indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to California, Col. Alexander was {{appointed}} president of a board appointed by the U.S. Congress to study the potential of irrigating the San Joaquin Valley, Tulare Valley, and Sacramento Valley. The board, which {{became known as the}} Alexander Commission, conducted a survey of the California Central Valley throughout the summer and fall of 1873. The Commission's report declared that large-scale irrigation was possible and that much land could be reclaimed from the swamps around the Sacramento River. The report was not initially acted upon, but was the first professional survey of <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> <b>and</b> set the stage for further development.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} stay {{just for}} the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion in the valley {{is a serious problem}} during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle bus system operates year-round in <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> <b>and</b> park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E
