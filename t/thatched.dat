5|$|<b>Thatched</b> House Lodge was the London home of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower {{during the}} Second World War. Since 1963 {{it has been}} the {{residence}} of Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy. The residence was originally built as two houses in 1673 for two Richmond Park Keepers, as Aldridge Lodge. Enlarged in 1727, the two houses were joined and renamed <b>Thatched</b> House Lodge in 1771 by Sir John Soane. The gardens include an 18th-century two-room <b>thatched</b> summer house which gave the main house its name.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{attraction}} is the nearby <b>thatched</b> two-storey monks' reredorter or lavatory, {{which is considered}} unique in Britain.|$|E
5|$|One of the <b>thatched</b> {{houses in}} Little Thetford was {{destroyed}} by fire. Reported in the Cambridge Chronicle 6 November 1930, {{the cause of the}} fire at the c.13th-century six-room building was not known. Fireworks were being discharged {{at the other end of}} the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its <b>thatched</b> roof.|$|E
5|$|Stembridge Tower Mill in High Ham, Somerset, England, is {{the last}} {{remaining}} <b>thatched</b> windmill in England. The mill is a grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|During his infancy, he {{was raised}} in a large hale pili (<b>thatched</b> house) named Auanakeo, which stood outside the Huliheʻe Palace, the {{principal}} residence of Leleiohoku's hānai (adoptive) father Kuakini, who was the Governor of Hawaii Island.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{her brother}} {{bought a house}} in Blo Norton, <b>Thatched</b> Cottage, for his sisters and Blo Norton Hall in South Norfolk for himself. That year, Sophia {{attended}} a farewell party at the Westminster Palace Hotel for Mahatma Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|The Old <b>Thatched</b> Cottage {{restaurant}} on the seafront carries the date 1774; it is the surviving portion of a summer cottage built by the Revd. William Leeves of Wrington.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough was {{formerly}} {{reputed to be}} a habitual thief of small objects from houses, including burning wood or lighted candles, which it would use to set fire to haystacks or <b>thatched</b> roofs.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey agent's house, {{known as}} Beechams, was also {{built in the}} 1920s. There are also row of six <b>thatched</b> cottages in Tudor style, a {{farmhouse}} and a barn dating from the same period.|$|E
5|$|A new visitor centre for Hengistbury Head {{was opened}} in December 2013. The extant <b>thatched</b> barn was {{upgraded}} in an eco-friendly {{way and the}} new addition cost over a million pounds. Funds were provided by developer contributions, the Heritage Lottery Fund and £300,000 from landfill tax.|$|E
5|$|Born on 4 September 1913 in Osaka, Japan, Tange {{spent his}} early {{life in the}} Chinese cities of Hankow and Shanghai; {{he and his family}} {{returned}} to Japan after learning of the death of one of his uncles. In contrast to the green lawns and red bricks in their Shanghai abode, the Tange family took up residence in a <b>thatched</b> roof farmhouse in Imabari on the island of Shikoku.|$|E
5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period tended {{to be built in}} the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. The house itself is a <b>thatched</b> half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E
5|$|Danybryn Cheshire Home {{was once}} a private house owned by Sir Lewis Lougher MP. It later had two wings added to {{accommodate}} the residents, who are physically disabled young people. The Thatch, the only <b>thatched</b> cottage in Radyr, was built for the Mathias family in 1936. St John the Baptist parish church is nearly 800 years old, but underwent a Victorian restoration in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{there were}} {{continuing}} gradual economic improvements, {{among the most}} visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional <b>thatched</b> blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and in recent years, with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the island's populations have begun to increase after decades of decline.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the house {{deteriorated}} and was adapted {{for use as}} a school. In the late 19th century it rented as storage by a farmer. In the early 20th century the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings campaigned for its restoration and it was then taken over by the National Trust. The <b>thatched</b> stone building is rented to a tenant and has limited public access.|$|E
5|$|Pub – The White Horse in {{the village}} centre is a popular pub across the island. It {{suffered}} a fire in 1987, then again 20 years later in 2007 which saw its temporary closure. Prior to the two fires, the pub was <b>thatched,</b> however after the fire in 2007, a tiled roof was built, {{in an attempt to}} prevent future fires.|$|E
5|$|The Horseshoes is a Grade II listed {{residential}} <b>thatched</b> cottage, {{which was}} originally the Three Horseshoes public house, a 17th-century pink-painted cottage built {{to follow the}} curve of the road. April Thatch is a former public house, now a Grade II listed residential property. This white-painted early 18th-century cottage used to be the Rose & Crown.|$|E
5|$|Whitwell's built {{environment}} is characterised by its mixture {{of stone and}} <b>thatched</b> housing. There {{is a mixture of}} single and two-story houses, with most single-story housing on Bannock Road, recently developed with a small estate of bungalows. Terraced housing features in the centre of the village. The most notable house in the village is The Old Rectory, close to the church and was formerly a Bed and Breakfast.|$|E
5|$|In the 18thcentury it was {{the custom}} for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night, {{following}} a lamp-lit procession through town. This tradition lasted until 1810. In 1732, during the procession preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby, strong winds caused sparks to fly from the lighted tapers carried by mourners. The buildings {{on the west side}} of the market place, low cottages with <b>thatched</b> roofs, caught fire and were destroyed. After local fund-raising the houses were eventually replaced with brick buildings with tile roofs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century Johann Georg Kleine, Wilhelm Busch's {{maternal}} grandfather, {{settled in the}} small village of Wiedensahl. There, in 1817, he bought a <b>thatched</b> half-timbered house, where Wilhelm Busch was to be born about 15 years later. Amalie Kleine, Johann's wife and Wilhelm Busch's grandmother, kept a shop in which Busch's mother Henriette assisted while her two brothers attended high school. When Johann Georg Kleine died in 1820, his widow continued to run the shop with Henriette.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{architecture}} {{is a combination}} between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or <b>thatched</b> roofs. Sliding doors (fusuma) were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps ten {{per cent}} of the {{population}} lived in one of many burghs that {{had grown up in}} the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. A characteristic of Scottish burghs was a long main street of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. In towns, traditional <b>thatched</b> half-timbered houses were interspersed with the larger stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. Most wooden <b>thatched</b> houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-storey Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements. Many burghs acquired tollbooths in this period, which acted as town halls, courts and prisons. They often had peels of bells or clock towers and the aspect of a fortress. The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh was rebuilt on the orders of Mary Queen of Scots from 1561 and housed the parliament {{until the end of the}} 1630s. Other examples can be seen at Tain, Culross and Stonehaven, often showing influences from the Low Countries in their crow-stepped gables and steeples.|$|E
5|$|Selworthy is a {{small village}} and civil parish which {{includes}} the hamlets of Bossington, Tivington, Lynch, Brandish Street and Allerford. Bossington is separated from Porlock Bay by a shingle beach, through which flows the River Horner, forming part of the Porlock Ridge and Saltmarsh Site of Special Scientific Interest. In the 1990s rising sea levels created salt marshes, and lagoons developed in the area behind the boulder bank. The village is on the South West Coast Path. Selworthy was rebuilt as a model village, to provide housing for the aged and infirm of the Holnicote estate, in 1828 by Sir Thomas Acland. Many of the other cottages, {{some of which are}} now rented out, are still <b>thatched</b> and are listed buildings, whose walls are painted with limewash that has been tinted creamy yellow with ochre. On the hill above the village is the whitewashed 15th-century Church of All Saints, with a 14th-century tower. One of Allerford's main attractions is the much-photographed packhorse bridge. Built as a crossing over the River Aller (from which the village gets its name), it is thought to be medieval in origin. The village is also home to Allerford House, childhood home of Admiral John Moresby, who explored the coastline of New Guinea and for whom Port Moresby, the capital city of Papua New Guinea, was named. Other features of the village include <b>thatched</b> cottages, a forge and an old-fashioned red telephone box. There is also a Reading Room, built by the Acland family to foster adult education. One of the <b>thatched</b> cottages operated as the local Primary School between 1821 and 1981 and is now a museum containing the West Somerset Rural Life Museum and Victorian School. The museum houses the West Somerset Photographic Archive.|$|E
5|$|Some millipedes are {{considered}} household pests, including Xenobolus carnifex which can infest <b>thatched</b> roofs in India, and Ommatoiulus moreleti, which periodically invades homes in Australia. Other species exhibit periodical swarming behaviour, which {{can result in}} home invasions, crop damage, and train delays when the tracks become slippery with the crushed remains of hundreds of millipedes. Some millipedes can cause significant damage to crops: the spotted snake millipede (Blaniulus guttulatus) is a noted pest of sugar beets and other root crops, {{and as a result}} {{is one of the few}} millipedes with a common name.|$|E
5|$|St George's Church is a 14th-century stone {{building}} with slate roof. The roof was <b>thatched</b> until 1863, {{when the church}} was heavily restored. In 1886, it was struck by lightning and required extensive rebuilding. Today, the church consists of a chancel, nave, north porch, and south vestry. The octagonal bowl font still has an original lead lining. St. George's Church, a Grade II* listed building, {{is part of the}} Ely Team Ministry. The Baptist chapel was erected in 1867 on the site of its 1839 predecessor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Thatched</b> or tiled roofs were {{supported}} by wooden pillars, since the addition of brick, rammed earth, or mud walls of these halls did not actually support the roof. Stone and plaster were also used for domestic architecture. Tiled eaves projecting outward were built to distance falling rainwater from the walls; they {{were supported}} by dougong brackets that were sometimes elaborately decorated. Molded designs usually decorated the ends of roof tiles, as seen in artistic models of buildings and in surviving tile pieces.|$|E
5|$|The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty (informally {{known as}} the National Trust) owns or manages a range of {{properties}} in the ceremonial county of Somerset, England. These range from sites of Iron and Bronze Age occupations including Brean Down, Cadbury Camp and Cheddar Gorge to Elizabethan and Victorian era mansions, which include examples such as Montacute House and Tyntesfield. Some of the smaller properties include Coleridge Cottage and Stembridge Mill, the last remaining <b>thatched</b> windmill in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} has undergone various extensions and alterations {{since it was}} built. The {{building has}} a T shaped plan with the west projecting wing being a hall added in the late 13th century. The great hall has a 15th-century four bay open arch-braced collar-truss timber roof. The roof was covered with slate from local quarries until it was <b>thatched</b> in the mid 19th century. The current clay tiles {{were used in the}} early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} tRound House in Main Street is disputed. It has been claimed {{that it is}} a late 15th-century dovecote. A Sun firemark {{insurance}} policy still exists, number 616606, dated July 1793, the earliest known written record of the house. Other sources suggest the Round House is an 18th-century <b>thatched</b> cottage, similar to the South African rondavel. A further source claims the building is a post-medieval, AD 1540–1900, tower mill. A family of 13children lived in the building during the 19th century. The now private dwelling was re-thatched in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} <b>thatched</b> {{but now is}} tiled, and is supported by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses. The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E
5|$|There were, however, {{continuing}} gradual economic improvements, {{among the}} most visible {{of which was the}} replacement of the traditional <b>thatched</b> blackhouse with accommodation of a more modern design and with the assistance of Highlands and Islands Enterprise many of the islands' populations have begun to increase after decades of decline. The discovery of substantial deposits of North Sea oil in 1965 and the renewables sector have contributed to a degree of economic stability in recent decades. For example, the Arnish yard has had a chequered history but has been a significant employer in both the oil and renewables industries.|$|E
5|$|Upstream {{from the}} bridge is a grotto and bath house, built in a similar rustic style and presumably by the same architect. The bath house is a square vaulted chamber, with a plunge pool fed by river water. The upper chamber {{comprises}} a circular saloon with windows, although this is now roofless and in poor condition. The original roof was a conical <b>thatched</b> structure, and a niche on the exterior wall may have housed a statue.|$|E
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of <b>thatched</b> cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 the streets were paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E
5|$|High Street {{contains}} two Grade II listed public houses: Ye Olde George Inne, once a coach house, and the Ship Inn {{which has the}} oldest licence in Christchurch. A known haunt of smugglers, the Ship Inn's history {{can be traced back}} to 1688. At the end of High Street is Church Street which contains Church Hatch, a Grade II* listed Georgian residence. Once the home of Sir Owen Tudor Burne, it was saved from demolition in 1929 by public appeal. Ye Olde Eight Bells, a Grade II listed gift shop in Church Street, was once another alehouse frequented by smugglers and central to a number of local legends. Close by in Castle Street is the Perfumery, a 14th-century <b>thatched</b> property often referred to as the old courthouse; although some local historians maintain that this was next door and long gone.|$|E
5|$|Ivall's Farm House is on {{the south}} side of the road near the Star Inn. It is a timber framed and cruck-built (A-frame) tiled roof {{building}} with a lobby entrance, previously a farmhouse, originally built around 1600. The south end dates to the 18th century.The tiled roof, with four small gabled dormers, half-hipped at the north west angle, was restored in the late 20th century. It became a Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963. Holt Cottage is a small <b>thatched</b> cottage situated on the edge of the village and was built in 1503. A Grade II listed building since 31 May 1985, much of the current building dates to the 17th and early 19th centuries. The roof is half-hipped at the south end and hipped at the north, with painted brickwork in monk bond.|$|E
5|$|One of the barrows (south {{of where}} the <b>thatched</b> barn now stands) {{contained}} a high status cremation of a woman of about twenty years in age, accompanied by an incense cup, a halberd-style pendant made from amber and copper alloy, and two gold cones that would have covered buttons of an organic material. The burial-goods recovered {{are similar to those}} of the Wessex culture, the Wilsford and Dorset Ridgeway series in particular. An urn from one of the barrows likely to have been made between 1700 and 1500 B.C., has been identified as Trevisker ware, a type widely found throughout Devon and Cornwall which was transported east in lesser amounts, this find being one of the easternmost discovered.|$|E
