50|$|The TOEIC Speaking & Writing Test was {{introduced}} in 2006. Test takers receive separate scores {{for each of the}} two tests, or can take the Speaking test without taking <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>test.</b> The Speaking test assesses pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and fluency, while <b>the</b> <b>Writing</b> <b>test</b> examines vocabulary, grammar, and overall coherence and organization. The tests are designed to reflect actual English usage in the workplace, though they do not require any knowledge of specialized business terms. The TOEIC Speaking Test takes approximately 20 minutes to complete; the TOEIC writing test lasts approximately 60 minutes. Each test has a score range between 0-200, with test takers grouped into eight proficiency levels.|$|E

50|$|Many colleges use the SAT Subject Tests for admission, course placement, and {{to advise}} {{students}} about course selection. Some colleges specify the SAT Subject Tests that they require for admission or placement; others allow applicants {{to choose which}} tests to take. Students typically choose which tests to take depending upon college entrance requirements for the schools to which they plan to apply. From their introduction in 1937 until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests, and until January 2005, they were known as SAT II: Subject Tests. They are still commonly known by these names. Every test is now a one-hour timed test. Historically, {{the exception to the}} one-hour time was <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>test,</b> which was divided into a 20-minute essay question and a 40-minute multiple-choice section. <b>The</b> <b>writing</b> <b>test</b> was discontinued in January 2005.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{the first}} {{administration}} of the new SAT Reasoning Test (which includes the writing section) in March 2005, some highly selective colleges required applicants to take three SAT Subject Tests, including <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>test</b> and two other tests of the applicant's choosing, {{in addition to the}} SAT. However, with writing now a standard component of the SAT Reasoning Test, most selective colleges recommend applicants to submit scores for any two SAT Subject Tests. Engineering schools may recommend or require Chemistry or Physics and Math Level 2. A handful of the most competitive schools still require three Subject Tests in addition to the three sections of the SAT Reasoning Test, while schools such as Georgetown and Harvard, which earlier required three Subject Tests, now 'strongly recommend' taking three Subject Tests.|$|E

The focus of the study was on a survey of intermediate level students of English taking writing posttests at a Vietnamese university. <b>The</b> <b>writing</b> <b>tests</b> were collected, scored and categorized into fivepoint levels.

5000|$|Students {{in grades}} 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are tested {{in reading and}} mathematics. Students in grades 5 & 8 are tested in reading, mathematics, and science.

50|$|The College Board's Accuplacer test is a {{computer-based}} placement {{test that}} assesses reading, writing and math skills. The Accuplacer test includes reading comprehension, sentence skills, arithmetic, elementary algebra, college-level mathematics and <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>test,</b> Writeplacer. The Accuplacer test is used primarily {{by more than}} 1,000 high schools and colleges to determine a student's needed placement. Often community colleges have specific guidelines for students requiring the Accuplacer test. The Accuplacer Companion paper-and-pencil tests allows {{for students with disabilities}} to take the test through its braille, large print and audio tests. The biggest benefit of the Accuplacer and Accuplacer Companion tests are their ability to be scored immediately through an online scoring system and taken in remote locations. While there are normally no fees for taking the test, some institutions may charge a fee to retake the test. Note that if a testing institution is not local, an examinee may be required to arrange a proctor for the test. If so, a local library may be willing to serve as proctor as there are not many other options for individuals in this case. Most schools will only test their own admissions candidates.|$|E
