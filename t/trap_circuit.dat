40|$|MRI {{is proving}} to be a very useful tool for sodium {{quantification}} in animal models of stroke, ischemia, and cancer. In this work, we present the practical design of a dual-frequency RF surface coil that provides (1) H and (23) Na images of the rat head at 4 T. The dual-frequency RF surface coil comprised of a large loop tuned to the (1) H frequency and a smaller co-planar loop tuned to the (23) Na frequency. The mutual coupling between the two loops was eliminated by the use of a <b>trap</b> <b>circuit</b> inserted in the smaller coil. This independent-loop design was versatile since it enabled a separate optimisation of the sensitivity and RF field distributions of the two coils. To allow for an easy extension of this simple double-tuned coil design to other frequencies (nuclei) and dimensions, we describe in detail the practical aspects of the workbench design and MRI testing using a phantom that mimics in vivo conditions. A comparison between our independent-loop, double-tuned coil and a single-tuned (23) Na coil of equal size obtained with a phantom matching in vivo conditions, showed a reduction of the (23) Na sensitivity (about 28 %) because of signal losses in the trap inductance. Typical congruent (1) H and (23) Na rat brain images showing good SNR ((23) Na: brain 7, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid 11) and spatial resolution ((23) Na: 1. 25 x 1. 25 x 5 mm(3)) are also reported.

40|$|The growing {{availability}} of high-field magnetic resonance (MR) scanners has reignited {{interest in the}} in vivo investigation of metabolics in the body. In particular, multinuclear MR spectroscopy (MRS) data reveal physiological details inaccessible to typical proton (1 H) scans. Carbon- 13 (13 C) MRS studies draw considerable appeal owing to the enhanced chemical shift range of metabolites that may be interrogated to elucidate disease metabolism and progression. To achieve the theoretical signal-to-noise (SNR) gains at high B 0 fields, however, J-coupling from 1 H- 13 C chemical bonds must be mitigated by transmitting radiofrequency (RF) proton-decoupling pulses. This irradiated RF power is substantial and intensifies with increased decoupling bandwidth as well as B 0 field strength. The preferred 13 C MRS experiment, applying broadband proton decoupling, thus presents considerable challenges at 7 T. Localized tissue heating is a paramount concern for all high-field studies, with strict Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) limits in place to ensure patient safety. Transmit coils must operate within these power guidelines without sacrificing image and spectral quality. Consequently, RF coils transmitting proton-decoupling pulses must be expressly designed for power efficiency as well as B 1 field homogeneity. This dissertation presents innovations in high-field RF coil development that collectively improved the homogeneity, efficiency, and safety of high field 13 C MRS. A review of electromagnetic (EM) theory guided a full-wave modeling study of coplanar shielding geometries to delineate design parameters for coil transmit efficiency. Next, a novel RF coil technique for achieving B 1 homogeneity, dubbed forced current excitation (FCE), was examined and a coplanar-shielded FCE coil was implemented for proton decoupling of the breast at 7 T. To perform a series of simulation studies gauging SAR in the prone breast, software was developed to fuse a suite of anatomically-derived heterogeneous breast phantoms, spanning the standard four tissue density classifications, with existing whole-body voxel models. The effects of tissue density on SAR were presented and guidance for simulating the worst-case scenario was outlined. Finally, for improving capabilities of multinuclear coils during proton coil transmit, a high-power <b>trap</b> <b>circuit</b> was designed and tested, ultimately enabling isolation of 13 C coil elements during broadband proton decoupling pulses. Together, this work advanced the hardware capabilities of high-field multinuclear spectroscopy with immediate applicability for performing broadband proton-decoupled 13 C MRS in the breast at 7 T...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a Petri Net {{model of the}} plant. The observation is given by a subset of transitions whose occurrence is always and immediately sensed by a monitoring agent. Other transitions not in this subset are silent (unobservable). Classical on-line monitoring techniques, {{which are based on}} the estimation of {{the current state of the}} plant and the detection of the occurrence of undesirable events (faults), are not suitable for models of large systems due to high spatial complexity (exponential in the size of the entire model). In this paper we propose a method based on the explanation of plant observation. A legal trace minimally explains the observation if it includes all unobservable transitions whose firing is needed to enable the observed transitions. To do so, starting from an observable transition, using backward search techniques, a set of minimal explanations is derived, which are sufficient for detecting whether a fault event must have occurred for sure in the plant or not. The technique also allows production of a set of basis markings for the estimation of the current state of the plant. The set of all possible current markings can then be characterized as the unobservable reach of these basis markings. The computational complexity of the algorithm depends on the size of the largest connected subnet which includes only unobservable transitions. This allows monitoring of plants of any size in which there is no large unobservable subnet. We also illustrate the applicability of the method for the monitoring of a class of infinite state systems, unbounded Petri Nets with unobservable <b>trap</b> <b>circuits,</b> and we show how this can be useful for distributed implementations...|$|R

In addition to hydrogen (which is the most abundant atom with nuclear magnetic resonance capability), other species (such as 31 P or 13 C) are used as well, to obtain certain information such as metabolite concentrations in neural or muscular tissues. However, this requires nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) transmitter/receivers (coils) capable of operating at multiple frequencies, while maintaining a good performance at each frequency. The objective of this work is to discuss various design approaches used for second-nuclei RF (radio frequency) coils, and to analyze the performance of a particular design, which includes using inductor-capacitor (LC) <b>trap</b> <b>circuits</b> on a 31 P coil. The method can be easily applied to other nuclei. The main advantage of this trapping method is the enabling design of second-nuclei coils that are insertable into standard proton coils, maintaining a near-optimum performance for both nuclei. This capability is particularly applicable as MRI field strengths increase and the use of specialized proton coils becomes more prevalent. A thorough performance analysis shows the benefit of this method over other designs, which usually impose a significant signal-to-noise (SNR) sacrifice on one of the nuclei. A methodology based on a modular coil configuration was implemented, which allowed for optimization of LC trap decoupling as well as performance analysis. The 31 P coil was used in conjunction with various standard 1 H coil configurations (surface/volume/array), using the trap design to overcome the coupling problem (degraded SNR performance) mentioned above. An analytical model was developed and guidelines on trap design were provided to help optimize sensitivity. The performance was analyzed with respect to the untrapped case, using RF bench measurements as well as data obtained from the NMR scanner. Insertability of this coil design was then verified by using it with general-purpose proton coils available. Phantoms were built to mimic the phosphorus content normally found in biologic tissues in order to verify applicability of this coil for in vivo studies. The contribution of this work lies in the quantification of general design parameters to enable ?insertable? second-nuclei coils, in terms of the effects on SNR and resonance frequency of a given proton coil...|$|R

The dynamics include self heating, bias dependent change in trapped charge, and variations due to impact ionization. These are feedback mechanisms that contribute to intermodulation as a memory effect does. A FET is better viewed as a nonlinear system with feedback, bias dependent rates, and high-order nonlinear conductance and charge storage with specific terminal to terminal interaction. Identifying and characterizing FET dynamics and linearity is a key step in the design process. Extraction of true intrinsic characteristics is {{an important first step}} to understanding the physics of trapping and heating within the device. Standard measurement techniques tend to derive access networks with an emphasis on scaling with layout geometry. The intrinsic device is then modelled as whatever is left after de-embedding the measurements. As such, the intrinsic model exhibits significant frequency dispersions and behaviour that is not easily related to the operation of the transistor. A correct determination of the access network reveals that the dispersions within the intrinsic data are related to physical process, such as heating and trapping.

In areas of defense, law enforcement, pharmaceutical science, and research industries such portable instrumentation begins to fill technology gaps, increase safety and efficiency, decrease sample preparation time, and decrease lead time waiting for results. A key technology facilitating miniature mass spectrometry is the ion trap mass analyzer. In this thesis miniature ion traps have demonstrated lower RF voltage, lower power, increased mass range, smaller form factor, ion <b>trap</b> and <b>circuit</b> integration, increased <b>trapping</b> capacity through arrays, the use of wideband power amplifiers, and amenability to planar and other alternative fabrication strategies {{all of which can}} significantly reduce device size and cost. ^ Several obstacles associated with the miniaturization process have been investigated through simulation and experiment in order to mitigate their effects. First, limitations of precision machining at very small dimensions are overcome by advanced fabrication through stereolithography. Second, the large space requirement of bulky interconnects and assembly hardware is reduced through assembly-free integration of circuit board and stereolithography. Third, ion trap arrays are used to compensate for the loss of ion trapping capacity per element, thereby increasing dynamic range. Fourth, the array effect, caused by dimensional variance between array elements, is characterized and overcome by tuning at each element. Fifth, the effects of perturbations are analyzed through simulation and characterization of a ceramic ion trap. Sixth, the increased effects of nonlinear resonances caused by higher order multipoles in miniature traps are analyzed through corroboration of simulation and experiment. Seventh, limitations on scaling are described on account of collisional cooling and decreased spectral resolution. ^ New methods are introduced for ion trap fabrication, based on the fabrication method stereolithography. One rapid methodology combines 2 D and 3 D parallel processing techniques to create miniature ion traps and arrays as single contiguous units while requiring no hand assembly. This process allows the array to be designed with freedom for tuning at each element. A second extends the use of stereolithography to the fabrication of a ceramic ion trap. ^ The development of an ion trajectory simulator with a collision model has been invaluable for the characterization of events observed in miniature traps. The trajectory simulator illustrates the minimum ion cloud size under typical operating parameters, and accurately predicts the resonance ejection patterns of miniature nonlinear ion traps. It has been shown that mass range, buffer gas temperature and type, and ion trap dimensions have an increased impact on performance with the decreased scale of the ion trap. ^ The reduced scale ion <b>trap</b> and <b>circuit</b> board integration have led to the design of a small integrated ion trap vacuum chamber.

The total results (chi 2 analysis) showed significantly greater microbial growth with the use of disposable circuits (permanent versus disposable, P less than 0. 001) and extension of time to 48 -h changes (24 h versus 48 h, P less than 0. 05).

According to the characteristics of each trap it may impact the MOS transistor {{in a different way}} [1]. If a trap is more likely to cap-ture a carrier than to emit it, this trap will tend to remain occupied, producing an aging effect. BTI is an aging phenomenon attributed to this trap activity effect [2]. On the other hand, a trap which is nomena. Further-duce perc trap and se [22]. A trend is the increase of the nominal threshold voltage and decrease of the operation voltage, aiming to reduce the pow sumption. When combining these effects, the increase impact of trap activity on transistor variability becomes evident, leading to serious circuit reliability issues. Atomistic (TCAD) simu-lation results show that the impact of a single trap on a 45 nm channel length transistor might cause an increase as high as 16 % on the device threshold voltage [4], these kind of simulation, how-ever, cannot be used to study the <b>traps</b> impact in <b>circuits</b> with {{more than a couple of}} transistor due to its computational cost...|$|R
40|$|DC, AC, and the {{transient}} characteristics of granular n-type semiconductors are modelled using the drift-diffusion theory. The transient model describes the electrical large-signal response to both voltage and temperature changes. The analysis {{is based on}} the dynamic electrical model of the grain-boundary region and electronic trapping in the acceptor-type electronic interface states at the grain boundaries. The use of different approximations in the model derivation results in a simple fully analytical model and a semianalytical model, which requires numerical methods in the solution. The models are verified by performing numerical device simulations with SILVACO ATLAS. The models are also fitted to experimental data. They are in excellent agreement with ATLAS and the experimental data. Compared to ATLAS the transient calculations employing the semianalytical model are four orders of magnitude faster on a standard PC computer, yet having the same accuracy. The existence of electronic traps at grain boundaries results in nonlinear DC, extraordinary AC, and highly complex and nonlinear transient electrical characteristics. The current-voltage curves can be divided into four characteristic regions: linear, sublinear, superlinear, and series resistance limited regions. The electrical-equivalent-circuit presentations of the AC characteristics have, in addition to the common resistors and capacitors, special RL and RC circuit branches associated with the electronic <b>trapping.</b> These <b>circuit</b> branches have negative admittance. In the experimental part an atomic-layer-deposited SnO 2 microhotplate gas sensor was designed and fabricated for the first time. The sensors exhibit good response and recovery to ethanol, acetone, and acrylonitrile vapours, and good stability. In addition, the developed model is extended to the case of n-type gas-sensitive surface-type metal oxides. The adsorption of gases is described by a surface-state model. The model is employed in the quantitative explanation of the new effects in metal-oxide gas sensors: the bias-dependent sensitivity and negative admittance effects, which were observed experimentally in commercial WO 3 gas sensors. These effects can be used for increasing the selectivity of the gas sensors...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen the {{development}} of several experimental systems capable of tuning local parameters of quantum Hamiltonians. Examples include ultracold atoms, <b>trapped</b> ions, superconducting <b>circuits,</b> and photonic crystals. By design, these systems possess negligible disorder, granting them {{a high level of}} tunability. Conversely, electrons in conventional condensed matter systems exist inside an imperfect host material, subjecting them to uncontrollable, random disorder, which often destroys delicate correlated phases and precludes local tunability. The realization of a condensed matter system that is disorder-free and locally-tunable thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of locally-tunable, ultra-low-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes suspended over circuits of unprecedented complexity. Using transport experiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position along the nanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location to location. Nearly perfect mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about the centre of the nanotube establishes the negligible effects of electronic disorder, thus allowing experiments in precision engineered one-dimensional potentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes at chosen separations, generalizing these devices to coupled one-dimensional systems. These new capabilities open the door to a broad spectrum of new experiments on electronics, mechanics, and spins in one dimension. Comment: Updated version. Supplementary information include...|$|R
