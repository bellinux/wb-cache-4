40|$|We {{investigate}} how <b>tax</b> loss <b>offset</b> restrictions affect an investor's evaluation of risky investments under bounded rationality. We analytically identify behavioral tax effects for {{different levels of}} loss <b>offset</b> restrictions, <b>tax</b> rate and prospect theoretical biases (loss aversion, probability weighting and reference dependence) and find <b>tax</b> loss <b>offset</b> restrictions significantly bias investor perception, even more heavily than the tax rate. If loss offset restrictions are rather generous, investors are very loss averse or assign a huge weight to loss probabilities, taxation {{is likely to increase}} the preference value of risky investments (behavioral tax paradox). Surprisingly, the identified significant perception biases of <b>tax</b> loss <b>offset</b> restrictions occur under both high and low tax rates and thus are relatively insensitive to tax rate changes. Finally, we identify huge differences in behavioral tax effects across countries indicating that <b>tax</b> loss <b>offset</b> restrictions crucially determine the perceived tax quality of a country for risky investments. Our analysis is relevant for policy makers discussing future tax reforms as well as for investors assessing risky investment opportunities. asymmetric taxation,investment decisions,loss offset restrictions,perception bias,risktaking,tax effects,tax losses,prospect theory,behavioral taxatio...|$|R

We show that barter and offsets are linked to liquidity problems {{at the level of}} the firm and to arrears in particular. We find evidence that the state has channeled implicit subsidies to enterprises in the form of <b>tax</b> and utility <b>offsets.</b> The findings help explain the rise of non-monetary transactions during much of the 1990 s.

Our findings suggest that a policy solution to the non-cash problem would require the state and public utilities to phase out arrears and offsets.

50|$|A {{number of}} economic, {{industry}} and cultural factors influence decisions to undertake an official co-production. These factors include {{the value of}} the Australian dollar, the availability of skilled crews, access to <b>tax</b> <b>offsets</b> and other financial incentives, the generation of creative content and the signing of further bilateral agreements. Higher production budgets, falling television licence fees and lower distribution guarantees are all factors that will continue to drive the international demand for co-productions. As discussed by Hoskins, McFadyen, & Finn, Australian producers find financial pooling the most important benefit of co-production and it is likely that this will be pursued more vigorously in the future.|$|R

50|$|The Low Income <b>Tax</b> <b>Offset</b> (LITO) is a {{tax rebate}} for Australian-resident {{individuals}} on lower incomes. For 2015-16, {{in addition to the}} tax-free threshold of $18,200, the LITO is $445 until the individual's taxable income reaches $37,000. The LITO is then reduced by 1.5c for every dollar of taxable income above $37,000, and cuts out when taxable income reaches $66,667. The LITO reduces an individual's tax liability but is not refundable when the liability reaches zero, and does not reduce the Medicare levy. The LITO is calculated automatically by the ATO when a tax return is lodged.|$|E

5000|$|The Competitive Tax Plan is an {{approach}} to taxation, suggested in the United States, that would impose a 10 - 15% value added tax (VAT) and reduce personal and corporate income taxes. The plan was created by Michael J. Graetz, professor at Columbia law school, and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy. Graetz states that it would generate enough revenue so that families with $100,000 of annual income or less [...] - [...] almost 90% of all current filers [...] - [...] {{would not have to}} pay income taxes or file tax returns. Graetz would provide a new payroll <b>tax</b> <b>offset</b> to replace the Earned Income Tax Credit and to protect low and moderate income workers from any tax increase under the new system. Under the initial proposal, households with an annual income of more than $100,000 would be taxed at a flat 25% rate and the corporate income tax rate would be reduced to 25%. Graetz argues that reducing the corporate tax rate [...] "would make the United States an extremely attractive nation for corporate investments for both U.S. citizens and foreign investors". [...] According to an article in the November 19, 2002 issue of The Wall Street Journal, the Competitive Tax Plan is already being given consideration by officials in the United States Treasury Department. In 2013, Graetz presented an updated version of his plan for 2015. In it, he proposed progressive income tax rates for single filers making over $50,000 and households making over $100,000 ($75,000 for head of household) and lowering the corporate income tax further, to 15%.|$|E
