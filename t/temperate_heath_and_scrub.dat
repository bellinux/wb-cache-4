40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that transition between lowland <b>heath</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrub</b> ecosystems depends upon soil phosphorus (P) sorption capacity (PSC). Experimental work found {{a positive relationship between}} P availability and tree invasion but the relationship between PSC, P availability <b>and</b> <b>scrub</b> invasion is poorly understood making it difficult to clearly link landscape invasion patterns with small-scale experimental findings. Using a combination of descriptive and experimental studies we re-examined the relationship between PSC and tree invasion and investigated the hypothesis that PSC is a key determinant of P retention and therefore the P available to scrub colonists. In a statistical model fitted to soil data from three regions soil organic matter (SOM) content explained most of the variation in available P but PSC also accounted for {{a significant portion of the}} variance. Additional models suggest that soil P saturation and the proportion of available P in water desorbable form, both indicators of leaching losses, are strongly dependent on PSC. These findings are supported by experimental results; there was greater retention of added P, in plant available form, on high PSC soils and low PSC soils saturated at lower levels of addition. When synthesized with existing data, these results demonstrate that the relationship between PSC and P availability operates via a variety of mechanisms and at several spatio-temporal scales. PSC may for instance, influence post-disturbance SOM accumulation rates. Therefore PSC, by controlling P-availability and ecosystem development, may control the propensity of a site to either heath or scrub...|$|R

60|$|But soon {{we begin}} to climb to the hills. And soon the {{cultivation}} begins to be intermittent. Extraordinary how the heathy, moor-like hills come near the sea: extraordinary how scrubby and uninhabited the great spaces of Sardinia are. It is wild, with <b>heath</b> <b>and</b> arbutus <b>scrub</b> <b>and</b> a sort of myrtle, breast-high. Sometimes one sees a few head of cattle. And then again come the greyish arable-patches, where the corn is grown. It is like Cornwall, like the Land's End region. Here and there, in the distance, are peasants working on the lonely landscape. Sometimes it is one man alone in the distance, showing so vividly in his black-and-white costume, small and far-off like a solitary magpie, and curiously distinct. All the strange magic of Sardinia is in this sight. Among the low, moor-like hills, away in a hollow of the wide landscape one solitary figure, small but vivid black-and-white, working alone, as if eternally. There are patches and hollows of grey arable land, good for corn. Sardinia was once a great granary.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increasing}} concern with the problems of conservation of native biotic communities. While in most parts of Australia the area of land devoted to nature conservation has been increasing rapidly, little is known about such basic questions as the minimum area needed to maintain native communities in at least part of a reserve, or even the effects of intensive land use in surrounding areas on directly unmodified native vegetation. Yet, given the small areas contained in a large number of reserves devoted to nature conservation, these questions are of some importance. There is general acceptance of the view that the least desirable reserve for nature conservation in the long term is small in area with a large boundary/area ratio (Frankenburg, 1971). While surrounded by unmodified native communities such reserves remain viable. However, with increasing intensity of land use around their boundaries, they become more and more prone to a series of edge effects. These edge effects can include fertilizer drift, pesticide and herbicide drift, an increased susceptibility to firing, and increasing probabilities of introduction of exotic plants and animals. This and a subsequent article will document vegetation changes in the Sandringham Foreshore Reserve in the Melbourne Metropolitan Area, Victoria. The changes in the flora of the reserve will be traced from 1911 to 1971, covering the period in which the areas abutting on to the reserve developed from largely uncleared <b>heath</b> <b>and</b> <b>scrub</b> to upper middle class suburbia. The later article will describe and analyze the plant communities present in 1971, and will attempt to follow their development to that date. The value of this study lies in the insight it will give to the types of changes that can be expected in a reserve of unsuitable shape which has been subjected to increasingly intensive landuse both within and outside its boundaries. It is hoped that an understanding of the changes that have taken place in the extreme case will elucidate and allow the control of changes taking place in better situations...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{pastoral}} {{farming and}} marginal land {{are important for}} many bird species of conservation concern. This study identified the bird species associated {{with a range of}} marginal upland habitats in the Llyn peninsula in Wales and discusses the impact on these species of further land-use change. Bird and habitat surveys of 45 sites were conducted between May and July 2000. The bird species observed at each site were recorded along with the densities of eight species characteristic of marginal farmland. Sites were assigned to land management categories representing different management intensity and land-use options. A binary similarity index was used to quantify species associations with each of these categories and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to identify associations with individual habitat characteristics. Habitat differences were largely attributable to differences in management. Very few species were recorded on intensively managed sites, although house martin Delichon urbica and swallow Hirundo rustica were significantly associated with improved grassland with scrub or bracken. Sites that were abandoned or under-managed had a high tree density, high cover of bracken Pteridium aquilinium and supported many common scrub or woodland species. Extensively managed sites with unimproved grassland, shrub <b>heath,</b> bracken <b>and</b> <b>scrub</b> (ffridd) were found to be important for several species, including chough Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax, wheatear Oenanthe oenanthe, mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus, stonechat Saxicola toquata and meadow pipit Anthus pratensis. High densities of yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and linnet Carduelis cannabina occurred on sites with improved grassland and gorse Ulex europaeus. This study highlights the need for a diversity of habitats on marginal farmland, which is most likely to be achieved through the distribution of funds to marginal areas through agri-environment and rural development measures...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of the plant communities characteristic of the Mediterranean type climatic regions of France, California, and southern Australia. Infertile and relatively fertile soils support two distinctive groups of plant communities. In their natural state, the climax vegetations on both soils are dominated by evergreen, sclerophyllous trees in a woodland formation. Grass and herbs form a characteristic understorey on the more fertile soils; evergreen sclerophyllous shrubs are common in the understorey on infertile soils. In drier habitats, the climax woodlands may be replaced by shrub communities such as the garrigue-maquis in France, the chaparral in California, <b>and</b> the <b>heath</b> <b>and</b> mallee-broombush (open <b>scrub)</b> vegetations in southern Australia. In a preliminary study, the characters which Schimper and others had expounded were used to compare the communities of drier habitats. Characteristics such as the presence of evergreen sclerophyllous leaves, lignotubers, and similar life-form spectra pointed to comparable vegetation. In further support of this conclusion, phenological data showed that spring was the season of maximum flowering and shoot growth of the various plant communities; the dry summer conditions reduced growth to zero except in southern Australia where growth extends through much of summer...|$|R

These communities are globablly rare and, in many areas, dependent on active management to sustain them. We used historic and recent aerial photographs of the Central Pine Barrens in New York to develop transition matrices and trajectories of vegetation change. A vegetation map for 1990 provided pre-burn cover type information for a 1, 200 ha area burned by an extremely severe wildfire in August 1995. Geographic information system analyses, a fire-history study, post-wildfire research and existing literature provided additional information for development of three conceptual models that describe our understanding of vegetation change in response to fire and land clearing. A simulation model was then used to predict the amount of each cover type in 2046. The reasonableness of the prediction was assessed based on our understanding of pine barrens vegetation dynamics. In 1938, following a period of frequent, intense wildfires of the region, 90 % of vegetation {{in the study area}} was open canopy barrens (including dwarf pine plains, pitch pine–scrub oak woodland, <b>heath,</b> pine–heath woodland, <b>and</b> <b>scrub</b> oak shrubland). Between 1938 and 1994, wildfires decreased in size, the average area burned per year generally declined, and there were no fires in 70 % of the study area.
