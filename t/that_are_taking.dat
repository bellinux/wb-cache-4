5|$|The {{gymnasium}} has {{a capacity}} of approximately 16,000 and the smaller building can accommodate up 5,300 depending on the events <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> place. At {{the time it was}} built, the gymnasium had the world's largest suspended roof span. Two reinforced concrete pillars support a pre-stressed steel net onto which steel plates are attached. The bottom anchoring of this steel net is a heavy concrete support system which forms a distinct curve on the interior and exterior of the building. In the interior, this structural anchor is used to support the grandstand seats. The overall curvature of the roof helps protect the building from the damaging effects of strong winds.|$|E

25|$|Various {{animal species}} have become extinct due to {{unchecked}} hunting under Ottoman rule {{and to a}} lesser extent under British Mandate rule, due to a non-enforcement of hunting laws. By the beginning of the 20th century, the white oryx, the Syrian brown bear, the Asiatic lions, the Asiatic cheetah, and the Nile crocodile became extinct in the region. Modern hunting laws prohibit all hunting of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, except those considered pests and specific animals in hunting seasons. However the packs of feral dogs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> over the countryside are an increasing threat to wildlife and domesticated animals.|$|E

The five of them rescue Jake, but Skip succeeds in using the enlarging machine, growing to 30 feet tall, and calls the Zirkonian invasion ships. They defeat him and shrink him again. Tazer and Razor flee, while Skip is shrunk to a tiny size by the machine. Sparks calls off the invasion and returns home. The rest of the vacation goes back to normal, except the kids grew closer to each other during their adventure. In the distance, Skip appears, bent on revenge, but meets his demise when a crow flies over and grabs him.|$|E
25|$|Brockton {{was named}} one of the 100 Best Communities for Young People in the United States in 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2011. This prestigious award is given out by America's Promise Alliance in {{recognition}} of those communities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> action to reduce dropout rates and provide supportive services to youth. Despite the challenges it has had over the years, Brockton has made the success of its youth a high priority and was honored for its continued commitment to education, mentoring and volunteerism. Through the collaborative efforts of the Plymouth County District Attorney's Office, the Mayor's Office, the Superintendent and Police Department, along with area nonprofits and parents, the community has flourished with a host of resources for its young people.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{trials are}} {{currently}} being conducted on microbial strains unique to individual healthcare facilities {{around the world to}} evaluate to what extent copper alloys can reduce the incidence of infection in hospital environments.

Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina indicate that rooms where common touch surfaces were replaced with copper demonstrated a 97% reduction in surface pathogens versus the non-coppered rooms and that patients in the coppered ICU rooms had a 40.4% lower risk of contracting a hospital acquired infection versus patients in non-coppered ICU rooms.|$|E

As translated by the Israeli-based MEMRI, Bin Al-Majed told his interviewer that [...] "the West, and the Americans in particular... are behind all the tragedies <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> place in Darfur", as they [...] "realized that it Darfur is full of treasures"; that [...] "Islam does not permit a non-Muslim to rule over Muslims"; {{and that he had}} issued a fatwa prohibiting the vaccination of children, {{on the grounds that the}} vaccinations were [...] "a conspiracy of the Jews and Freemasons".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{statement}} before the U.S. House of Representatives, Dr. Damon Noto said “the prisoners {{sentenced to death}} cannot fully account for all the transplantations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> place in China [...] Even if they executed 10,000 and transplanted 10,000 a year, {{there would still be}} a very large discrepancy. Why is that? It is simply impossible that those 10,000 people executed would match perfectly the 10,000 people that needed the organs.” David Kilgour and David Matas similarly write that traditional sources of transplants such as executed prisoners, donors, and the brain dead [...] "come nowhere near to explaining the total number of transplants across China." [...] Like Noto, they point to the large number of Falun Gong practitioners in the labor camp and prison system as a likely alternative source for organs.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired {{in part by}} {{an earlier}} musical {{version of the same}} story by Ken Hill, Lloyd Webber's score is {{sometimes}} operatic in style but maintains the form and structure of a musical throughout. The full-fledged operatic passages are reserved principally for subsidiary characters such as Andre and Firmin, Carlotta, and Piangi. They are also used to provide the content of the fictional [...] "operas" [...] <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> place within the show itself, viz., Hannibal, Il Muto, and the Phantom's masterwork, Don Juan Triumphant. [...] "Here, Lloyd Webber pastiched various styles from the grand operas of Meyerbeer through to Mozart and even Gilbert and Sullivan." [...] These pieces are often presented as musical fragments, interrupted by dialogue or action sequences in order to clearly define the musical's [...] "show within a show" [...] format. The musical extracts from the Phantom's opera, [...] "Don Juan Triumphant", during the latter stages of the show, are dissonant and modern—"suggesting, perhaps, that the Phantom is ahead of his time artistically".|$|E

2500|$|After McQueary was {{identified}} as the graduate assistant who reported the 2002 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect the boy from Sandusky (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), {{as well as for}} not reporting the incident to police himself. On November 7, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said that though some may have fulfilled their legal obligation to report suspected abuse, [...] "somebody has to question about what I would consider the moral requirements for a human being that knows of sexual things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> place with a child." [...] Noonan added that anyone who knows about suspected abuse, [...] "whether you're a football coach or a university president or the guy sweeping the building," [...] has [...] "a moral responsibility to call us." [...] Paterno said McQueary informed him that [...] "he had witnessed an incident in the shower ... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report." [...] Paterno was uncertain if being more graphic would have made a difference. [...] "And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because I never heard of, of, rape and a man," [...] said Paterno.|$|E
2500|$|Still {{during the}} {{promotion}} of the album, the singer acknowledged that she had to follow a more honest approach on her next project: [...] " [...] just made me realize that people want authentic Monica," [...] she stated. [...] "They don't want me to keep up with all the different gimmicks and trends <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> place." [...] In late 2007, Monica started work on her follow-up album. Intending to create a record that lived up to the sound her previous hits, particularly those from the 1990s, she expressed that she wanted to appeal to her existing fans although her label was concerned with making the project sound up to date: [...] "I am going back to where I started. The next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why I Love You So Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E
2500|$|With six laps {{remaining}} in the Bojangles' Southern 500, Busch cut a tire and subsequently caused a wreck that involved not only his car but also Ryan Newman. When leaving his pit (directly in front of Newman), Busch did a burnout and sped next to where crew members and NASCAR officials where standing. Following {{the conclusion of the}} race, while entering pit road, Busch bumped Newman's car. Busch explained the incident as an accident and unrelated, caused by taking his helmet off and not seeing where he was going. Andrew Rueger, Newman's gas man, went after Busch following the race. This turned into a heated argument, accidentally knocking over a NASCAR official. Newman, giving an interview to Sports Illustrated, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's easy to say that Kurt blew a fuse again, I'm not sure why he did it and tried to run over our guys and NASCAR officials. And nobody is. I think the chemical imbalance speaks for itself. Kurt drilled me in pit lane and said that he was taking his helmet off, and he didn't see where he was going. I'm pretty sure there were 42 other guys <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> their helmets off and doing whatever for the last 10 years, and that's the first time that's happened to me." [...] On May 15, 2012, NASCAR announced that Busch had been fined $50,000 and placed on probation until July 25, 2012 for [...] "reckless driving on pit road during the race" [...] and for being [...] "involved in an altercation with another competitor after the completion of the race." ...|$|E
