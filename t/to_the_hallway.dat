5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a hallway, until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a hallway and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another hallway where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{a shot of the}} outside view of The Confidante hotel and two flamingos. In the next scene, and {{in the context of the}} track, Lipa is lying on a bed, {{thinking}} of giving her ex a second chance, while her friends are by her side. As the song continues, the artist heads towards the phone to answer his call, but is stopped by one of her friends. Then, she keeps receiving advice from the women, but manages to escape <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b> There, they perform a choreography, and return to the room. In the next scenes, the women start a sleepover, brushing each other's hair and applying lipstick on each other. They change their outfits and head towards the pool, where they walk over the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This text {{deals with}} one of the {{preschool}} everyday routine chores, and the phenomenon I have chosen <b>to</b> investigate is <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> situation. <b>The</b> purpose of <b>the</b> study was <b>to</b> see if <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> situation offers good communicative interactions between children and teachers, and investigate if the teachers use special strategies <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> situation work. <b>The</b> method of this study was survey, qualitative interviews and observations. The three methods have deliberately been selected to best suite and reply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> different issues. Today’s groups of children in preschool are very big, and some of the preschools are not adapted to these large groups of children that we have today. This means that teachers are forced to think about and use their skills <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> business <b>to</b> work. During <b>the</b> 1990 - century was unfortunately substantial financial savings and cuts made, which today results in too large groups of children. But these cuts and savings have also generated a positive trend, and that trend is that the teachers consider themselves increased in their expertise and that they now have to use there skills <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> situation work. <b>The</b> outcome of my case study shows that teachers and the children together create and allow for communicative interaction between them. But it then depends on educators' skills and willingness to reflect on their own activities.  One way of looking at life is the postmodern perspective that centers the child. The child exists through its relationships with other people and in a unique context. Therefore {{it is important that we}} choose to see knowledge as a perishable commodity.   Key words: Preschool, hallway situation, communication, interaction, everyday routine...|$|R
500|$|The one-take {{fight in}} [...] "New York's Finest" [...] in which Daredevil fights gang members down a {{staircase}} {{was described by}} Cox as [...] "kind of like an homage" [...] to the first season's well received one-take hallway fight scene, and [...] "almost like that scene on crack". Silvera noted {{that it is a}} metaphorical [...] "descent into Hell" [...] rather than a [...] "test of will" [...] like the first season's scene. The stunt team had three days to prepare the fight, and the final sequence was filmed in a day and a half. Unlike the first season's scene, which was shot on a set and used a camera mounted on a ceiling track, the stairwell sequence was filmed on location, and required the camera to be passed around multiple people to get the final shot. The season includes another homage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> scene in [...] "Seven Minutes in Heaven", where the Punisher has his own hallway fight. Silvera noted that this [...] "full-blown", murdering Punisher was [...] "a strong contrast to Daredevil". For all the season's fights, the stunt team filmed a previsualization version using stunt doubles, with the actors, such as Cox, then shown this in sections on the day of filming, and allowed to make adjustments where necessary. Though the actors completed the majority of the fights, doubles were used for flips and major stunts.|$|E

The {{characters}} give Alice many riddles and stories, including the famous [...] "Why is a raven like a writing desk?". The Hatter reveals that they have tea all day because Time has punished him by eternally standing still at 6pm (tea time). Alice becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves, claiming {{that it was the}} stupidest tea party that she had ever been to. [...] She makes her way back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and, using the pieces of mushroom, manages to get the key, unlock the door and enter the garden.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more serious}} escape attempt {{happened}} in 1908 that left Deputy Warden Robinson dead and Warden Conley severely wounded. It was Conley's habit to hold {{what he called}} a [...] "warden's court" [...] each morning where inmates could air their grievances. At [...] tall and weighing roughly [...], Warden Frank Conley was an imposing man, and he considered himself more than a match for the men he maintained. What his physical bulk could not handle, the [...]41 caliber pistol he habitually carried would. He was shown just how vulnerable he was when, on the morning of 8 March, Deputy John A. Robinson admitted the men lined up to speak with the warden and was rushed by four men, W.A. Hayes, C.B. Young, Oram Stevens, and George Rock. Hayes managed to get past Robinson and burst into Conley's office, waving a knife and threatening the warden. Conley drew his pistol and fired twice, hitting Hayes in the ear. The remaining three inmates rushed in and Conley fired [...] again, hitting George Rock, who retreated from the office. [...] Hayes got back to his feet, and Conley shot him again and threw him into the hall after Rock. [...] Conley then went to help Robinson, who was on the ground under Rock. [...] Rock had already slashed the Deputy's throat and was stabbing him when Conley threw a chair at the assailant, who turned on Conley. [...] The warden fended the armed man off with the butt of his now empty pistol, and the escape attempt was ended {{at the end of a}} billy-club wielded by Guard E.H. Carver, who had had to break through the locked door <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway.</b>|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{computer}} vision system that enables a robot <b>to</b> navigate <b>the</b> <b>hallways</b> of buildings using a generic webcam as the only sensor. OpenCV 2. 0 programmed in C++ is the primary tool used <b>to</b> develop <b>the</b> vision system software. Three algorithms were developed <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> center of <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> and guide <b>the</b> robot in the correct direction. The first two algorithms use a generic filter (normal, median, or Gaussian) followed by edge detection and then corner detection on the edge- detected image. The first algorithm identifies the strongest vertical lines on an image. Averaging the horizontal coordinates of the vertical lines indicates the location of the center of <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> robot. The second algorithm utilizes the trapezoidal shape of <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> formed where <b>the</b> floo...|$|R

50|$|McIntire {{patterned}} {{the design}} of the house fairly closely on patterns found in the Builder's Treasury of Batty Langley, published in 1740. As a result the house has late Georgian styling. This was altered in some portions in 1801, when Peirce again hired McIntire <b>to</b> redo <b>the</b> <b>hallway</b> east parlor in preparation for the wedding of his daughter Sally to George Nichols. This area features the lighter Federal styling that was being popularized by architect Charles Bulfinch.|$|R

It was a large, old mansion cut up into five or six dwellings, but it had kept some traits of its former dignity, which pleased people of their sympathetic tastes. The dark-mahogany trim, of sufficiently ugly design, gave a rich gloom <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hallway,</b> which was wide and paved with marble; the carpeted stairs curved aloft through a generous space.|$|E
