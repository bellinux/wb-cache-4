5|$|In 1926 the United States {{government}} {{forced the}} railroad <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of its headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. Although Harrison threatened {{to take the}} company headquarters to Atlanta, in the end a new headquarters building was built on McPherson Square. Harrison installed a private lobby entrance leading to a private elevator to the 10th and 11th floors. The railroad took occupancy of the building {{in the middle of}} 1929.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{researchers}} {{note that}} mammals and birds {{get the most}} attention but smaller creatures {{at the base of}} the ocean food chain are also harmed by the oil. Life on the sea floor and near the shore such as mussels, barnacles, and other shellfish are unable <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the way. When exposed to oil, these organisms suffer 90%-plus mortality and recovery of the population can take decades.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{restoration}} {{work was}} scheduled for 2002, however the operators of the polyclinic were reluctant to leave, having occupied the building for over 40 years. In order to force the occupants out of the building, the workers boarded {{up all of the}} windows and threatened to do the same to the doors if the polyclinic did not vacate the premises. Only the president's involvement in the matter forced the polyclinic <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> completely.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid-18th century {{as part of the}} New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established on the road in the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Kanak {{independence}} movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non-Self-Governing Territories in 1946. A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French {{settlers in the}} country obtained voting rights in 1951, shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956. The Kanaks were then also allowed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of their reserve areas. This {{was followed by the}} establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957, but this was short-lived; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France, in 1958.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the penalty was taken, the Welsh dugout was {{surrounded}} by press and photographers, as the home team were still leading 1–0. With the scores levelled, the pack switched {{their attention to the}} Scottish bench, which led to Stein remonstrating with at least one photographer <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the way of his view of the game. Both Professor Stewart Hillis, the Scotland team doctor (who was also Stein's consultant), and Welsh manager Mike England stated that there appeared to be nothing wrong at this point.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June, {{government}} forces attempted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> {{of the air}} base and link up with troops at the university but failed after encountering heavy insurgent resistance in the al-Deum area.

5|$|On 7 August the Greater Bairam (a feast day {{celebrating the}} end of the Islamic year) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> with {{supplies}} for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past {{the end of}} their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up. One man was hit about the head with the butt of a pistol and the dissenters were dispersed into small groups and reassigned to various units in the infantry division; the 52nd (Lowland) Division.|$|E

5|$|Residents began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of {{the centre}} into the {{suburban}} areas which {{were included in}} Odense Municipality after boundaries were redefined in 1970. As a result, the population declined slightly in the 1970s and 1980s, falling to 136,646 in 1981. It began climbing again in the late 1980s, and steadily grew to 144,518 in 1996 and 145,554 in 2004. In 2010 Odense had a population of 166,305 people. As of 2017 it had a population of 176,683.|$|E
5|$|Temes was {{commissioned}} into the Danube Flotilla in 1915, {{and was in}} action against the Serbian Army at Belgrade in early October, when the Serbs evacuated {{the city in the}} face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. During the final river crossing and reinforcement of the resulting bridgehead, Temes provided close support. During this task, she attempted to draw fire away from the battle-damaged monitor Enns but after receiving a direct hit in the crew quarters aft, she had <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of range. She was run ashore to put out fires and stop leaks, before being towed out of the battle area by an armed steamer, and taken to Budapest for repairs.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, {{plucking}} or cutting the nest. If the resident spider eventually leaves the nest, P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident spider tries to counterattack and then retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata may attack the other spider as it re-enters the nest, or may wait motionless until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey spider retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters the nest, but {{waits for the}} prey <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out,</b> and then P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E

5|$|When {{the third}} statehouse was {{condemned}} in 1876 the government abandoned the building. The General Assembly relocated {{to a large}} office building that had been built in 1865 and was already housing the Supreme Court. The Governor and the executive staff relocated to another office building. The office building {{was used as the}} statehouse during the interim period that the new statehouse was being built. In 1887, before the new statehouse had been completed, enough of the lower floors were usable for the government <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the cramped office space and begin holding sessions in the new structure.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski {{returned to the}} Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, {{the first time since}} 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>out</b> of the line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold {{on the underside of the}} weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
