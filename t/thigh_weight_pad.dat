Two strains of Japanese quail (150 wild quails and 150 white quails) were used as base population. Four mating groups were used to produce progenies: wild male × wild female, white male × wild female, wild male × white female and white male × white female. Quails were weighed then slaughtered at 35 days of age. The carcass traits consisting carcass weight, breast meat <b>weight,</b> <b>thigh</b> meat <b>weight,</b> skin weight, and abdominal fat weight were recorded after slaughter and after removing feathers, internal organs, and digestive system. Based on these weights, the percentages of carcass, breast, thigh, skin, and abdominal fat were estimated. The effects of sex, hatch, and mating group on body and carcass composition traits were investigated. Sex had a significant effect on all traits (P < 0. 01), {{with the exception of the}} thigh percentage. Moreover, female birds showed higher values for all traits. There were significant differences between hatches and mating groups and wild male × wild female offspring showed highest values of carcass <b>weight,</b> breast <b>weight,</b> <b>thigh</b> <b>weight,</b> skin weight and abdominal fat weight (P < 0. 01).

The 24 -hour <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> test {{is commonly used}} to objectively quantify PPI. However, <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> may vary based upon activity level. We aimed to quantify variability in <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> based upon patient-reported activity. Materials and Methods: 25 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were prospectively enrolled. All patients demonstrated clinical stress urinary incontinence without clinical urgency urinary incontinence. On three consecutive alternating days, patients submitted 24 -hour <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> along with a short survey documenting activity level and number of pads used. Results: <b>Pad</b> <b>weights</b> collected across the three days were well correlated to the individual (ICC 0. 85 (95 % CI 0. 74 – 0. 93), p< 0. 001). The mean difference between the minimum <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> leakage and maximum leakage per patient was 133. 4 g (95 % CI 80. 4 – 186. 5). The mean increase in 24 -hour leakage for a one-point increase in self-reported activity level was 118. 0 g (95 % CI 74. 3 – 161. 7, p< 0. 001). <b>Pad</b> <b>weights</b> also varied significantly when self-reported activity levels did not differ (mean difference 51. 2 g (95 % CI 30. 3 – 72. 1), p< 0. 001).

In leg raise exercises, it allows more activation of the hip flexors (and abdominals) without putting more strain on the quadriceps muscles for extension, making it good for sports-specific training on movements like knees and jumping. The greater area and safe location allow it to handle much more weight. For those with wide thighs, such as bodybuilders with large quadriceps, or people with large amounts of fat stores on the inner thigh, it may cause chafing. If worn on both legs, however, the chafing would be between the weights and only damage them, possibly only chafing with a lack of tightness.|$|R

NRE administration significantly decreased body <b>weight</b> gain, fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight,</b> serum glucose, and lipid levels in HFD-induced obese mice. To elucidate the mechanism of action of NRE, the expression of genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were measured in liver. Results showed that mice treated with NRE demonstrated {{a significant decrease in}} cumulative body <b>weight</b> and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight,</b> a significant lowering in glucose and triglycerides serum levels, and an increase in the HDL-cholesterol serum level. Moreover mRNA expression results showed an enhancement of the expression of genes related to liver metabolism. Our findings suggest that NRE treatment had a protective or controlling effect against a high fat diet-induced obesity in C 57 B 6 J/L mice through the regulation of expression of genes involved in lipolysis and lipogenesis and thus the enhancement of the lipid metabolism in liver...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} if dietary Chlorella vulgaris (chlorella) intake would be effective on cadmium (Cd) detoxification in rats fed dietary Cd. Fourteen-week old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 415. 0 ± 1. 6 g were randomly divided into two groups and fed slightly modified American Institute of Nutrition- 93 Growing (AIN- 93 G) diet without (n= 10) or with (n= 40) dietary Cd (200 ppm) for 8 weeks. To confirm alteration by dietary Cd intake, twenty rats fed AIN- 93 G diet without (n= 10) and with (n= 10) dietary Cd were sacrificed and compared. Other thirty rats were randomly blocked into three groups and fed slightly modified AIN- 93 G diets replacing 0 (n= 10), 5 (n= 10) or 10 % (n= 10) chlorella of total kg diet for 4 weeks. Daily food intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ weight (liver, spleen, and kidney), perirenal fat pad and epididymal fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were measured. To examine Cd detoxification, urinary Cd excretion and metallothonein (MT) concentrations in kidney and intestine were measured. Food intake, calorie intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ <b>weight</b> and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were decreased by dietary Cd intake. Urinary Cd excretion and MT concentrations in kidney and small intestine were increased by dietary Cd. After given Cd containing diet, food intake, calorie intake, body weight change, body weight gain/calorie intake, organ <b>weights</b> and fat <b>pad</b> <b>weights</b> were not influenced by dietary chlorella intake. Renal MT synthesis tended to be higher in a dose-dependent manner, but not significantly. And chlorella intake did not significantly facilitate renal and intestinal MT synthesis and urinary Cd excretion. These findings suggest that, after stopping cadmium supply, chlorella supplementation, regardless of its percentage, might not improve cadmium detoxification from the body in growing rats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{total of}} 300 day-old Hubbard Classic broiler chicks with initial body weight (BW) of 43. 6 ± 1. 33 (mean±SD) were {{randomly}} and equally distributed into 15 pens, representing five feeding treatments with three replication per treatment {{to evaluate the}} performance of chicks fed varying dietary levels of cassava root chips (CRC) replacing corn grain (CG). Treatments were replacement of CG with CRC at 0 (T 1), 25 (T 2), 50 (T 3), 75 (T 4) and 100 % (T 5) levels. Isocaloric and isonitrogenous starter and finisher rations were used. Four birds 2 from each sex were randomly taken from each replication and slaughtered for carcass evaluation {{at the end of}} the study. The metabolizable energy content of CRC and CG were 3852 and 3753 kcal/kg dry matter (DM), respectively. Daily DM intake during the entire experimental period ranged 61 to 67 g/bird and was greater (P 0. 05) among treatments. Replacement of CRC for CG at higher levels (75 and 100 %) lowered (P< 0. 05) yield of most carcass parameters such as slaughter weight, dressed weight, eviscerated <b>weight,</b> breast <b>weight,</b> <b>thigh</b> <b>weight,</b> drumstick weight and giblet weight. The same carcass parameters were greater (P< 0. 05) for male than female birds but abdominal fat percentage was higher for females. In conclusion, based on DM intake and growth performance of broilers obtained in this study, CRC could completely replace corn grain in broiler diets as energy feed ingredient. However, looking on the results of yields of major carcass parameters, CRC should substitute corn grain not more than 50 %...|$|R

This study evaluated the potential use of in ovo administration of exogenous endocrine compounds to enhance growth and reduce fat content of posthatch broiler chickens. Effects of in ovo administration of growth hormone (GH) plus triiodothyronine (T 3) on growth and adiposity of broiler chickens were investigated in experiment 1. Vehicle or vehicle containing. 1 ng T 3 plus. 25 mg GH,. 1 ng T, plus 2. 5 mg GH or. 1 ng T 3 plus 25 mg GH were injected into the albumen of fertile eggs on day 11 of incubation. Female broilers from eggs injected with. 1 ng T 3 plus 25 mg GH had significantly greater body weights as compared to controls from 5 weeks to 7 weeks of age. Administration of. 1 ng T 3 plus 2. 5 mg G H resulted in a significant (P <. 05) 20. 5 % reduction in fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> in males. The effect of manipulating estrogen status in ovo on posthatch growth rate and skeletal development was examined by two trials in experiment 2. Effects of in ovo administration of tamoxifen citrate (T) or 17 f 3 -estradiol (E) on growth and fattening of broiler chickens were assessed in trial 1. At day one of incubation, either vehicle, vehicle containing 20 Mg of E or 200 Mg of T was injected into the albumen of fertile eggs. Neither sex ratios, body <b>weight,</b> fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> nor adipose cellularity parameters were altered by the concentrations of T or E administered in trial 1. In trial 2, eggs from a commercially selected broiler line and from a population of Athens-Canadian Randombreds (AC) were injected with either vehicle or vehicle containing 500 mg of T. At three weeks of age, chicks were sampled for fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> and gonadal sex. The higher concentrations of T administered in trial 2 resulted in significant modifications in phenotypic sex ratios at hatch in both genotypes. However, these phenotypic changes in sex ratios did not yield significant alterations in body <b>weight,</b> fat <b>pad</b> <b>weight</b> or skeletal development. In conclusion, in ovo endocrine administration resulted in modifications of growth and tissue development in broilers. However, the alterations were dependent on the type and concentration of hormone...|$|R

40|$|Authors {{investigated}} the growing performance of four broiler genotypes by sex during 42 days long raising. Samples were taken and slaughtered on the 42 nd day and carcasses of bothsexes were evaluated with 11 aspects. The valuable {{parts of the}} meat of carcasses (breast and thigh yield) were sensory evaluatedboth uncooked and cooked. Evaluation was done by expert judgers (8 people). All sampleswere judged uniquely with 3 repetitions by 4 main aspects, and by 3 - 9 sub-aspects per mainaspects. <b>Thigh</b> <b>weight</b> was 31 - 33 %, breast weight was 24 - 27 % of carcass weight. There were significant differences among the (uncooked) samples {{in the case of}} fairyness,size uniformity, colour intensity, muscularity, clearness and surface contamination. In the caseof foreign colour, colour uniformity and soundness of the samples were similar. Scores of the samples after cooking were smaller, and there was significant difference onlyfor normal smell of the chickens. There were significant differences among samples fornormal smell, normal flavour, flavourness and foreign flavour aspects. Samples significantly differed for tenderness, juciness and fiberness. Each sample was tenderin fact, however {{one of them was a}} little tender and it was shown at the mastication test...|$|R
