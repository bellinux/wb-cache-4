25|$|The Matildas had 40mm Ordnance QF 2 pounder guns, {{which only}} fired armour {{piercing}} rounds — not effective anti-personnel weapons. (High explosive rounds in small calibres were considered impractical). The tanks were in poor mechanical condition, as the engines were worn {{and could not}} be overhauled on Crete. Most tanks were used as mobile pillboxes to be brought up and dug in at strategic points. One Matilda had a damaged turret crank that allowed it <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>clockwise</b> only. Many British tanks broke down in the rough terrain, not in combat. The British and their allies did not possess sufficient Universal Carriers or trucks, which would have provided the mobility and firepower needed for rapid counter-attacks before the invaders could consolidate.|$|E
25|$|Michell {{devised a}} torsion balance for {{measuring}} {{the mass of the}} Earth, but died before he could use it. His instrument passed into the hands of his lifelong friend Henry Cavendish, who first performed in 1798 the experiment now known as the Cavendish Experiment. Placing two 1-kg lead balls at the ends of a six-foot rod, he suspended the rod horizontally by a fibre attached to its centre. Then he placed a massive lead ball beside each of the small ones, causing a gravitational attraction that led the rod <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>clockwise.</b> By measuring the rod’s movement, Cavendish was able to calculate the force exerted by each of the large balls on the 1-kg balls. From these calculations, he was able to provide an accurate estimate of the gravitational constant and of the mass and average density of the Earth. Cavendish gave Michell full credit for his accomplishment.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the rising}} warm air from {{convector}} heaters, warm air may accumulate at {{the ceiling of the}} room. Therefore, convector heaters are often paired with ceiling fans, especially in rooms with tall ceilings. In the winter, setting a fan <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>clockwise</b> will allow for more air circulation and will keep heat from rising completely, making the room feel warmer and allowing one to turn down the thermostat.|$|E

50|$|A saddle valve {{is mounted}} {{directly}} on to a pipe {{which is usually}} 1/2 inch copper tubing. Saddle valves are self-tapping devices. Once mounted on a line, with the included rubber seal in place, all that is required is <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the valve <b>clockwise</b> until it pierces the water line. When the valve handle {{can no longer be}} turned, it is done tapping the pipe. Turning the handle counter-clockwise opens the valve. These valves can be installed without shutting off the main water supply.|$|R
5000|$|A {{somewhat}} uncommon variant is YGHJ which while {{requiring the}} keyboard <b>to</b> be <b>turned</b> slightly <b>clockwise,</b> {{can result in}} the thumb resting comfortably upon the right [...] key and the little finger resting on [...] This {{can be useful in}} games that utilize both jump and sprint functions as it allows the fingers to rest on smaller keys than [...] and Space. The YGHJ configuration also places the hand closer {{to the center of the}} QWERTY section of the keyboard, potentially opening up the entire board to custom keybindings.|$|R
50|$|The Goon {{was built}} with a {{conventional}} welded steel tube frame and fabric covering. The wings used spruce spars and plywood covering. The mid-wing taildragger aircraft featured short-legged retractable landing gear. The engine was prepared <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>clockwise</b> (as normal for some British inlines of the era) {{in anticipation of}} mounting a custom French propeller, but the propeller was also customized for American engines, and the engine needed to be modified again to rotate normally.|$|E
5000|$|An arbor bolt is {{the bolt}} {{that holds the}} blade to the miter saw. The {{diameter}} of the arbor bolt must match the blade hole size in order to properly secure the blade (12" [...] blades commonly use 1" [...] arbor holes and 10" [...] blades favor 5/8"). Arbor bolts are reversed threaded meaning you have <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>clockwise</b> to loosen the bolt. Many inexperienced users will strip their arbor bolt as a result. The arbot bolt is designed so that the rotational spin of the saw blade is exerting a tightening pressure on the blade, {{as opposed to the}} bolt working its way loose and having the flying blade injure the operator.|$|E

50|$|The game can {{be played}} by two, three or four players, with {{additional}} rules provided for solo and four-player partnership play. Each player has a rack of six randomly chosen tiles which are concealed from the other players. The board is also {{made up of a}} number of hexagons, with the two outermost rings reserved for three- and four-player games respectively. The rules state that the youngest player takes the first turn, although where multiple games are played it is common practice for the first <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> rotate <b>clockwise</b> around the board in subsequent games.|$|R

50|$|The Roth-Steyr pistol fires from {{an unusual}} style of locked breech. The bolt is very long. Its rear end is solid, {{except for a}} sleeve for the striker, but its front part is hollow and fits tightly over the barrel. The {{interior}} of the bolt has cam grooves cut into it, and the barrel has studs which fit into the grooves. When the pistol is fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together within the hollow receiver for about 0.5 inch. During this operation, the helical grooves in the muzzle bush cause the barrel <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> 90 degrees <b>clockwise,</b> after which it is held while the unlocked bolt continues to the rear, cocking the action as it does so. For safety with intended use by mounted cavalry, the pistol has a heavy trigger pull against the firing striker spring, similar to a hammerless revolver.|$|R

The interconnecting shafts also ensured symmetrical lift distribution in event of engine failure. To optimise control in roll and yaw the rotors are arranged <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> in opposite directions with the port rotor turning anti-clockwise and the starboard rotor <b>turning</b> <b>clockwise,</b> ensuring that the advancing blades pass over the fuselage.|$|R
40|$|Mak-Trace {{provides}} {{an environment in}} which the user can program a character to move and draw on a grid. In the first release the grid is 10 x 15 and the character can only be programmed to go forwards or backwards (of one side of a square at the time) or <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> 90 degrees <b>clockwise</b> or counterclockwise. The characters can be dragged on the grid to choose a starting position and then they will leave a trace mark as they move according to the steps the user programs. Programmed sequences can be saved as "macros" and added to the possible commands to give to the character. Different backgrounds can be chosen for the characters to draw on. At the moment there are three types of backgrounds: free, mazes, or with proposed traces to program. To transition to a more "coordinate-looking" environment the characters' size can be reduced to a point and the transparency of the background increased to 100...|$|R

50|$|The fulcrum of {{competitive}} diving boards travels over {{a range of}} 0.61 m, and is set {{by way of a}} foot wheel that is approximately 0.35 m in diameter. To stiffen the spring (as if tightening it), the foot wheel is usually <b>turned</b> counter <b>clockwise.</b> Some may find this counter intuitive, since usually things are tightened by <b>turning</b> <b>clockwise.</b> However, with a little experience, people realize the fulcrum moves in the direction the bottom of the foot faces when placed on the foot wheel.|$|R
50|$|Note: On Airbus Helicopters {{aircraft}} {{designed in}} France, the main rotor <b>turns</b> <b>clockwise</b> {{when viewed from}} above, in common with rotorcraft deriving from Russia.
