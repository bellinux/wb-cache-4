5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E
25|$|Many thinkers are now {{considering}} how Marxist theory affects {{the way we}} think of media and vice versa, {{at the same time that}} new media are becoming a major form of communication. Contemporary media theorists often use elements of Marxist theory, such as mediation, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> new media affect social relations and lifestyles through their ability to communicate images, sounds, and other forms of information across the globe at incredible speeds.|$|E

25|$|The newly {{formatted}} series, {{stemming from}} Trinny & Susannah Undress..., began to air on ITV on 7 November 2007, and explores {{some of the}} major fashion problems in Britain. Numerous eye-catching stunts were filmed for the first series of the show in order to emphasise the points raised by Trinny and Susannah. One stunt included Susannah Constantine being transformed into a 70-year-old <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> people dress for their age. Breasts, bras and uniforms were also some of the themes investigated during the first series.|$|E
25|$|In health, {{the optimistic}} bias tends to prevent {{individuals}} from taking on preventative measures for good health. Therefore, researchers {{need to be}} aware of the optimistic bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease. Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.|$|E
25|$|ESA had {{originally}} cost-capped the ExoMars projects at €1 billion, (USD 1.3 billion) but {{the withdrawal of}} the U.S. space agency (NASA) and the consequent reorganisation of the ventures will probably add several hundred million euros to the sum so far raised. So on March 2012, member states instructed the agency's executive <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> this shortfall could be made up. One possibility is that other science activities within ESA may have to step back to make ExoMars a priority. On September 2012 it was announced that new ESA members, Poland and Romania will be contributing up to €70 million to the ExoMars mission. ESA has not ruled out a possible partial return of NASA to the 2018 portion of ExoMars, albeit in a relatively minor role.|$|E

25|$|The Grorud Line {{was built}} {{as part of}} the {{original}} metro network and opened on 16 November 1966. The Ring Line was built in two stages between 2000 and 2006. Oslo Sporveier announced in 2005 that it planned to double the number of services on the Grorud Line, to eight per hour. However, the bottleneck of the system is the Common Tunnel through the city center and services on all branches of the metro are limited by the capacity of that line. With the Ring Line under way, planners started <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> it could be used to increase traffic flow and capacity of the metro. This would allow traffic to be diverted around the Ring Line instead of through the Common Tunnel, increasing capacity on the system as a whole.|$|E

Lamont is in favour of greater devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament, and established a Commission <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> this can be achieved.|$|E
500|$|Lords Bingham and Mance, dissenting, {{took the}} view that the Order in Council was {{unreasonable}} and therefore invalid. Bingham noted that the proper way to interpret an exercise of the royal prerogative was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> it had been exercised previously, and that he could not find any previous record of the prerogative being used to [...] "exile an indigenous population from its homeland". [...] He argued that this prerogative power did not exist: [...] "he Crown has never had a prerogative power to prevent its subjects from entering the Kingdom, or to expel them from it". Accordingly, the Order was ultra vires. Bingham also maintained that it was irrational, since visits to the outer islands did not threaten US security, and unacceptable, in that no consideration had been given to the Chagossians. On the subject of legitimate expectation, the dissenters maintained that the statement should be [...] "construed according to the ordinary meaning that would be attached to it by those, principally the Chagossians and their supporters, to whom it was directed"; Bingham saw the ordinary meaning as being that the Chagossians would be allowed to return home.|$|E

25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|R

City on a Hill observes nine American communities, from the first immigrants to a modern communities, that sought their perfection through following the teaching of Christ.

Exploratory qualitative research is also useful for suggesting new hypotheses, which can eventually be tested by randomized experiments. Both qualitative and quantitative studies therefore are considered essential in education—just as in the other social sciences.

Contemporary usage of takfirism as an ideology has often led to lethal consequences for civilians on the ground who are labeled “Kafir”, and devastating consequences for the internal cohesion of groups who use takfir as disagreements arise over who is or is not “Kafir”. The concept is highly controversial, and has torn jihadist movements apart. The priority given to this concept in Boko Haram factions provides an illustrative case study of takfirism in contemporary jihadist movements. In the conclusion, the article provides recommendations on how this concept can be incorporated into CVE programs and especially de-radicalization of both leaders and foot soldiers of Boko Haram...|$|R
