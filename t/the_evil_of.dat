5000|$|Critic Thomas Bender {{describes}} the whole novel as devoted [...] "to <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evils</b> <b>of</b> selfishly attempting to achieve higher place".

5|$|Apart from actual episode footage, rare behind-the-scenes {{material}} {{also was}} discovered for The Smugglers, <b>The</b> <b>Evil</b> <b>of</b> the Daleks, The Abominable Snowmen, and Fury from the Deep.

5|$|Black also {{identifies}} {{a mechanism}} Fleming uses in Casino Royale—and in subsequent Bond novels—which {{is to use}} <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> his opponents both as a justification of his actions, and as a device to foil their own plans. Black refers to the episode of the attempted assassination of Bond by Bulgarian assassins which results in their own deaths.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} the diary, razor, and dress, Cavendish {{came to believe}} that he was destined to continue Arkham's work. On April Fools Day—the date Arkham's family was murdered—Cavendish released the patients and lured Batman to the asylum, believing him to be the bat Arkham spoke of. Cavendish accuses him of feeding <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> the asylum by bringing it more insane souls. Batman attempts to convince Cavendish he is sick and needs treatment, but Cavendish responds by attacking him. Batman and Cavendish proceed to struggle, which ends after Adams slashes Cavendish's throat with the razor.|$|E

5|$|He them imprisons the Gandhara {{royal family}} in his prison. He gives them only one rice grain per {{prisoner}} and that too the left over food of the kaurava clan.The prisoners start {{fighting for the}} few rice grains thrown at them. The king of Gandhara then stops everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided. He says that instead of everyone dying, they could keep {{at least one of}} their princes alive. He chooses Shakuni to be alive. Shakuni takes an oath that he will do everything he can to destroy the entire Kaurava clan.The whole royal family except Shakuni dies in the prison. Shakuni makes magic dice from his father's spinal cord. The magic dice show exactly the number that he would want. Duryodhana takes pity on the lone prisoner, Shakuni after the rest of the Gandhara royal family dies in prison out of starvation. Shakuni joins <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> coterie of Duryodhana, Karna and Dushyasana.|$|E
5|$|There is {{reliance}} on repetition of themes within {{the plot of}} Thalaba. Three times he attained a paradise {{that turns out to}} be false, and this is followed by the death of a woman who are gone until the very end when Thalaba is awarded entrance into a true paradise. The seeking out of mythic figures to guide him onto the next part of the tale is equally repetitive and has little result for the plot. Various instances of the sorcerers and sorceresses are added to the story to emphasise <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> magic along with tempting Thalaba with power. However, the emphasis on magic hides the moral within Thalaba's temptations. Although Thalaba does achieve his goal through moral submission, many of the quests and actions are arbitrary and repetitive. As such, they take away from any Islamic truth that could be found within the actions.|$|E
5|$|While the Grand Prince is away in Lithuania, his power-hungry {{younger brother}} forms an {{allegiance}} {{with a group}} of Tatars and raids Vladimir. We see flashbacks of the Grand Prince and his brother attending a religious service in the church, and see the rivalry and animosity between them. The invasion of the combined armed forces on horseback and the resulting carnage is shown in great detail. The city is burned, the citizens are murdered and women raped and killed. One scene shows a horse falling from a flight of stairs and being stabbed by a spear. Another shows a cow being set on fire. Foma narrowly escapes being killed in the city and escapes into the nearby countryside, but as he is crossing a river he is shot in the back with an arrow and killed. The Tatars force their way into the barricaded church, now fully decorated with Andrei's paintings, where the majority of the citizens have taken refuge. The Tatars show no mercy and massacre the people inside and burn all the painted wooden altarpieces. Andrei saves Durochka from being raped by killing a Tatar with an axe. The Bishop's messenger is cruelly tortured to make him reveal the location of the city's gold, which he refuses to do. After being repeatedly burned, he has liquid metal from a melted crucifix poured into his mouth and is dragged away tied to a horse. In the aftermath only Andrei and Durochka are left alive in the church. Andrei imagines a conversation with the dead Theophanes the Greek, lamenting the loss of his work and <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> mankind, while Durochka distractedly plaits the hair of a dead woman. Andrei decides to give up painting and takes a vow of silence to atone for killing another man.|$|E

25|$|It is true {{there are}} cases in which, if we confine {{ourselves}} {{to the effects of}} the first order, the good will have an incontestable preponderance over the evil. Were the offence considered only under this point of view, it would not be easy to assign any good reasons to justify the rigour of the laws. Every thing depends upon <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> the second order; it is this which gives to such actions the character of crime, and which makes punishment necessary. Let us take, for example, the physical desire of satisfying hunger. Let a beggar, pressed by hunger, steal from a rich man's house a loaf, which perhaps saves him from starving, can it be possible to compare the good which the thief acquires for himself, with the evil which the rich man suffers? … It is not on account of <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> the first order {{that it is necessary to}} erect these actions into offences, but on account of <b>the</b> <b>evil</b> <b>of</b> the second order.|$|E
