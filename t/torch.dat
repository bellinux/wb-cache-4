5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men <b>torch</b> fish. <b>Torch</b> fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for <b>torch</b> fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, <b>torch</b> fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, <b>torch</b> fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. <b>Torch</b> fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the <b>torch</b> fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish <b>torch</b> fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to <b>torch</b> fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the <b>torch</b> fishers. Second, <b>torch</b> fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of <b>torch</b> fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. <b>Torch</b> fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
5|$|A {{differently}} designed <b>torch</b> {{was used}} for the final leg. It was made of stainless steel and was fueled by magnesium {{in order to ensure that}} the flame showed up properly during the opening ceremony. It was also designed by Ralph Lavers, with the frame for the <b>torch</b> created by EMI, and the magnesium candle supplied by Wessex Aircraft Engineering. Neither the suppliers nor designer charged a fee for the final <b>torch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a <b>torch</b> by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the <b>torch</b> of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic <b>torch</b> relay that will carry the flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the <b>torch</b> relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Torches</b> have {{appeared}} in the CFA state title game four times, hosting the championship game in 2000. Until 2003, the <b>Torches</b> football program had advanced to the post-season playoffs each year since the program's inception. The <b>Torches</b> have won two CFA state titles. In 2007, the <b>Torches</b> won their first, beating Tuscaloosa Christian 58-12. The second came in 2011 when the <b>Torches</b> beat North River Christian Academy 52-22. This win completed the first ever perfect season for the <b>Torches</b> ending with an 11-0 record.|$|R

5|$|The {{detailed}} <b>torch</b> relay {{route and}} celebration sites were announced on February 24, 2015. The <b>torch</b> arrived in Toronto and then headed to Thunder Bay, before visiting all other communities on the route. The relay also visited five National Historic Sites of Canada, six Canadian Forces bases and one provincial park. There were 180 celebrations across the <b>torch</b> relay route.|$|E

5|$|Week of Welcome, usually {{held the}} first or second week of the Fall {{semester}} holds many spirit events, such as Trail of the <b>Torch.</b> Trail of the <b>Torch</b> is another university tradition that has continued to grow annually, where a pep rally is held in the Housing Quad with music, food, giveaways and dancing. After the pep rally, the <b>torch</b> of knowledge is lit and blue and gold candles are distributed to the crowd for the procession around the campus, trailing the <b>torch</b> from the Housing Quad to the <b>torch</b> in front of the Primera Casa building. Rage Week and Homecoming Week are other major back-to-back spirit weeks held in the Fall semester. They include the Homecoming Parade, Greek Row parties, Homecoming football game, Blue/Gold Party, pep rallies and other Panther Rage events.|$|E

50|$|Fuel <b>torches</b> are {{available}} in a vast range of size and output power. The term blowtorch applies to the smaller and lower temperature range of these. Blowtorches are typically a single hand-held unit, with their draught supplied by a natural draught of air. The larger <b>torches</b> may have a heavy fuel reservoir placed on the ground, connected by a hose. This is common for butane- or propane-fuelled gas <b>torches,</b> but also applies to the older, large liquid paraffin (kerosene) <b>torches</b> such as the Wells light.|$|R
5|$|An {{application}} {{period for}} Canadians {{to carry the}} <b>torch</b> opened in October 2014 and continued until December. Anyone aged 13 or older as of May 30, 2015 was eligible to become a torchbearer. Most of the torchbearers were selected by a random selection, while the others were selected by <b>torch</b> relay communities and games partners.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{blowtorches}} used liquid fuel, {{carried in}} a refillable reservoir attached to the lamp. Modern blowtorches are mostly gas-fuelled. Their fuel reservoir is disposable or refillable by exchange. The term [...] "blowlamp" [...] usually refers to liquid-fuelled <b>torches</b> still used in the UK. Liquid-fuelled <b>torches</b> are pressurized by a piston hand pump, while gas <b>torches</b> are self-pressurized by the fuel evaporation.|$|R

5|$|Finally, the <b>Torch</b> {{is brought}} into the stadium, passed from athlete to athlete during the <b>torch</b> relay, until it reaches the last carrier; often a {{well-known}} athlete from the host nation, who lights {{the fire in the}} stadium's cauldron. Under IOC rules, the lighting of the Olympic cauldron must be witnessed by those attending the opening ceremony, implying that it must be lit at the location where the ceremony is taking place. Another IOC rule states that the cauldron should be witnessed outside by the entire residents of the entire host city. This was made evident during the opening ceremony for the 2010 Games in Vancouver. The venue chosen as the Olympic Stadium was BC Place, which at the time was an air-supported domed stadium. Since there was no way the cauldron could be displayed outside and also be seen at the stadium, two cauldrons were used. For the first <b>torch</b> lighting inside the stadium the organizers chose three-time speed skating medalist Catriona Le May Doan, Canadian Senator Nancy Greene, who won two medals for Canada at the 1968 Games, NBA star Steve Nash, a native of nearby Victoria, and hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, to each light one of four arms of the <b>torch.</b> Notably, Le May Doan's arm refused to light; this was later rectified during the closing ceremony when she got a second chance to light her part of the <b>torch</b> and succeeded.|$|E
30|$|The low <b>torching</b> {{potential}} is contradictory to {{local and regional}} experience on recent wildfires, where <b>torching</b> potential appears to be substantial (Williamson 1999, R. Harrod and K. Satterfield, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forests, personal communication). Resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the scale at which the data are presented. Unit averages were comprised of about 30 plot measurements each, and across all units, 17 % of these plots had sufficiently high surface fireline intensity and sufficiently low canopy base height values such that <b>torching</b> would be enabled with 97 percentile weather. As not only the <b>torched</b> plot but surrounding trees would also be killed from the heat generated by the <b>torched</b> group, perhaps {{a third of the}} stand would be killed simply from the <b>torching,</b> above any mortality from surface fire activity alone. This is likely the scale at which the forest would actually experience the fire, and it is consistent with local wildfire experience. However, the experimental design, if analyzed at the plot scale, would have been pseudoreplicated (Hurlbert 1984), so that statistical analysis at the plot scale is not possible.|$|R

5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a <b>torch</b> are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the <b>torch</b> with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the <b>torch</b> is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010, the <b>torches</b> are {{structurally}} stable {{at their}} restored location; new mounts were bolted into the limestone bases, not directly {{attached to the}} <b>torches</b> but merely holding them in place underneath. At {{the time of this}} most recent installation the bronze was completely discolored by verdigris and black corrosion film. This splotchy appearance made the overall shape of the lampposts and the designs within the intricate bronze-work difficult to fully appreciate. Thus, the IMA Conservation Department performed a treatment on the <b>torches</b> following installation, thoroughly cleaning away most of the corrosion and applying multiple protective coatings of wax to the <b>torches</b> to protect them from further corrosion.|$|R
5000|$|In Ancient {{times it}} was similar to a lamp, and would have {{incorporated}} either candles or oil. The fanous originally developed from the <b>torches</b> used in the Pharaonic festivals celebrating the rising of the star Sirius. For five days, the Ancient Egyptians celebrated the birthdays of Osiris, Horus, Isis, Seth and Nephtys—one on each day—by lighting the streets with the fanous (<b>torches).</b> <b>Torches</b> or candles were also used in early Christianity. This is recorded by Egyptian historian Al-Maqrizi (1364 - 1442), who noted in his book, [...] "Al Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar", that these <b>torches</b> or candles were used at Christmastime for celebration.|$|R
5000|$|Many <b>torches</b> now use a hose-supplied gas feed, {{which is}} often mains gas. They may also have a forced-air supply, from either an air blower or an oxygen cylinder. Both of these larger and more {{powerful}} designs are less commonly described as blowtorches, while the term blowtorch is usually reserved for the smaller and less powerful self-contained <b>torches.</b> The archaic term [...] "blowpipe" [...] is sometimes still used in relation to oxy-acetylene welding <b>torches.</b>|$|R
