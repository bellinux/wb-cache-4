5|$|A {{particularly}} memorable {{match between}} the two sides came on 1 February 1958, when they met in a league fixture at Highbury. It was the last league game that United played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and saw two other players injured <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet. Five of the United players who would lose their lives {{as a result of the}} crash took to the field in the game – captain and full-back Roger Byrne, right-half Eddie Colman, centre-half Mark Jones, left-half Edwards and centre-forward Taylor.|$|E

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, however, the then megas doux, Michael Stryphnos, was accused by Niketas Choniates of {{enriching}} himself by selling off the equipment {{of the imperial}} fleet, while by the early 13th century {{the authority of the}} central government had weakened <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that various local potentates began seizing power in the provinces. The general atmosphere was one of lawlessness, which enabled men like Leo Sgouros in southern Greece and the imperial governor of Samos, Pegonites, to use their ships for their own purposes, launching raids of their own. Even Emperor Alexios III Angelos (1195–1203) is said to have licensed one of his commanders, Constantine Phrangopoulos, to launch pirate raids against commerce in the Black Sea.|$|E
5|$|Born {{in rural}} Russia in 1902, Suslov {{became a member}} of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 and studied {{economics}} for much of the 1920s. He left his job as a teacher in 1931 to pursue politics full-time, becoming one of the many Soviet politicians who took part in the mass repression begun by Joseph Stalin's regime. Suslov impressed the Soviet leadership <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent in the pre-Eastern Front Soviet Union that he was made First Secretary of Stavropol Krai administrative area. During the war, Suslov headed the local Stavropol guerrilla movement. He {{became a member of}} the Organisational Bureau (Orgburo) of the Central Committee in 1946 and, four years later, was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the All-Union Communist Party.|$|E

When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her that his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that serious remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Early during Kosygin's tenure, the Brezhnev–Kosygin {{attempt to}} create {{stability}} was failing on various fronts. From 1969 to 1970 discontent within the Soviet leadership had grown <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that some started to doubt both former and current Soviet policies. Examples include {{the handling of the}} Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (which Kosygin initially resisted), the decline in agriculture production, the Sino–Soviet border conflict (he advocated restraint), the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–American talks on the limitation of strategic missiles. Two summit conferences between the US and the USSR were held: the Warsaw Pact Summit Conference and the Moscow Summit Conference; both failed to gain support for Soviet policies.|$|E
5|$|From 1910 {{until his}} death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the {{leading role in the}} patent struggle, {{traveling}} incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred {{in the wake of his}} exhausting travels and the stress of the legal battle.|$|E

It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|His successor, Tanutamun, {{also made}} a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He {{successfully}} defeated Necho, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards.

5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} federal statute banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R.

5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that the running plate was the only component recognisable to the casual observer.|$|E
5|$|In addition, a {{programme}} of modernising {{many of the}} Underground's busiest central London stations was started; {{providing them}} with escalators to replace lifts.

5|$|In his memoirs, Władysław Szpilman also {{compared}} {{himself to}} Crusoe and, like Fogelman, emphasized the isolation and hopelessness which characterized the Warsaw Crusoes.

The movie that was eventually filmed, Miasto Nieujarzmione ("Unyoked city"), was heavily censored by the communist authorities, and its original theme changed <b>to</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> extent that Miłosz requested his name be removed from the film's credits.
