500|$|In an {{interview}} for YouTube posted on December 24, 2009, Carey elaborated on the lyrical meaning, saying that it [...] "really hits people in their hearts because it's like... everybody has experienced when you love somebody, and <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go, but you can't let them go. So 'I can't wait to hate you' is a strong statement". Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club compared the seagull chirp [...] "vocal acrobatic" [...] sung by Carey during the track's climax to the whistle notes she sings on her 1991 single [...] "Emotions".|$|E
500|$|Licciardello {{stated that}} they did not know they had entered the red zone, and [...] "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone. You can go into the green zone if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you,</b> but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E
2500|$|Between his smelter job and his music, {{he made a}} {{good living}} in the Helena area. He moved {{his wife and son}} to join him and they lived in Helena until 1967, {{purchasing}} their first home there, and with their children Dion and Angela being born at the local hospital. [...] The Pride family moved to Great Falls, Montana, in 1967, because Pride's music career was taking off and he required quicker access to an airport. The family ultimately left Montana and moved to Texas in 1969. [...] In a 1967 interview with the Helena Independent Record, Rozene commented that the family encountered minor racism in Montana, citing an incident where they were refused service in a restaurant and another time when a realtor refused to show them a home, but she felt that the family endured less racism than she saw leveled against local Native American people, whose treatment she compared to that given to black people in the South. Pride has generally spoken with fondness of the near-decade he spent there. “Montana is a very conservative state...I stood out like a neon. But once <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> in, you become a Montanan. When the rumor was that I was leaving. They kept saying, ‘we will let you in, you can’t leave.’" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>they</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> stay. We've {{tried it}} over and over; and the court won't <b>let</b> <b>you.</b> <b>They</b> say {{you will have to}} be tried, and they will put you in prison." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I cannot {{say much}} now, Gertrude, but I {{know how good}} you are; you will come and see me, if <b>they</b> will <b>let</b> <b>you,</b> won't you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{sorry to}} go?" [...] I asked, getting {{as close to}} the grating as I could. [...] "If <b>they</b> would <b>let</b> <b>you,</b> would you go on writing for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Tomlinson, [...] "you're 'way {{more patient}} than I would be. Why did <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go on working until you {{had found the}} gold?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{goodness}} that we {{are really}} off. I have been horribly nervous all the time. If <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> leave England they can have no suspicion as yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you're only {{a boy and}} don't {{understand}} the trick," [...] growled the lieutenant, {{who was in a}} bad humor generally. [...] "I don't see why <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{on up to}} the Hall," [...] went on Jack. [...] "I'm sure <b>they</b> will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> dry them {{in front}} of the open fire in the big living-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even if {{they have}} not, señor, you are safe from another attack. Now they know that you carry pistols, and are {{prepared}} for them, <b>they</b> will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Great place, great place. Finest {{thing in}} the world." [...] And then, suddenly, Mr. Tristram hesitated and looked about him. [...] "I suppose <b>they</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> smoke here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,' said I, 'friend, {{but will}} <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> {{come on board}} after you have been on shore here, when {{this is such a}} terrible place, and so {{infected}} as it is?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But cannot {{somebody}} else {{be found to}} go to them? You are not as necessary there as you are here, nor so highly prized. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go of their own accord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Gethryn wearily, 'it isn't a puncture. I always let the air {{out when}} I'm riding. It looks so much better, don't you think so? Why did <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> out? Good-bye.' ...|$|E
6000|$|VOICE. What has happened? They've been {{bothering me}} so with {{medicines}} and things, and <b>they</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> {{come and see}} me. I was never ill before. Am I ill now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} that <b>they</b> will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go; <b>they</b> will keep you to be their great doctoress. You should not have come. I sent you word--what did my life matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{he said to}} me, [...] "why <b>they</b> have <b>let</b> <b>you</b> {{come here}} I cannot tell! You know that I am in prison--that I am not likely to leave here alive!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said I, [...] "friend, {{but will}} <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> {{come on board}} after you have been on shore here, when this {{has been such a}} terrible place, and so {{infected}} as it is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Darting out, he procures a glass, returns, and, {{holding it}} to the sufferer's lips, {{supports}} his head while he drinks: [...] "And did <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> lie here, my poor sir, racked with this parching thirst?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Lot's of {{good men}} get 'em,' says Andy. 'If you don't answer {{the first letter}} <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> drop. If you answer it they write again asking you to come on with your money and do business.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A secret! My {{existence}} {{a secret}} from my child, my beautiful fond child!' exclaimed Herbert in a tone even more desolate than bitter. 'Why did <b>they</b> not <b>let</b> <b>you</b> at least hate me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come with me, then,' {{answered}} he; 'the servants are all my friends, and <b>they</b> will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> {{stand in}} the passage down which the king's son will pass, and all the company too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well {{take it from}} me, {{your only}} chance is to make them chummy. If you do {{something}} to please them, <b>they</b> might <b>let</b> <b>you</b> stay on, even though Peter was tired of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Still,” said Nettie naively, “I didn’t {{think you}} would. You {{have too many}} possessions, and, you see, there are {{limitations}} in the song. You might knock a long while at those ivory gates before <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> in.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Long {{enough to}} do {{me out of my}} five dollars' tip every week," [...] the man grumbled. [...] "I'm a married man, too, and a good American. Blast you fellows, coming and taking our jobs away! Can't think what <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> into the country for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh {{that was}} it!" [...] Alexis said. [...] "I {{wondered}} {{how you got}} mixed up in the affair, and still more why <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> out after your having been caught in what they considered a serious business. Well, here we are, victims both, {{and it is a}} curious chance that has thrown us together again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{came from}} the wrong school for us," [...] he declared. [...] "Regular thieves, the people he was with. By the bye, didn't <b>they</b> nearly <b>let</b> <b>you</b> that death-trap of old Lady Idlemay's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} <b>they</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> do," [...] said Mr. Brumley. [...] "Nobody visits but relations--and {{prospective}} relations, {{and the only}} other social intercourse is over the garden wall. Perhaps I can find books----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{mother says}} that she has some idea that you and she might live together;--that if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> Floodborough <b>you</b> might take a small house in Dublin. Remember, Phineas, I am not proposing it myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said--and Nasmyth {{could just}} hear {{him through the}} roar of the fall--"it seems to me the thing could be done if you have nerve enough. Still, I guess if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> have the whole valley afterwards, you'd deserve it." [...] Then he seemed to laugh. [...] "I'll make my share one {{thousand}} five hundred dollars. In the meanwhile, if you have no objections, we'll get back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know, dear. I {{was just}} thinking--maybe your boss {{is one of}} the temperance cranks," [...] Una interrupted. Mr. Schwirtz's {{arguments}} regarding the privileges of a manly man sounded very familiar. This {{did not seem to be}} a moment for letting her husband get into the full swing of them. She begged: [...] "What will you do if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> out? I wish there was something I could do to help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor gal, poor gal, it's plain enough how it is, but the Lord {{will bear}} in mind one of your simple heart and kind feelin's! We'll talk no more of these things; if you had reason, you'd be sorrowful at having let others so much into your secret. Tell me, Hetty, what has become of all the Hurons, and why <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> roam about the p'int as if you, too, was a prisoner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very likely. Move! What's {{the harm}} of moving? You talk of moving {{as though that}} were {{the worst thing that}} could happen. How would you like to be in some place where <b>they</b> wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>you</b> move?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And by my troth, {{he needs}} good country diet and air!" [...] cried Perronel. [...] "Thou hast had none {{to take care}} of <b>thee,</b> Ambrose. <b>They</b> have <b>let</b> <b>thee</b> pine and dwine over thy books. I must take thee in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have it so," [...] she declared. [...] "I {{never asked}} {{you for your}} silence. If you repent it, go and make the best bargain you can with the law. <b>They</b> will <b>let</b> <b>you</b> off cheaply in {{exchange}} for your information!" ...|$|R
