30|$|Although {{there are}} many <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> {{estimate}} frequency-domain representations for signals, {{it was noted that}} the discrete Fourier transform is the most used. Also, it was noted <b>that</b> <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> consider long-term characteristics of the signals tend to outperform the others. This suggests that future work in AMT should focus on the development of machine learning <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> exploit characteristics that are often found in music, such as sparseness in time and frequency and a tendency for continuity in spectral representations.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFiber {{tracking}} is {{a common}} method for analyzing 3 D tensor fields that arise from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. This method can visualize, e. g., {{the structure of the}} brain's white matter or that of muscle tissue. Fiber tracking results in dense, line-based datasets that are often too large to understand when shown directly. This chapter provides a survey of recent illustrative visualization approaches that address this problem. We group this work into <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> improve the depth perception of fiber tracts, <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> visualize additional data about the tracts, <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> employ focus+context visualization, visualizations of fiber tract bundles, representations of uncertainty in the context of probabilistic fiber tracking, and <b>techniques</b> <b>that</b> rely on a spatially abstracted visualization of connectivity...|$|R

5|$|The initial {{metallurgical}} {{analysis of}} the hoard {{was carried out in}} late 1992 and early 1993 by Cowell and Hook for the procedural purposes of the coroner's inquest.

5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a <b>technique</b> <b>that</b> is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an imaging <b>technique</b> <b>that</b> photographically {{records the}} electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Eric Koretz {{served as}} {{director}} of photography; he joined the team during a shift in focus in January 2008. Koretz used a Panasonic AG-HPX500 P2 HD camcorder. He commented to industry publication Videography about the choice of <b>technique,</b> <b>that</b> due to {{the intensity of the}} production team's travel schedule tape format would not have been an option. He stated he preferred using P2 cards over the HDD-based format due to its superior reliability. During the editing process, Glen Echo Entertainment utilized eight Apple Macintosh computers with Intel processors, equipped with Apple's Final Cut Pro editing software.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on the front wheel during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding <b>technique</b> <b>that</b> takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on the front wheel is known as trail braking.|$|E
5|$|Masaccio {{is often}} {{compared}} to contemporaries like Donatello and Brunelleschi as {{a pioneer of}} the renaissance, particularly for his use of single-point perspective. One <b>technique</b> <b>that</b> was unique to Masaccio, however, {{was the use of}} atmospheric, or aerial perspective. Both the mountains in the background, and the figure of Peter on the left are dimmer and paler than the objects in the foreground, creating an illusion of depth. This technique was known in ancient Rome, but was considered lost until reinvented by Masaccio.|$|E

Sartain sought her father's input on her work throughout her career and benefited from his support and connections. She carried on the mezzatint engraving <b>technique</b> <b>that</b> he taught her. Sartain lived with her parents into adulthood, supporting and caring for them in their later years. In 1886, her parents moved into her living quarters at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{published}} in serial form {{during the winter}} of 1834/35, Le Père Goriot is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a <b>technique</b> <b>that</b> distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his realist style, using minute details to create character and subtext.|$|E
