500|$|Tory Christman, {{a critic}} of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt {{encouraged}} by the new influx of critics of Scientology. Christman told Morning Edition: [...] "It feels like we've been out in this desert, fighting this group one-on-one by ourselves, {{and all of a}} sudden this huge army came up with not only tons of people, thousands of people, but better tools..." [...] Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told the St. Petersburg Times he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: [...] "I've never seen anything like that before. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see it on a Web cam." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said the}} song was {{given to him by}} DJ Frank E {{while he was in the}} studio writing songs for other artists and himself. [...] "I heard the track and I was like man <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> It kind of gave me the 'Forever' feeling so I wanted to do more of a song for my pop {{audience}}. I’ve been doing a lot of mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E

5000|$|On April 24, 2006, Kimeru {{announced}} that he would be making his first ever live appearance overseas in China.

60|$|I suppose I did {{not quite}} do my duty by {{the ruins of the}} Norman castle, and I feel that it is now too late to repair my neglect. The stronghold was more than once {{attempted}} by the Welsh in those wars which make their history a catalogue of battles, but it held out Norman till the Normans turned English. Owen Glendover took it in 1402, when it was three hundred years old, though not yet feeble with age, and in due time one of Cromwell's lieutenants destroyed it. Some very picturesque fragments remain to attest the grace and strength of the ancient hold. It is near the University College and the Amusement Pier, so that the mere sight-seers can do all the ordinary objects of interest at Aberystwyth in half a day or half an hour. But we were none of these. We {{had fallen in love with}} the place, and we would fain have stayed on after the week was up for which we had taken our lodging. It appeared from a house-to-house canvass, that there was no other lodging to be had in all that long crescent of the Terrace; or, if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incredible,</b> there was none we would have. Our successors were impending; and though I think our English landlady might have invented something for us at the last moment, the Welsh Power was inexorable. Her ideal was lodgers who would go out and buy their own provisions, and we had set our faces against that. Some one must yield, and the Welsh Power could not; it was not in her nature. We were therefore in a manner expelled from Aberystwyth, but our banishment was not from all Wales, and this was how we went next to Llandudno.|$|E
60|$|Most male {{birds are}} highly pugnacious during the breeding-season, and some possess weapons adapted for {{fighting}} with their rivals. But the most pugnacious {{and the best}} armed males rarely or never depend for success solely on their power to drive away or kill their rivals, but have special means for charming the female. With some it {{is the power of}} song, or of giving forth strange cries, or instrumental music, and the males in consequence differ from the females in their vocal organs, or in the structure of certain feathers. From the curiously diversified means for producing various sounds, we gain a high idea of the importance of this means of courtship. Many birds endeavour to charm the females by love- dances or antics, performed on the ground or in the air, and sometimes at prepared places. But ornaments of many kinds, the most brilliant tints, combs and wattles, beautiful plumes, elongated feathers, top-knots, and so forth, are by far the commonest means. In some cases mere novelty appears to have acted as a charm. The ornaments of the males must be highly important to them, for they have been acquired in not a few cases at the cost of increased danger from enemies, and even at some loss of power in fighting with their rivals. The males of very many species do not assume their ornamental dress until they arrive at maturity, or they assume it only during the breeding-season, or the tints then become more vivid. Certain ornamental appendages become enlarged, turgid, and brightly coloured during the act of courtship. The males display their charms with elaborate care and to the best effect; and this is done {{in the presence of the}} females. The courtship is sometimes a prolonged affair, and many males and females congregate at an appointed place. To suppose that the females do not appreciate the beauty of the males, is to admit that their splendid decorations, all their pomp and display, are useless; and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> Birds have fine powers of discrimination, and in some few instances it can be shewn that they have a taste for the beautiful. The females, moreover, are known occasionally to exhibit a marked preference or antipathy for certain individual males.|$|E

In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say whatever they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them...

In short, she was charming and maddening in her defensive ruses, in her advances and retreats, for I pressed her hard during the four weeks which followed, and in them made four visits. Flinging caution to the winds, I did not even pretend to George that I was coming to see him on business. I had the Hutchins family on my side, for they had the sense to see that the match would be an advantageous one; I even summoned up enough courage to talk to Ezra Hutchins on the subject.|$|R

Based on the material handling discussed in Section 2. 3, {{there are only three}} errors that could result in a shipping container being over batched. These are: incorrect measurement of the item, selecting the wrong item to package, and packaging two items into a single shipping container. The analysis in Section 3 shows that the first two events are incredible because of the controls that exist at LLNL. The third event is physically impossible.

Dreaming is the language of mind. It nourishes mind with innovative wondering ideas. Personal creativity is greatly increased by utilizing the information gleaned from the subconscious mind in dreaming. The dream experience is perhaps the most creative form of consciousness that some people will ever experience. When recall these dreams upon waking can take symbols, images and adventures experience and discover what is going on at deeper levels of psyche.

40|$|Super-resolution {{microscopy}} has tremendously progressed {{our understanding}} of cellular biophysics and biochemistry. Specifically, 4 pi fluorescence microscopy technique stands out because of its axial super-resolution capability. All types of 4 pi-microscopy techniques work well in conjugation with deconvolution techniques {{to get rid of}} artifacts due to side-lobes. In this regard, we propose a technique based on spatial filter in a 4 pi-type-C confocal setup to get rid of these artifacts. Using a special spatial filter, we have reduced the depth-of-focus. Interference of two similar depth-of-focus beams in a 4 pi geometry result in substantial reduction of side-lobes. Studies show a reduction of side-lobes by 46 % and 76 % for single and two photon variant compared to 4 pi - type - C confocal system. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>incredible</b> considering the resolving capability of the existing 4 pi - type - C confocal microscopy. Moreover, the main lobe is found to be 150 nm for the proposed spatial filtering technique as compared to 690 nm of the state-of-art confocal system. Reconstruction of experimentally obtained 2 PE - 4 pi data of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged mitocondrial network shows near elimination of artifacts arising out of side-lobes. Proposed technique may find interesting application in fluorescence microscopy, nano-lithography, and cell biology. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
