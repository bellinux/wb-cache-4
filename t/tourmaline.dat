5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the <b>tourmaline</b> veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are {{attracted}} towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the <b>tourmaline</b> veils, they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands. As the chapter ends, the now enormous monsters brought to life by the volcanic energy are spilling away from Greenland towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red <b>tourmaline,</b> and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E

40|$|Tourmaline-bearing {{rocks and}} a number of gold occurrences coexist in southwestern Finland, in a region where {{extensive}} magmatism and hydrothermal systems occurred during the Svecofennian orogeny, 1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga ago. <b>Tourmalines</b> investigated for this study were sampled from late-orogenic granite pegmatites (Eräjärvi, Kietyönmäki), quartztourmaline veins from gold occurrences (Kutemajärvi, Riukka), and the tourmalinised contact between a synorogenic intrusion and supracrustal rocks (Lepomäki Au occurrence, Ylöjärvi Cu-W-As-Ag-Au deposit). Major element compositions of the <b>tourmalines</b> are controlled by their host lithologies, whereas their boron isotopic compositions reflect the B reservoir(s) and the magmatic hydrothermal processes of the B-bearing systems. The obtained δ 11 B values for granite pegmatite, vein, and intrusion-country rock contact-related <b>tourmalines</b> range between - 10. 2 ‰ and - 13. 2 ‰, - 10. 2 ‰ and - 11. 6 ‰, and - 9. 6 ‰ and - 8. 7 ‰, respectively, and are similar to <b>tourmalines</b> worldwide. The lighter B isotopic composition at Lepomäki gold and Ylöjärvi polymetallic occurrences indicate different B reservoirs and magmatic-hydrothermal processes between syn and late-orogenic <b>tourmalines.</b> Geological observations and geochemical data on tourmalinesalso suggest that B was a constituent in hydrothermal fluids at all localities, including the gold-mineralising fluids at Lepomäki, Ylöjärvi and Riukka...|$|R
25|$|Almost {{every color}} of <b>tourmaline</b> {{can be found}} in Brazil, {{especially}} in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais and Bahia. In 1989, miners discovered a unique and brightly colored variety of <b>tourmaline</b> in the state of Paraíba. The new type of <b>tourmaline,</b> which soon became known as paraiba <b>tourmaline,</b> came in blue and green. Brazilian paraiba <b>tourmaline</b> usually contains abundant inclusions. Much of the paraiba <b>tourmaline</b> from Brazil actually comes from the neighboring state of Rio Grande do Norte. Material from Rio Grande do Norte is often somewhat less intense in color, but many fine gems are found there. It was determined that the element copper was important in the coloration of the stone.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{valuable}} {{variety is}} chrome <b>tourmaline,</b> a rare type of dravite <b>tourmaline</b> from Tanzania. Chrome <b>tourmaline</b> {{is a rich}} green color due {{to the presence of}} chromium atoms in the crystal; chromium also produces the green color of emeralds. Of the standard elbaite colors, blue indicolite gems are typically the most valuable, followed by green verdelite and pink to red rubellite. There are also yellow tourmalines, sometimes known as canary <b>tourmaline.</b> Zambia is rich in both red and yellow <b>tourmaline,</b> which are relatively inexpensive in that country. Ironically the rarest variety, colorless achroite, is not appreciated and is the least expensive of the transparent tourmalines.|$|E

25|$|Some fine gems and {{specimen}} {{material has}} been {{produced in the}} United States, with the first discoveries in 1822, {{in the state of}} Maine. California became a large producer of <b>tourmaline</b> in the early 1900s. The Maine deposits tend to produce crystals in raspberry pink-red as well as minty greens. The California deposits are known for bright pinks, as well as bicolors. During the early 1900s, Maine and California were the world's largest producers of gem tourmalines. The Empress Dowager Cixi of China loved pink <b>tourmaline</b> and bought large quantities for gemstones and carvings from the then new Himalaya Mine, located in San Diego County, California. It is not clear when the first <b>tourmaline</b> was found in California. Native Americans have used pink and green <b>tourmaline</b> as funeral gifts for centuries.

40|$|International audienceTwo {{pegmatite}} {{groups are}} represented in southeastern Brazil. The first group, resulting from fractional crystallization, is linked to syn-tectonic granites (580 Ma - deformation event D) and the second one is associated with another partial melting event of the crust which simultaneously produced porphyritic leucogranites [(520 - 500 Ma) - later deformation event D 2] and pegmatites themselves. The Fe/Mn ratios of <b>tourmalines,</b> micas and columbite-tantalites decrease continuously from simple pegmatites to gem quality elbaite-rich ones. The Fe/Mn ratio {{has been used as}} a qualitative fractionation index which seems to reflect the regional zoning of the first pegmatites group around a hidden granite body.

25|$|<b>Tourmaline</b> is a six-member ring cyclosilicate {{having a}} {{trigonal}} crystal system. It occurs as long, slender to thick prismatic and columnar crystals {{that are usually}} triangular in cross-section, often with curved striated faces. The style of termination {{at the ends of}} crystals is sometimes asymmetrical, called hemimorphism. Small slender prismatic crystals are common in a fine-grained granite called aplite, often forming radial daisy-like patterns. <b>Tourmaline</b> is distinguished by its three-sided prisms; no other common mineral has three sides. Prisms faces often have heavy vertical striations that produce a rounded triangular effect. <b>Tourmaline</b> is rarely perfectly euhedral. An exception was the fine dravite tourmalines of Yinnietharra, in western Australia. The deposit was discovered in the 1970s, but is now exhausted. All hemimorphic crystals are piezoelectric, and are often pyroelectric as well.|$|E
25|$|A lithium-tourmaline elbaite was one {{of three}} pegmatitic {{minerals}} from Utö, Sweden, in which the new alkali element lithium (Li) was determined in 1818 by Johan August Arfwedson for the first time. Elba Island, Italy, {{was one of}} the first localities where colored and colorless Li-tourmalines were extensively chemically analysed. In 1850 Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg described fluorine (F) in <b>tourmaline</b> for the first time. In 1870 he proved that all varieties of <b>tourmaline</b> contain chemically bound water. In 1889 Scharitzer proposed the substitution of (OH) by F in red Li-tourmaline from Sušice, Czech Republic. In 1914 Vladimir Vernadsky proposed the name Elbait for lithium-, sodium-, and aluminum-rich <b>tourmaline</b> from Elba Island, Italy, with the simplified formula (Li,Na)HAl6B2Si4O21. Most likely the type material for elbaite was found at Fonte del Prete, San Piero in Campo, Campo nell'Elba, Elba Island, Province of Livorno, Tuscany, Italy. In 1933 Winchell published an updated formula for elbaite, H8Na2Li3Al3B6Al12Si12O62, which is commonly used to date written as Na(Li1.5Al1.5)Al6(BO3)3(OH)3(OH). The first crystal structure determination of a Li-rich <b>tourmaline</b> was published in 1972 by Donnay and Barton, performed on a pink elbaite from San Diego County, California, United States.|$|E
25|$|The name dravite {{was used}} for the first time by Gustav Tschermak (1836–1927), Professor of Mineralogy and Petrography at the University of Vienna, in his book Lehrbuch der Mineralogie (published in 1884) for magnesium-rich (and sodium-rich) <b>tourmaline</b> from village Dobrova near Unterdrauburg in the Drava river area, Carinthia, Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today this <b>tourmaline</b> {{locality}} (type locality for dravite) at Dobrova (near Dravograd), {{is a part of the}} Republic of Slovenia. Tschermak gave this <b>tourmaline</b> the name dravite, for the Drava river area, which is the district along the Drava River (in German: Drau, in Latin: Drave) in Austria and Slovenia. The chemical composition which was given by Tschermak in 1884 for this dravite approximately corresponds to the formula NaMg3(Al,Mg)6B3Si6O27(OH), which is in good agreement (except for the OH content) with the endmember formula of dravite as known today.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>tourmaline</b> gems, {{especially}} pink to red colored stones, are {{altered by}} heat treatment {{to improve their}} color. Overly dark red stones can be lightened by careful heat treatment. The pink color in manganese-containing near-colorless to pale pink stones can be greatly increased by irradiation with gamma-rays or electron beams. Irradiation {{is almost impossible to}} detect in tourmalines, and does not, currently, impact the value. Heavily included tourmalines, such as rubellite and Brazilian paraiba, are sometimes clarity-enhanced. A clarity-enhanced <b>tourmaline</b> (especially the paraiba variety) is worth much less than a non-treated gem.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, copper-containing <b>tourmaline</b> {{was found in}} Nigeria.
