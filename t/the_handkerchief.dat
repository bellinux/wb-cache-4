5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E
25|$|A nation-wide manhunt ensued. Sherman {{was found}} {{four days later}} in Toledo, Ohio. He {{explained}} under interrogation that he had eloped with his girlfriend and denied that <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> was his. He was administered a polygraph test, which he passed, and was later cleared. The handkerchief's real owner, Airman Seymour Sherman of New York City, was eventually found. He {{had been out of}} the country when Suzanne Degnan was murdered. He had no idea how it could possibly have ended up in Chicago and the presence of <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> was determined to be a coincidence.|$|E
25|$|Fort Sumter raised Wigfall's white {{handkerchief}} on its flagpole as Wigfall departed in {{his small}} boat back to Morris Island, where he was hailed as a hero. <b>The</b> <b>handkerchief</b> was spotted in Charleston and a delegation of officers representing BeauregardStephen D. Lee, Porcher Miles, a former mayor of Charleston, and Roger Pryorsailed to Sumter, unaware of Wigfall's visit. Anderson was outraged when these officers disavowed Wigfall's authority, telling him that the former senator had not spoken with Beauregard for two days, and he threatened to resume firing. Meanwhile, General Beauregard himself had finally seen <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> and sent {{a second set of}} officers, offering essentially the same terms that Wigfall had presented, so the agreement was reinstated.|$|E
50|$|Ten large {{handkerchiefs}} {{were lost}} by the laundry. ‘The maximum amount allowed for lost or damaged articles is twenty times the charge made for laundering.’ That was 11s 5d. The cost of <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> was £5.Lord Greene MR held the limitation clause did apply, because although negligence was not mentioned, the defendants {{could only have}} been liable for <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> if they had been negligent.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Yellow <b>Handkerchief</b> is a 2008 American {{independent}} drama film. The film is {{a remake}} of the 1977 Japanese classic {{of the same name}} <b>The</b> Yellow <b>Handkerchief</b> (幸福の黄色いハンカチ Shiawase no kiiroi hankachi, lit. <b>The</b> yellow <b>handkerchief</b> of happiness) directed by Yoji Yamada.|$|R

25|$|Desdemona is {{concerned}} {{over the loss}} of <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> but maintains that its loss will not cause Othello to grow angry. Emilia is more cynical, especially after Othello violently asks to see it. Desdemona is confused over her husband's behaviour, which culminates in his striking her in public and calling her a whore.|$|E
25|$|Centaurus {{was renamed}} Portmar, and her port of {{registry}} was changed to New York. In 1934, her Code Letters were changed to KOPZ. On 13 July 1937, while on a voyage from Boston, Massachusetts to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Portmar collided with <b>the</b> <b>Handkerchief</b> Lightvessel in dense fog. Although she was undamaged, the lightvessel was severely damaged.|$|E
25|$|She {{apparently}} {{blew her}} nose into <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> and then threw the piece of cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to {{the shock of the}} court. Ní Mháille informed Elizabeth and her court that, in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was destroyed. Their discussion was carried out in Latin, as Ní Mháille spoke no English and Elizabeth spoke no Irish.|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} of this usually lies {{in the possibility of}} third party rights being acquired in good faith. For example, in Cundy v Lindsay (1878), a fraudster using the name Blenkarn posed as a retailer and induced Lindsay & Co to deliver 250 dozen linen handkerchiefs to him. Blenkarn then sold <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> on to an innocent third party, Cundy, but Lindsay was never paid. Lindsay, claiming ownership of <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs,</b> sued Cundy for their return. If the contract of sale to Blenkarn was held to be voidable for fraud, then Lindsay & Co would only have recourse against the insolvent Blenkarn. However, if (as was held) the contract of sale was void ab initio, then title did not pass from Lindsay to Blenkarn in the first place, and Lindsay could claim back <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> from Cundy as their property. Cundy was left with only a claim against the insolvent Blenkarn.|$|R

25|$|Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (1582–1591) {{may also}} {{have served as a}} minor influence. Of {{specific}} importance is <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> soaked in Rutland's blood which Margaret produces during York's torture in Act 1, Scene 4. This could have been influenced by the recurring image of a bloody handkerchief in the immensely popular Tragedy, insofar as a handkerchief soaked in the blood of his son, Horatio, is carried by the protagonist, Hieronimo, throughout the play.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{the pair}} condemn Croker to jump. When A {{goes to the}} window to inspect Croker, however, he is {{surprised}} by something inexplicable that causes him to remove his handkerchief and bring it timidly to the would-be jumper’s face. Although critics Ackerley and Gontarski assert that A’s discovery is an “enigmatic smile” on Croker’s face, Beckett makes no mention of this in the ending, leaving it open to various interpretations such as Croker may be crying (justifying <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief),</b> smiling, was dead prior to A and B’s arrival or else died during the process.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of China, dances are held for {{young men and women}} to find partners. For example, young women are {{encouraged}} to throw their handkerchiefs to the crowd, and the young man who catches and returns <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> has a chance at romance. In Daguang, in northeast Guizhou Province, young {{men and women of the}} Dong people would make an appointment at a certain place. The young women would arrive early to overhear remarks made about them by the young men. The young men would praise their lovers in front of their fellows, in which finally the listening women would walk out of the thicket. Pairs of lovers would go off to a quiet place to open their hearts to each other.|$|E

50|$|As well {{as various}} menhirs, tumuli and stone {{circles in the}} {{countryside}} around, the village is particularly noted for a holy well, Ffynnon Gybi (English: St Cybi's Well). According to local tradition the girls who wished to know their lover's intentions would spread their pocket-handkerchiefs on {{the water of the}} well, and, if the water pushed <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> to <b>the</b> south they knew that everything was right and that their lovers were honest and honourable in their intentions; but, if the water shifted <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> northwards, they concluded the contrary. A reference to this is made in severe terms by a modern Welsh poet.|$|R

25|$|I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face (February 5, 1967) – Kermit and Yorick from Sam and Friends are {{featured}} in this act. Kermit (dressed as a girl) lip-synchs to Rosemary Clooney's cover version as Yorick eats {{his way out of}} <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> he's under and tries to eat Kermit. This was previously done on The Jack Paar Show and later reprised on this show April 21, 1968, and reprised on August 29, 2011, at the D23 Expo by Leslie Carrara-Rudolph (who was operating a rebuilt version of Kermit's pre-frog form) and Brian Henson (who was operating a rebuilt and redesigned version of Yorick). The act was even done on Stuffed and Unstrung (an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up!). Clooney's cover was used for that event.|$|E
25|$|Another notable false {{lead was}} that of Sidney Sherman, a {{recently}} discharged Marine who had served in World War II. Police had found blonde hairs {{in the back of}} the Degnan apartment building, and nearby was a wire that authorities suspected could have been used as a garrote to strangle Suzanne Degnan. Near that was a handkerchief the police suspected might have been used as a gag to keep Suzanne quiet. On <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> was a laundry mark name: S. Sherman. The police hoped that perhaps the killer had erred in leaving it behind. They searched military records and discovered that a Sidney Sherman lived at the Hyde Park YMCA. The police went to question Sherman but discovered that he had vacated the residence without checking out and quit his job without picking up his last paycheck.|$|E
500|$|Mostly unconcerned about {{appearance}} and manners, biographers suggest {{she focused on}} her studies. A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed {{in a discussion of}} mathematics, [...] "gesticulated wildly" [...] as she ate and [...] "spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed". Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief</b> from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.|$|E
60|$|Then, lo and behold! <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> became tiny tents, {{and as the}} {{travelers}} looked at them the tents grew bigger and bigger until {{in a few minutes}} each one was large enough to contain the entire party.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the ledge}} where {{we stood there}} grew some filbert-bushes; and {{to one of these}} we made fast an end of our rope of <b>handkerchiefs.</b> <b>The</b> other end being tied round Peters' waist, I lowered him down {{over the edge of the}} precipice until <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> were {{stretched}} tight. He now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the soapstone (as far in as eight or ten inches), sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot, or thereabout, so as to allow of his driving, with the butt of a pistol, a tolerably strong peg into the levelled surface. I then drew him up for about four feet, when he made a hole similar to the one below, driving in a peg as before, and having thus a resting-place for both feet and hands. I now unfastened <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> from <b>the</b> bush, throwing him the end, which he tied to the peg in the uppermost hole, letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been that is, to the full extent of <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs.</b> Here he dug another hole, and drove another peg. He then drew himself up, so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut, taking hold with his hands upon the peg in the one above. It was now necessary to untie <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> from <b>the</b> topmost peg, with the view of fastening them to the second; and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart. However, after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot (having to hold on with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with his right), he at length cut the string, leaving six inches of it affixed to the peg. Tying <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs</b> now to <b>the</b> second peg, he descended to a station below the third, taking care not to go too far down. By these means (means which I should never have conceived of myself, and for which we were indebted altogether to Peters' ingenuity and resolution) my companion finally succeeded, with the occasional aid of projections in the cliff, in reaching the bottom without accident.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeal, with Mellish LJ, Brett J and Amphlett JA {{overturned}} the Divisional Court, holding that Lindsay could recover <b>the</b> <b>handkerchiefs,</b> since <b>the</b> mistake about {{the identity of}} the rogue voided the contract from the start. Cundy appealed.|$|R
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} William Whatton replied. He disputed Weatherill's {{claim that the}} only action taken to staunch the blood flow had been <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief,</b> and pointed out that his first action on arrival at Eccles vicarage had been to seal Huskisson's femoral artery. He stated that he had great {{experience}} with similar injuries from his time as an army doctor during the Peninsular War, and that [...] "none of them [...] would have ventured upon an operation where the chances were so decidedly against its success". He {{pointed out that the}} survival rate for amputations among soldiers with similar injuries—considerably healthier than the elderly Huskisson—was no better than 15% when attempted immediately after the injury. Instead, he cited the advice of leading surgeon George James Guthrie that amputation was not generally survivable until the patient's pulse had stabilised and the initial shock settled. Whatton pointed out that Huskisson's pulse did not stabilise and that he was in convulsions for the entire time Whatton attended him.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but {{breathed a sigh of relief}} when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under <b>the</b> <b>handkerchief.</b>|$|E
