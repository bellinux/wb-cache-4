5|$|The player {{may choose}} one of two courses: the Royal Troon Golf Club and the Old Course at St. Andrews. The player's caddie {{provides}} information about <b>the</b> <b>pitfalls</b> and idiosyncrasies of each course. The game simulates the strong wind and weather typical of the courses' real-world counterparts, which lie near the seaside. The player may adjust environmental aspects such as weather, wind speed and the wetness of the soil. During a match, the player uses information on the heads-up display to determine such factors as wind speed and direction, the ball's distance from the flag and the height difference between the ball and the hole.|$|E

25|$|While at the University of Aberdeen, James Keith {{acquired}} {{a taste for}} literature and learning that secured him the esteem of the most distinguished savants of Europe. His experiences in the Jacobite uprisings, and his observations of the contentious competition between and among the clan chieftains, offered him the opportunity early to learn <b>the</b> <b>pitfalls</b> of command, the arts of negotiation, {{and the importance of}} listening and diplomacy. This skill was further sharped during the intrigues of the Russian court, where he served for 17 years.

Henry III fully endorsed Dafydd as Llywelyn's heir, and in 1226 Henry III had successfully petitioned the Papacy to free his sister Joan from any stigma of illegitimacy. In 1229, Dafydd traveled to London to do homage for the lands he would inherit, and Llywelyn arranged for the advantageous marriage between Dafydd and Isabella de Braose, daughter and co-heiress of Llywelyn's powerful ally the Marcher lord William de Breos.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>pitfall</b> traps of protocarnivorous {{plants are}} {{identical}} to those of carnivorous plants in every way except in the plant's mode of digestion. The rigid definition of carnivory in plants requires digestion of prey by enzymes produced by the plant. Given this criterion, many of <b>the</b> <b>pitfall</b> trap plants commonly considered to be carnivorous would instead be classified as protocarnivorous. However, this is highly contentious and generally not reflected in current carnivorous plant phylogenies or literature. [...] Darlingtonia californica and several Heliamphora species do not produce their own enzymes, relying instead on an internal food web {{to break down the}} prey into absorbable nutrients.|$|R

25|$|A {{paper by}} Israeli {{researcher}} Sandrine Boudana {{two years later}} analyzed responses to the Strauss-Kahn perp walk in French and American print media {{within the context of}} the countries' respective cultures. While the predominant theme was French media condemning the practice and American media defending it, commentators on both sides took the occasion to reflect inwardly. Some American writers said the French had a point, and French writers in turn noted the difficulty of enforcing the Guigou law in an era where technology cannot prevent the images it forbids from being viewed in France when published overseas. Others noted that the incident also showed <b>the</b> <b>pitfalls</b> of the French media's practice of not reporting on the private lives of politicians, noting that rape allegations had been raised earlier about Strauss-Kahn on a French talk show with no media followup.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{attention}} and expectations {{were given to}} the title in the months leading to its release, leading Murray and some journalists to recommend caution due to the indie nature and niche appeal of the title, seeking to avoid <b>the</b> <b>pitfalls</b> that had previously occurred at the launch of EA's Spore in 2008. At release, the game received a wide range of mixed reviews, with some praising the technical achievements of the procedurally generated universe, while others considered the gameplay lacklustre and repetitive. No Man's Sky also suffered several technical problems at launch, while lacking several marketed features, including a multiplayer element. Though the game was a top seller in August 2016 in both the United Kingdom and North America, perception of the title fell in the months following release, though it retained a small cult following who eagerly requested continued work on the game from its developers. The promotion and marketing for No Man's Sky became a subject of debate, and the video game industry has used No Man's Sky as an example of missteps to avoid in marketing.|$|E

Results for all tests with the restricted data set were similar to those found for the full data set, and therefore not reported here.|$|R
40|$|Study of {{soil organisms}} {{population}} may not detect differences of organisms number due to <b>the</b> difficulty of <b>pitfall</b> installation methods routinely used.   However,  {{to a better}} practice and determination of population level of soil organisms, it was evaluated an alternative methodology to <b>the</b> <b>pitfall</b> Tretzel (modified). <b>The</b> method is called Provid, for {{the collection of the}} soil organisms, proposed by the authors of this work. The two methods were installed in nine different areas, with three replication for each method. The areas differed in terms of location, soil type and vegetable covering. The appraised parameters were richeness, abundance and Simpson´s index.   As results, it was not found significant statistical differences for the two methods of collection of organism´s edaphios among the nine analyzed areas, for the appraised parameters. Therefore, that the methodology of collection of the soil organisms for the Provid method can be used as  efficient as  <b>the</b> <b>pitfall</b> Tretzel modified method.
