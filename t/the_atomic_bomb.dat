5|$|Joan Elizabeth Curran (26 February 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a Welsh {{scientist}} who played {{important roles in}} the development of radar and <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> during the Second World War. She invented chaff, a radar countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked {{on the development of the}} proximity fuse and the electromagnetic isotope separation process for <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Beginning or the End (1947) is an American {{docudrama}} {{film about}} the development of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> in World War II, directed by Norman Taurog, starring Brian Donlevy and Hume Cronyn, and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film dramatizes the creation of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> in the Manhattan Project and the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E

5|$|The Smyth Report {{was issued}} by the US War Department on 12 August 1945, giving the story of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> and {{including}} the technical details that could now be made public. It made few references to the British contribution to the bomb, and a White Paper, Statements Relating to <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Bomb</b> was hurriedly drafted by Michael Perrin. This account was issued just after Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister, and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years.|$|E
5|$|In total Mount St. Helens {{released}} 24 megatons {{of thermal}} energy, 7 {{of which were}} {{a direct result of}} the blast. This is equivalent to 1,600 times the size of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> dropped on Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|Nixon is {{assigned}} to General Leslie Groves (Brian Donlevy), who is placed {{in charge of the}} project. Groves has to bring together the scientific, industrial and defense communities to build <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb.</b> In 1945, following the death of Roosevelt, the new president, Harry S. Truman (Art Baker), continues to support the atomic project, now moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico. When refined uranium-235 is obtained, the first atomic bomb is built and tested successfully in the New Mexico desert. Facing stiff resistance in the Pacific War, Truman orders the use of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> against Japan in July 1945.|$|E
50|$|While {{the first}} movie focused on the {{immediate}} effect of <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>bombing</b> of Hiroshima, <b>the</b> second film focuses on the long-term problems that faced the survivors, including the devastated economy and infrastructure, food shortages, unemployment, lack of housing, and the lingering effects of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb's</b> radioactive fallout.|$|R

5|$|With Dexter Masters, she co-edited the 1946 New York Times bestseller One World or None: a Report to the Public on the Full Meaning of <b>the</b> <b>Atomic</b> <b>Bomb.</b> The book {{included}} {{essays by}} Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer, and sold over 100,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of the}} B-29s {{were named}} as shown, the only nose art applied to the {{aircraft}} before <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> missions was that of Enola Gay. With the exceptions of Victors 71 and 94, the others were applied some time in August 1945. Luke the Spook was not named until November 1945, {{and it is not}} known if nose art was ever applied to Jabit III.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{extraction}} process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction, was not developed {{in time to}} be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The helium mass spectrometer was also vital in <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|At Potsdam, Truman {{agreed to}} a request from Winston Churchill that Britain be {{represented}} when <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> was dropped. William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. All they could do was send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, when Kwajalein of the Marshall Islands {{was secured}} by the U.S. forces, Sergeant Fernando Bernacett from Puerto Rico {{was among the}} Marines who were sent to guard various {{essential}} military installations. Bernacett, a combat veteran of the Battle of Midway, guarded the airport and POWs, as well as <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> as it was transported to Japan.|$|E
5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} of a powerful new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E

5|$|Foreseeing {{another war}} in Europe, Szilard {{moved to the}} United States in 1938, where he worked with Enrico Fermi and Walter Zinn on means of {{creating}} a nuclear chain reaction. He was present when this was achieved on December 2, 1942. He worked for the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory on aspects of nuclear reactor design. He drafted the Szilard petition advocating a demonstration of <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb,</b> but the Interim Committee chose to use them against cities without warning.|$|E
5|$|He {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} <b>the</b> <b>atomic</b> <b>bomb</b> during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s {{as a member of the}} Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.

Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.|$|E
