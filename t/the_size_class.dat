50|$|The {{animals are}} usually very active but cannot swim purposefully. They {{therefore}} live on solid substrates like plants, stones {{and in the}} case of one subspecies (Chaetogaster limnaei limnaei), on snails or (occasionally) mussels. They feed by sucking in small organisms of adequate size. The composition of the food items differs between species, as the size of the sucked in food components depends on each species’ body size. While the biggest species Ch. diaphanus consumes organisms in <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> of about 0.3-3 mm, which mostly contains zooplankton (rotifers, water fleas etc.), Ch. limnaei e.g. selects organisms in the order of 0.03-0.3 mm, which are mainly algae (diatoms and green algae) or very small zooplankton. In principle, all species are therefore omnivores, the bigger species taking in mainly animal food and the smaller ones rather plant particles. The unselective nature of their feeding is clearly shown by the fact that sand grains and other indigestible particles (e.g. conifer pollen) are always found in their stomachs. These particles are also in the indicated size range.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> {{frequency}} distribution {{of a sample}} of senile plaques (SP) was determined {{in a total of}} 20 brain regions from 5 elderly cases of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine whether a comparison of the {{frequency distribution}}s could be used to determine the chronology of SP development in the AD brain. SP from 10 microns to a maximum diameter of 160 microns were present in the tissue and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> frequency distributions were positively skewed. The frequency distributions varied between brain regions in: (1) <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> containing the mode, (2) the degree of positive skew, and (3) the ratio of large to small SP. In most patients the ratio of large to small SP was higher in the hippocampus or adjacent gyrus compared with temporal, parietal and frontal neocortex. If the diameter of a SP reflects its age in the tissue than the data suggest that SP formed earlier either in the hippocampus or adjacent gyrus compared with the other neocortical tissues. However, this conclusion rests on a number of assumptions including: (1) that SP diameter is directly related to age, (2) that SP development occurs at similar rates in different brain regions and (3) that, once formed, SP are not removed from the tissue by astrocytes...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out from July to December 1992 in the Gulf of Castellammare (N/W Sicily) in order to study the feeding habits of juveniles of the greater {{amberjack}} Seriola dumerili. Stomach content analysis showed three different phases of predation during this period, {{depending on the size}} variation of the specimens. Cluster analysis suggested prey choice differed within three size groups. Class I (individuals up to 80 mm SL) feed mainly on the zooplankton community (Copepoda and Crustacea larvae). Class II (individuals ranging from 80 to 120 mm SL) represent a transition stage in which fish continue to feed on zooplankton, but benthic and nectonic items also become important. Class III (individuals greater than 120 SL mm) feed mainly on nectonic and nectobenthic items. Fish belonging to <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> II showed the highest value of niche breadth.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> of the litter at birth on the variation in birth and weaning weights and on the survival rate of piglets from birth to weaning. For this purpose, records of individual weight at birth and weaning of piglets obtained from a database of 295 Landrace litters born between 2000 and 2010 on a pig farm in the western region of the State of Paraná were used. The litters were classified as small (up to 7 piglets), medium (8 to 13 piglets), and large (> 14 piglets) according to the total number of piglets born. The data were analyzed considering the effects of the year of sow mating and size class of the litter at birth. The correlations between mean weight and variance in litter weight and size were higher for medium and large litters. <b>The</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> of the litter significantly influenced the mean weight of piglets at birth and weaning and the variance in birth weight.

40|$|A {{standard}} method {{for assessing the}} accuracy of fire mapping derived from NOAA-AVHRR imagery was applied to five Landsat scenes sampling different regions across northern Australia. The procedure involved the undertaking of: (1) detailed ground verification exercises (using ground and aerial transects) {{at the time of}} Landsat overpasses; (2) assessment of the accuracy of fire mapping derived from relatively high resolution Landsat imagery, using the ground-truth verification data; and (3) using the Landsat fire mapping as a basis for assessing the accuracy of fire mapping produced from more coarse-resolution NOAA-AVHRR imagery, employing a regression approach. As well, using fire map data interpreted from Landsat imagery (both MSS and TM) and NOAA-AVHRR for two of these scene areas, <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distribution of fires was determined principally to assess the reliability of mapping small fires with NOAA-AVHRR imagery. Accuracy of fire mapping undertaken at the Landsat scale was consistently greater than 80 % (range 84 - 99 %). For assessing the accuracy of fire mapping derived from NOAA-AVHRR, a regression approach was applied using the mapped extent of burning from both Landsat and NOAA-AVHRR in 10 X 10 km 2 grid cells. Results indicated variable, but generally high mapping accuracy, with r ranging from 0. 41 - 0. 81. Assessment of <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distribution of fires indicates that mapping from NOAA-AVHRR imagery a priori misses all fires less than 1 pixel (1 km 2) in size; which constitute by far the great majority of individual fires.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{production}} of airborne dust emission during several industrial processes (i. e. dry stone working actions) was taken into account. In order to find new methods to reduce dust emissions, the proposed approach was the dimensional and morphological dust characteristics according to different working tools and materials. In this perspective, two different methods have been investigated: <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distribution analysis of dust particles based on a laser diffraction system (LD) and the 2 D fractal analysis of airborne dust populations acquired as digital images. The first approach (dust size class distribution through laser based diffraction system) permitted to directly characterise particle dust size class distribution in respect of the ornamental stone processed and the working action applied. The second one (2 D fractal analysis method) allowed the study of dust image structure and texture by evaluating statistical fractal parameters (“fractal dimensions” and their precision), to quantify the efficiency in space or surface covering by dust particles. The 2 D fractal analysis method {{appeared to be an}} interesting approach providing information on particles spatial disposition and on the structure of the disposition itself permitting this way to derive information concerning the overall characteristics of dust particles and, as a consequence, about the behaviour of the working process.

Interesting correlation have been found between fractal parameters and the parameters deriving from <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>class</b> distribution analysis by LD, supporting the validity of the proposed approach.
