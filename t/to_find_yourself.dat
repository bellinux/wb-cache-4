500|$|Fuseli's other Macbeth Woodmason {{painting}} Macbeth and the Armed Head {{depicts a}} later {{scene in which}} Macbeth is shown MacDuff and warned {{to be wary of}} him. Fuseli evidently intended the two paintings to be juxtaposed. He said, [...] "when Macbeth meets with the witches on the heath, it is terrible, because he did not expect the supernatural visitation; but when he goes to the cave to ascertain his fate, it is no longer a subject of terror." [...] Fuseli chose to make MacDuff a near-likeness of Macbeth himself, and considered the painting one of his most poetic in that sense, asking, [...] "'What would be a greater object of terror to you if, some night on going home, you were <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> sitting at your own table [...] [...] [...] would not this make a powerful impression on your mind?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] When you turn your mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests." ...|$|E

After a tour at the , the guests were led into the concert hall for [...] "Diaspora", which is a mixed media production, combining music, video and drama of five Asian artists searching for their identities. The production itself was made by local arts company TheatreWorks, and it costs S$700,000 (US$437,500). The delegates sang praises of the production with one saying the music played by the orchestra is good, one of the stories told about the different cultures, ages and trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself,</b> another said the production was colourful and diverse, with a lot of life in it. At the finale of the event, a ten-minute display of fireworks at the Marina Bay transformed the area into a multi-cultural street with segments of Chinatown and Little India.|$|E
2500|$|In an interview, Horn {{was quoted}} as saying that [...] "the {{entrance}} to all my work... which is extremely important to me" [...] is the ongoing series of books entitled To Place (1990-) concerning Iceland. The books consider identity, site, and nature through photographs of landscapes, ice, rocks, swirling water, and people; most of the images are accompanied by descriptive, classificatory, or literary texts. In describing her attraction to the landscape, Horn states: The drama comes from its youth. The landscape is unique in that the geology is very young. It’s like a labyrinth in the definitive sense. It’s big enough to get lost in, but small enough <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself.</b> There is little erosion and, as a result, unexpected symmetries exist in unexpected places. America has everything Iceland has, but it’s ten thousand, twenty thousand, one hundred thousand years older... Growing up in a very “old” landscape—New York City—its origins are secreted from the present. I mean that the geological aspect of the landscape in New York City can only be experienced theoretically at this point. In Iceland, you understand empirically exactly what this place is: its what and how. That accessibility effects the nature of one’s experience, the experience of the world. Any place you’re going to stand in, in any given moment, is a complement {{to the rest of the}} world, historically and empirically. What you can see in that moment, what you can touch in that moment, is confluent with everything else.|$|E

The highlight of many people's trips is cooking for themselves, and these small steps, along with the larger ones like being in control of a 42 ft yacht, help move the young person forward from the feeling of 'institutionalisation' the hospital can sometimes leave on them, helping to establish the attitude that they can actually achieve a lot, and more importantly achieve it by themselves.|$|R
