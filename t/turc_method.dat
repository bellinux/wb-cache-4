The objectives of this study are: first, to investigate the effect of wind speed on accuracy of Turc method; second, to develop the wind speed adjustment factors for the <b>Turc</b> <b>method.</b> The adjusted <b>Turc</b> <b>method</b> provides the quite good agreement with the evapotranspiration obtained by the FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith method. It gave reliable estimation at all the locations and it has proven to be the most adjustable to the local climatic conditions.

It is concluded that <b>Turc</b> <b>method</b> with original coefficients, 300 and 0. 9, could not be used because of huge discrepancies between the measured and calculated values. Instead, coefficients of 601 and 0. 65, respectively, were used after the correction using long term measured flow rates. Employing the modified <b>Turc</b> <b>method</b> for these research basins, reservoirs volume are reduced by 50. 7 %.

40|$|The <b>Turc</b> <b>Method</b> is used {{widely in}} Turkey to {{determine}} runoff depths therefore, water yield {{from a particular}} watershed and subsequently the reservoir’s volume by Turkish General Directorate of Rural Services {{which is responsible for}} the investments on agricultural and rural infrastructures. However the method over predicts the water yield markedly when compared to the directly measured long-term water yields, which increases the total cost for the instruction of reservoirs and leads to environmental hazards due to disturbing more agricultural areas. In this research, the <b>Turc</b> <b>Method</b> was modifi ed through replacing the new coeffi cients with the original coeffi cients of the 300 and 0. 9 by fi tting the calculated values to the directly measured long-term, a total of 223 years, in 22 sub-basin distributed throughout Turkey. Coeffi cients 566 and 0. 68 were proposed as average values for Turkey in general instead 300 and 0. 9, respectively, though the new coeffi cients for a particular watershed varied widely from 20 to 1135 and from 0. 4 to 1. 32, respectively. The country’s sub-basins divided into three groups in terms of basin characteristics affective on these coeffi cients and new coeffi cients were also suggested for each group. Employing the modifi ed <b>Turc</b> <b>Method</b> with these new coeffi cients for the research sub-basins can reduce the reservoir’s volume by 45 % and this may decrease the total cost of the reservoirs by about 20 - 25 % through reducing occupied surface area, embankment and crest height...|$|E
40|$|Evapotranspiration is an {{important}} component in water-balance and irrigation scheduling models. While the FAO - 56 Penman-Monteith method has become the de facto standard for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET o), it is a complex method requiring several weather parameters. Required weather data are oftentimes unavailable, and alternative methods must be use d. Three alternative ET o methods, the FAO - 56 Reduced Set, Hargreaves, and <b>Turc</b> <b>methods,</b> were evaluated for use in Mississippi, a humid region of the USA, using only measurements of air temperature. The Turc equation, developed for use with measured temperature and solar radiation, was tested with estimated radiation and found to provide better estimates of FAO - 56 ET o than the other methods. Mean bias errors of 0. 75, 0. 28, and - 0. 19 mm, mean absolute errors of 0. 92, 0. 68, and 0. 62 mm, and percent errors of 22. 5 %, 8. 5 %, and - 5. 7 % were found for daily estimates for the FAO - 56 Reduced Set, Hargreaves, and <b>Turc</b> <b>methods,</b> respectively. </p...|$|R
30|$|After {{this study}} focused on {{hydrological}} modeling, we can conclude that the two different annual and monthly timesteps (GR 1 A and GR 2 M) allowed us to evaluate the parameters of Nash and R 2 by using as input precipitation and evapotranspiration (ETP) data calculated by <b>Turc’s</b> <b>method</b> and using the water runoff as output data. This work provides {{an answer to the}} questions posed in the initial sections and validate data whether on an annual or monthly scale in arid zones, which subsequently enabled us to supplement and extend our series of monthly and annual flows of the Wadi Bechar watershed. After an observation of the geographical location of the basin study in areas with arid climate, the rainfall was found to be low, which gives flows heterogeneous in time and space (irregularity). Flooding is rare but aggravating; analysis of the rainfall–runoff relationship shows that the Bechar station poses a slight anomaly for the monthly model GR 2 M due to the concentration time or due to significant infiltration resulting from the geographical formations, which requires a survey and study into the area. It is likely that rising temperatures in arid zones will intensify the hydrological cycle, resulting in greater flows in the downstream of the watershed.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the expected changes in evapotranspiration in climate change scenarios using the Penman Monteith/FAO 56 (PM) standard method and empirical equations for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET 0), specifically for the conditions of Rio Verde, in the state of Goiás, Brazil. Data from the National Institute of Meteorology, and Meteorology and Hydrology System of the State of Goiás were used to estimate the ET 0 by using the following methods: Modified Penman, Radiation, Blaney-Criddle, Hargreaves-Samani, and Priestley-Taylor and Turc, which were compared with the PM method on the daily scale. From the ET 0 obtained in each of these methods, their performance was evaluated through statistical indices in four future climate scenarios. The projections originated from two emission scenarios based on the HadGEM 2 -ES global climate model with medium (2040 - 2069) and long (2070 - 2099) term scenarios. The results presented that the Radiation and <b>Turc</b> <b>methods</b> are currently—and can be under the predicted conditions of future climate scenarios—the best options for estimation of ET 0 in Rio Verde, when meteorological data are not available to implement the PM method.

40|$|Evapotranspiration (ET) is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the sum of evaporation and transpiration form land surface to atmosphere. Considering the importance of ET, two methods was developed to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET). The two ET groups there are temperature-based method and radiation-based method. About two types of PET methods were selected for each groups there are Priestly-Taylor Method and <b>Turc</b> <b>Method</b> to represent radiation-based method, meanwhile Hargreaves-Samani Method and Blaney-Criddle Method represented temperature-based method. The A 2 scenario is used to represent the level of state development due to the climate projection results. The daily temperature data was provided by MMD under Ministry Science. The data provided was used in the method to estimate the future trend of PET in long term. Downscaling is a technique that have been used to predict the local meteorological condition. The SDSM is a tool that used to produce high resolution climate change scenario. The objective {{of the study was to}} quantify the performance between radiation-based method and temperature-based method and to analyse the future trend of ET at Kuantan, Pahang state. In this study, it was found that the radiation-based method gave better performance compared to temperature-based method in quantifying in calculating ET. In radiation-based method, Priestly-Taylor Methods is the most suitable method to use to find ET based on the lowest value of absolute error and higher Pearson error.

40|$|In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), {{the number}} of weather {{stations}} (WS) that are monitoring all climatic parameters required for FAO- 56 Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) equation is limited. In fact, it is of great need and importance to achieve the possibility of calculating reference evapotranspiration (ET 0) for every WS in BiH (around 150), regardless of {{the number of}} climate parameters which they collect. Solving this problem is possible by using alternative equations that require less climatological data for reliable estimation of daily and monthly ET 0. The main objective {{of this study was to}} validate and determine, compared to the FAO-PM method, a suitable and reliable alternative ET 0 equations that are requiring less input data and have a simple calculation procedure, with a special focus on Thornthwaite and <b>Turc</b> as <b>methods</b> previously often used in BiH. To fulfill this objective, 12 alternative ET 0 calculation methods and 21 locally adjusted versions of same equations were validated against FAO-PM ET 0 method. Daily climatic data, recorded at sixteen WS, including mean maximum and minimum air temperature (Â°C), precipitation (mm), minimum and maximum relative humidity (%), wind speed (mÂ sâ 1) and sunshine hours (h) for the period 1961 â 2015 (55 years) were collected and averaged over each month. Several types of statistical indicators: the determination coefficient (R 2), mean bias error (MBE), the variance of the distribution of differences (sd 2), the root mean square difference (RMSD) and the mean absolute error (MAE) were used to assess alternative ET 0 equation performance. The results, confirmed by various statistical indicators, shows that the most suitable and reliable alternative equation for monthly ET 0 calculation in BiH is the locally adjusted Trajkovic method. Adjusted Hargreaves-Samani method was the second best performing method. The two most frequently used ET 0 calculation methods in BiH until now, Thornthwaite and Turc, were ranked low.

40|$|The {{evapotranspiration}} is {{an important}} component of the Amazon hydrological balance, which is of critical importance to the global water balance. The spatial variability of the amazon evapotranspiration is essential for the knowledge of climate in the regional and global scale. Several methods have been tested to estimate the long-term evapotranspiration in the Amazon basin. Analyses include estimation of the actual and potential evapotranspiration using diverse methods, such as those by Morton, Penman (Priestley and Taylor), Thornthwaite and Turc, for potential evapotranspiration, and those by Coutagne, Choudhury, Morton, Budyko, Zhang and Turc, for actual evapotranspiration. These actual evapotranspiration methods were validated using the long-term water balance equation with river discharge data from 76 sub-basin within the Amazon Basin. The method introduced by Choudhury, with alpha parameter equal a 2. 1, exhibited the smallest estimation errors (18. 7 %) for actual evapotranspiration in the Amazon.

40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of potential evapotranspiration is necessary step in water resources management. Recently, the FAO- 56 version of Penman-Monteith equation {{has been established}} as a standard for calculating reference evapotranspiration (ET 0). Still there are different approaches (requiring less data) which estimate ET 0 closely to Penman-Monteith method for different climatological conditions. Performance Evaluation of all the approaches on the same basis is prerequisite for selecting an alternative approach in accordance with available data. Therefore, two most popular temperature-based approaches (Hargreaves and Thornthwaite) and two radiation based approaches (Priestley-Taylor and Turc) were used to estimate monthly potential evapotranspiration (ET 0) at Pantnagar (Uttarakhand), India.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Estimated daily {{reference}} crop evapotranspiration (ETo) {{is normally}} {{used to determine}} the water requirement of crops using the crop factor method. Many ETo estimation methods have been developed for different types of climatic data, and the accuracy of these methods varies with climatic conditions. In this study, pair−wise comparisons were made between daily ETo estimated from eight different ETo equations and ETo measured by lysimeter to provide information helpful in selecting an appropriate ETo equation for the Cumberland Plateau located in the humid Southeast United States. Based on the standard error of the estimate (Syx), the relationship between the estimated and measured ETo was the best using the FAO− 56 Penman−Monteith equation (coefficient of determination (r 2) = 0. 91, Syx = 0. 31 mm d− 1, and a coefficient of efficiency (E) = 0. 87), followed by the Penman (1948) equation (r 2 = 0. 91, Syx = 0. 34 mm d− 1, and E = 0. 88), and Turc’s equation (r 2 = 0. 90, Syx = 0. 36 mm d− 1, and E = 0. 88). The FAO− 24 Penman and Priestly−Taylor methods overestimated ETo, while the Makkink equation underestimated ETo. The results for the Hargreaves−Samani equation showed low correlation with lysimeter ETo data (r 2 = 0. 51, Syx = 0. 68 mm d− 1, and E = 0. 20), while those for the Kimberly Penman were reasonable (r 2 = 0. 87, Syx = 0. 40 mm d− 1, and E = 0. 87). These results support the adoption of the FAO− 56 Penman−Monteith equation for the climatological conditions occurring in the humid Southeast. However, Turc’s equation may be an attractive alternative to the more complex Penman−Monteith method.

40|$|International audienceSolar {{radiation}} {{is an important}} climatic variable for assessing reference evapotranspiration (E 0), but it is seldom available in weather station records. Meteosat satellite images processed with the Heliosat- 2 method provide the HelioClim- 1 database, which displays spatialized solar radiation data at a daily time step for Europe and Africa. The aim of the present work {{was to investigate the}} interest of satellite-sensed solar radiation for E 0 calculation, where air temperature is the sole local weather data available. There were two study areas in Southern France. One (Southwest, SW) is characterized by Oceanic climate and the other (Southeast, SE) by Mediterranean climate. A data set of daily values for 19 weather stations spanning five years (2000 – 2004) was used. First, a sensitivity analysis of the Penman–Monteith formula to climate input variables was performed, using the Sobol' method. It shows that E 0 is mainly governed by solar radiation during summer, and by wind speed during winter. Uncertainties of HelioClim- 1 solar radiation data and their repercussions on E 0 formulae were evaluated, using the FAO- 56 Penman–Monteith formulae (PM) and radiation-based <b>methods</b> (<b>Turc,</b> TU; Priestley–Taylor, PT and Hargreaves-Radiation, HR). It was shown that HelioClim- 1 data slightly underestimate solar radiation and provide relative RMSE (root mean square error) of 20 % of the mean annual value for SW and 14 % for SE. The propagation of HelioClim- 1 data uncertainties is small in PM but considerable in radiation methods. Four estimation methods were then compared to PM data: the 1985 Hargreaves formula (HT) based on air temperature only; TU, PT and HR, based on air temperature and satellite-sensed solar radiation. Radiation methods were more precise and more accurate than HT, with RMSE ranging from 0. 52 mm to 0. 86 mm against 0. 67 – 0. 96 mm. These results suggest that using satellite-sensed solar radiation may improve E 0 estimates for areas where air temperature is the only available record at ground level...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in an ungauged {{catchment}} of the lower Congo River basin, with the overall objective of deriving useful data in support of water resources management practices. Specifically, the study aims to generate and validate remotely sensed water resources data at the catchment level; use this data and assess spatial and temporal changes in water resources and land use at the catchment level; and assess the relationship between the catchment evapotranspiration and varying types of land use. The methodology used in this study consisted of delineation of the catchment, extraction of water resources data from remote sensing products such GLDAS, CHIRPS, for rainfall and GLDAS, MOD 16, and FEWS NET for evapotranspiration. The study used empirical approaches such as the <b>Turc</b> <b>method</b> to validate remote sensing evapotranspiration products and Soil Conservation Service Curve Number method to compute runoff of the catchment. Rainfall from the ground were used to validate remote sensing rainfall products. The supervised classification method and Maximum Likelihood Algorithm were used for the classification of land use land cover. The supervised classification was validated using the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient equations. It was observed that the remote sensing rainfall products were strongly correlated to ground measurement at the catchment level (r= 0. 870) with p-value 0. 05. In general, there was an increase in areas covered by cultivation p-value< 0. 05 and settlement and bare land but statistically insignificant for p-value< 0. 05. The decrease in the area covered by savanna p-value< 0. 05, forest p-value< 0. 05, and water and marshy p-value< 0. 05. The overall accuracy of classification was found to be 73 % and Kappa coefficient 68 %. The study shows that the increase in cultivated areas led to increases of actual evapotranspiration. The reduction of forest and savanna areas contribute to the reduction of actual evapotranspiration in those areas. This led to the reduction of moisture supply into the atmosphere and reduce local rainfall at the catchment level. It was seen that settlement and bare land areas increased, but the actual evapotranspiration was still increased as well, this can be put on the back of increased evaporation from the soil. It can be realised that land use practices have limited impact on actual evapotranspiration. This study reveals that the change in actual evapotranspiration for the Lufumi catchment is more related to hydro-meteorological parameters than observed rates of changes in land use and land cover.,WaterNe...|$|E
