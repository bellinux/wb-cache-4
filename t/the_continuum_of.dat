5|$|Historically, {{there has}} been {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B.phalloides. The taxon has been described as both a variety (as B.phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916) and as a form (as B.phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004). In 1995, mycologist Roy Watling opined that B.stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange-tawny, slightly larger (5–6.5 by 5.75–7µm, as opposed to 4.5–5.25 by 4.5–5.75µm), and less ornamented. Further, B.stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size, a more coarsely scaly stipe, and lack of mucilage in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem. The presence or absence of mucilage has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species. In 1904, Lászlo Hollós proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species; in 1942, Paul Marshall Rea, after studying 25 specimens from southern California, concluded that B.stevenii was conspecific with B.phalloides and represented a single species. An analysis of a number of European specimens—using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA—also suggested both to be conspecific. The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species; they did, however, note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion. The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field-collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world. They found that material labeled B.stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes, while that labeled B.phalloides was generally more consistent, and smaller. However, the B.phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK, while the B.stevenii material originated {{from a wide variety of}} locales and habitats, suggesting that environmental factors influence fruit body morphology. Evidence pointing to conspecificity included <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> spore sizes between the two, and the lack of any significant differences between their DNA. In 2006, however, based on a study of specimens collected in China, other scientists considered them to be independent species.|$|E

40|$|The {{fields of}} intercultural {{communications}} and relations, {{decision making and}} consumer behavior have addressed {{issues related to the}} process of decision making in an intercultural context. Though contributing many conceptual constructs, these fields have not focused on constructing an intercultural decision making model that is applicable for intercultural research. This article focuses on constructing a culture-general intercultural decision making model (ICDM model). This process model focuses on three intersecting three-dimensional axes: logic of intellect, logic of emotions, and imagined outcomes. Each of these axes systems suggests three interactive continua that function as a process for making decisions. The logic <b>of</b> intellect has <b>the</b> <b>continua</b> <b>of</b> powerful-powerless, good-evil, and accuracy-intuition.

25|$|The {{vertices}} of the polytope {{are also}} called basic feasible solutions. The {{reason for this}} choice of name is as follows. Let d denote the number of variables. Then the fundamental theorem of linear inequalities implies (for feasible problems) that for every vertex x* of the LP feasible region, there exists a set of d (or fewer) inequality constraints from the LP such that, when we treat those d constraints as equalities, the unique solution is x*. Thereby we can study these vertices by means of looking at certain subsets of the set of all constraints (a discrete set), rather than <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> LP solutions. This principle underlies the simplex algorithm for solving linear programs.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, the {{zoologist}} Alfred Kinsey {{created a}} scale to measure <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> sexual orientation from heterosexuality to homosexuality. Kinsey studied human sexuality {{and argued that}} people have the capability of being hetero- or homosexual even if this trait does not present itself in the current circumstances. The Kinsey scale is used to describe a person's sexual experience or response at a given time. It ranges from 0, meaning exclusively heterosexual, to 6, meaning exclusively homosexual. People who rank anywhere from 2 to 4 are often considered bisexual; they are often not fully one extreme or the other. The sociologists Martin S. Weinberg and Colin J. Williams write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered bisexual.|$|E

2500|$|This {{interdependence}} {{is based}} on two principles. [...] First, trans-species psychology's recognition of substantial vertebrate commonalities, [...] "re-embeds" [...] humans back into <b>the</b> <b>continuum</b> <b>of</b> nature – cross-species relationships are [...] "horizontal", based in parity, not structured along a vertical gradient of inequality. [...] As the field of ecopsychology emphasizes, humans {{are a part of}} the natural world, and disconnection with it creates a disconnect with one's self and one's culture. [...] Second, studies of previous human-human domination and violence (e.g. European holocaust, genocides, slavery) highlight that being either the oppressed or the oppressor creates a pathogenic psychological state. Continued domination and traumatic injury of non-human animals with minds similar to humans and capacities similar to humans, causes suffering for both the human and non-human animal.|$|E
