5|$|Indefatigable was {{assigned}} to the BPF in November and she arrived in Colombo, Ceylon on 10 December where she joined the 1st ACS. Together with the other carriers of the BPF, she attacked oil refineries in Sumatra in January 1945 (Operation Lentil and Operation Meridian) before sailing to Sydney to prepare for operations in the Pacific. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet at Ulithi on 20 March and attacked airfields on the Sakishima Islands, south of Okinawa, beginning on 26 March, as part of the preparations for Operation Iceberg. During these operations, Indefatigable became the first British carrier to be hit by a kamikaze when one penetrated the combat air patrol (CAP) and struck <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> island on 1 April. The bomb carried by the kamikaze did not detonate and this limited casualties to 21 men killed and 27 wounded. Damage to the ship was minimal and the flight deck was back in operation thirty minutes later. After Okinawa had been secured, the BPF arrived back at Sydney on 7 June and Indefatigable was delayed rejoining operations as she required repairs to her machinery. She departed Manus on 12 July and reached the coast of Japan eight days later. Her aircraft began attacking targets in the Inland Sea on 24 July. Most of the BPF withdrew as planned on 10 August to prepare for Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu scheduled for November, but Indefatigable and several other ships remained to represent Britain at the end of operations. The ship's aircraft flew missions on 13 and 15 August; during the last of these missions, her Seafires shot down eight of twelve Mitsubishi A6M Zeros while losing one of their own and an Avenger gunner shot down another Japanese aircraft. After the ceasefire, her aircraft continued to fly CAP and flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war.|$|E

Cindy starts to ask Jack questions, saying they are here to [...] "watch", but he angrily sends her away. Alex visits Jack later and tells him that the Others are planning to execute Juliet. Alex helps him escape from his cage, and they go to Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), who writes a note, sparing Juliet, in return for Jack's continuing to be Ben's doctor. The two then go to a trial the Others are holding for Juliet, and Alex gives Isabel Ben's note, which says Juliet is not to be executed, but is to be marked instead (with a branded symbol at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> spine). When Juliet later asks Jack why he helped her, he replies that it is because Ben said he would let both of them off the island and he wants to make that happen by working together.

40|$|A hybrid pair of bluebirds {{is raising}} young in Dawes County, Nebraska, {{in the yard}} of Jim and Hope Minyard, {{approximately}} 8 miles south of Crawford. The female of the pair is a Mountain Bluebird (Sialia currucoides). She is basically a dull gray bluebird, with little contrast between upperparts and underparts. There is no rusty or tan on her breast, and no sharp demarcation between the gray breast and the lighter belly. <b>Her</b> rump and <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> outer tail feathers are a light, bright blue, while the other tail feathers and the primaries are blackish. When the wing is folded, her longest wing feathers approach, but do not reach, the tip <b>of</b> <b>her</b> tail. The male presents a more complicated picture. Superficially he resembles an Eastern Bluebird (Sialia sialis) because the upper parts are uniformly bright blue, the breast and throat are rusty, and the belly is white. The blue of his upperparts appears a lighter, more cerulean blue than is typical of Eastern Bluebirds, though {{it is difficult to}} judge without direct breast comparison. The rusty breast is paler and duller than usual for male Easterns as well. Most peculiarly, there is a small, bright blue bib or necklace on the upper breast, similar in color to the back. When folded, the male’s wing tips reach a little over half way down the tail. In other words, his wings are relatively shorter than those of the female. We believe that the male is a Mountain x Eastern Bluebird hybrid...|$|R
2500|$|Mating occurs {{around the}} months of March and April in the {{northern}} hemisphere and during August–October in the southern hemisphere. The courtship and mating of sand tigers has been best documented from observations in large aquaria. In Oceanworld, Sydney, the females tended to hover just above the sandy bottom ("shielding") when they were receptive. This prevented males from approaching from underneath towards their cloaca. Often {{there is more than}} one male close by with the dominant one remaining close to the female, intimidating others with an aggressive display in which the dominant shark closely follows the tail of the subordinate, forcing the subordinate to accelerate and swim away. The dominant male snaps at smaller fish of other species. The male approaches the female and the two sharks protect the sandy bottom over which they interact. Strong interest of the male is indicated by superficial bites in the anal and pectoral fin areas of the female. The female responds with superficial biting of the male. This behaviour continues for several days during which the male patrols the area around the female. The male regularly approaches the female in [...] "nosing" [...] behaviour to [...] "smell" [...] the cloaca of the female. If she is ready, she swims off with the male, while both partners contort their bodies so that the right clasper of the male enters the cloaca of the female. The male bites <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> right pectoral fin, leaving scars that are easily visible afterwards. After one or two minutes, mating is complete and the two separate. Females often mate with more than one male. Females mate only every second or third year. After mating, the females remain behind, while the males move off to seek other areas to feed, resulting in many observations of sand tiger populations comprising almost exclusively females.|$|E
