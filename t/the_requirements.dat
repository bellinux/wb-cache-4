Originally the {{municipalities}} of Asker and Bærum had demanded that residents be subject to a maximum of 27 decibel A-weighting (dBA), but the National Rail Administration appealed <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> and was permitted to allow up to 32 dBA. In March 2004, a test was done in the tunnel to insure that <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> would be met, as low-frequency sound is difficult to predict. Measurements after the opening of the tunnel showed background noise of 30 dBA, that no-one was subject to 32 dBA or higher, and that it was nearly impossible to measure the passing of trains.|$|E
