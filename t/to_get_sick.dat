"Although it is {{easy for}} some <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> of the {{repetitive}} lovesick theme B seems to gravitate towards, the music in this song nothing short of epic, as is Beyonce's vocal performance.

500|$|... "My Happiness" [...] {{peaked at}} number 23 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, {{making it the}} first Powderfinger song to appear on a Billboard chart. According to Susan Groves of WHRL, part of the song's success came about because very few people knew of Powderfinger, but were drawn towards [...] "My Happiness" [...] because it was [...] "melodic, [...] pretty"—a change from what she {{described}} as [...] "middle of the road rock" [...] popular in the United States. Meanwhile, Australians were [...] "starting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> of My Happiness"—Cameron Adams argued in The Hobart Mercury that {{this was one of}} the reasons Powderfinger decided to focus on the offshore market.|$|E
500|$|Because both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson {{were busy}} adding the {{finishing}} touches to their own episodes—"Hollywood A.D."

The two eventually decided that causing Mulder <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> in acts three and four would free up Duchovny for his episode. Walker noted, [...] "Mulder getting sick in Act Two and being in a hospital bed for Acts Three and Four was the direct result of his limited amount of time.

500|$|With Internationalist, Powderfinger {{first set}} their sights overseas, {{appearing}} at numerous music festivals in the U.S., including South by Southwest in Texas. While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in Los Angeles and New York City. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult {{due to the}} lack of any homegrown fan support. [...] He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped. Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in Austin, as [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "fun". After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as [...] "people [...] are going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> of you pretty quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially." ...|$|E

60|$|Now, {{it is to}} be {{confessed that}} this Mr. H., whom we have {{introduced}} to our reader, was, in his way, quite an oddity.

He always had in his pocket book a note of some dozen poor widows who wanted tea, sugar, candles, or other things such as poor widows always will be wanting. And then he had a most extraordinary talent for finding out all the sick strangers that lay in out-of-the-way upper rooms in hotels, who, every body knows, have no business <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>sick</b> in such places, unless they have money enough to pay their expenses, which they never do.|$|E

50|$|Another {{criticism}} {{is that it}} is possible that in many cases animals are simply exhibiting Garcia-type learning which involves conditioned taste aversion. This type of behavioural response occurs when a subject associates the taste of a food with negative symptoms caused by that food so that they will avoid consuming a possibly toxic substance in the future.
