5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} <b>this</b> <b>disaster,</b> sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four guns from the battery.|$|E
5|$|The 1687 {{earthquake}} {{marked a}} turning point in the history of Lima as it coincided with a recession in trade, a reduction of silver production and economic competition by other cities such as Buenos Aires. To add to these problems, on October 28, 1746, a powerful earthquake severely damaged the city and destroyed Callao, forcing a massive rebuilding effort under Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velasco. <b>This</b> <b>disaster</b> led to an intense devotion for an image of Christ called The Lord of the Miracles, which has been taken out in procession every October since 1746.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{states that}} the commune of Florence spent more than 60,000 gold florins to {{mitigate}} this effects of <b>this</b> <b>disaster.</b> In order to save their own funds and calm the rage of the riotous poor, all the baker's ovens in the city were requisitioned by the commune and {{a loaf of bread}} weighing 170 g (6oz) was then sold at a meager four pennies. This price was fixed in consideration that poor workers who made only eight to twelve pennies a day could now buy enough bread to survive.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>this</b> <b>disaster</b> King Rama I {{predicted}} that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation. This prophecy was recorded in a diary of a princess of the first reign, after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years was too short and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a nought. This prophecy was again present {{in the minds of}} many people, when only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the Siamese revolution of 1932 was carried out. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri monarchs with a constitutional monarchy with Siam's first constitution.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Trigger is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} which {{was released on}} the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 11, 1995 in Japan and on August 22, 1995 in North America.

Vowing to prevent <b>this</b> <b>disaster,</b> they travel throughout history to discover the means to save the planet. Chrono Trigger was ported to the PlayStation in 1999 as a standalone title in Japan and in 2001 as part of the Final Fantasy Chronicles compilation in North America. A third version was released for the Nintendo DS handheld platform on November 20, 2008. It is regarded today {{as one of the greatest}} games ever made.|$|E
5|$|In late 842 or 843, with Neapolitan support, the Muslims conquered Messina. In 845, the {{fortress}} of Modica also fell, while the Byzantines, now {{at peace with}} the Abbasid Caliphate, received reinforcements from the eastern theme of Charsianon. The two armies met near Butera, where the Byzantines suffered a crushing defeat, losing about 10,000 men. In the wake of <b>this</b> <b>disaster,</b> the Byzantine position deteriorated rapidly: al-Fadl ibn Ja'far took Leontini by a ruse in 846, and {{the fortress}} of Ragusa followed in 848, when its garrison was forced by severe famine to surrender it to the Muslims, who razed it to the ground. At {{about the same time}} (late 847 or 848), an attempt by the Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo failed, and subsequently the Byzantines lost seven out of their ten ships in a storm.|$|E

The assailants (M-19 a Marxist, Terrorist Insurgency group) planned to hold a trial {{involving}} Colombian President Belisario Betancur. He refused to participate and sent the national army into the building. The attackers were holding several hundred hostages, including the 24 Supreme Court justices and 20 other judges. In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges). <b>This</b> <b>disaster,</b> coupled with the Armero tragedy, spurred the Colombian government to predict and prepare for {{a broad range of}} threats.|$|E
5|$|The lavishness of the {{architecture}} that was to arise from <b>this</b> <b>disaster</b> is connected with the politics of Sicily at the time; Sicily was still officially under Spanish rule, but rule was effectively delegated to the native aristocracy. This was led by the Duke of Camastra, whom the Spanish had appointed viceroy to appease the aristocracy, who were numerous. The aristocracy was relatively concentrated compared to most of Europe, and a gentry class was missing. In the 18th century, one estimate held that there were 228 noble families, who provided Sicily with a ruling class consisting of 58 princes, 27 dukes, 37 marquesses, 26 Counts, one viscount and 79 barons; the Golden Book of the Sicilian nobility (last published in 1926) lists even more. In addition to these were the younger scions of the families, with their courtesy titles of nobile or baron.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 460s BC, the Athenians {{took the}} ambitious {{decision}} to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. Although the Greek task force achieved initial successes, they were unable to capture the Persian garrison in Memphis, despite a 3-year long siege. The Persians then counterattacked, and the Athenian force was itself besieged for 18 months, before being wiped out. <b>This</b> <b>disaster,</b> coupled with ongoing warfare in Greece, dissuaded the Athenians from resuming conflict with Persia. In 451 BC however, a truce was agreed in Greece, and Cimon was then able to lead an expedition to Cyprus. However, while besieging Kition, Cimon died, and the Athenian force decided to withdraw, winning another double victory at the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus in order to extricate themselves. This campaign marked the end of hostilities between the Delian League and Persia, and therefore {{the end of the}} Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E

5|$|Ezra Meeker's farm at Swamp Place was not {{a success}} as the land was too poor to grow crops. The family {{continued}} to run the store in Steilacoom. On January 5, 1861, Oliver Meeker drowned while returning from a buying trip to San Francisco, when his ship, the Northerner, sank off the California coast. The Meekers had borrowed to finance the trip, and the losses from <b>this</b> <b>disaster</b> reduced Ezra Meeker to near penury. He secured the squatter's claim of Jerry Stilly on land in the Puyallup Valley, and moved {{his wife and children}} there in 1862. While clearing his own holdings, he earned money by helping to clear the land of others. His father and surviving brother, John Meeker, also had claims in the valley. John Meeker had come to Washington Territory by ship in 1859 and had settled in the Puyallup Valley. Ezra Meeker ran for the Washington Territorial Legislature in 1861, but was defeated. In 1869, Meeker ran for Pierce County Surveyor; he was defeated by James Gallagher, 138 votes to 116.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>this</b> <b>disaster,</b> Sayf al-Dawla {{needed time}} to recover his strength, {{but as soon as}} Nikephoros Phokas {{returned}} victorious from Crete in summer 961, he resumed the offensive in the east. The Byzantines captured Anazarbus in Cilicia, and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. Sayf al-Dawla's attempts to halt the Byzantine advance in Cilicia failed, and Nikephoros Phokas, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, took Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros ignored them. Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December, they suddenly appeared before Aleppo. There they defeated an improvised army before the city walls. The Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. The Byzantines departed in early 963, taking much of the populace with them as captives.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their military tasks, the C-17s have formed part of the Australian Government's response to natural disasters.

At {{the conclusion of the}} ADF response to <b>this</b> <b>disaster,</b> another C-17 mission was conducted to return Army Sikorsky S-70A-9 Black Hawks to their base at Townsville. During May 2008 a C-17 flew 31 tonnes of emergency equipment from Australia to Yangon in Burma following Cyclone Nargis. Later in the month a RAAF Globemaster transported two Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopters from South Africa to Thailand, from where the helicopters flew into Burma. On 1 October 2009, C-17s transported supplies and ADF evacuation teams from RAAF Base Richmond to Samoa following the earthquake there. Two days later another C-17 sortie delivered medical personnel and other specialists to Padang in Indonesia after the Sumatra earthquakes. In August 2010, two C-17s were dispatched to deliver emergency supplies to Pakistan following widespread flooding there.|$|E

5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of <b>this</b> <b>disaster</b> was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities {{did their best to}} respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations paused. In the short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices {{for the remainder of the}} medieval period.|$|E
5|$|To the north, the Bulgar {{frontier}} remained quiet, {{except for}} a Bulgar raid that was defeated, leading to the renewal of the 30-year peace treaty of 815, which was later reconfirmed by the new Bulgar khan Boris (r. 852–889). Byzantium thus enjoyed a period of peace except in the West, where the Byzantine government proved unable to halt the ongoing Muslim conquest of Sicily. Modica fell in 845, but although Constantinople used the relative quiet in the East to send reinforcements to the island, these were heavily defeated at Butera, where the Byzantines lost about 10,000 men. In the wake of <b>this</b> <b>disaster,</b> Leontini in 846 and then Ragusa in 848 fell to the Muslims, while {{an attempt by the}} Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo in winter 847/848 failed. Over the next few years, the Muslims raided the Byzantine territories on the eastern half of the island unopposed, capturing several minor fortresses and securing ransom and prisoners from others.|$|E
