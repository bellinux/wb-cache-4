Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|The view of Jinnah in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>has</b> {{been shaped}} {{to some extent}} by his {{portrayal}} in Sir Richard Attenborough's 1982 film, Gandhi. The film was dedicated to Nehru and Mountbatten and was given considerable support by Nehru's daughter, the Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi. It portrays Jinnah (played by Alyque Padamsee) in an unflattering light, who seems to act out of jealousy of Gandhi. Padamsee later stated that his portrayal was not historically accurate.|$|E

5|$|Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, {{northern}} {{parts of}} the country are characterized by hot, humid, rainy summers and mild winters with periodic droughts. Mesopotamia, in the northeast is characterized by high temperatures and abundant precipitation throughout the year with droughts being uncommon. West of this lies the Chaco region, which is the warmest region in Argentina. Precipitation in the Chaco region decreases westwards, resulting in the vegetation changing from forests in the east to shrubs in the west. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry and hot although the rugged topography makes it climatically diverse, ranging from the cold, dry Puna to thick jungles. The center of the country, which includes the Pampas to the east and the drier Cuyo region to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>has</b> hot summers with occasional tornadoes and thunderstorms, and cool, dry winters. Patagonia, in the southern {{parts of the}} country has a dry climate with warm summers and cold winters characterized by strong winds throughout the year and one of the strongest precipitation gradients in the world. High elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions, and the mountainous zones can see heavy snowfall.|$|E
5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>has</b> a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. Nitric acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of nitric and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the popular}} {{historical}} criticisms of Muhammad in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>has</b> been his polygynous marriages.

25|$|The Western United States, {{commonly}} referred to as the American West, the Far West, or simply the West, traditionally refers to the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States.

Prior to about 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier.|$|E
