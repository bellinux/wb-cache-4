5|$|After {{intersecting}} with NY289, NY178 progresses northeastward, {{intersecting with}} the western terminus of CR84 {{in the community of}} Thomas Settlement. After leaving Thomas Settlement, NY178 intersects with CR77 and turning to the southeast through a rural region before entering the village of Adams at an intersection with Cobbville Road. There, the surroundings become further residential, before the highway connects to I-81 at exit41. After the interchange, NY178 becomes known as Church Street West, crosses over a railroad line and enters the downtown portion of Adams. After the intersection with Clay Street, NY178 intersects with US11 (Main Street), where the NY178 designation ends. The right-of-way continues eastward as Church Street East, which becomes CR69 at <b>the</b> <b>east</b> <b>village</b> line.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of {{the film}} began in New York City on July 2, 2012, and lasted for 23 days. Carney chose to film in Manhattan's lesser known neighborhoods {{that would be more}} recognizable to locals than tourists. Specific locations included Greenwich Village, <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Village,</b> Times Square, and Washington Square Park. Rather than performing live during filming, the actors sang to pre-recorded tracks. In order to save money on hiring a full crew and extras, some scenes—including one in Times Square—were shot late at night with a handheld camera. The rooftop location near the Empire State Building is located at 28 W 36th St.|$|E

5|$|The Second Avenue Subway was {{supposed}} to be the flagship project of the Program for Action. In a 1964 report, it was given top priority on a list of projects to be completed. Prior attempts to build the line had failed, and the city wished to have a Second Avenue subway line to alleviate overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Twenty-two blocks of tunnel were ultimately constructed, excluding seven blocks in <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Village</b> that were prepared for tunneling operations, but never excavated.|$|E
5|$|Some neighborhoods, such as SoHo, {{which is}} mixed use, {{are known for}} upscale {{shopping}} as well as residential use. Others, such as Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, Alphabet City and <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Village,</b> have long {{been associated with the}} Bohemian subculture. Chelsea is one of several Manhattan neighborhoods with large gay populations and has become a center of both the international art industry and New York's nightlife. Washington Heights is a primary destination for immigrants from the Dominican Republic. Chinatown has the highest concentration of people of Chinese descent outside of Asia. Koreatown is roughly bounded by 6th and Madison Avenues, between 31st and 33rd Streets, where Hangul (한글) signage is ubiquitous. Rose Hill features a growing number of Indian restaurants and spice shops along a stretch of Lexington Avenue between 25th and 30th Streets which has become known as Curry Hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by contemporary critics, who noted {{the success of}} the Dragonette-production, in addition to reviewers who called it a good follow-up single to her debut due to the successful pop themes and potential of the track. Commercially the track debuted at number 40 in both the UK Singles Chart and the Scottish Singles Chart. A music video directed by Stephen Agnes was released; the video was filmed in <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Village</b> of New York City and presented Roberts walking down various streets in the city with special effects added to her movements. During the shoot, weather conditions made it uncomfortable for filming, although this was not reflected in critical opinion. The video's simplicity, as well as the dress she wore in the video, gained mixed responses from critics.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>Village</b> {{was once}} {{considered}} the Lower East Side's northwest corner. However, in the 1960s, {{the demographics of}} the area above Houston Street began to change, as hipsters, musicians, and artists moved in. Newcomers and real estate brokers popularized <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Village</b> name, and the term was adopted by the popular media by the mid-1960s. As <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Village</b> developed a culture separate {{from the rest of the}} Lower East Side, the two areas came to be seen as two separate neighborhoods rather than the former being part of the latter.|$|E
