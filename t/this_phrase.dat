5|$|It is {{the oldest}} witness for the phrase μη αποστερησης (do not defraud) in Mark 10:19. <b>This</b> <b>phrase</b> was not {{included}} by the manuscripts: Codex Vaticanus (added by second corrector), Codex Cyprius, Codex Washingtonianus, Codex Athous Lavrensis, f1, f13, 28, 700, 1010, 1079, 1242, 1546, 2148, ℓ 10, ℓ 950, ℓ 1642, ℓ 1761, syrs, arm, geo. This is variant of the majority manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|What <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> {{meant to}} {{the maker of}} these riddles is {{impossible}} to say. In Hávamál 160 {{it is said that}} the dwarf Thjódrørir sang before Delling's doors, which (in {{view of the fact that}} Delling is the father of Dag (Day) in Vafþrúðnismál 25) may mean that he gave warning to his people that the sun was coming up, and they must return to their dark houses; the phrase would then virtually mean 'at sunrise.' As regarding dǫglings for Dellings in H, and Dǫglingar were the descendants of Dagr (according to SnE. 183).|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} {{successfully}} matches {{a number of}} consecutive notes correctly, they boost their individual scoring multiplier up to a maximum 4x value; missing a note will reset to the multiplier back to 1x. Throughout each song's respective charts for the instruments are special highlighted phrases; completing all the notes in <b>this</b> <b>phrase,</b> and for guitar/bass players, using the whammy bar on marked sustained notes, fills part of a Star Power meter. When this meter is at least half full, the player can activate Star Power by performing special actions on their controllers: either tilting the guitar controller upward briefly or pressing the Star Power activation button for guitar and bass; striking two pads simultaneously on the drums; and either double tapping the microphone or pressing one of the buttons on the game console's regular controllers for vocals. When Star Power is activated, the overall band scoring multiplier is increased for a limited time until the Star Power meter is drained. After completing a song, the band is awarded a number of stars based on the overall score; in normal modes for Warriors of Rock, up to six stars can be earned; the final being achievable only through zero misses and zero extra strums.|$|E

5|$|In about 701 Bede {{wrote his}} first works, the De Arte Metrica and De Schematibus et Tropis; both were {{intended}} {{for use in the}} classroom. He continued to write {{for the rest of his}} life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to Ecgbert of York, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of Acts of the Apostles that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the Bodleian Library at University of Oxford; it is known as the Codex Laudianus. Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the Laurentian Library in Florence. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>phrase</b> {{was coined}} by the German eugenicists Erwin Baur, Eugen Fischer and Fritz Lenz. It {{appeared}} in their 1921 work Human Heredity, which {{insisted on the}} innate superiority of the Nordic race.|$|E
5000|$|Sneider {{states that}} the [...] "truth" [...] {{campaign}} avoids <b>this</b> <b>phrasing</b> because [...] "the focus of the sentence would then be removed from their object of contempt, and placed on {{the very people who}} choose to smoke," [...] despite differences in tobacco-related cancer deaths.|$|R
5000|$|Some have {{objected to}} <b>this</b> <b>phrasing,</b> {{which is an}} {{elaboration}} of referring to training as [...] "human capital", either {{for the same reason}} that phrase is objectionable, or on the grounds that it implies that the human in which the knowledge is [...] "invested" [...] is a resource to be exploited.|$|R
5000|$|When {{translated}} into English, the syntactical form of <b>this</b> Hebrew <b>phrase</b> {{appears to be}} lacking a verb. In <b>this</b> context the <b>phrase</b> was commonly explained in early Rabbinical paraphrases as [...] "they bite like a lion my hands and my feet".|$|R
25|$|The motto {{which appears}} on most current University of Bradford {{publications}} is Making Knowledge Work, which {{relates to the}} institution's focus on courses that lead to employment. The university announced in June 2007 it was to use <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> as a trademark.|$|E
25|$|Subjacency {{says that}} you cannot relate two {{positions}} across two bounding nodes. In (13), {{we see that the}} movement of the wh-expression 'what' was moved past a CP and a TP to get to the Spec CP position- thus <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> is ungrammatical.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>phrase</b> {{has become}} the label of choice for this {{constitutional}} clause, and it was universally adopted by the courts, and it received Congress's imprimatur in Title 50 of the United States Code, section 1541(b) (1994), in the purpose and policy of the War Powers Resolution.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes, {{the nuclear}} force {{is called the}} {{residual}} strong force, {{in contrast to the}} strong interactions which arise from QCD. <b>This</b> <b>phrasing</b> arose during the 1970s when QCD was being established. Before that time, the strong nuclear force referred to the inter-nucleon potential. After the verification of the quark model, strong interaction has come to mean QCD.|$|R

25|$|Pape {{specifically}} {{during her}} Neo-Concrete period {{was interested in}} the “proposal to ‘live the body.’” <b>This</b> <b>phrase</b> indicates Pape’s interest in how the physical body acts as our mediator for all sensual experiences. Pape sought to explore this idea of the body’s relation in space by creating multi-sensorial experiences in her artwork.|$|E
25|$|The only {{words of}} Jesus {{on the cross}} in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a {{quotation}} of Psalm 22. Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, it is often considered a literary and theological creation. Geza Vermes, however, {{points out that the}} verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the Hebrew in which it usually would have been recited, and suggests that by the time of Jesus, <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> had become a proverbial saying in common usage. Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, which he describes as 'theologically correct and reassuring', he considers <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> 'unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable'. He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'. Raymond Brown likewise comments that he finds 'no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote'.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year September, US-Soviet Union {{cooperation}} line collapsed due to the disavowal of the Soviet Union's opinion on the German problem in the Stuttgart Council, and then followed the U.S. President Harry S. Truman’s announcement of enactment of hard anti-Soviet Union, anticommunism line policy. Since then, <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> became popular and was widely used as anti-Soviet Union propaganda term in the Western countries.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>phrase</b> is {{ambiguous}} {{in that it}} can be interpreted as the noun 'boy' referring to a particular individual or to a different individual for each instance of 'tree' under the quantifier 'every'. The interpretation that a single boy climbed all the trees takes a wide scope, while the other interpretation that for every tree there is a boy, who maybe be different for each tree takes a narrow scope.|$|E
25|$|Radiographers, {{also known}} as radiologic technologists, {{diagnostic}} radiographers and medical radiation technologists are healthcare professionals who specialise in the imaging of human anatomy for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} pathology. Radiographers are infrequently, and almost always erroneously, known as x-ray technicians. In countries which use the title radiologic technologist they are often informally referred to as techs in the clinical environment; <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> has emerged in popular culture such as television programmes.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeals {{found the}} second and third {{provisions}} of section 403a of the California Penal Code to be in compliance with the state and federal Constitutions’ guarantees of freedom of speech. They did, however, state that the constitutionality of the first clause was “questionable,” taking particular issue with the phrase “of opposition to organized government.” The Court of Appeals suggested that <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> could be eliminated from the section without introducing material changes to its purpose.|$|E
50|$|According to RFC 5321, the lowest-numbered {{records are}} the most preferred. <b>This</b> <b>phrasing</b> can be confusing, and so the {{preference}} number is {{sometimes referred to as}} the distance: smaller distances are more preferable. An older RFC, RFC 974, indicates that when the preference numbers are the same for two servers, they have the same priority, hence those two terms are used interchangeably.|$|R

5000|$|We find <b>this</b> <b>phrase’s</b> English {{equivalent}} {{twice in}} Shakespeare’s Sonnets. In neither case, however, is the context {{the same as}} that of Ovid’s. Shakespeare makes such boasts in the Sonnets, and they owe much to Ovidian precedent; but <b>this</b> particular <b>phrase</b> has migrated into different territory, the lover’s affirmation of a transcendent dependence on the beloved. Ovid never writes this way of Corinna in his Amores, where she is only an occasional longing; it is unmistakably his desire, not her merit that animates the Amores. Shakespeare, however, regards the beloved object highly as the all-inclusive focus. Indeed, justification of the lover’s existence marks the decisive new start for European love poetry in the thirteenth century.|$|R
25|$|Lipstick on a pig: Obama used <b>this</b> <b>phrase</b> to insinuate {{that any}} changes that McCain was advocating from the {{policies}} of George W. Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad. Some called it sexist, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during the Republican convention that {{the only difference between}} a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick.|$|E
25|$|As far as {{repeated}} {{words are}} concerned, they are normally written separately (with a comma), but a hyphen is used if their connection {{is more than}} occasional (e.g. ki ‘who’ but ki-ki ‘everyone’). If a word is repeated with a different suffix or postposition, the words are written separately (napról napra ‘day by day’, lit. ‘from day to day’), except if an element only exists in <b>this</b> <b>phrase,</b> {{in which case the}} words are written with a hyphen (régi ‘old’ réges-régi ‘ancient old’).|$|E
25|$|Ignatius {{wrote the}} Jesuit Constitutions, adopted in 1553, which created a {{centralised}} organization and stressed acceptance of any mission {{to which the}} Pope might call them. His main principle became the unofficial Jesuit motto: Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam ("For the greater glory of God"). <b>This</b> <b>phrase</b> is designed to reflect the idea that any work that is not evil can be meritorious for the spiritual life if it is performed with this intention, even things normally considered of little importance.|$|E
