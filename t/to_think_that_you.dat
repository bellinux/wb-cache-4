I will look in your eyes and tell you that I'm not dumb enough or moronic enough <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are dumb or moronic enough not to see that I would have stolen a melody. If you put the songs next to each other, side by side, the only {{similarities}} are the chord progression. It's the same one that has been in disco music for the last 50 years. Just because I'm the first fucking artist in 25 years to think of putting it on Top 40 radio, it doesn't mean I'm a plagiarist, it means I'm fucking smart. Sorry." ...|$|E
500|$|Wellesley {{later told}} Stevenson that [...] "I should {{not like to}} see again such a loss as I {{sustained}} on the 23rd September, even if attended by such a gain", and in later life he referred to Assaye as [...] "the bloodiest for the numbers that I ever saw". Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Munro, the Company's district collector at Mysore, was critical of the high proportion of casualties and questioned Wellesley's decision not to wait for Stevenson. He wrote to Wellesley: [...] "I am tempted <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did it {{with a view of}} sharing the glory with the smallest numbers". In response, Wellesley politely rebuffed Munro's accusations and defended his action as necessary because he had received and acted upon incorrect intelligence regarding the Maratha position. Assaye was 34-year-old Wellesley's first major success and despite his anguish over the heavy losses, it was a battle he always held in the highest estimation. After his retirement from active military service, the Duke of Wellington (as he later became known) considered Assaye the finest thing he ever did in the way of fighting even when compared to his later military career.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the groups}} {{have pledged to}} work together, {{relations}} between them have been difficult, with some sources saying that [...] "the loathing within the Brexit camp surpasses even that between Remain and Leave". Farage has said that Vote Leave is headed by [...] "apparatchiks" [...] and [...] "cretins", saying that the organisation [...] "brief every day that I'm toxic, I put voters off, and {{there is absolutely no}} statistical evidence to back that up at all. ... It's crackers <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can win a referendum campaign with Boris [...] and the likes of the cabinet", and became irritated when UKIP's sole MP Douglas Carswell joined Vote Leave. Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU's director of communications, told Private Eye that [...] "our private polling shows Remain will win if we carry on as we are".|$|E

60|$|CATHERINE. Your {{young lady}} still seems <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> enjoyed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't be I--it {{would be}} you. It would frighten them <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should absorb his lordship's young affections." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] {{replied the}} girl faintly. [...] "Try to forget me--no, not that--I {{could not bear}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had {{forgotten}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have reason}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> {{came into this}} room,” he said in {{measured}} tones, “it was not Michaelis who was in your mind; not principally—perhaps not at all.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{younger brother}} of the late Sir James Walter, {{the head of the}} Submarine Department. Yes, yes; I see the fall of the cards. He is coming <b>to.</b> I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had best leave his {{examination}} to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. <b>To</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> oh <b>you</b> {{can look}} at a scandal and <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{that would be good}} for your career, where for me it took every ounce of {{credibility}} and talent that I had and wiped it out." ...|$|R
60|$|I never dared <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> loved me. It's maddening that I must go. It's {{horrible to}} think of leaving you now.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not know, Uncle John, but I am {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> were a {{young man}} and should come a-wooing you would not get a rebuff from me," [...] answered Betty, smiling on the old man, of whom she was very fond.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{could have}} {{anticipated}} {{what has come}} to pass between us four,' said the old man thoughfully; 'but it is too late <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> would receive her courteously, young ladies, and be kind to her, if need were?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it good, dear, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> once <b>you</b> and I {{may have}} looked like that to some passer-by. I wish I could bless them--sweet, swift young things!

6000|$|... "It {{looks like}} it, for a fact, else {{why should we}} have been sent for? I'm beginnin' <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> Noel, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> said 'yes' to his wild scheme too quickly.

6000|$|... "It {{satisfies}} me beautifully," [...] Densher declared, [...] "but it doesn't, my dear child, very greatly enlighten me. You don't, you know, {{really tell}} me anything.
