5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>redemptive</b> powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem {{from the fact that}} in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is no}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|Todd was {{initially}} a short-term villain, but his popularity {{with the audience}} and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison, like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past. While keeping aspects of his personality dark or violent, they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion. They took steps to redeem him and made him {{an integral part of}} OLTL canvas, despite Howarth's objections to a redemption storyline. With the use of literary techniques for <b>the</b> <b>redemptive</b> arc, the writers borrowed from nineteenth-century melodrama and Gothic traditions, and literature such as Frankenstein. Todd became the product of an affair between his father, Victor Lord, and his mother, Irene Manning, which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters, including his sisters, Tina and Victoria Lord. An important aspect of the character became his appearance, most notably the scar on his right cheek, which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty. Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd's development. Although he formed many relationships (including with his wives, Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado), and fathered children, a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy.|$|E

25|$|Protestants {{perceived}} Roman Catholic salvation to {{be dependent}} upon the grace of God and the merits of one's own works. The reformers posited that salvation is a gift of God (i.e., God's act of free grace), dispensed by the Holy Spirit owing to <b>the</b> <b>redemptive</b> work of Jesus Christ alone. Consequently, they argued that a sinner is not accepted by God {{on account of the}} change wrought in the believer by God's grace, and that the believer is accepted without regard for the merit of his works, for no one deserves salvation.|$|E
25|$|The work {{is often}} {{compared}} to the other great historical novel of the Napoleonic Wars, Tolstoy's War and Peace. While Tolstoy's work has a greater emphasis on the historical detail and the effect the war has upon his protagonists, Thackeray instead uses the conflict as a backdrop to the lives of his characters. The momentous events on the continent do not always have an equally important influence on the behaviours of Thackeray's characters. Rather their faults tend to compound over time.

25|$|The Bernward Doors depict {{scenes from}} the Book of Genesis (left door) {{arranged}} in parallel to {{scenes from the}} Gospels (right door).

The left door depicts the increasing estrangement of humanity from God from top to bottom: the Creation, the Fall, Cain's murder of Abel. The right door shows <b>the</b> <b>redemptive</b> work of Christ from bottom to top: the Annunciation and Nativity, the Passion, the Resurrection). The depictions of the right door, in which the birth and childhood of Jesus are followed immediately by his passion and resurrection, are complemented thematically by the depiction of his life and ministry on the Bernward Column, which was probably also donated by Bernward, and stood in the east choir of St. Michael's until the eighteenth century.|$|E

[...] Aaron Ashmore's twin, Shawn, who is better known as Bobby [...] "Iceman" [...] Drake in the X-Men film series, appeared in two episodes of Smallville as the power leeching Eric Summers. After three seasons with the show, two as a series regular, Ashmore was written out of the series. According to Ashmore, when the producers were first trying to get permission to use the character on Smallville, DC Comics had qualms over how close Jimmy was in age to Clark and Lois, as the character was supposed to be at least ten years younger. The producers guaranteed the department they would eventually reveal the Jimmy Olsen who appeared on the show was not the Jimmy Olsen who would one day work alongside Clark and Lois. At the character's funeral, his full name is shown to be [...] "Henry James Olsen", and it is alluded that Jimmy's younger brother, who is given a brief appearance at the funeral, is the DC Comics version of Jimmy Olsen who will one day work at the Daily Planet with Clark and Lois.
