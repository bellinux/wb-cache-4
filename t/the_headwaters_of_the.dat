50|$|In 1860, the {{question}} was posed from the French side, which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two tributary rivers was <b>the</b> <b>headwater,</b> and thus <b>the</b> border. A joint French-Dutch commission was appointed to review the issue. <b>The</b> Dutch side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commission consisted <b>of</b> J.H. Baron van Heerdt tot Eversberg, J.F.A. Cateau van Rosevelt and August Kappler. Luits Vidal, Ronmy, Boudet and Dr. Rech composed the French side. In 1861 measurements were taken, which produced the following result: the Lawa had a discharge of 35,960 m3/minute at a width <b>of</b> 436 m; <b>the</b> Tapanahony had a discharge of 20,291 m3/minute at a width of 285 m.

5|$|On both {{approach}}es, the dropoff is steep {{enough for}} Highway 82 {{to require a}} 6% grade and switchbacks: one on the west and three on the east. The former approach uses the narrow valley of the Roaring Fork River, {{a tributary of the}} Colorado, which rises from Independence Lake west of the pass. Its walls are steeper but shallower than those of the North Fork of Lake Creek, which drains into Twin Lakes Reservoir and <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas River, on the east.|$|E
5|$|Pike {{had planned}} for the Pawnees to guide him to the Comanches. However, upon his arrival at the village, he was {{informed}} that the two tribes were at war. When Pike expressed his intention of continuing inland toward <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arkansas, Sharitarish urged him to turn back: he had prevented the Spanish from going further into American territory, and would likewise resist an American movement toward Spanish land.|$|E
5|$|Rugged {{mountains}} {{divided by}} rolling plains characterize the physiographically diverse watershed of the Snake River. The Snake River Plain {{was created by}} a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park, where <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Snake River arise. Gigantic glacial-retreat flooding episodes {{that occurred during the}} previous Ice Age carved out many topographical features, including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River. Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds.|$|E
50|$|In 1888 {{the city}} planned to put pipe in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{existing}} zanjas, but budgetary shortfalls {{did not allow}} the work to be finished. <b>The</b> tunnel at <b>the</b> <b>headwater</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zanja Madre was reconstructed and much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conduit was either brick or concrete lined. By 1893 there ended up some 50 miles <b>of</b> zanjas in <b>the</b> city and another 40 miles <b>of</b> zanjas outside <b>the</b> city limit. Over the years <b>the</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zanja Madre that passed around <b>the</b> north edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Train Yard was realigned again and again until railroad construction eventually demolished most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conduits as the city built newer types of water systems.|$|R
50|$|In 1860, the {{question}} was posed from the French side, which <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two tributary rivers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marowijne River (also called Maroni and Marowini) was <b>the</b> <b>headwater,</b> and thus <b>the</b> border.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} concentration and distribution of heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) was carried out for <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> Ranau District. Topsoil samples (0 - 15 cm depth) were collected randomly in accordance with <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> soil associations in the area. It was found that only three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heavy metals (Ni, Cr, and Cu) were present above <b>the</b> threshold <b>of</b> toxicity level, whilst the others were below this level. These higher levels of heavy metal concentration were most likely associated with the mining activities in <b>the</b> <b>headwater</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study area and also to <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> serpentinite parent material.

5|$|The {{rock in the}} {{southern}} part of the watershed of West Creek is of the Trimmers Rock Formation. This consists of siltstone and shale and comes from the Devonian period. The northern part of the watershed has rock belonging to the Catskill Formation, which consists of sandstone and siltstone and also comes from the Devonian. The Huntley Mountain Formation can be found at <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek.

5|$|A {{historic}} Native American path used to {{pass through}} the water gap of Leggetts Creek on its way from <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lehigh River to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Some mining and quarrying operations have been done in the watershed and the Leggetts Gap Railroad was built through Leggetts Gap in the 19th century. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of old growth forests. In other places, there are grasslands or invasive plants. A greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan.|$|E

50|$|At the confluence, the Schwarzbach carries {{twice as}} much water as the Blies (10.4 m³/s versus 5 m³/s). It is also some 10 percent longer.

5|$|Later American explorers {{traveled}} {{throughout the}} Snake River area and up its major tributaries beginning in 1806, just after Lewis and Clark had returned. The first was John Ordway in 1806, who also explored the lower Salmon River.

5|$|Because the Columbia was at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Missouri River, there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long-sought Northwest Passage. A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri. When the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast, unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition (1803–05), they found no passage between the rivers. After crossing the Rocky Mountains, Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River, reaching the Columbia near the present-day Tri-Cities, Washington. They explored a few miles upriver, as far as Bateman Island, before heading down the Columbia, concluding their journey at the river's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop, a short-lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months.|$|E
5|$|In 631 Anna was {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the existence of an important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} <b>the</b> <b>headwaters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Palliser River, a {{tributary}} of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E
