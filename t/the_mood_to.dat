25|$|The rebels {{realized}} {{that the people in}} Mecca supported the defense offered by Uthman and were not in <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> listen to them. That was a great psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.|$|E
500|$|Cyber Danganronpa VR was {{announced}} and {{shown at the}} Animation-Comic-Game Hong Kong fair in July 2015 by Sony Interactive Entertainment, as a tech demo for their virtual reality headset PlayStation VR. The game was developed by Spike Chunsoft, and was their first PlayStation 4 project. According to producer Yoshinori Terasawa, he was inspired to create the game by Bandai Namco Entertainment's PlayStation VR title Summer Lesson. The reason for making a game based on Trigger Happy Havoc rather than the spin-off shooting game [...] was that other companies could create virtual reality shooting games, and that the developers wanted to create something that only they could make. Terasawa {{decided to make the}} punishment sequence play out from a first-person perspective to make the player feel horror, but also included Monokuma to lighten <b>the</b> <b>mood.</b> <b>To</b> be able to complete the game quickly, the developers made use of the game engine Unreal Engine 4.|$|E

500|$|Actress Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith Palmer, {{attributed}} {{her love of}} the episode to Craig Robinson, because the two shared an enjoyment of singing together ever since the first season episode [...] "Basketball". She explained, [...] "We sing on the set and in the hair and makeup trailer. We sound good together, but sometimes people are not in <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> hear our amazing duets, mostly from the '80s." [...] Flannery believed that Robinson's performance in the episode was [...] "very funny," [...] as his character served as a [...] "great foil for Michael Scott."

Finally, a radio edit titled [...] "If U See Amy" [...] was released to American radio stations (after some stations briefly eliminated those lyrics of the song entirely), which changes the [...] "seek" [...] to [...] "see". The amended version was released in the UK in May. While the song has not officially been renamed or released in Australia, some radio stations, such as those belonging to the Austereo Radio Network, play the censored version, while others continue to play the uncensored.

Scipio stated that all 12 songs on the album feature [...] "tight, bouncy production" [...] and that {{all the members of}} the group sing confidently; [...] "there are no weak vocals here". He cited [...] "House Keeper" [...] and [...] "Personal" [...] as having the most soul, [...] "but the rest stand solidly". He concluded his review of the album by stating that: [...] "These visionaries are definitely a sound for sore ears". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared the group and the musical style of Personal to that of Boyz II Men. Erlewine stated that where Boyz II Men have first-rate professional songwriters and producers, Men of Vizion merely have [...] "competent hacks", which means that [...] "no matter how hard the group tries, they can't make any of these songs memorable". Jai Henry of The Daily Cougar commented that although at times they sound [...] "a little too much" [...] like Blackstreet, Men of Vizion [...] "definitely have their own sound".|$|E

500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} {{moderately}} well received by critics. Writing for Common Sense Media, Melissa Camacho spoke favorably of the series' emphasis on [...] "a successful and powerful {{segment of the}} African-American community" [...] {{that appears to be}} frequently neglected by the popular television. Tim Hall from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer commented of his general distaste for reality television, particularly describing The Real Housewives of Orange County as [...] "utterly ridiculous". However, he admitted that the dynamic and conflict between the women, in addition to the wealthy lifestyles they led, to be [...] "somewhat entertaining". In a more mixed review, Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times joked that its portrayal of wealth served as [...] "the best choice for a time capsule of the Bling Decade" [...] when noting the economic downturn the United States experienced around the time that the series premiered, although more seriously stated that the housewives' luxuries [...] "was never all that enviable, and now it looks as if it might not be viable."

500|$|But {{there is}} some {{opposition}} {{to the idea of}} an empowered global parliament. A 2007 BBC poll of approximately 12,000 respondents asked, [...] "How likely would you be to support a Global Parliament, where votes are based on country population sizes, and the global parliament is able to make binding policies?" [...] Of those polled, 19.1% responded [...] "Very unlikely–it is a bad idea"; 14.9% responded [...] "Quite unlikely–but it might work"; 23.1% said [...] "Quite likely–but with reservations"; and 14.4% said [...] "Very likely–it is a good idea". The poll was broken out by country, and the U.S. and Australia showed the strongest opposition. Potential challenge to the UNPA are political organizations such as the U.S. Constitution Party, and politicians such as 2008 U.S. presidential candidate Ron Paul, which favor withdrawal from the United Nations and other multilateral organizations altogether due to sovereignty concerns. Canadian Action Party leader Connie Fogal also opposes the UNPA, saying, [...] "It is very revealing to see the NDP and the Greens as part of and promoting this...Further, the European assembly {{has proven to be a}} rubber stamping mechanism of bureaucratic decisions. This is not democracy." [...] In addition, a Civicus article warns, [...] "With an unexpected backlash against civil society in the offing (despite the good efforts of the UN General Assembly President, Jan Eliasson, to reverse the trend), citizen participation at the UN is diminishing quickly.

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> template is a potentially valid explanation of the day-of-the-week effect. Regressions of daily returns from 1953 to 2006 suggest that a simple average of <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> scores in Farber (1953) and our survey can explain 35 % to 90 % {{of the variation in}} average daily abnormal returns. Given evidence that individual investors tend to disproportionately invest in small stocks (Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler, 1991; Grinblatt and Moskowitz, 2004; Nagel, 2005), we expected <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable <b>to</b> be more powerful for small stocks.

2500|$|There {{had been}} no new release from Slade since the [...] "Nobody's Fool" [...] single had been lifted from the Nobody's Fools album in April 1976 to {{commercial}} failure. The first that was heard of Slade in 1977 was the single [...] "Gypsy Roadhog". After the single was banned and stalled on the UK Singles Chart, the album that followed didn't have much commercial chance after that. Titled by Chandler after a piece of graffiti spotted painted on a London bridge, Whatever Happened to Slade, while intended as a defiant, ironic comment on their absence from UK shores, was more likely received as a virtual admission of how far the group's star had fallen, and few people, except perhaps a mere fraction of their old fan base, was in <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> contradict them.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> using <b>the</b> imperative <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> express orders, {{they can}} also be expressed using just the potential aspect of the indicative.

30|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations for {{the decline in the}} magnitude of the t-statistics of <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable. One possible source for this decline is the general decline of the day-of-the-week effect as documented in the previous subsection. The second possible explanation is that <b>the</b> ability of <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> effect has declined. It appears to us that this reflects more of a general decline in the magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect than a decline in <b>the</b> ability of <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> explain it. <b>The</b> basis for this conjecture {{is the fact that the}} proportion of variation of average abnormal returns explained by <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable, as measured by the ratio of R 2, does not show a declining trend over time. For example, in the EW portfolio, the proportion of variation of average abnormal returns explained by <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable in <b>the</b> first, second, and third subperiods is 64.1 %, 85.8 %, and 85.5 %, respectively. Similar results can be seen in the small capitalization deciles. We conclude, therefore, that the reduction in the magnitude of the t-statistics of <b>the</b> <b>mood</b> variable is more likely the result of the general decline in the magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect than a decline in <b>the</b> ability of <b>mood</b> <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> effect.|$|R
