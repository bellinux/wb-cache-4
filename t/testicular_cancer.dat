5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself <b>testicular</b> <b>cancer,</b> making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get <b>testicular</b> <b>cancer.</b> The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E

5|$|Mike Bullen {{vowed that}} he would not write a fifth series after the fourth ended so well in 2001, but was persuaded to write it when {{executive}} producer Andy Harries suggested he should kill off a character.

Despite this, Bullen was unable to make Adam's death funny and, following a meeting with Harries, decided it should be Rachel who died. Harries scheduled a meeting with Helen Baxendale at the Groucho Club, where they discussed the development. The scenes where Adam talks to Rachel's spirit were inspired by Truly, Madly, Deeply and Ghost. Bullen co-wrote the script of episode three with Matt Greenhalgh.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with <b>testicular</b> <b>cancer,</b> which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E

40|$|During recent years, {{significant}} {{advances have}} been made in the field of molecular therapy in urologic oncology, mainly for advanced renal cell carcinoma. In this hitherto largely treatment-refractory disease, several agents have been developed targeting the von Hippel-Lindau metabolic pathway which is involved in carcinogenesis and progression of the majority of renal cell carcinomas. Although cure may not be expected, new drugs, such as the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib and the mammalian target of rapamycine inhibitor temsirolimus, frequently stabilize the disease course and may improve survival. Fewer data are available supporting molecular therapies in prostate, bladder, and <b>testicular</b> <b>cancers.</b> Preliminary data suggest a potential role of high-dose calcitriol and thalidomide in hormone-refractory prostate cancer, whereas targeted therapies in bladder and <b>testicular</b> <b>cancers</b> are still more or less limited to single-case experiences.
