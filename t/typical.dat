5|$|Eta Carinae A {{is not a}} <b>typical</b> LBV. It is more {{luminous}} {{than any}} other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although {{it is unclear what}} the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a <b>typical</b> LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly <b>typical</b> of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and {{it has been estimated that}} the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be <b>typical</b> for an LBV in eruption.|$|E
5|$|In a <b>typical</b> day, each {{crew member}} divided {{his time between}} {{physical}} exercise, station assembly and maintenance, experiments, communications with ground personnel, personal time, and bio-needs activities (such as rest and eating). The crew's daily schedule usually operated on UTC; for example, a <b>typical</b> morning {{had been scheduled to}} begin with an electronic wake-up tone at about 05:00 UTC. But during the expedition, a more <b>typical</b> wake-up time was actually between 06:00 and 07:00 UTC. The crew's sleep habits were sometimes shifted to accommodate the schedules of visiting shuttles or resupply vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>typical</b> variety, spores {{range in}} size from 40–62µm (although a smaller range of 45–56µm is most <b>typical)</b> by 2–2.5µm; the paraphyses are either {{slightly}} branched above or not at all, and are curved to circinate at their apices.|$|E
5|$|Standard USB hub ports {{can provide}} from the <b>typical</b> 500mA/2.5W of current, only 100mA from non-hub ports. USB3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8A/9.0W (for {{dedicated}} battery charging, 1.5A/7.5W full bandwidth or 900mA/4.5W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60watts of power, although 10 to 20watts is more <b>typical.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Computer Language Benchmarks Game {{compares the}} {{performance}} of implementations of <b>typical</b> programming problems in several programming languages. The submitted Perl implementations typically perform toward {{the high end of}} the memory-usage spectrum and give varied speed results. Perl's performance in the benchmarks game is <b>typical</b> for interpreted languages.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{belong to}} the calc-alkaline series. Trace element data are <b>typical</b> for Central Volcanic Zone rocks. High {{potassium}} content is <b>typical</b> for shoshonite-like lavas erupted at large distance from the trenches.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are smaller}} than the <b>typical</b> variety, usually 39–42 by 1.5–2µm; the paraphyses are irregularly {{branched}} on the upper portion. Fruit bodies in this variety are club-shaped and flattened compared to the <b>typical</b> tongue-shape of the <b>typical</b> variety.|$|E
5|$|These {{omissions}} are <b>typical</b> for the Alexandrian text-type.|$|E
5|$|Uppercase and {{lowercase}} prefixes are not interchangeable. E.g., {{the quantities}} 1mW and 1MW represent two different quantities; {{the former is}} the <b>typical</b> power requirement of a hearing aid (1milliwatt or 0.001watts), and the latter the <b>typical</b> power requirement of a suburban train (1megawatt or watts).|$|E
5|$|A <b>typical</b> Noh play always {{involves}} the chorus, the orchestra, {{and at least}} one shite and one waki actor.|$|E
5|$|Exclamatory phrases {{follow the}} <b>typical</b> {{steadily}} rising pattern, but rise sharply {{on the last}} syllable instead of falling.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Solitus {{follows the}} <b>typical</b> human {{archetype}} and possesses average breed statistics of all choices.|$|E
5|$|Free-ranging dromedaries face large predators <b>typical</b> {{of their}} {{regional}} distribution, which includes wolves, lions and tigers.|$|E
5|$|In classes where {{horses are}} {{turned out in}} saddle seat equipment, it is <b>typical</b> for the horse to be shown in a single curb bit with a bit shank under , rather than the double bridle more common to other saddle seat breeds. Riders wear <b>typical</b> saddle seat attire. Hats are not always mandatory, but use of safety helmets is allowed and ranges from {{strongly}} encouraged to required in some pleasure division classes.|$|E

5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a <b>typical</b> example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the <b>typical</b> example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his <b>typical</b> example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a <b>typical</b> barrier reef then compares it to others, and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between <b>typical</b> and less <b>typical</b> forms. It was first applied to metals that floated on water (lithium, sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Only recently, since the mid-20th century, has it been widely {{used to refer to}} elements with intermediate or borderline properties between metals and nonmetals.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains elements}} <b>typical</b> of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But {{in other respects}} it conforms to the then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. <b>Typical</b> of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.|$|E
5|$|The <b>typical</b> clutch {{is three}} to four in size, but this may vary.|$|E

5|$|The <b>typical</b> {{longevity}} of beagles is 12–15 years, {{which is a}} common lifespan for dogs of their size.|$|E
5|$|<b>Typical</b> {{background}} {{concentrations of}} lead do not exceed 0.1μg/m3 in the atmosphere; 100mg/kg in soil; and 5μg/L in freshwater and seawater.|$|E
5|$|Whereas Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) are <b>typical</b> data-link {{protocols}} {{for larger}} networks such as WANs; Ethernet and Token Ring are <b>typical</b> data-link protocols for LANs. These protocols {{differ from the}} former protocols {{in that they are}} simpler, e.g., they omit features such as quality of service guarantees, and offer collision prevention. Both of these differences allow for more economical systems.|$|E
25|$|The appearance: e.g., purpuric (<b>typical</b> of {{vasculitis}} and meningococcal disease), {{fine and}} like sandpaper (<b>typical</b> of scarlet fever); circular lesions {{with a central}} depression are <b>typical</b> of molluscum contagiosum (and in the past, small pox); plaques with silver scales are <b>typical</b> of psoriasis.|$|E
25|$|Radioactivity {{is present}} {{everywhere}} (and {{has been since}} {{the formation of the}} earth). According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, one kilogram of soil typically contains the following amounts of the following three natural radioisotopes 370 Bq 40K (<b>typical</b> range 100–700 Bq), 25 Bq 226Ra (<b>typical</b> range 10–50 Bq), 25 Bq 238U (<b>typical</b> range 10–50 Bq) and 25 Bq 232Th (<b>typical</b> range 7–50 Bq).|$|E
25|$|Tyler {{experiences}} weather <b>typical</b> of East Texas, {{which is}} unpredictable, {{especially in the}} spring. All of East Texas has the humid subtropical climate <b>typical</b> of the American South.|$|E
25|$|Type IIb supernovae (SNe) {{initially}} exhibit {{spectral lines}} of hydrogen (like <b>typical</b> Type II's), but these disappear {{after a short}} time {{to be replaced by}} lines of oxygen, calcium and magnesium (like <b>typical</b> Type Ib's and Ic's).|$|E
25|$|The large {{range of}} values for the {{dissipation}} factor includes both <b>typical</b> and maximum specifications from data sheets of the various manufacturers. <b>Typical</b> electrical values for power and large AC capacitors {{were not included in}} this table.|$|E
25|$|A first {{approach}} for analyzing cellular networks {{is to consider}} the <b>typical</b> user, who can be assumed to be located anywhere on the plane. Under the assumption of point process ergodicity (satisfied when using homogeneous Poisson processes), {{the results for the}} <b>typical</b> user correspond to user averages. The coverage probability of the <b>typical</b> user is then interpreted as the proportion of network users who can connect to the cellular network.|$|E
25|$|The {{sizes of}} drums and cymbals given below are <b>typical.</b> Many drummers differ {{slightly}} or radically from them. Where no size is given, {{it is because}} {{there is too much}} variety to call a <b>typical</b> size.|$|E
25|$|High speed {{motorcycles}} {{often have}} long wheelbases: extra length is added by the extended swingarm on a <b>typical</b> dragbike; a <b>typical</b> land speed record streamliner has a meters-long wheelbase (3.7 meters {{for the current}} record holder, Ack Attack).|$|E
