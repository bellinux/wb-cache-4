He never supported the expansion of Cameroun's public school system, since he believed that educated subjects might one day challenge his rule.

5|$|Between 1950 and 1952, {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothall (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952–53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of tsetse fly.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>eradication</b> {{campaign}} led to {{the death}} of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of multinational corporations find their origins in First World countries. After {{the fall of}} communism, multinational corporations proliferated as more countries focused on global trade. The series of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later the World Trade Organization (WTO) essentially ended the protectionist measures that were dissuading global trade. <b>The</b> <b>eradication</b> of these protectionist measures, while creating avenues for economic interconnection, mostly benefited developed countries, who by using their power at GATT summits, forced developing and underdeveloped countries to open their economies to Western goods.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{relatively}} mild temperate climate with ample precipitation, the areas around Image Lake boast rich natural habitats with many species of plants, insects, rodents, and large mammals. Native Americans took advantage of these resources, and may have inhabited the area seasonally. However, human activity such as hunting, fishing, and mining, and recreational overuse increased after the arrival of Europeans. As a result, some areas experienced significant environmental degradation {{near the end of the}} nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, including <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of large predatory animals. Recreational overuse and the presence of livestock were especially problematic in the early to mid-twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Child labour is {{a complex}} problem that is {{basically}} rooted in poverty. The Indian government is implementing the world's largest child labour elimination program, with primary education targeted for ~250million. Numerous non-governmental and voluntary organisations are also involved. Special investigation cells {{have been set up}} in states to enforce existing laws banning employment of children (under 14) in hazardous industries. The allocation of the Government of India for <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of child labour was 10million in 1995–96 and 16million in 1996–97. The allocation for 2007 is 21million.|$|E

In his speech on Peace, he called for developed and developing nations to come together to strive for <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of poverty, the fight against terrorism, and nuclear disarmament. At the end of his speech, he recited the Shanti Mantra.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{had contact}} with these societies, and {{established}} missions further north, near Lake Okeechobee. In the 18th century, invading Creeks incorporated the dwindling numbers of the Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were the reasons for <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of both groups.

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E
5|$|The spot-billed pelican has an {{estimated}} population between 13,000 and 18,000 {{and is considered}} to be Near Threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Numbers declined substantially during the 20th century, one crucial factor being <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of the important Sittaung valley breeding colony in Burma through deforestation and the loss of feeding sites. The chief threats it faces are from habitat loss and human disturbance but populations have mostly stabilised following increased protection in India and Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} control measures for invasive Caprellamutica populations as of 2012. It {{has been suggested}} that the seasonal population fluctuations may be taken advantage of. Eradication efforts done during the winter months when C.mutica populations are dormant and at their lowest numbers, are potentially more effective in preventing their recovery during the summer months. Because of the great difficulty in detecting and removing them, however, control methods will likely focus on preserving native species populations rather than <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> of established C. mutica.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia {{banned the}} import of common {{starlings}} in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where {{other members of the}} flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue <b>the</b> <b>eradication</b> programme.|$|E
5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm was {{inspired}} by a passage in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard.
