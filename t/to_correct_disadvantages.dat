40|$|Estimation of {{stability}} of the soil body is the main objective {{in the design of}} structures and foundations. But the laws of mechanics, such as the equilibrium conditions and the boundary conditions are not observed in most methods used for estimating the {{stability of the}} soil body. <b>To</b> <b>correct</b> the noted <b>disadvantages,</b> the special method, in which all laws of mechanics are observed, is stated. Search for the most dangerous surface of failure is based on the variation principle. The proposed method is used to identify the impact of such factors like boundary conditions, the shape of the surface of failure, the law of normal stress distribution over the surface of failure on the estimating the slope stability. It is established that all these factors significantly effect on the estimating the stability of the soil body...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe increasing demands upon large digital computing facilities have necessitated {{the development and}} use of a system control program to provide for continuous automatic job processing., A comparative study of two current systems was conducted. The first, CDC FORTRAN 60, is described and its advantages and disadvantages are pointed out. This system was modified by the authors to incorporate a remote (satellite) operation in a time shared mode The second system studied was the CDC COOP MONITOR system. This system, a more complex, sophisticated control system is likewise discussed. Modifications <b>to</b> <b>correct</b> certain <b>disadvantages</b> of this system are shown, along with the programming necessary to provide for remote station operation in the COOP MONITOR environment. Several other programs which were developed by the authors to improve the computing center's capability are documented. These include; (1) A graph plotting routine utilizing CDC 1604 / 160 computers and a CDC 165 / CalComp Plotter, (2) A large file merg sort routine, and (3) A data display "Line Printer" routine. The authors wish to express their appreciation to Professor Mitchell L. Cotton of the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School, and to the personnel of the school's computing center for their kind consideration during the term of this thesis.
