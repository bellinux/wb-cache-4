5|$|After {{sufficiently}} {{upgrading the}} ship and exploring the map, the player is allowed to buy the three powerful artifacts, which then spawn at random ports. Defeating the Ancient Guardian in a card minigame awards the player additional loot and previously unavailable upgrades. Ancient Trader does not include a saving feature, which means that all progress is lost if the game is closed. An online multiplayer mode allows for several players to simultaneously play the same map, chase the artifacts, and defeat the Guardian. The prices of the artifacts increase as other players buy them. The players can check <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> artifacts gained by other players. The game also includes several alternative game modes, which focus on reaching a set total wealth or cash tally before other players. The multiplayer does not include an online scoreboard.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1841, Meyerbeer had {{completed}} {{the first draft of}} Le prophète, but refused to stage it because the then director of the opera, Leon Pillet, wished to cast his mistress, Rosine Stoltz, in the part of Fidès, the hero's mother. (Berlioz characterised Stoltz as 'la Directrice du Directeur'). Meyerbeer insisted on Pauline Viardot for the role. Meyerbeer lodged the score with a Parisian lawyer, and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met. It was not until 1849 when the Opéra was willing to agree his conditions. Meyerbeer was unique in his time in having <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> influence to impose his will as a composer in this way.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach {{may well}} have {{controlled}} Mann throughout his second reign in Dublin. Silver hoards uncovered on Mann, dated by their coins to the years 1030s1050s, {{may well be the}} by-product of the intense conflict over control of the island. There is evidence indicating that, {{at some point in the}} early eleventh centuryperhaps in the 1020s1030sa mint may have developed and functioned on Mann. Coins that appear to have been minted on the island roughly coincide with Echmarcach's rule. These coins are very similar to those produced in Dublin, and may be evidence that Echmarcach attempted to harmonise the coinage utilised within his realm. The production of coins on Mann appears to be evidence of a sophisticated economy in the Isles. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> sophistication of commerce in Echmarcach's realm could in part explain why the constant struggle for control of Dublin and the Isles was so bitter, and could account for Þórfinnr's apparent presence in the region.|$|E
5|$|Most {{migrants}} {{were people}} from the lower economic strata who had {{been left out of}} government and economic jobs; their lands had been confiscated due to heavy taxation under the Portuguese in Goa. As a consequence of <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> privileges which these Goan migrants enjoyed in Mangalore, they began feeling superior to their landless kindred in Goa. Their captivity at Seringapatam (1784–1799), where many died, were killed, or were forcibly converted to Islam, {{led to the formation of}} a separate and common Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity among members of the group, who hitherto had considered themselves an extension of the larger Goan Catholic community. They no longer self-identified as Goan Catholics. After their years of captivity, prosperity under the British and under Italian Jesuits, followed by migration for employment to Bombay, Calcutta, Poona, the Persian Gulf Arab states, and the English-speaking world, enabled the community to restore their identity. The overwhelming majority of Mangalorean Catholics are of Goud Saraswat Brahmin lineage. Historian Alan Machado Prabhu estimates that almost 95 per cent of Mangalorean Catholics have Goan origins.|$|E

5|$|The see, if such {{it may be}} called, {{appears to}} have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into {{existence}} {{in the years after}} Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, in about the year 603, though this is an unreliable source. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops – Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present – to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and <b>the</b> <b>wealth</b> <b>and</b> influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion, possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives tell how the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saint’s foundation as its endowment.|$|E
