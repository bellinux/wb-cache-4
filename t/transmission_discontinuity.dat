40|$|Abstract—The {{performance}} of wideband radar {{system may be}} degraded by signal distortion occurring in anyplace of the transmission channel of the system. If the amplitude response is not flat or the signal delay is not constant in the transmission of the wideband signal,then signal distortion will occur,which can reduce the SNR and resolution. The available theory indicates that a small sinusoidal ripple variation in either amplitude-frequency or phase-frequency response of a linear system will cause signal distortion and the phenomena of paired echoes in the output signals of the time domain. In this paper,whether a dispersive <b>transmission</b> line with <b>discontinuities</b> {{will lead to the}} phenomena of paired echoes is discussed by means of finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and theoretical analysis. The results show that the technique of paired echoes is unsuited to analyze the influence of dispersive <b>transmission</b> line with <b>discontinuities</b> on time domain pulse signal.

Furthermore, the switches {{are based on a}} multistable interlocking mechanism resulting in static zero-power consumption, i. e., both the onstate and the offstate are maintained without applying external actuation energy. Additionally, the switches provide with active opening capability, potentially improving the switch reliability, and enabling the usage of soft low-resistivity contact materials. Both two-port single-pole-single-throw (SPST) switches featuring mechanical bistability and three-port single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) T-junction switches with four mechanically stable states are presented. The switches, together with the transmission lines, are fabricated in a single photolithography process. The loss created by the discontinuity of the switch mechanism alone is 0. 08 dB at 20 GHz. Including a 500 mu m long transmission line with less than 0. 4 dB/mm loss up to 20 GHz, the total insertion loss of the two-port devices is 0. 15 and 0. 3 dB at 2 and 20 GHz, and the isolation is 45 and 25 dB at 2 and 20 GHz. The three-port switches, including their T-junction transmission line, have an insertion loss of 0. 31 and 0. 68 dB, and an isolation of 43 and 22 dB, at 1 and 10 GHz, respectively. Actuation voltages are 23 - 39 V for the two-port switches and 39 - 89 V for the three-port switches. The microwave propagation in the micromachined transmission line and the influence of the different switch designs were analyzed by finite-element method (FEM) simulations of electromagnetic energy and volume current distributions, proving the design advantages of the proposed concept. © 2010 IEEE.

In this paper, numeric analysis implemented by boundary element methods (BEM) and the normal mode expansion technique is used to study the Lamb wave reflection and <b>transmission</b> coefficients at <b>discontinuity</b> in plate. It is considered the interaction of Lamb waves with two basic discontinuities—thickness step and thickness incline. Interaction of individual Lamb wave modes with discontinuity in a plate is investigated by calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients for varying incident Lamb wave modes, frequency, and discontinuity shape. A 0 and S 0 Lamb mode in aluminum plate incident at frequency to 1. 4 MHz, the plate thickness variation from 0. 5 mm to 2. 0 mm and incline angle from 0 °to 60 °at the point of discontinuity are considered.

Introduction: Ultrasonic Lamb wave inspection is an elegant and promising technique whereby an ultrasonic pulse is sent to scan a long path through the structure, such as plate, tube and pipe. Lamb wave propagates in the direction along the surface of plate or in the axial direction of pipe, and as the material like metal has very little damping, the energy of the waves is practically not absorbed as they travel, and thus they can travel over long distances...|$|R
40|$|Broad-band {{microwave}} {{integrated circuit}} (MIC) amplifier design is a complex, multi-disciplinary process. This work focuses on three important aspects: the behaviour of microstrip <b>transmission</b> lines, <b>discontinuities,</b> and related structures; the accurate measurement of components and devices mounted in microstrip circuits; and the circuit design methodology. Techniques for microstrip quasi-static analysis are reviewed {{in order to}} identify methods suitable for extension to deal with the effects of substrate anisotropy. An integral equation method is described and the anisotropic Green's function derived using an extension to the method of partial images. Proposed transform methods are assessed and the preferred option implemented by adaption of a microstrip analysis computer program. A method, by which accurate measurements of microstrip properties may be made, is developed. Involving measurements of the resonant behaviour of half-wavelength short circuit resonators with two arbitrary coupling conditions, this technique allows the unloaded properties to be deduced. Results for microstrip on a sapphire substrate concur with the analysis. A pragmatic but effective approach to the calculation of the capacity component of microstrip discontinuities, and some other three dimensional MIC structures, is described and developed to allow existing data for isotropic substrates to be applied to the anisotropic situation. The computer corrected network analyser (CCNA) is a widely used microwave measurement tool. Weaknesses in popular correction strategies are identified and remedies developed. In particular, revised calibration equations that better accommodate test port mismatch variation with s-parameter selection, and a model for quadrature error are presented. A 2 -port calibration scheme suitable for use with MIC transmission lines, using only simple standards, is described. The standards are partially self-calibrating;the values of propagation constant, loss, and end effect are deduced in the calibration process. An effective jig for use with microstrip is described and the results of measurements on microwave transistors presented. Conventionally microwave amplifiers are designed using reactive components both to achieve good port matches and compensate the frequency dependent gain of the active devices. The problems associated with this approach are enumerated and the alternatives reviewed. A methodology which combines the benefits of frequency dependant dissipative networks with the elegance of reactive network synthesis is described. The device gain slope is compensated by simple lumped or distributed circuits incorporating a resistive element to produce a composite `device' with a specififed (flat) maximum available gain frequency response. Reactive matching networks are then used to interface these gain blocks. By this structured approach the amplifier gain breakdown can be defined at the outset and preserved through the design process. Other advantages stemming from the use of dissipative compensation include improved tolerance to device parameter and component value scatter, reduced group delay variations and enhanced reverse isolation. The method is demonstrated by the design and characterisation of 4 to 9 GHz amplifier having a representative specification. The close conformance of the performance of the untrimmed amplifier to that predicted by computer simulation testifies to the inherent accuracy of the design method, the microstrip (and related structures) analysis techniques and the CCNA MIC calibration scheme...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{undesirable}} {{transmission of}} {{noise and vibration}} along fluid filled pipes demands knowledge of the wave propagation characteristics. Because such waves are dispersive and wave reflection may occur at discontinuities, cross correlation and cross spectral methods of experimental determination of wave propagation characteristics, and of reflection and <b>transmission</b> coefficiences of <b>discontinuities,</b> are not effective. The thesis shows that a simple time or frequency analysis is not suitable for the determination of both dispersion and amplitude information, becasue the dispersion relation appears in the mathematical expression of the correlation peaks, and consequently corrupts the results. On the other hand, it is demonstated that wave field analysis, involving frequency-wavenumber decomposition, is able to produce both the dispersion relation k() and the amplitude of waves travelling in both directions in any type of waveguide. This is achieved by generating a two dimensional transfer function which is shown to vanish for wavenumbers of different value form the ratio /c(), and for values of k() = /c() displays Dirac peaks, the magnitudes of which are equal to the amplitude of the wave of corresponding wavenumber, and from which the dispersion relation is obtained. Using such a technique of wavenumber analysis, it is shown {{that it is possible}} to measure the complex reflection and transmission amplitude coefficients of a discontinuity in a waveguide. The important feature of this method, compared with simple time, or frequency, analysis consists in the fact that it can be applied to any kind of propagating dispersive wave, and no assumption has to be made about the expected dispersion relation involved. However, the application of this wavefield analysis to the measurement of reflection and transmission characteristics of a discontinuity is subject to some limitations which are investigated by using numerical simulation. With this technique, experimental results have been obtained for flexural waves in a rectangular cross-sectioned beam on which is fitted a mass-moment of inertia as a discontinuity, and comparison with theoretical results is presented. In addition, flexural waves in a piping system are investigated, and by using a similar technique, it has been possible to measure experimentally the dispersion relations of various flexural modes of different circumferential orders of a piping system when in-vacuo, and also when filled with liquid. An attempt to measure the reflection and transmission characteristics of a ring constraint fitted on the pipe when in-vacuo, and when fluid filled, is also reported with the associated difficulties which yield some proposition for further development of the technique in a view to future improvement...|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{waveguide}} structures, formed using rectangular {{blocks of}} dielectric, can guide electromagnetic energy in a frequency range suitable for new microwave antennas and devices, or between 2 GHz and 18 GHz. In this thesis, we present {{the analysis and}} design of thin dielectric waveguide structures so small {{that for the first}} time, they can be made economically out of readily available substrates, or circuit boards, even at these frequencies. These strikingly thin metallic-bound dielectric waveguides (H-guides), to be operated in a single fundamental mode, are analyzed and subsequently applied to three brand new applications: a square periodic H-guide structure, an antenna, and a thin H-guide dual-directional coupler. In the first application, we investigate periodic dielectric structures, or Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structures, where a new model for periodicity applies thin H-guide <b>transmission</b> lines with <b>discontinuities.</b> This model allows for the resonant frequency, transmission (S 21), and reflection (S 11) parameters of such structures to be found quickly and quite accurately with closed form expressions, without the need for any numerical methods. As an added benefit of the new model, which can be represented as a z-transform, an inverse operation exists, creating the possibility to design a structure that meets a certain frequency response. In the second application, we explore the use of the thin H-guide as a transmission line feed for a new type of aperture horn antenna that is not only high gain, but also wideband. Incredibly, with proper design, the antenna can also meet low-sidelobe levels between frequencies of 8 and 18 GHz. The proposed thin H-guide aperture horn antennas have wider bandwidths than typical array designs, have similarly high gains as compared to traditional air-filled horn antennas, and can even be easily fabricated using typical two dimensional substrate machining processes. The prototype operates from 8 to 18 GHz with a peak gain of about 18 dBi with reference to the H-guide transmission line. To make antenna fabrication and measurement of periodic dielectric structures possible, a new transition based on microstrip design has been carefully developed that exceeds the performance of all previous microstrip to dielectric waveguide transition designs. This wideband, low loss, Bézier-shaped microstrip to thin H-guide transition has been carefully developed and is discussed in detail in this thesis. This transition can even be fabricated using the same two dimensional substrate machining processes used for the H-guide aperture horn antenna, which allows for the seamless integration of the two structures. Finally, a dual-directional H-guide coupler is discussed that is much thinner than air-filled waveguide designs. The structure is so thin that its total thickness can be less than 2 millimeters, where the design obtains a directivity of better than 25 dB over a large bandwidth of 8 to 14 GHz. ...|$|R
