5|$|The {{major part}} of the {{subsequent}} attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll <b>to</b> <b>roll.</b> <b>In</b> theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead have a number of consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E

25|$|The Browns {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> {{the first}} half of the 1977 season, but an injury to Sipe by Steelers linebacker Jack Lambert on November 13 proved to be disastrous. Cleveland won only one of their last five games to finish at 6–8, a collapse that led to Forrest Gregg's dismissal before the final game of the season. Dick Modzelewski served as interim coach in the team's 20–19 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.|$|E
25|$|Prince David, {{in company}} with Prince Henry, left Halifax on 12 January 1941 for work-ups off Bermuda. Crews of both ships {{were given a}} good {{introduction}} to the quick rolling characteristics of the 'Princes' during a stormy passage to Hamilton, Bermuda. Even as cruise ships, the three 'Princes' were known for their tendency <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> heavy seas. As a gun platform, {{this was not an}} ideal trait and extra care and practice was needed to overcome the tendency to a quick rolling motion. Added to this was the age of the 6-inch guns themselves, which made it necessary to devote more care to the armament than was desirable in a hectic engagement.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2012 the FEC {{began an}} {{aggressive}} project to reopen direct rail {{service to the}} ports of Miami, and Port Everglades. This is {{in anticipation of the}} expansion of the Panama Canal and the expected increase of intermodal traffic. In 2013 the drawbridge at the Port of Miami was repaired and reactivated and trains began <b>to</b> <b>roll.</b> <b>In</b> 2014 a new container shuttle was put into operation between Hialeah Yard and the Port of Miami. Also in 2014, the new rail lines into Port Everglades were opened allowing direct access for FEC trains into the port. Further a new transfer facility in Hialeah Yard will add additional intermodal transfer between trains, trucks, and planes. This facility will open by 2015. Additional capacity improvements are planned at other ports as well as the FEC's mainline.|$|E

500|$|The player {{starts with}} a single LocoRoco. When this LocoRoco eats a berry, it grows by one, up to a maximum size of twenty. The single large LocoRoco may be split into {{individual}} beings by pressing [...] or through specific points on the level, while individual LocoRoco can merge back into a single being by holding down [...] Manipulation of the LocoRoco in this manner {{may be necessary to}} guide them to the finish; while the single large LocoRoco is easier to control, small passages can only be navigated by individual LocoRoco. The player can lose LocoRoco if they are touched by harmful objects or they run into the Moja, and the game will be over if they lose all their LocoRoco. With the exception of making them jump, the player does not otherwise directly control the LocoRoco, but instead controls the planet itself, tilting the planet using the L and R buttons. [...] This causes the LocoRoco <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> the direction of tilt, as well as causing certain mechanical objects such as platforms to also tilt. [...] The player can also cause the LocoRoco to jump by holding and releasing both buttons; this not only allows the LocoRoco a way to cross gaps, but to burst through walls as well as harm the Moja without taking damage. As the player collects more LocoRoco in a level, the music gains more voices, each LocoRoco singing a part in the overall song.|$|E
500|$|On 29 May 1900, Tiger was reactivated, {{and she was}} {{assigned}} as the flagship of the II Division the following day. She served in this role for three months during the summer training period, {{before returning to the}} reserve fleet. In 1901, the navy decided to add bilge keels to the ship to reduce her tendency <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> heavy seas. In addition, a [...] dynamo, a steam control system, and electric lights were also installed. She participated in the summer training exercises in 1902 and 1903, before returning to reserve status on 15 September 1903. In late 1903, the navy began to consider what would be done with Tiger, now 15 years old, for the remainder of her career. The navy considered four options in a meeting on 19 February 1904: to keep the ship armed with her original gun batter, to disarm her, to replace them with new 40-cal. versions, or replace them with 7cm 45-cal. guns. Ultimately, the Marinesektion rejected all four proposals, since the ship's boilers were in poor condition by that point. Instead, they decided to convert the ship into an admiralty yacht, since she had little combat value by that time anyway. Additionally, the current yacht, Pelikan, was to be converted into a depot ship for the torpedo training school. The plan was prepared in June, and the work was to be done at the Pola Naval Arsenal. The conversion work was done in 19051906 and she was renamed Lacroma on 29 January 1906. Her armament reduced to six 47mm QF guns and the sponsons for her main battery were removed.|$|E

Mostyn's supporters quickly published a response, A Vindication of the Conduct of Captain M-N, attributing blame solely to Hampton Courts tendency <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> heavy swell. Despite this response, public opinion remained against Mostyn and nearly a year after the verdict he was jeered out of Portsmouth Dockyard by workmen and sailors calling out ‘All's well! there's no Frenchman in the way!’ ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 29, 1898, the City of Ainsworth left Nelson for Bonner's Ferry and {{was caught}} in a gale force storm. Loaded down with eight cords of wood on her bow, she began to founder. Passengers and crew were quick to throw the {{firewood}} overboard, but then the water rushed down onto her stern and she turned broadside and began <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> the waves. At one point she rolled over so far that water rushed into her smokestack. The first officer put down one of the two lifeboats, but as soon as five people got in it, it was swamped and four of them were lost in the waves. The second lifeboat was launched with worse results, and another five people were lost.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1988 {{season the}} Bears kept on rolling, winning their fifth {{straight}} division title with a 12–4 record and earning home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In a Divisional Playoffs game on New Year's Eve, the Bears faced the Philadelphia Eagles, and former defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan {{in a game}} that forever would be known as the [...] "Fog Bowl". Late in the 2nd Quarter the fog began <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> off Lake Michigan, and {{at the start of the}} 3rd Quarter, Soldier Field was immersed in thick fog that made viewing the game impossible. The Bears emerged from the fog with a 20–12 victory.

2500|$|In {{their final}} non-conference {{game of the}} 2013 season, Ohio State {{defeated}} the Florida A Rattlers of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, 76–0, in Columbus. Kenny Guiton was named the Buckeyes' starting quarterback {{for the second consecutive}} game. [...] The Buckeyes scored on all five of their drives in the first quarter for a 34–0 lead. Jordan Hall scored Ohio State's first touchdown on a 3-yard run, while Guiton threw four touchdown passes to four separate receivers. [...] A blocked punt by Doran Grant and an interception by Bradley Roby set up good field positions for the Buckeyes and scoring drives. [...] Ohio State continued <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> the second quarter, scoring three touchdowns on all of their drives, including an 18-yard run from Jordan Hall and two touchdown passes from Guiton. The six touchdown passes from Guiton in the first half were a new Ohio State single-game quarterback record.|$|E
2500|$|Provisioned and {{manned by}} July, the vessel was {{returned}} to the English Channel to assist in safe convoy for a fleet of West Indiamen, and then in company with Tartar to hunt privateers. She had her first and only victory within weeks of leaving port, capturing the French vessel La Marquise de Chateaunois on 17 July. [...] Despite this victory Tartars Prize was experiencing considerable difficulty with her long, sleek design, which increased her speed but made her unwieldy and liable <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> heavy weather. In August Baillie was forced to make port in Spanish Corunna {{so that he could}} restow the cargo and take on ballast to stabilise the ship. He returned Tartars Prize to sea in September, where she promptly sprang a leak and started taking on 18 inches of water each hour. Forced back into port for repairs, Baillie wrote to Admiralty requesting stronger decking and timbers so that the hull would not keep opening up at the seams.|$|E
2500|$|The chief proponent {{for the new}} large carrier was Admiral Marc Mitscher. He {{wanted a}} carrier that {{would be able to}} handle the most {{effective}} weapons of the day. Early design discussions centered around developing a carrier that would be able to support combat missions using the new jet aircraft. These were faster, larger and significantly heavier than the aircraft the [...] and -class carriers were handling {{at the end of the}} Second World War. It was thought that the aircraft carried would have to have longer range to allow the carrier to operate farther away from the target. The deck would have to be able to handle the weight of the heavy jet aircraft landing on the deck. The overall implication was that the ship's strength deck would have to be the flight deck rather than the hangar deck, as had been the case for earlier U.S. carriers. Armoring the flight deck would mean the ship would have a greater tendency <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>in</b> rough weather, as a greater part of the ship's weight would be elevated higher above the waterline.|$|E
