5|$|Architectural {{historians have}} grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four {{different}} generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings {{from the first}} years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 {{in a wide range of}} styles. Immaculate Conception's place at the end of <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>generation</b> is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical of that period and much more common in the fourth generation that would soon arise, putting it in somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.|$|E

5|$|Succeeding the SG-1000, the Master System was {{released}} {{as a direct}} competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>generation</b> of video game consoles. The NES used virtually the same hardware as the 1983 Famicom while the Master System was constructed with more up-to-date hardware. Despite improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil. Compared with its competition from Nintendo, the Master System's game library lacked a number of well-received titles, due to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity to the NES.|$|E
