5|$|Modern {{scholars}} classify <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Hebrews {{as one of}} {{the three}} Jewish–Christian gospels, along with <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Nazarenes and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Ebionites. Others suggest that these three titles may have been referring to one and the same book. All are known today only from fragments preserved in quotations by the early Church Fathers. The relationship between the Jewish–Christian gospels and a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel remains a speculation.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Ebionites, <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Hebrews, and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Nazarenes remains unclear. All the Jewish–Christian gospels survive only as fragments in quotations, {{so it is}} difficult to tell if they are independent texts or variations of each other. Scholar Albertus Klijn established the modern consensus, concluding that the gospel harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius. Scholar Marie-Émile Boismard has claimed the Ebionite gospel is partly dependent upon a hypothetical Hebrew gospel as a source; however this conjecture remains a minority view. Its putative relationship to the gospel text known to Origen as <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve remains a subject of scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Thomas, <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Mary, and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Philip.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully argued that <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> John has elements {{in common with}} Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> John, the pre-existing Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} pre-existing Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. <b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Mark and <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|The Ebionite gospel is {{one example}} of a type of gospel harmony that used <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Matthew as a base text but did not include <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, harmonization was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> John is {{significantly}} different from the synoptic gospels, with major variations in material, theological emphasis, chronology, and literary style. There are also some discrepancies between John and the synoptics, some amounting to contradictions.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Luke {{says the}} census from Caesar Augustus took place when Quirinius was {{governor}} of Syria.

Some scholars explain the apparent disparity as an error {{on the part of the}} author of <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> Luke, concluding that he was more concerned with creating a symbolic narrative than a historical account, and was either unaware of, or indifferent to, the chronological difficulty.|$|E
