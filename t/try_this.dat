5|$|The {{match on}} 15 June was {{played at the}} Agricultural Ground in front of 12,000 spectators. NSW soon put points on the {{scoreboard}} when O'Donnell marked and Verge kicked a goal. Queensland responded soon after with an unconverted try, and then, after some fast play, scored a second <b>try,</b> <b>this</b> one converted to put the visitors ahead 4–8. Verge then kicked a penalty goal to bring the difference to one point. The second half was a demonstration of good attacking play and strong defensive work on both sides. The only points scored were from a try for Queensland, giving them a 7–11 win.|$|E
5|$|John's {{final season}} with Wales ended disappointingly as both Scotland and Wales refused {{to travel to}} Ireland due to the {{increased}} violence in Ulster and the events of Bloody Sunday. Despite this, John had a good Championship, scoring 35 points in the three games against England, Scotland and France. The opener, away to England, was won 12–3, with John scoring two penalty goals and converting a J.P.R. Williams <b>try.</b> <b>This</b> {{was followed by a}} win over Scotland, in which John played well, converting three of the five Welsh tries and scoring three penalty goals. John's final international was at home to France. He successfully converted four penalty goals in a 20–6 victory to Wales, and in scoring his final penalty surpassed the Wales international points scoring record of Jack Bancroft set nearly 60 years earlier. The Welsh Rugby Union's refusal to allow travel to Ireland stole the team's possibility of a consecutive Grand Slam title.|$|E

25|$|England led 10–6 {{early in}} the second half, with a try to Andy Farrell late in the first and one to {{replacement}} forward Chris Joynt 5 minutes into the second, both coming about through mistakes from Australia's fullback, Tim Brasher. A try to Mark Coyne levelled the score at 10–10. But England's Jason Robinson scored after another Australian handling error by winger John Hopoate with twelve minutes remaining. Another England <b>try,</b> <b>this</b> time from an interception by Paul Newlove put the result beyond doubt. This game attracted 4.2 million viewers.|$|E
25|$|With the game-time {{temperature}} at , the coldest NFL game since the Ice Bowl of December 31, 1967, {{the first quarter}} contained nothing but punts and interceptions, with Cleveland's Ron Bolton and Oakland's Lester Hayes each recording a pick. Near {{the end of the}} quarter, Sipe's 20-yard completion to Reggie Rucker sparked a drive inside the Raiders 30-yard line, but it ended with no points early in the second quarter when Cockroft missed a field goal attempt from 47 yards. On Oakland's ensuing drive, quarterback Jim Plunkett lost a fumble while being sacked, but their defense kept the Browns in check and Cockroft missed another field goal <b>try,</b> <b>this</b> one from 30 yards out.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{overtime}} period, referee Ron Blum announced that each team had three timeouts. This caused some confusion because, {{compared with the}} regular season, overtime in the postseason utilizes slightly different rules. The Titans took the opening kickoff and McNair threw completions to Justin McCareins for gains of 31 and 22 yards before Robert Holcombe's 3-yard run put {{the ball on the}} Steelers 16-yard line. They sent out Nedney to win the game, setting up a wild finish. Nedney's first kick was good, but it was negated because the Steelers had called timeout. The fireworks operator at the stadium inadvertently set off the fireworks, delaying the game for several minutes. After the fireworks had fizzled, Nedney attempted to win the game again. His kick was wide right, but Washington was penalized for running into Nedney. After the five-yard penalty was assessed, Nedney was given a third <b>try.</b> <b>This</b> time he converted the kick, winning the game.|$|E
25|$|After {{playing in}} the very first Scotland match against Wales in early 1883, scoring his first {{international}} try in the game, Don-Wauchope was incapacitated {{for the rest of the}} season with a knee injury. He regained his place for all three matches of the 1884 Home Nations Championship, paired at half back with Oxford University rival Augustus Grant-Asher. After victories over Wales and Ireland, where he scored another <b>try,</b> <b>this</b> time against Ireland; the Scottish team were beaten by England in a contentious game at Blackheath. The next season saw Scotland draw to Wales, beat Ireland, and refuse to face England. Don-Wauchope played in both games of the 1885 Championship and in the home clash with Ireland, not only scored his third international try, but was also joined at half-back with his younger brother Patrick Hamilton Don-Wauchope. This was Patrick's first international game, and he would go on to win five more caps for Scotland.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} game of the 2006-07 Guinness Premiership season against Worcester Warriors on Friday, 8 September, Wilkinson was helped from the pitch after 47minutes {{with a knee injury}} {{incurred}} when one of his team members fell on him after he was tackled. A scan confirmed that he had torn the medial ligament of his right knee. He returned to play a full 80minutes in the 26–21 win against leaders Bristol on Friday, 3 November, kicking a conversion, a drop-goal and two penalties. It was reported on 9 November that Wilkinson suffered a lacerated kidney during the match. He returned from this injury in the Premiership game against Leicester Tigers on 27 January 2007, coming off the bench after 37 minutes. On 29 January 2007, Wilkinson was selected at fly-half in the starting line up for England in their 2007 Six Nations Championship opener against Scotland. England comprehensively beat Scotland 42–20 to regain the Calcutta Cup, Wilkinson making an impressive return, scoring 27points with five penalties, two conversions, a drop goal, and a <b>try.</b> <b>This</b> broke the previous Calcutta Cup individual record of 24, set by Rob Andrew. Wilkinson was awarded the RBS Man of the Match as adjudicated by BBC commentator, Brian Moore.|$|E

500|$|Toivonen's WRC {{contract}} with Lancia Martini consisted of five events. Fiorio {{stated that the}} team needed another top driver as [...] "Audi will have four top drivers next year {{so it would be}} very difficult competing with only two." [...] Toivonen had his Lancia 037 debut in Portugal with very limited testing experience: [...] "It has been snowing in Italy every time I have been to <b>try</b> <b>this</b> car, so I don't know its limits." [...] However, similarly to his Opel Ascona 400 debut at the same event two years ago, Toivonen immediately took the lead and set several fastest stage times before retiring. This time the retirement was not caused by a broken clutch, but a mistake and a crash by Toivonen. After a retirement also in Greece, he finished third in his home event, the 1000 Lakes Rally. These three remained Toivonen's only WRC events of the season as his back injury forced him to miss the Sanremo and RAC rallies. Before Sanremo, Markku Alén re-signed with Lancia and Fiorio stated he wanted to sign Toivonen with a similar two-year contract, depending on the condition of his back and his contractual situation with Rothmans Porsche, who had claimed Toivonen had already re-signed with them. Toivonen chose to become a full-fledged Lancia driver for the 1985 season.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} first started, Clement and {{his crew}} would spend six hours applying Haley's make-up; eventually, the crew was able to streamline their process. According to Haley, the make-up crew would apply individual prosthetics to him, from his head {{all the way down}} his back, which were glued to his body. The appliances were then blended together to create a seamless appearance. Haley spent approximately three hours and twenty minutes in the make-up chair to apply the prosthetics, each day; on occasion, it would take almost four and a half hours when the crew needed to apply the prosthetic skull cap, which Haley did not need to worry about most days as he was able to wear the fedora hat on top of his head. Haley also had to wear contact lenses, one that was bloody and another that was cloudy, with the latter one making it difficult for the actor to see out of. Haley also had to work on developing Freddy's [...] "voice" [...] for the film. According to Haley, the process of coming up with the perfect voice for Freddy is [...] "this organic process of embodying the character", and not about just [...] "sitting around the table and going, 'Let me <b>try</b> <b>this</b> voice and this voice'". Haley and Bayer admitted that some of the voice would be digitally enhanced in the end to give it a [...] "supernatural quality" [...] and get it away from the voice Haley used as Rorschach in Watchmen.|$|E
