5|$|Plots {{are often}} {{set in motion}} by events, ranging from the fairly typical to the supernatural and extraordinary, which {{frequently}} happen in the town. The boys often act as the voice of reason when these events cause panic or incongruous behavior among the adult populace, who are customarily depicted as irrational, gullible, and prone to vociferation. The boys are also frequently confused by <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> and hypocritical behavior of their parents and other adults, and often perceive them as having distorted views on morality and society.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha {{gains in}} the north were undone because of <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> {{policies}} of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in {{the family of the}} Peshwa, which culminated in the murder of Narayanrao Peshwa in 1773. Due to this, the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India. Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries. He sought help from the British, and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775. This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort.|$|E
5|$|Lukesh {{then returns}} to the {{alleyway}} where Doggett was shot and vanishes. Based on <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> evidence, Reyes concludes that Lukesh can travel between parallel universes in order to kill. She also concludes that the unharmed Doggett disappeared because {{two versions of the}} same person cannot exist in the same universe. Follmer and Skinner question Lukesh, who becomes agitated when his mother is mentioned. Noting this, Skinner decides to hint that his mother will be questioned, which leads Lukesh to become more uncomfortable. Lukesh returns home to find his mother has found the gun with which he shot Doggett. After she threatens to talk to the FBI, Lukesh kills her.|$|E

5|$|Richard named Geoffrey Archbishop of York on 20 July 1189, {{within days}} of taking the throne; the formal {{election}} took place on 10 August. What happened with the vacant archbishopric of York after Richard took the throne, and why, {{as well as the}} exact chronology of events, is complicated by <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> nature of the main contemporary accounts. Gerald of Wales states that Geoffrey was reluctant to accept York, but another chronicler, Benedict of Peterborough relates that Geoffrey quickly took control of the archiepiscopal estates. However the election occurred, Geoffrey's consecration did not take place until much later, and soon after his election, he either resigned or was stripped of his office of Chancellor. A further complication was that the cathedral chapter had earlier elected the Dean of York, Hubert Walter, as archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> reality of harming {{themselves}} {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

25|$|The god (Deva) and antigod (Asura), states Edelmann, {{are also}} symbolically <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> forces that motivate each {{individual}} and people, and thus Deva-Asura dichotomy {{is a spiritual}} concept rather than mere genealogical category or species of being. In the Bhāgavata Purana, saints and gods are born in families of Asuras, such as Mahabali and Prahlada, conveying the symbolism that motivations, beliefs and actions rather than one's birth and family circumstances define whether one is Deva-like or Asura-like.|$|E

As president, he primarily focused the nation's overseas ambitions on the Caribbean, especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project, the Panama Canal. Roosevelt also increased {{the size of the}} navy, {{and by the end of}} his second term the United States had more battleships than any other country besides Britain.|$|E

25|$|Thus, Kumar {{sees the}} task of {{scholars}} of media and culture as twofold: “to explain and critique the state of culture and society, and then to act upon the world to change it. In taking up this challenge, classical Marxism {{as a guide to}} action has much to offer” (85). In addition, this type of work is possible according to Kumar due to <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> nature of media: “Media texts are contradictory, as all reality is contradictory. And contradiction allows for change within the totality of social relations. This change is the product of human beings resisting their conditions of oppression and exploitation” (p.84).|$|E

He described his portrayal as working through <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> traits Lucky inherited from his parents, the purity of Laura versus the con artist side of Luke. He explained that he was taking the essence of being their son and translating him into adulthood.|$|E

Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter, and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> explanations she and Fred had given as to Heather's disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after the girl had left home.|$|E

25|$|The three brigades {{gathered}} by Lieutenant General Ludwig von Wohlgemuth from the Austrian Hereditary Provinces neared the Vág and Garam rivers, receiving a brigade from {{the division of}} Lieutenant General Balthasar Simunich and the Jablonowski division defeated at Vác some days earlier.

But <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> orders given by Welden and Jelačić, prevented that this corps to arrive on time {{in the vicinity of}} the Garam river. Welden on 17 April gave him order to march towards Vác, and enter in contact with Wohlgemuth, but the Croatian ban was not very willingly to obey, agreeing to move only on 20 April (a day after the battle of Nagysalló actually took place).|$|E

The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets ("Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the Apologies main strategies was to use <b>the</b> <b>contradictory</b> philosophies of skepticism and stoicism, personalized by Montaigne on one hand, and Epictetus on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.|$|E
