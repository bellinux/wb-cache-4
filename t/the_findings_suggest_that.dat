The first of these was based on limited quantitative questions relating to masturbation. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> masturbation is {{not a substitute for}} sexual intercourse, as has often been posited, but is associated with increased sexual interest and greater number of partners.

2500|$|Darley and Latané (1968) {{conducted}} research on diffusion of responsibility. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{in the case}} of an emergency, when people believe that there are other people around, they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as doctors or police officers, and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance. For this reason, some legislations, such as [...] "Good Samaritan Laws" [...] limit liability for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency.|$|E

Included are the Rayleihg law for small particles, the Chandrasekhar solution of the planetary scattering problem, and the Mie theory for large particle scattering. Observations cover the wavelength range from 0.37 to 0.79 micrometre at the scattering angle 2.4 degrees, and over the altitude range from 42,000 ft. to 80,000 ft. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{the form of the}} particle size distribution changes with altitude, becoming a steeper function of particle radius at higher altitudes.|$|E

50|$|When {{dealing with}} real life {{aircraft}} equipped with plasma actuators, {{it is important}} to consider the effect of temperature. The temperature variations encountered during a flight envelope may have adverse effects in actuator performance.

Increasing dielectric surface temperature can increase the plasma actuator performance by increasing the momentum flux whilst consuming slightly higher energy.|$|E
