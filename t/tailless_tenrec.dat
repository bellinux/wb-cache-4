5000|$|The <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec,</b> {{similar to}} a {{hedgehog}} but belonging to a different family of insectivores, the Tenrecidae, whose main stronghold is Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|At {{least six}} species of tenrecs {{are found in}} and around Analamzaotra Forest Station {{including}} common <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec,</b> greater hedgehog tenrec, lowland streaked tenrec, mole-like rice tenrec, shrew tenrecs and aquatic tenrec.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec</b> is {{the largest}} land-dwelling species of the tenrec family, Tenrecidae. It is 26 to 39 cm (10 to 15½ in) in length and weighs 1.5 to 2.5 kg (3¼ to 5½ lb). It has medium-sized, coarse grey to reddish-grey fur and long, sharp spines along its body. It not only eats small {{invertebrates}} among leaves, but also scavenges and hunts frogs and mice. If threatened, this tenrec will scream, erect its spiny hairs to a crest, jump, buck and bite. It shelters in a nest of grass and leaves under a rock, log or bush by day. It gives birth to a litter {{of as many as}} 32 young, with an average litter between 15-20 after a gestation of 50-60 days; when young, they have a black-and-white striped appearance. Despite being sometimes known as the <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec,</b> they have a small tail 1 to 1.5 cm (⅜ to ½ in) in length.|$|E
50|$|Tenrecs have a {{gestation}} period of 50 to 64 days, and {{give birth to}} a number of relatively undeveloped young. While the otter shrews have just two young per litter, the <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec</b> can have as many as 32, and females possess up to 29 teats, more than any other mammal. At least some tenrec species are social, living in multigenerational family groups with over a dozen individuals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec</b> (Tenrec ecaudatus), {{also known}} as the common tenrec, is a species of mammal in the family Tenrecidae. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Tenrec. Native to Madagascar, it is also found in the Comoros, Mauritius, Réunion, and Seychelles, where it has been introduced. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, dry savanna, moist savanna, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, subtropical or tropical moist shrubland, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland, subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, arable land, pastureland, plantations, rural gardens, and urban areas.|$|E
50|$|Tenrecs {{are small}} mammals of {{variable}} body form. The smallest species are {{the size of}} shrews, with a body length of around 4.5 cm, and weighing just 5 g, while the largest, the common or <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec,</b> is 25 to 39 cm in length, and can weigh over 1 kg. Although they may resemble shrews, hedgehogs, or otters, they are not closely related {{to any of these}} groups, their closest relatives being other African insectivorous mammals, such as golden moles and elephant shrews. The common ancestry of these animals, along with aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants, and sea cows in the group Afrotheria, was not recognized until the late 1990s. Continuing work on the molecular and morphological diversity of afrotherian mammals has provided ever increasing support for their common ancestry.|$|E
40|$|Murine typhus	 case	 was	 initially	 identified	 in	 Reunion, France,	 in	 2012 	in	a	tourist. Our	investigation	confirmed	 8 {{autochthonous}} cases	 that	occurred	during	January	 2011 – January 2013 	in	Reunion. Murine	typhus	should	be	consid-ered in	 local	 patients	 and	 in	 travelers	 returning	 from	Re-union who	have	fevers	of	unknown	origin. Murine typhus, {{an acute}} zoonotic infection caused by Rickettsia typhi (1), occurs worldwide. It is under-diagnosed and largely underreported {{because of its}} non-specific characteristics and frequently mild course, a lack of active monitoring; and limited awareness among physi-cians (2). Symptoms include fever, headache, and inconsis-tent and transient rashes (1, 3). Serious complications {{have been associated with}} acute infections (4). The death rate is generally low but can reach 4 % without the use of anti-bacterial drugs (1, 4). The classic cycle involves rats (black rat [Rattus rattus] and brown rat [R. norvegicus]) in urban areas and the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis (3). However, mu-rine typhus is also documented in suburban areas, where opossums, cats, dogs, and their fleas coexist (3). Reunion is a French overseas territory of 2, 512 km 2 in the southwestern Indian Ocean, 700 km east of Madagas-car, and has a tropical climate. Most of its 850, 000 resi-dents live in coastal areas where major towns are located. Invasive rodents (rats, including the black rat, mice, and shrews) and endemic rodents (i. e., the <b>tailless</b> <b>tenrec</b> [Ten-rec ecaudatus]) are present both in rural and urban settings (5). X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis fleas are present mainly on rats, but their presence and their abundance vary accord-ing to the local climates of the island and to the seasons (6). Stray dogs and feral cats are numerous in the island and often are infested with fleas. In addition, domestic dogs and cats traditionally are allowed to run freely in both urban and rural areas. In early 2012, murine typhus was reported in a tourist returning from Reunion (7). We conducted a study to col-lect epidemiologic data and to describe clinical manifesta-tions for all murine typhus cases diagnosed in the infectious disease departments of hospitals in Reunion...|$|E
