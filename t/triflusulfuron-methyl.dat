40|$|Fluorinated {{non-ionic}} surfactants were assessed as adjuvants for tribenuron-methyl, <b>triflusulfuron-methyl</b> and foramsulfuron. The compared adjuvants included hydroxy-terminated fluorinated polyether (PF- 151 N), poly- oxyethylene-alpha-fluoro-omega-(2 -hydroxyethyl) poly(difluoromethylene) (Zonyl FSN- 100), and polyoxyethyl- ene(23) lauryl ether (Brij 35). Greenhouse experiments {{were performed to}} evaluate these surfactants both for their efficacy in controlling weeds and selectivity to crops. Tribenuron-methyl and <b>triflusulfuron-methyl</b> absorp- tion into catchweed and giant foxtail leaves due to surfactant addition was also estimated. Zonyl FSN- 100 and Brij 35 allowed {{a reduction in the}} application rate of <b>triflusulfuron-methyl</b> to nearly 1 / 2 of the labelled rate to control redroot pigweed. The foramsulfuron rate was reduced by more than 50 % to control barnyardgrass thanks to the addition of Zonyl FSN- 100 and it controlled giant foxtail only applied at the maximum labelled rate and mixed with Zonyl FSN- 100. Tribenuron-methyl activity against poppy was only slightly enhanced by the use of adjuvants. Tribenuron-methyl efficacy was clearly enhanced by the use of adjuvants to control catchweed; how- ever, the required dose was not lower than the labelled one. The addition of adjuvants induced slight phytotoxic- ity in the crops. Brij 35 caused the greatest absorption of <b>triflusulfuron-methyl</b> into giant foxtail leaves and of tribenuron-methyl into catchweed leaves...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{are exposed}} to {{multiple}} residues of different pesticides via the diet. Therefore, EU legislation for pesticides requires the evaluation of single active substances {{as well as the}} consideration of combination effects. Hence the analysis of combined effects of substances in a broad dose range represents a key challenge to current experimental and regulatory toxicology. Here we report evidence for additive effects for (tri) azole fungicides, a widely used group of antifungal agents, in the human placental cell line Jeg- 3. In addition to the triazoles cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, flusilazole and tebuconazole and the azole fungicide prochloraz also pesticides from other chemical classes assumed to act via different modes of action (i. e., the organophosphate chlorpyrifos and the triazinylsulfonylurea herbicide <b>triflusulfuron-methyl)</b> were investigated. Endpoints analysed include synthesis of steroid hormone production (progesterone and estradiol) and gene expression of steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic cytochrome-P- 450 (CYP) enzymes. For the triazoles and prochloraz, a dose dependent inhibition of progesterone production was observed and additive effects could be confirmed for several combinations of these substances in vitro. The non-triazoles chlorpyrifos and <b>triflusulfuron-methyl</b> did not affect this endpoint and, in line with this finding, no additivity was observed when these substances were applied in mixtures with prochloraz. While prochloraz slightly increased aromatase expression and estradiol production and <b>triflusulfuron-methyl</b> decreased estradiol production, none of the other substances had effects on the expression levels of steroidogenic CYP-enzymes in Jeg- 3 cells. For some triazoles, prochloraz and chlorpyrifos a significant induction of CYP 1 A 1 mRNA expression and potential combination effects for this endpoint were observed. Inhibition of CYP 1 A 1 mRNA induction by the AhR inhibitor CH 223191 indicated AhR receptor dependence this effect...|$|E

40|$|The Clearfield® {{production}} system for winter oilseed rape is now registered in France and a introduction for Germany is planned. In this {{production system}}, imidazolinone herbicides are used. These herbicides {{belong to the}} same mode of action (HRAC group B) as the active ingredient <b>triflusulfuron-methyl</b> in the herbicide Debut®. Therefore, a reduced efficacy of this active ingredient for the control of Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape is expected. Today non-Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape in sugar beets is effectively controlled with triflusufuronmethyl. Due to the fact that oilseed rape and sugar beet are increasingly cultivated in the same crop rotation, Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape could be expected in future sugar beet crop rotations. To determine the performance of different herbicide treatments for a sufficient control of Clearfield® volunteer oilseed rape in sugar beet, in 2010 and 2011 14 field-trials were conducted in four countries, Germany, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. These trials had been set up in a two way split-plot design with non-Clearfield®-rape and Clearfield® oilseed rape. The effects of ten treatments with different herbicides and application dates were tested. The results of both years showed large differences in the herbicide efficacy among the herbicide treatments. Pre-emergence application led to insufficient results in both years on both cultivars. Applied post-emergence, the herbicide treatment with Debut® (<b>triflusulfuron-methyl)</b> controlled non-Clearfield® volunteer rape considerable better, than the Clearfield® volunteer rape. A combination of herbicides in addition with Venzar® (Lenacil) provided good control of volunteer Clearfield® oilseed rape...|$|E

The combination of a leave with a soil active ingredient controls successfully typical broadleaf weeds as well as hard to control weeds like volunteer oilseed rape (Brassica napus), knotweeds (Polygonum ssp.), fool's parsley (Aethusa cynapium) and cleavers (Galium aparine). Debut®DuoActive is an excellent partner for standard tankmixes based on the active ingredients Phen/-desmedipham, ethofumesate und metamitron. As part of a herbicide program Debut®DuoActive helps to improve significantly the efficiency of standard herbicide tankmixes and reduces the necessity of possible subsequent treatment.

40|$|In 1998 a {{co-operation}} {{was initiated}} between DuPont and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) {{with the aim}} of generating knowledge on environmental behaviour of sulfonylurea (SU) herbicides under Swedish agricultural conditions. Results from a 9 -year monitoring programme of SU herbicides in surface waters are presented. The report includes the analytical results from 536 samples collected during 1998 to 2006 from up to 4 intensively cultivated agricultural catchments in the southern portion of Sweden. The following seven SU herbicides were included: chlorsulfuron, flupyrsulfuronmethyl- sodium, metsulfuron-methyl, rimsulfuron, thifensulfuron-methyl, tribenuron-methyl and <b>triflusulfuron-methyl.</b> Results on detection frequency and concentration levels are presented and related to amounts applied in the investigated areas {{as well as to the}} Swedish Guideline Values (GV) for surface waters. The application of SU herbicides to a variety of crops was quite comprehensive during the 9 - year investigation period, with tribenuron-methyl being the most extensively used herbicide on 16 - 33 % of the arable catchment area each year. Thifensulfuron-methyl was the secondly most widespread SU herbicide. Analytical results showed that SU herbicides were occasionally detected in stream water draining intensively cultivated areas in Sweden (on average in 13 % of the samples collected each year). These findings were essentially restricted to samples collected during or shortly after the main application season. The level of detected concentration was typically in the 0. 01 - 0. ...|$|E
