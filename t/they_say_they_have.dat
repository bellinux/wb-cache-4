500|$|As a subplot, Stan {{spends most}} of the episode trying to return the {{aforementioned}} Margaritaville mixer; the trendy retailer Sur La Table will not accept the return because it was bought on a payment plan. He tries to find out to whom he can return it, each person saying the debt has been packaged and sold to someone else (much like real-life mortgage-backed securities). Eventually he {{goes all the way}} to the United States Treasury, where a group of associates [...] "consult the charts" [...] and tell him the mixer is worth $90 trillion. One of the three treasury workers then says that another insurance company is failing and asks what they should do. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to [...] "consult the charts" [...] again. Stan follows the men inside, and he sees a round lit-up game show style board, where the men cut off a chicken's head and let the decapitated chicken run on the board while one of them plays a tune similar to Yakety Sax on a kazoo. The chicken falls on the [...] "bailout!" [...] spot, so that is what the men do. In anger at the ridiculousness of the system, Stan breaks the mixer on the platform by the chicken and walks off.|$|E

2500|$|The {{physicists}} Günter Nimtz and Alfons Stahlhofen, of the University of Cologne, {{claim to}} have violated relativity experimentally by transmitting photons faster {{than the speed of}} light. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> conducted an experiment in which microwave photons — relatively low-energy packets of light — travelled [...] "instantaneously" [...] between a pair of prisms that had been moved up to [...] apart.

Nimtz has also claimed that [...] "evanescent modes are not fully describable by the Maxwell equations and quantum mechanics have to be taken into consideration." [...] Other scientists such as Herbert G.

2500|$|Explorer James Bruce, {{who visited}} the Ethiopian Highlands c. 1770, wrote of [...] "a {{tradition}} among the Abyssinians, which <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> had since time immemorial", that {{in the days after}} the Deluge, Cush, the son of Ham, traveled with his family up the Nile until they reached the Atbara plain, then still uninhabited, from where they could see the Ethiopian table-land. There they ascended and built Axum, and sometime later returned to the lowland, building Meroë. He also states that European scholars of his own day had summarily rejected this account on grounds of their established theory, that Cush must have arrived in Africa via Arabia and the Bab-el-Mandeb, a strait located between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, and Djibouti and Eritrea on the Horn of Africa. Further, the great obelisk of Axum was said to have been erected by Cush in order to mark his allotted territory, and his son Ityopp'is was said to have been buried there, according to the Book of Aksum, which Bruce asserts was revered throughout Abyssinia equally with the Kebra Nagast.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the charges}} brought against Manstein were almost {{identical}} to those brought against Rundstedt, it is worth quoting the remarks made by the prosecutor at Manstein's trial, Sir Arthur Comyns Carr: [...] "Contemporary German militarism flourished briefly with its recent ally, National Socialism, as well as or better than {{it had in the}} generals of the past. Many of these have made a mockery of the soldier's oath of obedience to military orders. When it suits their purpose <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to obey; when confronted with Hitler's brutal crimes which are shown to have been within their general knowledge, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> disobeyed.

That transition happened, in part, due to accusations by the Diamond Sangha Teachers Circle.

This break was also in part due to Tarrant's experimental and unorthodox approach to Koan work and differences in the two organization's visions of Western Zen.|$|R
