25|$|Coal {{comes in}} four main types or ranks: lignite or brown coal, {{bituminous}} coal or black coal, anthracite and graphite. Each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> {{has a certain}} set of physical parameters which are mostly controlled by moisture, volatile content (in terms of aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons) and carbon content.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash: A {{by-product}} of coal-fired electric generating plants, {{it is used}} to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 60% by mass).

25|$|Wegner {{suggests}} {{that a combination of}} naval ship design, and a change in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maines building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With {{an increase in the number}} of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maines explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.|$|E

2500|$|This {{is because}} coal stoves are {{fitted with a}} grate so {{allowing}} part of the combustion air to be admitted below the fire. The proportion of air admitted above/below the fire depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal.</b> Brown coal and lignites [...] evolve more combustible gases than say anthracite and so need more air above the fire.
