40|$|As {{part of the}} Sustaining Engineering {{program for}} the International Space Station (ISS), a ground {{simulator}} of the Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS) in the Lab Module was designed and built at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). To support prediction and troubleshooting, this facility is operationally and functionally similar to the flight system and flight-like components were used when available. Flight software algorithms, implemented using the LabVIEW(Registered Trademark) programming language, were used for monitoring performance and controlling operation. Validation testing of the low <b>temperature</b> <b>loop</b> was completed prior to activation of the Lab module in 2001.

40|$|The {{timescale}} {{for energy}} release {{is an important}} parameter for constraining the coronal heating mechanism. Observations of “warm ” coronal loops (∼ 1 MK) have indicated that the heating is impulsive and that coronal plasma is far from equilibrium. In contrast, observations at higher temperatures (∼ 3 MK) have generally been consistent with steady heating models. Previous observations, however, {{have not been able}} to exclude the possibility that the high <b>temperature</b> <b>loops</b> are actually composed of many small scale threads that are in various stages of heating and cooling and only appear to be in equilibrium. With new observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and X-ray Telescope (XRT) on Hinode we have the ability to investigate the properties of high temperature coronal plasma in extraordinary detail. We examine the emission in the core of an active region and find three independent lines of evidence for steady heating. We find that the emission observed in XRT is generally steady for hours, with a fluctuation level of approximately 15 % in an individual pixel. Furthermore, we find no evidence for warm emission that is spatially correlated with the hot emission, as would be expected if the high <b>temperature</b> <b>loops</b> are the result of impulsive heating. Finally, we also find that intensities in the “moss, ” the footpoints of high <b>temperature</b> <b>loops,</b> are consistent with steady heating models provided that we account for the local expansion of the loop from the base of transition region to the corona. In combination, these results provide strong evidence that the heating in the core of an active region is effectively steady, that is, the heating occurs on very short timescales relative to the relevant radiative and conductive cooling times...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} and damping of slow magnetoacoustic {{waves in}} the solar atmosphere is investigated, with particular emphasis placed on waves with periodicities of five minutes. The basic model of a uniform <b>temperature</b> <b>loop</b> is extended {{by the addition of}} an equilibrium temperature gradient allowing study of wave propagation from the transition region to the corona. The inclusion of thermal conduction produces a phase shift between the perturbations in velocity, density and temperature, which for a non-uniform equilibrium temperature varies along the loop and may be observable as a phase shift between intensity and Doppler shift observations. Forward modelling of the simulation results, for both constant and non-constant equilibrium temperature profiles, is undertaken in order to establish the observational consequences for TRACE, SoHO/CDS and Hinode/EIS. Slow waves propagating in a non-uniform equilibrium <b>temperature</b> <b>loop</b> are seen to damp rapidly in the corona, however, {{as a result of the}} ionisation balance, the inclusion of damping can actually increase the amplitude of some parts of the oscillation. The ability of several data analysis techniques to identify oscillation signatures are examined. In particular, empirical mode decomposition was found to be a very useful technique for extracting oscillations from a wide range of data sets and is capable of intrinsically determining background trends. Co-spatial and cotemporal TRACE 171 A, CDS and EIS data are analysed for evidence of propagating slow waves. Slow waves with periods of 210 s to 370 s are found with amplitudes of 1. 2...|$|E

40|$|Nickel {{and iron}} mixed oxide Abstract. The {{condition}} of a heat transfer surface with boiling {{is composed of}} three environmental components; high temperature, high pressure and water vapor. In general an autoclave or a high <b>temperature</b> <b>loop</b> system is used for maintaining the required condition. The thermodynamic relationship of chemical reactions states that the free energy difference (∆G) is clearly dependent on the reaction temperature and independent of the reaction pressure if the reaction has no volume change: (∂∆G/∂P) T = ∆V ~ 0. Based on the above relationship, the high-pressure term {{was removed from the}} environmental components of the heat transfer surface. A vacuum quartz capsule with a moisturized metal oxide powder was used to study the formation of nickel ferrite.

40|$|The Fluids and Combustion Facility (FCF) {{will become}} an ISS {{facility}} capable of performing basic combustion and fluids research.

In the implementation of a design solution, significant factors in the selection of the hardware included ability to measure and control relatively low flow rates, ability to throttle flow within the time constraints of the ISS MTL, conserve energy usage, observe low mass and small volume requirements.

40|$|We present {{observations}} of high temperature emission {{in the core}} of a solar active region using instruments on Hinode and SDO. These multi-instrument observations allow us to determine the distribution of plasma temperatures and follow the evolution of emission at different temperatures. We find that at the apex of the high <b>temperature</b> <b>loops</b> the emission measure distribution is strongly peaked near 4 MK and falls off sharply at both higher and lower temperatures. Perhaps most significantly, the emission measure at 0. 5 MK is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude from the peak at 4 MK. We also find that the temporal evolution in broad-band soft X-ray images is relatively constant over about 6 hours of observing. Observations in the cooler SDO/AIA bandpasses generally do not show cooling loops {{in the core of}} the active region, consistent with the steady emission observed at high temperatures. These observations suggest that the high <b>temperature</b> <b>loops</b> observed in the core of an active region are close to equilibrium. We find {{that it is possible to}} reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission lines with a simple, high-frequency heating scenario where heating events occur on time scales much less than a cooling time. In contrast, low-frequency heating scenarios, which are commonly invoked to describe nanoflare models of coronal heating, do not reproduce the relative intensities of high temperature emission lines and predict low-temperature emission that is approximately an order of magnitude too large.

40|$|The {{selection}} of a good control structure for a distillation column {{is important for the}} plant operation because it can affect its operability. In this work, it is studied the control structure {{selection of}} a deethanizer distillation column from Mongstad/Statoil. This is a multicomponent distillation column with a partial condenser and a vapor distillate flow. Having a very small distillate flow rate (1 % of the feed flow rate), this column presents some difficulties for pressure control. The simulations are done in ASPEN Plus and ASPEN Dynamics. The main objective is to find a structure that minimizes the effect of the disturbances and implementation error (noise and bias) in the top and bottom compositions (indirect composition control). The results show that it is better to control temperatures in the top section where the gains are higher and, as this is a multicomponent column, the two-point temperature control does not improve the control system performance, confirming the results obtained by Hori and Skogestad (2007 b). As the most important disturbance for this column is the feed flow rate, the results also show that we should ratio the available manipulated variables with feed flow to improve the control performance.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in using the}} pseudoelastic properties of NiTi wires in orthodontic practice arises chiefly from the expectation that they can afford low continuous forces at constant temperature. The reversion force developed by NiTi archwires depends, however, upon temperature since the superelastic force follows a Clausius-Clapeyron like equation. Actually the oral environment temperature is modified {{as a consequence of}} hot/cold liquid/solid intake in the temperature range 5 °- 55 °C, as previously evaluated. In the above-mentioned temperature range first results have already been obtained on the reversion force variation. Attention is focused here on the reversion force as a function of temperature under diffèrent fixed constraints. Tensile and 3 -point bending tests have been performed on NiTi orthodontic wires, adopted in orthodontic practice, starting at body temperature : loading and partial unloading have been performed in order to fix different constraint conditions corresponding to different states in orthodontic therapy.

40|$|Various {{approaches}} to Quantum Gravity such as Loop Quantum Gravity, Spin Foam Models and Tensor-Group Field theories use invariant tensors on a group, called intertwiners, {{as the basic}} building block of transition amplitudes. For the group SU(2) the contraction of these intertwiners {{in the pattern of}} a graph produces what are called spin network amplitudes, which also have various applications and a long history. We construct a generating functional for the exact evalutation of a coherent representation of these spin network amplitudes. This generating functional is defined for arbitrary graphs and depends only on a pair of spinors for each edge. The generating functional is a meromorphic polynomial in the spinor invariants which is determined by the cycle structure of the graph. The expansion of the spin network generating function is given in terms of a newly recognized basis of SU(2) intertwiners consisting of the monomials of the holomorphic spinor invariants. This basis is labelled by the degrees of the monomials and is thus discrete. It is also overcomplete, but contains the precise amount of data to specify points in the classical space of closed polyhedra, and is in this sense coherent. We call this new basis the discrete-coherent basis. We focus our study on the 4 -valent basis, which is the first non-trivial dimension, and is also the case of interest for Quantum Gravity. We find simple relations between the new basis, the orthonormal basis, and the coherent basis. The 4 -simplex amplitude in the new basis depends on 20 spins and {{is referred to as the}} 20 j symbol. We show that by simply summing over five of the extra spins produces the 15 j symbol of the orthonormal basis. On the other hand, the 20 j symbol is the exact evaluation of the coherent 4 -simplex amplitude. The asymptotic limit of the 20 j symbol is found to give a generalization of the Regge action to Twisted Geometry. By this we mean the five glued tetrahedra in the 4 -simplex have different shapes when viewed from different frames. The imposition of the matching of shapes is known to be related to the simplicity constraints in spin foam models. Finally we discuss the process of coarse graining moves at the level of the generating functionals and give a general prescription for arbitrary graphs.
