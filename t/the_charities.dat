5|$|After the {{planning}} approval was granted, local residents hired barristers to consider an appeal against the decision.

50|$|A charity gift card {{allows a}} gift giver {{to make a}} {{charitable}} donation that the gift recipient may direct to <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> of their choice. Although a charity gift card has many similarities to a store gift card, a charity gift card functions quite differently. A charity gift card is an indicator of control over a small donor advised fund. The purchaser of <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> gift card creates the donor advised fund with <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> gift card purchase money. When <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> gift card recipient “spends” the gift card, the recipient is in actuality advising the holder of the associated donor advised fund (typically <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> that issued <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> gift card) to send the money to <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> that <b>the</b> <b>charity</b> gift card recipient selects.|$|R

Rowling's contribution was an 800-word Harry Potter prequel that concerns Harry's father, James Potter, and godfather, Sirius Black, and takes place three years before Harry was born. The cards were collated and sold for charity in book form in August 2008.|$|E

5|$|After {{overturning}} a two-goal {{deficit to}} beat Woolwich Arsenal 4–3 {{in a friendly}} at Plumstead, Small Heath took on Aston Villa in their last match of the season, {{the final of the}} Birmingham Charity Cup. Unfortunately for <b>the</b> <b>charities,</b> the weather was poor and the attendance low, but those spectators present saw an exciting game.

Mobley tied the scores with a long shot, but in the second half with the wind behind them, Villa scored three times to Jack Hallam's one to take the match 5–3.|$|E

5|$|Both the High Court and <b>the</b> <b>Charities</b> Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E

5|$|In his will, Sylvester had {{declared}} that royalties {{from the future}} sale of this music be devoted to two HIV/AIDS charities, Project Open Hand and the AIDS Emergency Fund. Although Sylvester died deeply in debt {{as a result of}} taking advances on his royalties, by the early 1990s this debt had been paid off, and a balance had begun to build up. Roger Gross, the attorney to Sylvester's manager and the openly gay lawyer who helped him draw up his will, petitioned the probate court to designate <b>the</b> <b>charities</b> as the beneficiaries of Sylvester's will. The proceeds of $140,000 in accrued royalties were split between the two groups, and they will continue to be paid the royalties in the future.|$|E
