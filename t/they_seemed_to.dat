5|$|In 1895, Lorentz more {{generally}} explained Fresnel's coefficient {{based on the}} concept of local time. However, Lorentz's theory had the same fundamental problem as Fresnel's: a stationary aether contradicted the Michelson–Morley experiment. So in 1892 Lorentz proposed that moving bodies contract in the direction of motion (FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction hypothesis, since George FitzGerald had already arrived in 1889 at this conclusion). The equations that he used to describe these effects were further developed by him until 1904. These are now called the Lorentz transformations in his honor, and are identical in form to the equations that Einstein was later to derive from first principles. Unlike Einstein's equations, however, Lorentz's transformations were strictly ad hoc, their only justification being that <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E

5|$|Six {{minutes into}} the match, Ronny Johnsen fouled Bayern striker Carsten Jancker just outside the area, and Mario Basler placed a low free kick around the United wall to score the first goal. Contrary to popular belief, the free kick was not a deflection, but rather swerved into the far bottom corner of Peter Schmeichel's goal. Despite the bad start, United began to {{dominate}} possession but failed to create any clear cut chances despite David Beckham's tireless running. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be badly missing influential midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. The Bayern defence remained strong and well organised, as Andy Cole found out when his close-range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders. As Bayern began to look increasingly more dangerous on the counter-attack than their opponents did in possession, Jancker repeatedly tested the United back four {{with a number of}} clever runs, some of which were flagged offside.|$|E
5|$|Stocks were {{increased}} by animals transferred from other zoos {{that had been}} forced to close. Initially the zoo was given favourable food rationing quotas, but certain foods became unavailable and the price of others increased dramatically. Bananas were impossible to obtain and the supply of fish was problematic. As a result, the keepers were forced to experiment. The sealions became casualties of the food shortage when their keepers attempted to feed them strips of beef soaked in cod liver oil. Although <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> thrive on this diet, their digestive systems were unable to cope with the unusual food, and they eventually died of stomach ulcers. The lions' new diet was green-coloured horsemeat, and the monkeys were fed on boiled potatoes. The birds-of-paradise (lack of millet), and the penguins (lack of fish), were unable to adapt to their make-do diet and also succumbed. Vegetables were not in short supply however, as the garden staff grew lettuce, cabbage and carrots in the kitchen gardens.|$|E
5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> confirm that the siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but}} to receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded to hear from the popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E

25|$|Warcraft III {{takes place}} in the fictional world of Azeroth. Several years before the events of the games, a demon army known as the Burning Legion intent on Azeroth's {{destruction}} corrupted a race called the Orcs, and sent them through a portal to attack Azeroth. After many years of fighting, the Orcs were defeated by a coalition of humans, dwarves and elves known as the Alliance; the surviving combatants were herded into internment camps, where <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> lose their lust for battle. With no common enemy, a period of peace followed, but the Alliance began to fracture. The events of Warcraft III occur after a timeskip from Warcraft II. This period was originally intended to have been documented in , but that game was canceled in mid-development.|$|E

Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.|$|E
25|$|In Flanders, {{this period}} {{started with the}} {{appearance}} of two new successful newspaper comics, Bakelandt by Hec Leemans and the extremely successful Kiekeboe by Merho. But <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be {{at the same time the}} final successes of a slowly dying system, and comics in Flanders are more and more centered around albums as well. Successful series and authors are few and far between, and most, like Urbanus or F. C. De Kampioenen, are only a local success. A few peripheral figures like Ever Meulen, who is mainly an illustrator, or Kamagurka, who is more of a cartoonist, do become successful in Wallonia, France and the Netherlands, but apart from those exceptions, the main method for Flemish comics artists to become successful is still being published by the three French language publishers.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} an {{excellent}} first round in 2016–17, losing only once in 23 matches (against then-bottom club Newport County) and standing at second place. <b>They</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have guaranteed at least a play-off place, but a disastrous second round followed, with Carlisle winning just 4 of the next 21 games, losing 10 and dropping from 2nd to 10th in the standings, with two games to spare. However, a comeback home win against Newport County combined with favorable results elsewhere sent them back into play-off positions. Then, another comeback at play-off bound Exeter in the last game proved enough for a final position of 6th, and a play-off semifinal showdown with the same opponent. However, Exeter beat them 6–5 on aggregate to comdemn Carlisle to another season in League 2.|$|E

25|$|In January 2013, Kaspersky {{discovered}} the Red October malware, {{which had been}} used for widespread cyber-espionage for five years. It targeted political targets like embassies, nuclear sites, mostly in Europe, Switzerland and North America. The malware was likely written by Russian-speaking hackers and the exploits by Chinese hackers. That June, Kaspersky discovered NetTraveler, which it said was obtaining data on emerging technology from government targets and oil companies. Kaspersky did not identify who was behind it, but it was similar to other cyber-espionage coming from Beijing, China. Later that same year, Kaspersky discovered a hacker group it called Icefog after investigating an cybersecurity attack on a Japanese television company.
