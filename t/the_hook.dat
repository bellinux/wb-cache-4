5|$|An iron hook is affixed {{into the}} wall of the Castellania close to the pillory. According to tradition, <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> might have been used to lift the largest bell of the nearby Saint John's Co-Cathedral, but this is now {{regarded}} as unlikely. <b>The</b> <b>hook</b> was most probably used to secure prisoners to the Castellania's pillory. In 1803, Horatio Nelson allegedly passed through <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> in a dare, and <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> became known as Nelson's Hook after the Battle of Trafalgar. It became a tradition for Royal Navy sailors to bet and buy drinks for shipmates who managed to pass through <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Junior officers allegedly had a good chance of promotion if they passed through <b>the</b> <b>hook.</b> Brockman further claims that <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> was used to lift a cage at the pillory, with a person condemned to stay inside for public ridicule, allegedly another type of public degradation. <b>The</b> <b>hook</b> by itself is a sought after landmark; it is often found marked on modern contemporary maps and included on tourists booklets.|$|E

5|$|Wilton {{deployed}} {{the stronger}} Australian battalions forward, with 2 RAR occupying the left forward position on <b>The</b> <b>Hook,</b> while 3 RAR was deployed on the right, overlooking the Samichon River. 1 DLI {{was on the}} opposite side of the Samichon, while 1 RF was held in reserve as a brigade counter-penetration force. 2 RAR was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Larkin, while 3 RAR was under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur MacDonald. Larkin deployed 2 RAR with three companies forward, and one back in reserve as a counter-attack force. In the centre, <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> was held by B Company, while C Company held the left and A Company the right, with D Company in reserve. MacDonald deployed 3 RAR with two companies forward and two in depth. A Company occupied Hill 146, on the boundary with 2 RAR, B Company held the south-eastern tip of the ridge, and C and D Companies were held in reserve. British Centurion tanks were also deployed forward to support the Australians. Directly confronting the Australians on <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> was the 137th Division of the Chinese 46th Army which had been in the line since February 1953, under the command of Cheng Dengzhi.|$|E

Charring of the ablated tissue can cause the tissue to become caught {{in the space between}} <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> and <b>the</b> shaft or stick to <b>the</b> <b>hooks.</b> This can prevent withdrawal of <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> into <b>the</b> shaft and is therefore an important complication of which practitioners need to be aware...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>hooked</b> {{element in}} <b>the</b> pes of turtles was {{historically}} identified by most palaeontologists and embryologists as a modified fifth metatarsal, and {{often used as}} evidence to unite turtles with other reptiles with a hooked element. Some recent embryological studies, however, revealed that this element might represent an enlarged fifth distal tarsal. We herein provide extensive new myological and developmental observations on <b>the</b> <b>hooked</b> element of turtles, and re-evaluate its primary and secondary homology using all available lines of evidence. Digital count and timing of development are uninformative. However, extensive myological, embryological and topological data {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>hooked</b> element of turtles represents a fusion of the fifth distal tarsal with the fifth metatarsal, but that the fifth distal tarsal dominates <b>the</b> <b>hooked</b> element in pleurodiran turtles, whereas the fifth metatarsal dominates <b>the</b> <b>hooked</b> element of cryptodiran turtles. The term ‘ansulate bone’ is proposed to refer to hooked elements that result from the fusion of these two bones. The available phylogenetic and fossil data are currently insufficient to clarify the secondary homology of hooked elements within Reptilia...|$|R

Ken Cranston came on to bowl and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Chappell's battles {{against the}} short-pitched bowling of Snow {{during the season}} {{compelled}} him to reappraise his game. Following a conversation with Sir Donald Bradman, he decided to reinstate <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg. Although he still regularly lost his wicket after playing the shot, Chappell felt that the psychological benefit of showing aggression to opposing bowlers offset the times that he was dismissed for a low score.|$|E
50|$|The big {{breakthrough}} George de Mestral {{made was}} {{to think about}} hook-and-eye closures on a greatly reduced scale. Hook and eye fasteners have been common for centuries, but what was new about hook and loop fasteners was the miniaturisation of <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> and eyes. Shrinking <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> led to <b>the</b> two other important differences. Firstly, instead of a single-file line of hooks, touch fasteners have a two-dimensional surface. This was needed, because in decreasing the size of <b>the</b> <b>hooks,</b> <b>the</b> strength was also unavoidably lessened, thus requiring more <b>hooks</b> for <b>the</b> same strength. The other difference is that hook and loop has indeterminate match-up between <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> and eyes. With larger hook and eye fasteners, each hook has its own eye. On a scale as small as that of hook and loop fasteners, matching up each of these <b>hooks</b> with <b>the</b> corresponding eye is impractical, thus leading to the indeterminate matching.|$|R

30|$|It {{was judged}} {{that the effect}} of the delay between the {{collection}} and testing of <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> would have little effect on the relative performance of <b>the</b> <b>hooks</b> and probably little effect on the absolute performance of <b>the</b> individual <b>hooks</b> given that they were collected in a naturally desiccated state and maintained in a dry condition until ready for testing, thereby preventing/inhibiting decomposition. Their desiccated state also made them ready for SEM work.|$|R

5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the {{hymenium}} (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form {{a characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, formation of <b>the</b> <b>hook</b> ensures proper {{distribution of the}} newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis {{and the production of}} ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July B Company, 2 RAR was {{relieved}} on <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> by D Company, and subsequently moved into reserve. The following day, with the ceasefire {{believed to be}} imminent, Wilton limited patrols to only those considered essential {{for the security of}} his forward positions. Rumours spread quickly among the troops that the truce was expected to be signed on 26 July. However, by 24 July the Chinese shelling had once again grown in intensity, while large bodies of Chinese infantry were increasingly seen on the forward slopes by the Australians. Meanwhile, similar concentrations of Chinese were also reported by the US Marines. With the Chinese eager to gain a last-minute victory over the UN forces and the tactical advantage offered to the side that held <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> after the truce, simultaneous attacks were soon launched against 2 RAR and the US 7th Marine Regiment on the left flank, in two major actions on the nights of 24/25 and 25/26 July.|$|E

5|$|Patrolling by the Australians {{continued}} {{in order to}} prevent the Chinese from harassing their forward positions. Small clashes occurred on the nights of 15/16, 21/22, 22/23 and 23/24 July, suggesting that the Chinese were preparing for a major attack. Aerial reconnaissance subsequently detected a build up of Chinese forces and supplies west of the Samichon River. In response the Australians and US Marines stepped up their defensive preparations, {{while at the same time}} rumours from the peace talks started to spread of a ceasefire. Regardless, Chinese harassing artillery and mortar fire intensified, causing a constant stream of casualties among the Australians. Intense Chinese shelling struck Hill 121 and <b>The</b> <b>Hook</b> on the night of 19/20 July, with more than 300 rounds wounding four members of C Company, 2 RAR and further damaging the defences. That night the US Marines were driven off the Berlin and East Berlin features on the left flank, further exposing <b>The</b> <b>Hook,</b> which became a salient. Yet on 21 July an expected Chinese assault in the US 5th Marine Regiment sector failed to occur, while sightings of Chinese troops across the US 1st Marine Division front declined as the fighting entered a lull.|$|E
