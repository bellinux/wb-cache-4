With Mendelssohn's strong encouragement Bennett applied for the position. Mendelssohn wrote to {{the principal of the}} university, [...] "I beg you <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> powerful influence on behalf of that candidate whom I consider in every respect worthy of the place, a true ornament to his art and his country, and indeed one of the best and most highly gifted musicians now living: Mr. Sterndale Bennett." [...] Despite this advocacy Bennett's application was unsuccessful.|$|E

In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and you have got <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> brain {{a little bit more}} than in League One. It's developed me as a player because you need to learn how to perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E
500|$|The court then {{considered}} {{whether the}} accused had taken action that waived those rights. Waiver {{must be a}} free choice with full awareness (Moran v. Burbine). Miranda v. Arizona (the Miranda ruling) states that [...] " [...] heavy burden rests on the government {{to demonstrate that the}} defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel." [...] It was noted that the accused had read and expressed understanding of the rights, and had them read aloud, he had not pleaded lack of understanding, was given time, and therefore knew his rights. Specifically, having read the 5th warning ("you have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned") he was aware this right was enduring and could be applied {{at any time in the}} questioning if he chose, and the police would have to honor the invocation if he did so. The court observed that [...] "olice are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time". That a question is linked to religious beliefs does not cause the reply to be [...] "involuntary". The accused, understanding his rights and that they were capable of invocation at any point, had not chosen to invoke them.|$|E

500|$|Of all the {{elements}} of the series, Zombiepowder.s action sequences received the most feedback. The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by Anime News Network, with rough drawings and few backgrounds, though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission: elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began. ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent, kinetic, well-paced, easy to follow, and interspersed well with comedic moments. They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average, but with the disclaimer that the action was [...] "the entire sum and substance" [...] of the series. IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume's flap: [...] "The theme is fighting. Sitting there and just reading it without thinking is fine. But if you ever feel like it please try <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> mind as you read," [...] and said that if this advice was taken Zombiepowder. could be a [...] "great shōnen tale", but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series. Gorban's view was again the most positive, stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other, and that the series grasped this notion admirably. Finally, Den of Geek found Zombiepowder.s [...] "wall-to-wall" [...] action sequences colorful and fun, but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story.|$|E
500|$|The Berlin Wall, {{like the}} much longer inner German border between East and West Germany, was {{designed}} with two purposes in mind: to obstruct would-be border-crossers and to enable border guards {{to detect and}} stop illegal border crossings. In its final form, the [...] wall consisted of inner and outer concrete walls separated by a [...] "death strip" [...] some [...] to [...] wide. [...] It was guarded by around 11,500 Grenztruppen, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic who were authorised to use any means necessary, including firearms, to prevent border breaches. [...] The shooting orders, or Schießbefehl, issued to the border guards instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals, and {{that the use of}} deadly force was required to deal with them: [...] "Do not hesitate <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used". [...] Some guards have since claimed that the motto at the time was [...] "a dead refugee is better than an escaped one". At first, wounded or shot refugees were left out in the open until they were removed, so that people from West Berlin and the western press could see them as well. After the reactions to the public death of Peter Fechter, border guards were ordered to move any casualties out of West Berlin's field of view. Negative reporting was sought to be prevented. Because of this, border guards often pulled people down into the car-moat {{that was part of the}} whole border security system. In some cases, the removal of the body was done only after nightfall.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2005, {{following}} {{a meeting of}} Anglicans of the [...] "global south" [...] in Cairo at which Williams had addressed them in conciliatory terms, 12 primates who had been present sent him a letter sharply criticising his leadership which said that [...] "We are troubled by your reluctance <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> moral authority to challenge the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Church of Canada." [...] The letter acknowledged his eloquence but strongly criticised his reluctance to take sides in the communion's theological crisis and urged him to make explicit threats to those more liberal churches. Questions were later asked about the authority and provenance of the letter as two additional signatories' names had been added although they had left the meeting before it was produced. Subsequently, the Church of Nigeria appointed an American cleric to deal with relations between the United States and Nigerian churches outside the normal channels. Williams expressed his reservations about this to the General Synod of the Church of England.|$|E

He and Warner did not file suit against Paramount, largely because Straczynski didn't see it as a productive option, with negative repercussions for both TV series. In 1993 he responded to a Deep Space Nine fan who saw the lack of legal action as proof that Straczynski's allegation was unfounded, [...] "If there is any (<b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> term) winking and nudging going on, it's on the level of 'Okay, YOU (Paramount) know what happened, and *I* know what happened, but let's try to be grownup about it for now,' though I must say that the shapechanging thing nearly tipped me back over the edge again.

2500|$|Rubin first {{conceived}} of the dating aspect for the film, [...] "being able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>your</b> superior knowledge {{to pick up}} women", {{which led to the}} film to lean more into the comedy side. He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but that had little fanfare, which the film could be played annually similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman. Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and [...] "rules" [...] for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.|$|E
