5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a death row inmate. At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum <b>to</b> <b>mandate</b> that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did not carry health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state <b>to</b> <b>mandate</b> universal health insurance. Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E

5|$|In January 2003, Obama became {{chairman}} of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state <b>to</b> <b>mandate</b> videotaping of homicide interrogations. During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March, Tirpitz, {{escorted by}} three destroyers, {{launched}} {{a raid on}} the British convoys to the Soviet Union. The Germans attempted to intercept convoys PQ-12 and QP-8, but the inclement weather prevented them from finding the convoys. The British located Tirpitz, and the aircraft carrier Victorious launched a strike of twelve Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers. The aircraft were repulsed without having scored any hits on the German ships. Tirpitz and the destroyers were back in port by 12 March. The close call prompted Hitler <b>to</b> <b>mandate</b> that Tirpitz was not to attack another convoy unless its escorting aircraft carrier had been sunk or disabled.|$|E
5|$|Campaigning on a {{platform}} of progressive reforms, McCreary defeated Republican Edward C. O'Rear in the general election. During this second term, he became the first inhabitant of the state's second (and current) governor's mansion; he is also the only governor to have inhabited both the old and new mansions. During his second term, he succeeded in convincing the legislature to make women eligible to vote in school board elections, <b>to</b> <b>mandate</b> direct primary elections, to create a state public utilities commission, and to allow the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or not}} to adopt prohibition. He also realized substantial increases in education spending and won passage of reforms such as a mandatory school attendance law, but was unable to secure passage of laws restricting lobbying in the legislative chambers and providing for a workers' compensation program. McCreary was one of five commissioners charged with overseeing construction of the new governor's mansion and exerted considerable influence on the construction plans. His term expired in 1915, and he died three years later. McCreary County was formed during McCreary's second term in office and was named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|The delegates {{voted to}} address the {{platform}} before deciding on nominees, and debate began when they reconvened at 8:45p.m. Many fights and compromises had been hashed out in the Resolutions Committee already, but the delegates insisted on debating several provisions. On many planks, there was widespread agreement among the delegates. On the monetary issue, the platform declared that all money, whether metal or paper, should be issued by the government, not by banks (as was common for paper money at the time). They also called for the unlimited coinage of silver and the repayment of the national debt in bonds, rather than gold dollars. Other planks of the platform called for a graduated income tax, laws <b>to</b> <b>mandate</b> safe working conditions in factories, the regulation of interstate commerce, {{and an end to}} child and convict labor; all of these were familiar parts of Greenback platforms from earlier elections, and provoked no serious dissent.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of unrated games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made <b>to</b> <b>mandate</b> the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000–2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{constructs}} an {{asymmetric information}} model {{to investigate the}} efficiency and equity cases for government mandated benefits.

It is shown that adverse effects can be mitigated by restricting <b>mandates</b> <b>to</b> "large" firms. An alternative <b>to</b> a <b>mandate</b> is direct government provision.
