25|$|Many inventors {{lived in}} Salem. Moses Farmer {{was the first}} to light his home by {{electricity}} and sold his lightbulb to Thomas Edison. Edison also used his arc lighting in his demonstrations. Farmer provided Tesla with his lightbulbs for Westinghouse after Edison refused to sell them his to light the Columbian Exposition World Fair of 1893. Farmer would die at the fair. Charles Grafton Page made an electromagnet that could lift 1,000 pounds, electric train, an early telegraph, and worked in the US patent office. He was a precursor to what would befall Tesla for his laboratory had burned down during the Civil War and the section of the Smithsonian which housed his magnet also burned at a later date. Joseph Dixon the inventor of high temperature graphite crucibles, the Single Reflex Lens, and the Dixon-Ticonderoga #2 pencil lived in Salem. Packard Electric were making electric cars in the nineteenth century up to the 1914 fire which destroyed their factory. Alexander Graham Bell invented <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> Salem and held the first public demonstration at the Salem Lyceum Hall. Also Nicola Tesla would create a power plant for Pequot Mills. He was in the area after Mark Twain introduced him to John Hammond Sr.. Tesla would give his son, John Hammond Jr. the patents for remote control which Hammond used to develop guided missiles and boats for the military during WWII. Tesla would conduct tests on ESP at Hammond Castle using a Faraday Cage to prove ESP did not transmit through electromagnetic waves, for a psychic received a message from a woman in the cage a few miles away. It was John Hammond Sr. who helped destroy Tesla's plans for free wireless electricity since he just invested heavily in a copper mine that was going to create electrical lines for transmission. Also Elihu Thomson had his Thomson-Houston Electric Company in the bordering town of Lynn and lived in the other border town Swampscott. This company will be merged with Edison Electric Company to make General Electric. Many of these Salem inventors' inventions are still displayed in the Smithsonian in the electricity display room.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} {{announced}} on 13 February 1992, {{a little more}} than two weeks before opening night on 29 February at Lakeland Civic Center in Lakeland, Florida.

While the band had toured North America every year between 1980 and 1987, they had been absent from the region's tour circuit for over four years before Zoo TV. The US concert business was in a slump at the time, and the routing of the first two legs generally allowed only one show per city.
