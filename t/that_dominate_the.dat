5|$|Trying to {{discover}} what happened to Marsh, Quatermass contacts Inspector Lomax (John Longden), who had previously assisted him (see The Quatermass Xperiment). Lomax puts him in touch with Vincent Broadhead (Tom Chatto), a Member of Parliament, who {{has been trying to}} uncover the veil of secrecy surrounding Winnerden Flats. Quatermass joins Broadhead on an official tour of the complex, which he is told has been built to manufacture artificial food. Slipping away from the visiting party, Broadhead attempts to get inside one of the large domes <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a poisonous black slime.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} decades of the Turkish Republic, the {{government}} (or banks established and owned by the government, such as Türkiye İş Bankası (1924), Sanayi ve Maadin Bankası (1925), Emlak ve Eytam Bankası (1926), Central Bank of Turkey (1930), Sümerbank (1933), İller Bankası (1933), Etibank (1935), Denizbank (1937), Halk Bankası (1938), etc.) had to subsidise most of the industrial projects, due to the lack of a strong private sector. However, in the period between the 1920s and 1950s, a new generation of Turkish entrepreneurs such as Nuri Demirağ, Vehbi Koç, Hacı Ömer Sabancı and Nejat Eczacıbaşı began to establish privately owned factories, some of which evolved into the largest industrial conglomerates <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> Turkish economy today, such as Koç Holding, Sabancı Holding and Eczacıbaşı Holding.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the largest}} volcanoes like Mount St. Helens {{get the most}} attention, the Cascade Volcanic Arc is really {{made up of a}} band of {{thousands}} of very small, short-lived volcanoes that have built a platform of lava and volcanic debris.

25|$|The Telegraph Building is a six-story, flat-roofed office {{building}} faced with white terra cotta, constructed in 1913.

50|$|Economists {{debate whether}} a single reserve {{currency}} will always <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> global economy.

The argument is that, in the absence of sufficiently large shocks, a currency <b>that</b> <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> marketplace will not lose much ground to challengers.|$|R

25|$|Sydney {{real estate}} prices {{are some of the}} most {{expensive}} in the world, surpassing both New York City and Paris. There were 1.5 million dwellings in Sydney in 2006 including 940,000 detached houses and 180,000 semi-detached terrace houses. Units or apartments make up 25.8% of Sydney's dwellings, more than the 12.8% which are semi-detached but less than the 60.9% which are separate houses. Whilst terrace houses are common in the inner city areas, it is detached houses <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> landscape in the outer suburbs.|$|E

Another architectural monument of Brno is the functionalist Villa Tugendhat which has been included on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. One of the natural sights nearby is the Moravian Karst.|$|E
25|$|True {{intermediate}} and felsic {{rocks are}} present on Mars, but exposures are uncommon. Both TES and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have identified high silica rocks in Syrtis Major {{and near the}} southwestern rim of the crater Antoniadi. The rocks have spectra resembling quartz-rich dacites and granitoids, suggesting {{that at least some}} parts of the Martian crust may have a diversity of igneous rocks similar to Earth's. Some geophysical evidence suggests that the bulk of the Martian crust may actually consist of basaltic andesite or andesite. The andesitic crust is hidden by overlying basaltic lavas <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> surface composition but are volumetrically minor.|$|E
25|$|A {{consortium}} called Pacific LNG {{was formed}} to exploit the newly discovered reserves. The consortium comprised the British companies BG Group and BP, and Spain's Repsol YPF. Repsol {{is one of three}} companies <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> gas sector in Bolivia, along with Petrobras and Total. A plan costing US$6 billion was drawn to build a pipeline to the Pacific coast, where the gas would be processed and liquefied before being shipped to Mexico and the United States (Baja California and California), through a Chilean port, for example Iquique. The 2003 Lozada deal was opposed heavily by Bolivian society, in part because of nationalism (Bolivia feels resentment after the territorial losses of the War of the Pacific in the late 19th century, which deprived it of the Litoral province and hence access to the sea).|$|E

25|$|In 2000, the Dallas City Council {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} mandating that no vehicle can be operated as a taxicab {{within the city}} limits once it reaches five years from the date of manufacture. More recently, an effort spearheaded by Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert has begun to convert all taxicabs in Dallas to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). It has been alleged that the drive toward CNG taxis is consequence of a corrupt bargain among Dallas politicians and the large energy interests <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> business and civic circles of the city. To name one, Clean Energy, LP, the largest retail natural gas distributor in North Texas and majority-owned by T.

25|$|The type of soils <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> upland {{areas are}} Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with {{mountain}} soil undifferentiated {{found on the}} south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately friable, and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is friable and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Sta. Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.|$|E
25|$|Jacksonville is the 49th largest {{local radio}} {{market in the}} United States, and is {{dominated}} by the same two large ownership groups <b>that</b> <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> radio industry across the United States: Cox Radio and iHeartMedia. The dominant AM radio station in terms of ratings is WOKV 690AM, which is also the flagship station for the Jacksonville Jaguars. In May 2013, WOKV began simulcasting on 104.5 FM as WOKV FM. There are two radio stations broadcasting a primarily contemporary hits format; WAPE 95.1 has dominated this niche for over twenty years, and more recently has been challenged by WKSL 97.9 FM (KISS FM). WJBT 93.3 (The Beat) is a hip-hop/R station, 96.9 The Eagle WJGL operates a Classic Hits format while its HD subchannel WJGL-HD2 operates an Urban CHR format under the moniker Power 106.1, WWJK 107.3 is an Adult Variety station. WXXJ 102.9 is an alternative station, WQIK 99.1 is a country station as well as WGNE-FM 99.9, WCRJ FM 88.1/WSOS-FM 94.1 (The Promise) is the main Contemporary Christian music station operating since 1984, and WJCT 89.9 is the local National Public Radio affiliate. WJKV 90.9 FM is an Educational Media Foundation K-LOVE outlet. The NPR and PRX radio show, , hosted by performance poet and playwright, Al Letson, is headquartered and produced in Jacksonville.|$|E
