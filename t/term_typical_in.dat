40|$|We {{investigate}} the rapidly changing equilibrium between the momentum {{sources and sinks}} during {{the passage of a}} two-peak storm over the Catalan inner-shelf (NW Mediterranean Sea). Velocity measurements at 24 m water depth are taken as representative of the inner shelf, and the cross-shelf variability is explored with additional measurements at 50 m water depth. At 24 m, as the storm-related wind stress accelerated the flow, velocity increased throughout the water column, resulting in bottom stress starting to become important. The sea level also responded, with the pressure gradient force opposing the wind stress. In particular, during the second wind pulse, there were rapid oscillations in the acceleration and advective terms, apparently reflecting the incapacity of the bottom stress to dissipate the high kinetic energy of the system. The Coriolis and wave induced terms (via radiation stresses) were less important in the momentum balance. The frictional adjustment time scale was around 10 h, consistent with the e-folding time obtained from bottom drag parameterizations.

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) {{transformation}} {{to explore the}} variables that determine a firm’s R&D collaborative expenditure. The IHS specification is used to overcome the inconsistencies deriving from non-normality of error <b>terms</b> which are <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> censored data. This represents a novelty in R&D studies. The sample employed refers to 1231 Italian firms where the dependent variable under investigation is strongly skewed by the zero values and by the extreme observations. The results show that standard errors are smaller in the IHS model than in the more common logarithmic one. The analysis also shows that size and public grants are effective in determining the level of cooperative R&D expenditure. Absorptive capacity, outsourcing inputs or services externally and the industry, also play an important role...|$|R
40|$|The d-q {{transformation}} {{applied to}} three-phase balanced systems allows for convenient definitions of vectors, which {{are consistent with}} the usual notion of phasors in sinusoidal steady state. If harmonics are neglected, then the dynamic models of balanced power-electronic systems in the d-q variables are also time-invariant, which facilitates vector control design. Alternative definitions are required for single-phase systems and unbalanced three-phase systems, around which similar controllers can then be built. This paper presents a unified theoretical analysis of these definitions. Generalizations of the time-delay-based definition are presented, which are also shown to be amenable to vector control. The dynamic equations for zero-sequence components reveal that the strategy to avoid cross-coupling between in-phase and quadrature <b>terms</b> <b>in</b> <b>typical</b> vector-control schemes is applicable to the control of zero-sequence vector components as well...|$|R
40|$|In {{countries}} with a mature public broadcasting sector and where public broadcasting {{is being challenged}} by the multichannel and digital environment, there is a veritable avalanche of discourse aiming to ensure {{the future of the}} sector. Various key concepts are intoned like mantras—public service, public sphere, citizenship, democracy—as if by their very repeti-tion they had the power to hold hostile forces at bay. The present article examines just one of these—democracy—and suggests that the invocation of the <b>term</b> <b>in</b> <b>typical</b> defenses is at best imprecise and at worse outdated. Furthermore, in its devaluation of various forms of popular media, the typical defense ends up championing a set of media practices that are increas-ingly irrelevant.

40|$|We {{study the}} non-singlet sectors of matrix quantum {{mechanics}} (MQM) through an operator algebra which generates the spectrum. The algebra is a nonlinear {{extension of the}} W ∞ algebra where the nonlinearity comes from the angular part of the matrix {{which can not be}} neglected in the non-singlet sector. The algebra contains an infinite set of commuting generators which can be regarded as the conserved currents of MQM. We derive the spectrum and the eigenfunctions of these conserved quantities by a group theoretical method. An interesting feature of the spectrum of these charges in the non-singlet sectors is that they are identical to those of the singlet sector except for the multiplicities. We also derive the explicit form of these commuting charges in terms of the eigenvalues and show that the interaction <b>terms</b> which are <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> Calogero-Sutherland system appear. Finally we discuss the bosonization and rewrite the commuting charges in terms of a free boson together with a finite number of extra degrees of freedom for the non-singlet sectors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive method to calculate object to object diffuse reflections within complex environments containing hidden surfaces and shadows. In essence, each {{object in the}} environment is treated as a secondary light source. The method provides an accurate representation of the "diffuse " and "ambient" <b>terms</b> found <b>in</b> <b>typical</b> image synthesis algorithms. The phenomena of "color bleeding " from one surface to another, shading within shadow envelopes, and penumbras along shadow boundaries are accurately reproduced. Additional advantages result because computations are independent of viewer position. This a 11 ows the efficient rendering of multiple views of the same scene for dynamic sequences. Light sources can be modulated and object reflectivities can be changed, with minimal extra computation. The procedures extend the radiosity method beyond the bounds previously imposed...|$|R
30|$|Another {{continuing}} initiative will be lobbying the Secretariat for Agriculture (SAGARPA) {{for help}} in reducing the agricultural use of fire. The CONAFOR, according to its Forest Fire Manager (Alfredo Nolasco, Mexican National Forestry Commission, personal communication), develops the national fire management policies to move from prevention and fire fighting to fire management. The adoption of these policies by high level officials in the Mexican government’s Commissions on Forestry and Protected Areas, as well as Environment (SEMARNAT) and Agriculture Secretariats is still pending. The National Commission on Forestry is hoping that these officials, {{as well as the}} public, understand that fire management {{is an integral part of}} forest management and the conservation of biological diversity. The revision of the forestry law in Mexico is pending, although new regulations, such as the update of the official norm on use of fire (SEMARNAT 2009), incorporate broader elements that are closer to the national reality on the use of fire by rural communities, as well as to the fire ecology of its fire-maintained ecosystems. Another challenge is to transcend the six-year presidential <b>terms</b> so <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> Mexico because policies may change radically from one term to another. In addition, the capacity for fire management needs to be developed in the three levels of government: federal, state and municipal, and rural communities. It is important to incorporate the results of scientific research and the concept of fire regimes into the decision making process and to establish strategies on the short, middle, and long terms in order for society to understand and support fire management.|$|R

40|$|End of Project ReportFreeze-chilling {{involves}} {{freezing and}} frozen storage followed by thawing and chilled storage. Trials with whiting and mackerel fillets/portions (Part 1) indicated {{no difference in}} odour scores (raw samples) between freeze-chilled and chilled samples; however, freeze-chilled salmon portions were inferior to chilled in terms of odour. Fresh fillets received the highest acceptability scores as cooked samples followed by frozen, chilled and freeze-chilled fillets. Freshness indicators were {{the same for the}} three species. Freeze-chilled fillets had the highest free fatty acid and peroxide values but the levels were low and did not influence sensory response. The effects of the four treatments on the colour and texture of the raw fillets were small <b>in</b> practical <b>terms</b> and <b>typical</b> shelf-lives <b>in</b> the chill phase of the freeze-chill process were 3 to 5 days. In Part 2, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) was combined with freezechilling to further extend the shelf-life of raw whiting, mackerel and salmon fillets/portions. <b>Typical</b> shelf-lives <b>in</b> the chill phase for the freeze-chilled fillets were 5 (whiting and mackerel) and 7 (salmon) days. Good manufacturing practice coupled with HACCP and careful tempering (thawing) are essential for the successful freeze-chilling of raw fish fillets. Packs should be labelled ‘previously frozen’ for consumer information. It is concluded that freeze-chilling with MAP is a suitable technology for extending the shelf-life of raw fish fillets...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{stationary}} solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) systems have been developed that can generate electricity and heat from the energy stored in hydrogen or hydrocarbons with total efficiencies up to 95 %. While the mechanical cell support of stationary systems is commonly supplied by thick ceramic cell components (i. e. anode and electrolyte supported concepts), mobile systems demand a more robust design. This is ensured by a strong yet porous metallic substrate which serves as the mechanical backbone of thin film membrane electrode assemblies [metal supported cell (MSC) concept]. Porous PM Fe-Cr oxide dispersion strengthened alloys for use as MSC supports have recently been developed. These materials provide mechanical and chemical long <b>term</b> stability <b>in</b> <b>typical</b> SOFC atmospheres at operation temperatures up to 850 °C. The substrates support a multilayer anode-electrolyte-cathode thin film assembly, constituting a high performance MSC repeat unit.

A transportable setup was realized {{to be able to}} perform tests on site. An integrated x/y-translation stage allows to shift the object, in order to measure only areas of interest or to measure larger fields step by step. An easy-to-use method of calibration was found and realized, which allows to calibrate the sensor in all directions. For industrial applications an easy-to-use operation of the sensor, with the option of automation, {{is as important as the}} processing of the data gained by a measurement. Both has become possible by linking the coherence radar to a special control- and evaluation software. Since important applications for the system were found in the field of surface microtopology and roughness, the coherence radar was compared to tactile surface profilers; under certain conditions the sensor can perform this task.

40|$|Nagy, Á. : The Characteristics of Terminology of Sciences in {{relation}} to Family from {{point of view of}} Terminological Extraction According to Eugen Wüster, terms are lexical units that belong to a scientific domain where they are connected to a concept that they denote; therefore, terms have to have a precise definition. In the term extraction process, terms can mainly be recognised by morphosyntactic patterns: for example, noun+noun is a <b>typical</b> <b>term</b> pattern <b>in</b> French (e. g. navigateur web). One of the aims {{of this article is to}} find the <b>typical</b> <b>term</b> patterns and their frequency in the domain of social sciences. For this reason, three articles were chosen as corpus in the social sciences domain with the criterion that they include frequently the words famille ’family’ and/or individu ’individual’. In the three articles, all terms were manually annotated. The other aim of this article is to compare the frequencies of the term patterns in social sciences with the results of previous research on terms of a corpus of computer science. The further aim of this analysis is to determine whether an automatic term extractor fine-tuned for texts on computer science could also be used on a corpus of social sciences. In order to achieve this goal, problematic patterns – like adjectives preceding the nominal head in a term – are also examined. The results showed that the IT corpus followed the same tendency as the corpus on human sciences; however, juxtaposed nouns are less frequent in the latter which prefers the noun-adjective sequence. Concerning the problematic patterns, the two corpora did not show important differences: their presence is minimal in both (7...|$|R
