5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are {{the location of}} star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September12. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September23, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in shower and thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another burst in convection occurred on September25, likely due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system, which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> development out to 48hours. The tropical wave split on September26, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September27, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation. Although TWOs issued on September27 predicted a high probability for development, the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.|$|E

25|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever virus, Rift Valley fever, Marburg {{virus and}} Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are highly {{contagious}} and deadly diseases, with the theoretical {{potential to become}} pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector, and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly quarantine vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the first}} public {{railways}} were built as local rail links operated by small private railway companies.

25|$|A {{precondition}} for further commercialization of GM forest trees {{is likely to}} be their complete sterility. Plantation trees remain phenotypically similar to their wild cousins in that most are the product of no more than three generations of artificial selection, therefore, the risk of transgene escape by pollination with compatible wild species is high. One of the most credible science-based concerns with GM trees is <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> wide dispersal of seed and pollen. The fact that pine pollen travels long distances is well established, moving up to 3,000 kilometers from its source. Additionally, many tree species reproduce {{for a long time before}} being harvested. In combination these factors have led some to believe that GM trees are worthy of special environmental considerations over GM crops. Ensuring sterility for GM trees has proven elusive, but efforts are being made. While tree geneticist Steve Strauss predicted that complete containment might be possible by 2020, many questions remain.|$|E
25|$|The narcissistic manager {{will have}} two main sources of narcissistic supply: inanimate – status symbols like company cars, company-issued {{smartphone}} or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – flattery and attention from colleagues and subordinates. Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries. The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective decisions; while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> attention-gaining for the manager themself. Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate narcissism. He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as Al Dunlap and Robert Allen) who, he suggests, literally have only one thing on their minds: profits. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia.|$|E

500|$|Academics {{have written}} of how {{transgressive}} themes in cult films can be regressive. [...] David Church and Chuck Kleinhans describe an uncritical celebration of transgressive themes in cult films, including misogyny and racism. [...] Church has also criticized gendered descriptions of transgressive content that celebrate masculinity. [...] Joanne Hollows further identifies a gendered component to {{the celebration of}} transgressive themes in cult films, where male terms are used to describe films outside the mainstream while female terms are used to describe mainstream, conformist cinema. [...] Jacinda Read's expansion states that cult films, despite <b>their</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> empowerment of the marginalized, are more often used by politically incorrect males. [...] Knowledgeable about feminism and multiculturalism, they seek a refuge from the academic acceptance of these progressive ideals. [...] Their playful and ironic acceptance of regressive lad culture invites, and even dares, condemnation from academics and the uncool. [...] Thus, cult films become a tool to reinforce mainstream values through transgressive content; Rebecca Feasy states that cultural hierarchies can also be reaffirmed through mockery of films perceived to be lacking masculinity. [...] However, the sexploitation films of Doris Wishman took a feminist approach which avoids and subverts the male gaze and traditional goal-oriented methods. [...] Wishman's subject matter, though exploitative and transgressive, was always framed in terms of female empowerment and the feminine spectator. [...] Her use of common cult film motifs – female nudity and ambiguous gender – were repurposed to comment on feminist topics. [...] Similarly, the films of Russ Meyer were a complicated combination of transgressive, mainstream, progressive, and regressive elements. [...] They attracted both acclaim and denouncement from critics and progressives. [...] Transgressive films imported from cultures that are recognizably different yet still relatable {{can be used to}} progressively examine issues in another culture.|$|E
