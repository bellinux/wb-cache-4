25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> <b>together</b> in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E

[...] Hale uses the expression 'Science Diplomacy' in this context, which he says it's possible he coined. [...] "The sky looks the same from Iran as it does from here in the US.

500|$|Questlove was the [...] "musical powerhouse" [...] behind {{several of}} the Soulquarians' {{projects}} during the late 1990s and early 2000s, including Voodoo and Things Fall Apart. In a 2002 interview, he told critic Jim DeRogatis {{about his role in}} recording Voodoo and being a part of the Soulquarians, stating [...] "I tried to do all in my power that I could <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> <b>together</b> – to bring Common to Electric Lady, have him record here whenever so that he could record with some of these other artists. You'd just come into [...] A Room, you don't even know who has a session, but you call me: 'Who's down there?' 'Common's in there today'. So you come down, you order some food, sit down and bulls—, watch a movie, and then it's, 'Let's play something'. And I say, 'Who wants this ?' And it would be, 'I want it!' 'No, I want it!'". Questlove has referred to the recording experience at the studio as a [...] "left-of-center black music renaissance".|$|E

2500|$|The {{variety and}} {{evolving}} range [...] of stand-alone and built-in social networking {{services in the}} online space introduces a challenge of definition.

Such a broad definition {{would suggest that the}} telegraph and telephone were social networking services – not the Internet technologies scholars are intending to describe.

2500|$|Barbecue {{remains one}} of the most {{traditional}} foods in the United States. While many festive foods, such as roasted turkey or ham, are usually served on particular days or holidays, barbecue can be served on any day. Barbecue is often served on the Fourth of July, however, it is not only confined to that day. Barbecues tend <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> <b>together</b> and serve as a bonding experience at any time of the year. It brings people back to their roots, providing a cooking experience that is often an escape from civilization and closer to nature. Barbecues are traditionally held outside. They could be small informal gatherings with a few of people in a backyard or a formal event that could last all day, typically held for larger numbers of people. Barbecue has been a tradition in the United States beginning with Native Americans. As author Andrew Warnes states, [...] "its mythology of savagery and freedom, of pleasure, masculinity and strength" [...] is part of what makes barbecues so popular to date. By the 19th century barbecues became one of the main forms of United States public celebration, especially in celebration of July 4.|$|E

60|$|From {{the first}} the child should hear {{a clear and}} uniform {{pronunciation}} about it, a precise and careful idiom and words definitely used. Since language is <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> <b>together</b> and not to keep them apart, it would be well if throughout the English-speaking world there could be one accent, one idiom, and one intonation. This there never has been yet, {{but there is no}} reason at all why it should not be. There is arising even now a standard of good English to which many dialects and many influences are contributing. From the Highlanders and the Irish, for example, the English of the South are learning the possibilities of the aspirate h and wh, which latter had entirely and the former very largely dropped out of use among them a hundred years ago. The drawling speech of Wessex and New England--for the main features of what people call Yankee intonation {{are to be found in}} perfection in the cottages of Hampshire and West Sussex--are being quickened, perhaps from the same sources. The Scotch are acquiring the English use of shall and will, and the confusion of reconstruction is world-wide among our vowels. The German w of Mr. Samuel Weller has been obliterated within the space of a generation or so. There is no reason at all why this natural development of the uniform English of the coming age should not be greatly forwarded by our deliberate efforts, why it should not be possible within a little while to define a standard pronunciation of our tongue. It is a less important issue by far than that of a uniform vocabulary and phraseology, but it is still a very notable need.|$|E
