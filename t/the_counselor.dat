25|$|Each merit badge has a {{pamphlet}} (booklet) {{published by the}} Boy Scouts of America associated with it; the pamphlet contains information on completing the requirements for the badge.

Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>counselor</b> will have to work carefully to respond to the client using challenging responses in order to help him or her work past maladaptive beliefs and thoughts, and to think about other options.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) {{has become}} the world's {{foremost}} health threat and {{is the number one}} killer in Zimbabwe. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome impacts not only the individual who has AIDS, but on nuclear and extended families, and all aspects of society in Zimbabwe. Since studies have indicated that counseling could be an effective tool in preventing the spread of Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) and helping those who are already impacted by the virus, it would be important for counselors to be knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS and have positive attitudes towards people with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, the main {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate eight practicing Zimbabwean counselors' attitudes towards and knowledge of HIV/AIDS. Additionally, the study explored <b>the</b> emotions <b>the</b> <b>counselors</b> experienced while counseling HI V/AIDS clients, their beliefs about the origin of HI V/AIDS, and their perceptions about HI V/AIDS counseling in Zimbabwe. Eight practicing counselors in Zimbabwe participated in this study. A mixed method Model III with a sequential exploratory design was used amid phenomenological underpinnings. <b>The</b> <b>counselors</b> provided information through a mailed (electronic mail) questionnaire and telephone interviews. Follow-ups to the interviews were carried out through the electronic mail. Results indicated that <b>the</b> <b>counselors</b> in <b>the</b> study were generally knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS, had positive attitudes toward people with HIV/AIDS, and did not think that the origin of HIV/AIDS was important and that it was better to focus on the solutions to <b>the</b> problem. <b>The</b> <b>counselors</b> experienced a wide variety of feelings while counseling HIV/AIDS clients. <b>The</b> <b>counselors</b> reported more negative than positive feelings, but most of the feelings were not directed toward <b>the</b> client. <b>The</b> <b>counselors</b> revealed that HIV/AIDS counseling was complex and difficult. <b>The</b> <b>counselors</b> thought counselor training in Zimbabwe was too limited and that counselors in Zimbabwe in general lacked both support and supervision services. Despite the difficulties of, and the lack of support and supervision, <b>the</b> <b>counselors</b> found meaning in counseling HIV/AIDS clients...|$|R

25|$|Many {{counseling}} {{preparation programs}} include courses in human development. Since children {{often do not}} have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, counselors will use a variety of media such as crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), toys, board games, et cetera. The use of play therapy is often rooted in psychodynamic theory, but other approaches such as Solution Focused Brief Counseling may also employ the use of play in counseling. In many cases <b>the</b> <b>counselor</b> may prefer to work with the care taker of the child, especially if the child is younger than age four. Yet, by doing so, <b>the</b> <b>counselor</b> risks the perpetuation of maladaptive interactive patterns and the adverse effects on development that have already been affected on the child's end of the relationship. Therefore, contemporary thinking on working with this young age group has leaned towards working with parent and child simultaneously within the interaction, as well as individually as needed.|$|E
