25|$|Although {{the causes}} of {{terrorism}} are complex, it may be <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> are partially reassured by their religious views that God is on their side and will reward them in heaven for punishing unbelievers.|$|E
25|$|After the shuttle's breakup, {{there were}} some initial fears <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> might have been involved, but no {{evidence}} of that has ever surfaced. Security surrounding the launch and landing of the space shuttle had been increased because the crew included the first Israeli astronaut. The Merritt Island launch facility, like all sensitive government areas, had increased security after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

25|$|The Journal {{subsequently}} {{conducted a}} worldwide {{investigation of the}} causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from The Wall Street Journal bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated. It was during this coverage <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> kidnapped and killed Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{has had a}} {{moratorium}} on executions since 2008. Currently there are approximately 800 people on death row in Pakistan in terrorism related cases. The move comes following the widely held perception <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> are never brought to justice in Pakistan. Many times, the judges and witnesses are too scared {{to come forward and}} award due sentences to the terrorists. And even when the terrorists are convicted and sent to prison, the frail policing system of Pakistan has seen many jailbreaks, including the Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan jailbreaks, in which many high-profile terrorists escaped.|$|E
25|$|Historically, refugee {{populations have}} often been portrayed as a {{security}} threat. In the U.S and Europe, {{there has been much}} focus on the narrative <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> maintain networks amongst transnational, refugee, and migrant populations. This fear has been exaggerated into a modern-day Islamist terrorism Trojan Horse in which terrorists hide among refugees and penetrate host countries. 'Muslim-refugee-as-an-enemy-within' rhetoric is relatively new, but the underlying scapegoating of out-groups for domestic societal problems, fears and ethno-nationalist sentiment is not new. In the 1890s, the influx of Eastern European Jewish refugees to London coupled with the rise of anarchism in the city led to a confluence of threat-perception and fear of the refugee out-group. Populist rhetoric then too propelled debate over migration control and protecting national security.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} the report was {{emphasized}} prior to its executive summary with quotations from President of the United States Barack Obama, FBI director James Comey and former United States Attorney General Eric Holder. Obama warned that with globalization came {{an increased risk of}} terrorists passing through the borders of the United States in order to cause harm to U.S. citizens. Comey wrote <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> who had garnered battlefield experience in Iraq and Syria posed a threat if they were able to travel to the U.S. Holder said the Syrian Civil War created a fertile bed for Islamic extremism and the U.S. needed to be alert to prevent U.S. citizens from traveling there and returning to their country of origin to commit attacks. During the course of their research for the report, members of the bipartisan task force traveled to foreign countries in order to speak with government workers and intelligence community leaders about the subject matter to gain more expertise in the area. Work for the report's publication was completed in 2015. The book was first published in paperback format by Skyhorse Publishing in 2016. An e-book edition was released the same year.|$|E
500|$|Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop named Spooks series seven as {{the best}} {{television}} show of 2008 out of 50 programmes. Gimmers felt the seventh series performed better than the previous, as it [...] "lost its way slightly" [...] with the concentration of Islamic extremists. The seventh series however, was praised for bringing back the more traditional enemy, the Russians. With the introduction of Lucas North, Gimmers stated [...] "the possibilities for double-blinding the audience were legion and every single one was exploited to the max." [...] Gimmers also cited the more [...] "pacy" [...] plots due to a shorter series as another factor of the series's success, and also said [...] "the only problem with having a series as good as this in the bag is how they will match it next year?" [...] David Blackwell of Enterline Media said that the series' storylines [...] "have a grain of truth reflecting today's climate" [...] and also [...] "more deeply rooted in gritty realism and preying on the real dangers <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> and other countries pose to the UK." [...] Blackwell also posed the storylines also [...] "keeps the characters human and show what they go through" [...] and reacted positevely towards Lucas' introduction, stating [...] "I like Lucas North better than Adam Carter or Tom Quinn. His dark and conflicted persona adds to the story and makes him a more interesting character than Adam or Tom ever were." [...] Blackwell summed up the series as [...] "as great as the first six seasons. The show maintains a high standard of quality." ...|$|E

2500|$|British {{academic}} Shaun Gregory alleged in 2009 <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> {{had attacked}} Pakistani nuclear facilities three times; twice in 2007 {{and once in}} 2008. However, Pakistan's military rejected the allegations. Talat Masood, a political analyst, said that the nuclear link was [...] "absolute nonsense". Interestingly, all three attacks were suicide and appeared to aim at causing maximum damage and not seizing weapons.|$|E
2500|$|The Irgun's {{activities}} were classed as terrorism by MI5. The Irgun {{has been viewed}} as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts. In particular the Irgun was branded a terrorist organisation by Britain, the 1946 Zionist Congress and the Jewish Agency. Begin argued <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> and freedom fighters are differentiated in <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> deliberately try to target civilians, and that the Irgun was not guilty of terrorism since it supposedly tried to avoid civilian casualties. At the events to mark the 60th anniversary of the attack, Benjamin Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an act of terror intended to harm civilians. He said, [...] "Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.' They don't do that. That is the difference." ...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by the {{investor}} sentiment literature and assuming <b>that</b> <b>terrorist</b> activity influences investor mood the paper explores whether terrorism exerts {{a significant negative}} impact on daily stock market returns for a sample of 22 countries. The employed empirical specifications are based on flexible versions of the World CAPM allowing for autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. The results suggest <b>that</b> <b>terrorist</b> activity leads to significantly lower returns {{on the day of}} terrorist attack occurrence. In addition, the negative effect of terrorist activity is substantially amplified as the level of psychosocial effects increases. On the one hand this evidence sheds light to the underlying mechanism via which terrorism affects stock markets while on the other hand provides further empirical support for the sentiment effect.

40|$|This article explores how terrorists acting {{alone or}} in small groups have used sports events as {{symbolic}} targets in their performance of terrorism. Drawing on a comparative analysis of {{the attacks on the}} 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games and the 2013 Boston Marathon, it is argued <b>that</b> <b>terrorist</b> target selection of major sports events should be understood in relation to the grievances and desires of the perpetrators. The article finds that rather than being the primary target of their attacks, sports events are among a broader range of densely crowded spaces <b>that</b> <b>terrorist</b> actors may seek to target as part of their violent struggle against their adversaries. The findings are contextualized in relation to broader patterns and trends in lone wolf terrorism, including the significance of a copycat phenomenon and inspiration effect...|$|R
2500|$|President Hosni Mubarak {{promised in}} a {{televised}} address <b>that</b> <b>terrorists</b> would not destabilize Egypt or divide Christians and Muslims. He said the attack [...] "carries evidence of the involvement of foreign fingers" [...] and vowed to pursue the perpetrators. Many doubt that the perpetrators will be pursued, citing the Mubarak regime's preference for handling violence against the country’s Christian minority through a reconciliation process between the perpetrators and the victims, rather than prosecution of the perpetrators.|$|E
