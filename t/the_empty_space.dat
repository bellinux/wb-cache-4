5|$|Removing the {{original}} tablet {{to the victims}} of the East Ham Sewage Works accident had left an unsightly gap in {{the original}} row of tiles. In 1931, Mary Watts tracked down Fred Passenger, a former employee of DeMorgan who had, after the closure of the business, set up his own ceramics business using DeMorgan designs. Passenger was by this time working for a pottery business in Bushey Heath established by artist Ida Perrin, but Mary Watts persuaded him to produce a single panel in the style of DeMorgan to fit into <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space.</b> Herbert Maconoghu, a schoolboy who had died in 1882 attempting to rescue two friends from drowning, {{had been one of the}} names originally suggested by Watts, and Passenger produced a tablet to Maconoghu in the style of the original central row, which was installed in April 1931. Maconoghu was actually Herbert Moore McConaghey, the son of Matthew and Martha McConaghey, and he was born in Mynpoorie in Indian where Matthew was working as a settlement officer for the Imperial Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara Desert is huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> {{between the}} pubic bones and the {{intestines}} has by G.S. Paul and David Martill been hypothesised {{to have been}} the location of a large air-sac. Dal Sasso & Maganuco however, rejected this interpretation because with living birds the air-sac of the posterior abdomen does not force the intestines forwards. They considered the space {{more likely to have been}} filled by a large yolk-sac. Air-sacs were nevertheless probable given the pneumatisation of the vertebrae. Vertebrae without pneumatopores would have indicated the boundaries between three air-sac systems: those of the neck base, the lungs, and the abdomen. The double rib heads would indicate a rather stiff thorax, ventilated by the gastralia. A system of hook-like uncinate processes on the ribs as with the Maniraptoriformes, allowing the ribcage to move flexibly, in articulation with an ossified sternum, was absent in Scipionyx.|$|E

Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember what she looked like in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
25|$|Zero-point energy (ZPE) {{or ground}} state energy {{is the lowest}} {{possible}} energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics, quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As well as atoms and molecules, <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> of the vacuum has these properties. According to Quantum Field Theory the universe {{can be thought of}} not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (i.e. leptons and quarks), and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g. photons and gluons). All these fields have zero-point energy. These fluctuating zero-point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an aether in physics, since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However this aether cannot {{be thought of as a}} physical medium if it is to be Lorentz invariant such that there is no contradiction with Einstein's theory of special relativity.|$|E
25|$|Since exoskeletons are rigid, {{they present}} some limits to growth. Organisms with open shells can grow by adding new {{material}} to the aperture of their shell, {{as is the case}} in snails, bivalves and other molluscans. A true exoskeleton, like that found in arthropods, must be shed (moulted) when it is outgrown. A new exoskeleton is produced beneath the old one. As the old one is shed, the new skeleton is soft and pliable. The animal will pump itself up to expand the new shell to maximal size, then let it harden. When the shell has set, <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> inside the new skeleton can be filled up as the animal eats. Failure to shed the exoskeleton once outgrown can result in the animal being suffocated within its own shell, and will stop subadults from reaching maturity, thus preventing them from reproducing. This is the mechanism behind some insect pesticides, such as Azadirachtin.|$|E

500|$|As a precaution, Gorgons cork lagging was {{stripped}} out {{and replaced by}} silicate wool which revealed the real cause. Part of the cork was missing and folded newspapers were found in <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space.</b> Furthermore a number of rivets were entirely missing which meant that ½-inch (12.7mm) holes were present which could have dropped hot ashes onto the newspapers. The forced draught pressure in the boiler room would have supplied air through the rivet holes which would have caused the cork to give off flammable gases and eventually ignite the cordite charges.|$|E
500|$|In ancient China, {{there were}} various {{schools of thought}} {{concerning}} {{the nature of the}} heavens, some of which bear a resemblance to the modern understanding. In the 2nd century, astronomer Zhang Heng became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, [...] "empty and void of substance". Likewise, the [...] "sun, moon, and the company of stars float in <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space,</b> moving or standing still".|$|E
500|$|Some {{art historians}} {{have speculated that}} the area removed was beyond {{restoration}} since {{it is unlikely that}} such a large section of painting by an artist of Goya's stature would be lightly discarded. Still, the removal may have been for aesthetic reasons, with <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> on the right viewed as unnecessary; its removal intended to bring balance to a canvas perceived as overlong. If this was Cubells' reasoning, it was misguided (he was not an accomplished painter and lacked insight into Goya's intentions); Goya had often used empty space to dramatic and evocative effect.|$|E

25|$|Permineralization is {{a process}} of fossilization that occurs when an {{organism}} is buried. <b>The</b> <b>empty</b> <b>spaces</b> within an organism (spaces filled with liquid or gas during life) become filled with mineral-rich groundwater. Minerals precipitate from the groundwater, occupying <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> <b>spaces.</b> This process can occur in very small spaces, such as within the cell wall of a plant cell. Small scale permineralization can produce very detailed fossils. For permineralization to occur, the organism must become covered by sediment soon after death or soon after the initial decay process. The degree to which the remains are decayed when covered determines the later details of the fossil. Some fossils consist only of skeletal remains or teeth; other fossils contain traces of skin, feathers or even soft tissues. This is a form of diagenesis.|$|R
