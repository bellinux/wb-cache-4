5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} mating systems among teleosts. Some species are promiscuous, where {{both males and}} females breed with multiple partners and there are no obvious mate choices. This has been recorded in Baltic herring, guppies, Nassau groupers, humbug damselfish, cichlids and creole wrasses. Polygamy, where one sex has multiple partners can come in many forms. Polyandry consists of one adult female breeding with multiple males, which only breed with that female. This is rare among teleosts, and fish in general, but is found in the clownfish. In addition, it may also exist to an extent among anglerfish, where some females have more than one male attached to them. Polygyny, where one male breeds with multiple females, is much more common. This is recorded in sculpins, sunfish, darters, damselfish and cichlids where multiple females may visit a territorial male that guards and takes care of eggs and young. Polygyny may also involve a male guarding a harem of several females. This occurs in coral reef species, such as damselfishes, wrasses, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and <b>tilefishes.</b>|$|E
500|$|The great {{northern}} tilefish (Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), or golden tile, is {{the largest}} species in the family Malacanthidae (<b>tilefishes),</b> which grows to an average length between [...] [...] The {{great northern tilefish}} is a slow-growing and long-lived species, which has four stages of life. After hatching from eggs, the larvae are found in plankton. As they grow into juveniles, the individuals seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows. As adults, the tilefish continue to expand their burrows in the sediment throughout their lives. The diet of the larvae is unknown, but presumed to consist of zooplankton; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates, crustaceans, and fish. After reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age, females lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize, with each female laying an average of 2.3 million eggs.|$|E
2500|$|Several species {{build up}} mounds of coral pieces either {{to protect the}} {{entrance}} to their burrows, as in <b>tilefishes</b> and gobies of the genus Valenciennea, or to protect the patch of sand in which they will bury themselves for the night, as in the Jordan's tuskfish Choerodon jordani [...] and the rockmover wrasse Novaculichthys taeniourus.|$|E

The function of the <b>tilefish's</b> burrows was predator avoidance, but this has been disputed because chased <b>tilefish</b> try to outswim their predators rather than entering their burrows to seek shelter.|$|R

500|$|The <b>tilefish's</b> {{construction}} {{and expansion of}} burrows {{are the subject of}} ongoing research to better understand the behavior of the species.

[...] <b>Tilefish</b> typically are found in their own burrows, with sharing exhibited with male and female pairs. <b>Tilefish</b> tend to congregate in their habitat, with their burrows in relative proximity to each other; the species does not form schools. The grouping of <b>tilefish</b> can be as dense as 13,000 burrows per km2 off the southern U.S. Atlantic coast, but 1,600 burrows per per km2 were reported in inhabited areas of the Gulf of Mexico and 2,500 burrows per per km2 [...] near the Hudson Canyon. <b>Tilefish</b> burrows also provide a home for various species that live in the area, such as mollusks and other crustaceans.|$|R
