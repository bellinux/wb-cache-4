25|$|In Westland, the {{landscape}} changes quickly from flat lowlands to mountains. Vegetation alters according <b>to</b> <b>elevation,</b> changing between lowland (0-400m elevation; forested, includes lianas and epiphytes), montane (400-800m elevation; forested), subalpine (800-1200m elevation; dense scrub, low forest), low-alpine (1200-1500m elevation; low scrub with tall grasslands), high-alpine (1500-2000 in some areas; herb fields and short grasslands), and nivel zones (as low as 1700m in some areas; incredibly sparse vegetation, only lichens on snow-free rock).|$|E

25|$|Similar {{studies in}} Connecticut, however, {{have been unable}} to {{replicate}} these findings. Shimon Anisfeld and Troy Hill performed a 5-year fertilization experiment of a salt marsh in Long Island Sound and found that neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led <b>to</b> <b>elevation</b> loss, reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production. They suggest that high nutrient levels can significantly alter marsh processes and increase gross carbon loss from sediment but that other processes may compensate for these impacts. No net deleterious effects of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability are anticipated from this study (Anisfeld and Hill 2012).|$|E
