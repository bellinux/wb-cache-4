5|$|In late 1869, Earp courted 20-year-old Urilla Sutherland (c. 1849–1870), the {{daughter}} of William and Permelia Sutherland, who operated the Exchange Hotel in Lamar. They were married by his father Nicholas in Lamar on January 10, 1870, and in August 1870, Wyatt bought a lot on <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> for $50, where he built a house. Urilla was pregnant and about to deliver their first child when she suddenly died from typhoid fever. In November, Earp sold the lot and a house on it for $75. Hoping to keep the office {{to which he had}} been appointed, he ran against his elder half-brother Newton for the office of constable. The Earps may have hoped to keep the job in the family one way or another. Wyatt won by 137 votes to Newton's 108, but their father Nicholas lost the election for justice of the peace in a very close four-way race.|$|E

5|$|Burnham was {{trekking}} the 1,000 miles (1,609km) {{north from}} Durban to Matabeleland {{with his wife}} and son, an American buckboard and six donkeys when war broke out between Rhodes's British South Africa Company and the Matabele (or Ndebele) King Lobengula in late 1893. He signed up to scout for the Company immediately on reaching Matabeleland, and joined the fighting. Leander Starr Jameson, the Company's Chief Magistrate in Mashonaland, hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal town of Bulawayo, and so sent Burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on the situation there. While on <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed everything in sight. By the time the Company troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The Company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the Shangani Patrol, led by Major Allan Wilson and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham.|$|E

25|$|All {{residents}} of Brugg were thereafter subjects of Bern. Nonetheless, this changed little on <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town,</b> as Bern's border {{had been pushed}} to the north by only a few kilometers, and conflict continued to impair the town's economy. During the eighty years subsequent to the “Brugg Night of Murder” the population of Brugg was halved and surrounding communities were able to expand their trading areas and markets {{at the expense of}} Brugg.|$|E
25|$|Bodie {{also had}} a {{cemetery}} on <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> and a nearby mortuary.

25|$|Connecting the new Philadelphia Branch to {{the rest}} of the B system was a {{considerable}} engineering challenge. A new surface line across the center of town was politically impossible and prohibitively expensive. Building around <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town</b> would have required massive regrading and bridging, as the terrain is extremely hilly and the line would cut across every watershed flowing into the harbor. As a temporary expedient, traffic was handled through Baltimore on carfloats, but it was clear that a direct connection would have to be built.|$|E

25|$|In 1905 Nurse Despard, who {{had trained}} in Melbourne, opened a {{maternity}} hospital in Newcastle in Leeder's House in Stirling Terrace. The Sisters of Mercy had vacated {{the house when}} they moved into the newly built convent on <b>the</b> <b>outskirts</b> <b>of</b> <b>town.</b> A maternity hospital was unusual for those times; the practice was for home births assisted by a midwife.
