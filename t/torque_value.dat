The G37s VQ37VHR engine has been touted by car magazines and reviewers as an improvement over the VQ35HR engine mostly adding much more refinement and smoother engine operation, especially at high rpm where the VQ35HR engine was frequently criticized for NVH and sounding strained, harsh and loud.

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of steam sterilization on the accuracy (within 10 %) of friction-style mechanical torque limiting devices (F-S MTLDs) to achieve their target <b>torque</b> <b>values.</b> Materials and Methods: Fifteen new F-S MTLDs were selected from Astra Tech (25 Ncm, Hader SA, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland), BioHorizons (30 Ncm, Dynatorq ITL, Irvine, California, USA), Dr. Idhe (15 - 60 Ncm, Dr. Idhe Dental, Eching/Munich, Germany). Every peak torque measurement was tested ten times before steam sterilization using Tohnichi torque gauge (6 Tohnichi-BTG (-S), Japan). Steam sterilization was performed using a 100 cycle autoclave.

Mean difference between the measured and the targeted <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> were evaluated before and after aging. Repeated-measures of ANOVA were {{used to compare the}} differences of accuracy between subjects. Bonferroni post-hoc test was used for pairwise comparison.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{influence}} of implant bed preparation, using either Er:YAG laser ablation, piezoelectric surgery or drill osteotomy, on osseointegration of titanium dental implants after 4, 6, and 8 weeks. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 108 implants (Camlog) were placed in the pelvis of 6 sheep (18 implants/sheep). Implant sites were prepared by an Er:YAG laser, a dental drill or a piezoelectric device. For each time period, six implants were used for biomechanical removal torque testing and six implants for a semi-quantitative histological assessment of the bone-to-implant contact (BIC). RESULTS: An initially missing implant adjusted site preparation led to slightly higher BIC and <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> in the piezoelectric and laser groups due to a press-fit effect after 4 weeks. Statistical analysis of the average mean BIC after 4, 6, and 8 weeks revealed no significant differences (P > 0. 05) between the different osteotomy techniques. Comparison of individual removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> showed the highest value for laser osteotomy after 8 weeks (1, 698. 50 +/- 67. 52 Nmm), which was significantly higher than the corresponding value for drill osteotomy (P = 0. 006). CONCLUSION: Although BIC and removal <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> decreased in the laser and piezoelectric groups at 6 weeks during an active remodeling process, favorable and superior BIC as well as <b>torque</b> <b>values</b> could be demonstrated at 8 weeks. Thus laser and piezoelectric osteotomy seem to be at least comparable to drill osteotomy, concerning early osseointegration and implant stability...|$|R
