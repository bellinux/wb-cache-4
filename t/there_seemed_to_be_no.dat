5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department exacerbated the situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E
5|$|Land {{was also}} {{an issue in the}} coming of the war. While the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who {{seasonally}} engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> end of settlers in the British colonies, who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.|$|E
25|$|But without {{detailed}} {{evidence and}} a force sufficient {{to drive the}} movement, the theory was not generally accepted: the Earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a liquid core, but <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> way that portions of the crust could move around. Distinguished scientists, such as Harold Jeffreys and Charles Schuchert, were outspoken critics of continental drift.|$|E

25|$|The rumor seemed {{unlikely}} to be true for several reasons: {{the two young men}} came from different states and had never met before being brought to the MacLab; if they were both conspiring with Randi, then the plot had gone on for 21 months. What critic would be so persistent in engaging in fraud and conspiracy on such a time-scale? <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> precedent. Nor was it possible to track down how reliable the rumor might be.|$|E
25|$|MacKaye {{recruited}} ex-Dag Nasty drummer Colin Sears {{and bass}} guitarist Joe Lally, and the trio began practicing together in September 1986. After {{a few months}} of rehearsals, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty (earlier of Rites of Spring). One day Canty's Rites of Spring bandmate Guy Picciotto dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> place for him.|$|E

25|$|The Ptolemaic {{approach}} of using cycles and epicycles was becoming strained: <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{end to the}} mushrooming growth in complexity required {{to account for the}} observable phenomena. Johannes Kepler {{was the first person to}} abandon the tools of the Ptolemaic paradigm. He started to explore the possibility that the planet Mars might have an elliptical orbit rather than a circular one. Clearly, the angular velocity could not be constant, but it proved very difficult to find the formula describing the rate of change of the planet's angular velocity. After many years of calculations, Kepler arrived at what we now know as the law of equal areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomena}} {{for which}} Plato had to account were of three kinds, ethical, epistemological, and ontological. In {{each of these}} spheres there had been developed {{by the end of}} the fifth century doctrines so extremely paradoxical that <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> possibility of reconciling them with one another or any one of them with the observable facts of human experience. The dialogues of Plato, I believe, will furnish evidence to show that he considered it necessary to find a single hypothesis which would at once solve the problems of these several spheres and also create a rationally unified cosmos by establishing the connection among the separate phases of experience.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} antiquity, an {{unexpected}} {{exception to the}} alteration of an organism's tissues by chemical reduction of the complex organic molecules during fossilization has been the discovery of soft tissue in dinosaur fossils, including blood vessels, and the isolation of proteins and evidence for DNA fragments. In 2014, Mary Schweitzer and her colleagues reported the presence of iron particles (goethite-aFeO(OH)) associated with soft tissues recovered from dinosaur fossils. Based on various experiments that studied the interaction of iron in haemoglobin with blood vessel tissue they proposed that solution hypoxia coupled with iron chelation enhances the stability and preservation of soft tissue and provides the basis for {{an explanation for the}} unforeseen preservation of fossil soft tissues. However, a slightly older study based on eight taxa ranging in time from the Devonian to the Jurassic found that reasonably well-preserved fibrils that probably represent collagen were preserved in all these fossils, and that the quality of preservation depended mostly on the arrangement of the collagen fibers, with tight packing favoring good preservation. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> correlation between geological age and quality of preservation, within that timeframe.|$|E

500|$|When she {{was four}} years old, she started {{learning}} the violin, and later commented: [...] "I remember asking for a violin, but I don't remember knowing what one was. I might {{have thought it was}} a kind of pony for all I know, but I don't remember being disappointed." [...] Four years later, Autumn made her musical debut as a solo violinist performing with an orchestra, and won a competition. At the age of nine or ten, she left regular school with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist. On her time at the school, she remarked, [...] "I hated it anyway, what with the status as 'weird,' 'antisocial,' and the physical threats, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reason to go anymore, so I just didn't." [...] She practiced eight or nine hours a day, had lessons, read a wide range of literature, participated in orchestra practice, and was home-schooled. Growing up, she owned a large CD collection of [...] "violin concertos, symphonies, chamber music, opera, and a little jazz". She began writing her own music and poetry at age thirteen or fourteen, though she never planned to sing any of her songs. She studied under various teachers and attended Indiana University in Bloomington, but left after two years there, because she disagreed with the prevailing views on individuality and classical music. She believed that neither the audience nor the original composer would be insulted by the clothing and appearance of the performer.|$|E

His first mainstream album, entitled Mylon, We Believe (Atlantic/Cotillion Records 1969), is considered {{by some to be}} the first true [...] "Jesus Rock" [...] album. LeFevre took the classic song, [...] "Gospel Ship", setting the familiar southern gospel melody to rock & roll tempo.|$|E

2500|$|At MGM Loos happily {{turned out}} scripts; however, she {{frequently}} {{had to use}} Emerson as a conduit to communicate with directors and other executives who balked at dealing with a woman on equal footing. This worked well to promote the idea they were a writing [...] "team" [...] and a happy couple. She bought a modest house in Beverly Hills in 1934, where she could write in the garden when weather permitted. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> world or life outside of Hollywood; during {{the day it was}} work, and at night parties given by other MGM folk, like the Thalbergs, the Selznicks and the Goldwyns. Loos was a frequent attendee at George Cukor's Sunday brunches, which was the closest Hollywood had to a literary salon.|$|E
2500|$|During July 1890 (not May 1890, as {{previously}} thought), Franck was {{riding in a}} cab which {{was struck by a}} horse-drawn trolley, injuring his head and causing a short fainting spell. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> immediate after-effects; he completed his trip and he himself considered it of no import. [...] However, walking became painful and he found himself increasingly obliged to absent himself first from concerts and rehearsals, and then to give up his lessons at the Conservatoire. [...] He took his vacation as soon as he could in Nemours, where he hoped to work on the proposed organ pieces as well as some commissioned works for harmonium. [...] During the vacation he was able to start on both projects.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1623 Maria Eleonora {{gave birth to a}} daughter, but the baby died the next year. At that time, the only {{surviving}} male heirs were the hated king of Poland and his sons. With Gustavus Adolphus risking his life in battles, an heir to the throne was anxiously awaited. In the autumn Maria Eleonora was pregnant for a third time. In May 1625 she was in good spirits and insisted on accompanying her husband on the royal yacht to review the fleet. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> danger, as the warships were moored just opposite the castle, but a sudden storm nearly capsized the yacht. The queen was hurried back to the castle, but when she got there she was heard to exclaim: [...] "Jesus, I cannot feel my child!" [...] Shortly afterwards the longed-for son was stillborn.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{had just}} said to Dick McMullen, 'Be sure not to fire until they reach that mullein stalk,' when a commotion {{in the rear of}} our line caused me to look behind us, and to my dismay, my eyes rested upon the largest line of cavalry I had ever seen. <b>There</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in our {{immediate}} rear I know not, and from what direction they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance. Major [...] Boyd, commanding our regiment, quickly said: 'We are prisoners,' {{and that was the end}} of the Nineteenth Virginia Infantry as a body of armed soldiers." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} came to groom a {{successor}} for the king, <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: [...] "You are the rightful king and we must ask you to come with us to the palace." [...] Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, [...] "I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root." [...] The stick he carried, was of chopo or black poplar, which easily takes root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} played on a wet and {{slippery}} field that handicapped the offensive players. The Detroit Free Press reported that players had difficulty untracking themselves in [...] "the mire that lay over the gridiron like custard." [...] The teams played to a scoreless tie in a first half that featured a punting duel between Steketee and Rife. Michigan's first touchdown {{was set up by}} a 73-yard punt from Steketee that [...] "stuck fast in the mud" [...] at Ohio State's two- or three-yard line. Michigan's defense held, and Rife was forced to punt from his end zone. In the outstanding play of the game, Goetz blocked the punt and recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown. The Detroit Free Press described the key play as follows:"The pass from center was perfect and <b>there</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> fear that Rife would not get it away. [...] But Goetz, one man who has starred in every game the Maize and Blue played this year, shattered the line and rammed the Buckeye punter. Leather and Goetz collided and the pigskin went bounding away with Goetz in hot pursuit. Three scarlet-robed athletes tried to block Goetz's path to the ball, but he thrust them aside and went to earth with it just as his rivals in the race catapulted themselves at the leather." ...|$|E
