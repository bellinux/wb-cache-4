Consequently, the set of coefficients occurring in a <b>ternary</b> cyclotomic <b>polynomial</b> consists of consecutive integers.

40|$|A <b>ternary</b> inclusion-exclusion <b>{{polynomial}}</b> is a polynomial of {{the form}} Q_p,q,r=(z^pqr- 1) (z^p- 1) (z^q- 1) (z^r- 1) /(z^pq- 1) (z^qr- 1) (z^rp- 1) (z- 1), where p, q, and r are integers > 3 and relatively prime in pairs. This class of polynomials contains, as its principle subclass, the <b>ternary</b> cyclotomic <b>polynomials</b> corresponding to restricting p, q, and r to be distinct odd prime numbers. Our object here is to continue {{the investigation of the}} relationship between the coefficients of Q_p,q,r and Q_p,q,s, with r≡ spq.

40|$|Let l>= 1 be an {{arbitrary}} odd integer and p,q and r primes. We {{show that there}} exist infinitely many <b>ternary</b> cyclotomic <b>polynomials</b> Φ_pqr(x) with l^ 2 + 3 l+ 5 <= p<q<r such that the set of coefficients of each of them consists of the p integers in the interval [-(p-l- 2) / 2,(p+l+ 2) / 2]. It is known that no larger coefficient range is possible. The Beiter conjecture states that the cyclotomic coefficients a_pqr(k) of Φ_pqr satisfy |a_pqr(k) |<= (p+ 1) / 2 and thus the above family contradicts the Beiter conjecture.

40|$|Bit-slicing is a non-conventional {{implementation}} {{technique for}} cryptographic software where an n-bit processor is {{considered as a}} collection of n 1 -bit execution units operating in SIMD mode. Particularly when implementing symmetric ciphers, the bit-slicing approach has several advantages over more conventional alternatives: it often allows one to reduce memory footprint by eliminating large look-up tables, and it permits more predictable performance characteristics that can foil time based side-channel attacks. Both features are attractive for mobile and embedded processors, but the performance overhead that results from bit-sliced implementation often represents a significant disadvantage. In this paper we describe a set of light-weight Instruction Set Extensions (ISEs) that can improve said performance while retaining all advantages of bit-sliced implementation. Contrary to other crypto-ISE, our design is generic and allows for a high degree of algorithm agility: we demonstrate applicability to several well-known cryptographic primitives including four block ciphers (DES, Serpent, AES, and PRESENT), a hash function (SHA- 1), as well as multiplication of <b>ternary</b> <b>polynomials...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} recent {{algorithmic}} advances has delivered highly effective methods for pairing evaluation and parameter generation. However, the resulting multitude of options means many different variations of base field must ideally be {{supported on the}} target platform. Typical hardware accelerators {{in the form of}} co-processors possess neither the flexibility nor the scalability to support fields of different characteristic and order. On the other hand, extending the instruction set of a general-purpose processor by custom instructions for field arithmetic allows to combine the performance of hardware with the flexibility of software. To this end, we investigate the integration of a tri-field multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit into a SPARC V 8 processor core to support arithmetic in Fp, F 2 n and F 3 n. Besides integer multiplication, the MAC unit can also execute dedicated multiply and MAC instructions for binary and <b>ternary</b> <b>polynomials.</b> Our results show that the tri-field MAC unit adds only a small size overhead while significantly accelerating arithmetic in F 2 n and F 3 n, which sheds new light on the relative performance of Fp, F 2 n and F 3 n in the context of pairing-based cryptography...|$|R

40|$|Taking a {{combinatorial}} {{point of}} view on cyclotomic polynomials leads to a larger class of polynomials we shall call the inclusion-exclusion polynomials. This gives a more appropriate setting for certain types of questions about the coefficients of these polynomials. After establishing some basic properties of inclusion-exclusion polynomials we turn to a detailed study of the structure of <b>ternary</b> inclusion-exclusion <b>polynomials.</b> The latter subclass is exemplified by cyclotomic polynomials Φ_pqr, where p<q<r are odd primes. Our main result is that the set of coefficients of Φ_pqr is simply a string of consecutive integers which depends only on the residue class of r modulo pq.

40|$|A tensor $T$, {{in a given}} tensor space, {{is said to be}} $h$-identifiable if it admits {{a unique}} {{decomposition}} as a sum of $h$ rank one tensors. A criterion for $h$-identifiability is called effective if it is satisfied in a dense, open subset of the set of rank $h$ tensors. In this paper we give effective $h$-identifiability criteria for a large class of tensors. We then improve these criteria for some symmetric tensors. For instance, this allows us to give a complete set of effective identifiability criteria for <b>ternary</b> quintic <b>polynomial.</b> Finally, we implement our identifiability algorithms in Macaulay 2.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel technique for drawing proximity graphs in polynomial area and volume.

Finally, we give evidence of the effectiveness of our technique by showing that a class of graph requiring exponential area even for weak Gabriel drawings, admits a linear-volume strong β-proximity drawing and a relative neighborhood drawing.
