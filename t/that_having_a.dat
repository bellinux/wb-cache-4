5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal {{would keep the}} existing station open but with many services calling only at a new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Kocianski began wrestling on the Notre Dame High School {{scholastic}} wrestling team. She was {{the first}} female varsity wrestler in the school's history. She became the North-East freestyle women's champion in 1999, and also won at the New York State Fair Tournament the same year. At the time, {{she was also a}} member of USA Wrestling, a freestyle wrestling association. Her life goal was, according to her, to become a professional wrestler, and she believed <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> solid amateur background would help her reach it.|$|E
5|$|This was a {{recognition}} of the de facto political situation, as the Patriarch of Constantinople was partially under the political control of the Ottoman Empire. However, faithful people—concerned <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> Catholic {{as the head of the}} Church of Greece would weaken the Orthodox Church—criticised the unilateral declaration of Autocephaly as non-canonical. For the same reason, they likewise resisted the foreign, mostly Protestant, missionaries who established schools throughout Greece.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or seconder of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E
5|$|In early 1964, David Warburton of Roberts & Vinter, an {{established}} publisher, {{heard from the}} printer of Science Fantasy and New Worlds that the magazines were going to fold shortly. Warburton decided <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> respectable magazine would help him in getting good distribution for Roberts & Vinter's books: Science Fantasy and New Worlds both had distribution arrangements with the two main British newsagents of the time, John Menzies and W.H. Smith. Carnell {{did not want to}} continue to edit the magazines in addition to New Writings in SF, and recommended Moorcock to Warburton; Kyril Bonfiglioli, an Oxford art dealer who was a friend of Brian Aldiss, also expressed an interest. Warburton gave Moorcock the choice of which magazine to edit; Moorcock chose New Worlds, and Bonfiglioli became the new editor of Science Fantasy. Roberts & Vinter changed the format from digest to paperback, and the first issue under Bonfiglioli's control was number 65, dated June–July 1964. The schedule was initially somewhat irregular, with each issue dated with two months even when two issues were only a month apart—for example, June–July 1964 was followed by July–August 1964. From March 1965 a regular monthly schedule was begun.|$|E
5|$|Irataba {{assisted}} Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves {{during his}} 1851 {{exploration of the}} Colorado. On March 19, 1851, a family of Mormon settlers, the Oatmans, who were traveling by wagon train {{in what is now}} Arizona, were attacked by a band of Western Yavapai, probably the Tolkepaya. They captured two survivors of the attack: the 14-year-old Olive Oatman and her 7-year-old sister, Mary Ann. After a year with the Yavapai, the girls were sold to the Mohave, and adopted into the Oach clan where they lived with the family of a Mohave man called Tokwatha (Musk Melon) a friend of Irataba. Olive remained with the Mohave until February 22, 1856, when Tokwatha, having been warned <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> white girl among them might be seen as an offense by whites, brought her to Fort Yuma carpenter Henry Grinnell, releasing her in return for two horses and some blankets and beads. Irataba may have learned about Anglo-Americans and their society from Oatman, and knowing her may have contributed to his generally favourable disposition towards Whites.|$|E

5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces {{had a right}} under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence of}} a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in those decisions <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was an unfair labor practice and actionable under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E
5|$|There {{were more}} {{concerns}} about Clannad being similar to Air. When Nagisa's scenario was being written, {{there were some}} disputes concerning {{the length of her}} scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how Air was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt's, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters' scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game's evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the end result was a good one. Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa's scenario, would eclipse the entire game's scenario, much like what happened with Air according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in Clannad, Maeda focused on making {{the first half of the}} story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making it long and heart-breaking. Clannad is Key's second longest work, as reported by Yūto Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4,000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game Little Busters! Ecstasy.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Indecon (international {{economic}} consultants) published in 2014 on the Irish Stock Exchange found <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> local {{stock market and}} securities industry directly supports 2,100 jobs in Ireland and is worth €207 million each year to the Irish economy. It also found <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> domestic securities industry centered on the Irish Stock Exchange generates €207m in estimated direct economic impact (measured in Gross Value Added or GDP) and €230m in direct tax for the Irish exchequer (including stamp duty on trading in Irish shares).|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} side, the 4.5 inch gun {{was criticized for}} {{insufficient}} power of its high-explosive shell. The shell was produced from low grade ("19 ton") steel, which necessitated thick walls.

Additionally, it was felt <b>that</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> small number of guns of atypical caliber unnecessarily complicated logistics.|$|E
