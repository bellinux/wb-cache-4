The <b>touch</b> pointer can be switched off in Control Panel and resembles a small diamond shape. When the screen is <b>touched</b> a blue ripple appears around the <b>touch</b> pointer to provide visual <b>touch</b> feedback. When swiping to scroll etc., the <b>touch</b> pointer would follow the finger as it moves.

Most counselors believed that non-erotic and ethical <b>touch</b> had positive effects on clients. There was a significant main effect of therapist gender on attitudes towards <b>touch,</b> F(1, 57) = 9. 05, p<. 003, and frequency of <b>touch</b> use, F(1, 57) = 6. 4, p <. 05.

30|$|Case one is {{that the}} first <b>touch</b> was truly {{intended}} and the second <b>touch</b> was unintended.

In both case two and three, the unintended drawn ink stroke should be removed. Therefore, to minimize the occurrences of IDIR, we embed a function that invokes DIR only for the first <b>touch.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the detection of}} multiple <b>touch</b> points for capacitive <b>touch</b> panel systems under Gaussian noise.

Simulation demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed algorithm. I...|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of target selection for finger <b>touch,</b> we conceptualize finger <b>touch</b> input as an uncertain process, and derive a statistical target selection criterion, Bayesian <b>Touch</b> Criterion, by combining the basic Bayes’ rule of probability with the generalized dual Gaussian distribution hypothesis of finger <b>touch.</b> The Bayesian <b>Touch</b> Criterion selects the intended target as the candidate with the shortest Bayesian <b>Touch</b> Distance to the <b>touch</b> point, which is computed from the <b>touch</b> point to the target center distance and the target size. We give the derivation of the Bayesian <b>Touch</b> Criterion and its empirical evaluation with two experiments.
