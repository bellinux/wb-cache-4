5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to wilderness. With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts of the cemetery not currently in use, the cemetery itself sank further into neglect.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Lee {{bought the}} rights to the San Francisco 49ers {{football}} stadium, which was renamed to Monster Park. Citizens and local government protested that a public facility adopted a corporate name and a local ballot was passed <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> the stadium name after the four-year deal with Monster expired. The sponsorship was partially contentious due to a recent layoff of 120 local employees.|$|E

5|$|In the subplot, Moe {{decides to}} expand his {{customer}} base by turning his tavern into a family restaurant. The stress of running the business by himself ultimately unnerves him and he soon snaps at a little girl. The restaurant is a failure, forcing Moe <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to a run-down tavern.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{most urgent}} problem facing the new Emperor was the {{scarcity}} of resources left in the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> {{to the practice of}} auctioning the offices, obviously causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, {{with the help of the}} Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.|$|E
50|$|However, {{after the}} club moved back <b>to</b> Sonsonate they <b>reverted</b> <b>to</b> green and white.|$|R
50|$|Some market {{commentators}} {{predicted that}} this would lead <b>to</b> originators <b>reverting</b> <b>to</b> traditional limited recourse language, particularly as the tax advantages related to PECOs no longer subsisted.|$|R
50|$|ABC's countersuit was {{dismissed}} in October 2016, and Prospect Park's lawsuit {{was dismissed}} in December 2016, with {{the rights to}} All My Children and One Life <b>to</b> Live <b>reverting</b> <b>to</b> ABC.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} each season, fans vote {{directly}} for the Player of the Season. Historically this has been conducted by post, but in recent years it has taken place on the Watford Observer's website. This system was earmarked for change to a match-by-match rating system in 2009, but in March 2010, the Observer decided <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to the traditional method of voting.|$|E
5|$|Win32 console windows {{can now be}} resized {{without any}} restrictions, {{can be made to}} cover the full screen by {{pressing}} , and can use standard keyboard shortcuts, such as those for cut, copy, and paste. Other features such as word wrap and transparency were also added. These functions can be disabled <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to the legacy console, if needed.|$|E
5|$|A {{third year}} {{student and the}} current leader of the Juken Club. She is very skilled in various martial arts, but does not possess the Dragon's Eye like her siblings. For this reason her father {{entrusted}} her with the cursed sword Reiki. Early in the series, she would use a body manipulation technique <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> herself into her childhood form to conserve her ki. She also has an argument to settle with Mitsuomi Takayanagi.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit {{their love}} for each other, yet he distrusts her {{intentions}} (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the Queen Anne's Revenge and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the Revenge. He reclaims the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, hoping <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> the Black Pearl to its original size and continue living the pirates life.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's {{precarious}} {{health was}} {{a constant source of}} worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of eleven, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. The English Parliament did not want the throne <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E
50|$|The {{club was}} known as Hobart Tassie Devils from 1987 <b>to</b> 1995, but <b>reverted</b> <b>to</b> Hobart Devils in its final season.|$|R
50|$|In computing, {{downgrading}} refers <b>to</b> <b>reverting</b> software (or hardware) back to {{an older}} version; downgrade {{is the opposite of}} upgrade. Often, complex programs may need to be downgraded to remove unused or bugged features, and to increase speed and/or ease of use. The same can occur with machinery.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Biman {{went through}} a {{rebranding}} exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman was forced <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern revised version of its livery, that {{was applied to the}} new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.|$|E
5|$|Newton is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions {{to the theory of}} finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's decimals.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the {{decentralisation}} stance {{taken in}} the treaty, Pavlov {{was one of the}} key players in the establishment of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in August 1991. Pavlov's inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to pre-Gorbachev policies. The Committee's main goal was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralised union state. The Emergency Committee was led by Gennady Yanayev, Vice President of the Soviet Union, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, Defence Minister Dmitry Yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust Gorbachev.|$|E
50|$|The Bourses du Travail survived, {{often as}} a single {{organisation}} union hall, while the history of splits in the French labour movement saw the buildings pass from one hand <b>to</b> another, <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> municipalities, or disappear entirely.|$|R
50|$|The curious plot of {{allotment}} gardens at {{the main}} entrance date from 1940 when many school grounds were used for such purposes but {{here is one of}} the few examples not <b>to</b> have <b>reverted</b> <b>to</b> school grounds.|$|R
50|$|At the 2005 general election, Thomas was {{narrowly}} {{defeated by}} the Conservative Party candidate David Jones. Before 1997, Clwyd West had been regarded as a safe Conservative seat and now appears <b>to</b> be <b>reverting</b> <b>to</b> its traditional character.|$|R
5|$|The Chalk River reactor {{was shut}} down for {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} and {{opening of the}} Erie Canal in 1825 along the same alignment as the Albany to Buffalo route began to eat away at the revenues of these turnpike companies. In time, the turnpike business had become unprofitable and the companies were dissolved by 1852, causing the roads <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to public control. The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852. The old, southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus, NY175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill, and NY173 from there east to Chittenango.|$|E
5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E
