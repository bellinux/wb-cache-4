In 1928, a concrete slipway was built for seaplanes that used the adjoining Kowloon Bay. The first control tower and hangar at Kai Tak were built in 1935. In 1936, the first domestic airline in Hong Kong was established.|$|E

Replying to Brundle's notion that driving {{the way he did}} earlier in the season would have given him a chance for the championship, Rosberg replied: [...] "Thank you very much for <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> advice, I could figure that out for myself!" [...] Lewis Hamilton on the other hand lamented {{the fact that he was}} unable to follow Rosberg closely on track without damaging his tyres too much, saying that he would have otherwise had the pace to pass him. Third placed Sebastian Vettel called it [...] "a good race", but also [...] "not very exciting", since the Ferrari drivers had been [...] "in no-mans land" [...] behind the Mercedes.|$|E

500|$|A {{tropical}} {{low over}} the northern Gulf of Mexico developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16. The depression headed slowly east-northeastward, and intensified into Tropical Storm Danny on the following day. Danny continued east-northeastward, and reached hurricane strength just before landfall near Buras, Louisiana. Because of the narrowness of <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land, most of Danny remained over water and it lost little strength. Danny re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened slightly making two landfalls in Alabama as a low-end Category1 hurricane on July19. After remaining stationary for a day, Danny moved northward and weakened to a tropical depression. Heading northward across Alabama, Danny turned {{to the east and}} crossed over the Southeastern United States. While centered over North Carolina, Danny interacted with a developing trough, which caused it to re-intensify into a tropical storm. Shortly thereafter, Danny emerged over the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina/Virginia border on July24. Danny took a northward turn, and came within [...] of Nantucket Island on July26. It then turned out to sea and was absorbed by a front on July27.|$|E

[...] MD16 was completed from Mount Holly to East New Market in 1911, from Cambridge to Mount Holly in 1913, from East New Market to Preston via Linchester in 1914, and from Church Creek to Cambridge in 1915. [...] The gap in the state highway within East New Market was closed in 1917. [...] The segment of highway between Preston and Grove was surfaced by 1915. [...] MD16 between Grove and Bureau was under construction by 1919 and finished around 1920. [...] The state highway was constructed from the bridge to Taylor's Island to Church Creek between 1917 and 1919.|$|E
500|$|Before {{leaving the}} [...] "Führerbau", Chamberlain {{requested}} a private conference with Hitler. Hitler agreed, {{and the two}} met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning. Chamberlain urged restraint {{in the implementation of}} the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed [...] "Anglo–German Agreement", which contained three paragraphs including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement [...] "symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again". According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected [...] "Ja! Ja!" [...] ("Yes! Yes!") as the Prime Minister read it. The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the Führer replied, [...] "Oh, don't take it so seriously. <b>That</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> paper is of no further significance whatever." [...] Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, [...] "I've got it!" [...] Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters.|$|E

500|$|The video—which cost an {{estimated}} $140,000 to produce—was completed while Kiedis and Frusciante {{were on a}} promotional trip through Europe in support of Blood Sugar Sex Magik. When the vocalist first saw it, he was [...] "more hysterically ecstatic about <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> visual footage than anything [...] ever done." [...] Warner Bros. executives, however, were worried that the content would be [...] "too weird" [...] or [...] "too artsy" [...] {{for the general public}} and favored a more traditional premise in contrast to the experimental approach Sednaoui took. The video was ultimately released without being edited by the record label; since then it has been widely credited as being a considerable factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' success and greatly increased their international popularity. Journalist Jeff Apter noted the video's [...] "funky brew of goofy looks, a subtle invasive hook, Flea's spindly fingered baseline and Kiedis' crotch-hugging shorts made the clip essential viewing across MTV throughout the last few months of 1991." [...] Steve Huey of Allmusic commented in his review of the song that [...] "MTV jumped all over the visually distinctive video." [...] It was nominated for three awards—"Best Alternative Video", [...] "Breakthrough Video", and [...] "Best Art Direction"—at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, for which it won the latter two.|$|E

2500|$|Language {{rights in}} the United States are usually derived from the Fourteenth Amendment, with its Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, because they forbid racial and ethnic discrimination, {{allowing}} language minorities to use this Amendment to claim their language rights. One example of use of the Due Process Clauses is the Meyer v. Nebraska case which held that a 1919 Nebraska law restricting foreign-language education violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Two other cases of major importance to linguistic rights were the Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad case, which overturned a language-restrictive legislation in the Philippines, declaring <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation to be [...] "violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Philippine Autonomy Act of Congress", {{as well as the}} Farrington v. Tokushige case, which ruled that the governmental regulation of private schools, particularly to restrict the teaching of languages other than English and Hawaiian, as damaging to the migrant population of Hawaii. Both of these cases were influenced by the Meyer case, which was a precedent.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they wondered who the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In Eng Foong Ho v.

Next to the temple was the Ramakrishna Mission and the Bartley Christian Church, but land belonging to these properties was not acquired. The appellants, who were the trustees of the temple land, argued, among other things, that the acquisition of <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> land was against the equal protection clause as the State had discriminated against them in acquiring only their property and not the other two properties. The Court applied a modified reasonable relation test in determining the constitutionality of the land acquisition decision. It stated that to determine if it violated Article 12(1), [...] "he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law". The administration of a law [...] "may be unconstitutional if it amounts to intentional and arbitrary discrimination". The mere existence of inequalities [...] "due to inadvertence or inefficiency" [...] is insufficient, unless it is on a [...] "very substantial scale".|$|E
