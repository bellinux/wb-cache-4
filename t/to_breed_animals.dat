By tenth year of its functioning, the institute proposes <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> 1500 <b>animals</b> annually. Though the project was conceived way back in 2008 by the UPA Government, it got delayed due to financial and technical reasons. However, it got impetus in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Many smaller breeders {{have gone}} out of business, concentrating the market around larger {{international}} companies, such as Charles River Laboratories and Harlan, or to forcing pharmaceutical companies and universities <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> <b>animals</b> in-house. For example, after Shamrock Farm closed in 2000, there were no commercial importers of laboratory primates left in the UK. To address this shortage, Cambridge University planned to build Europe's largest primate facility. However, they withdrew their plans following a concerted campaign by animal rights activists.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to sable, {{black and white}} fox, ermine, beaver, squirrel, lynx, wolf, wolverine, rabbit, marten, walrus, sea otter, and polar bear were also hunted for their pelts. Most of these fur bearing animals {{are found in the}} Siberian taiga, except for the sea otters and walrus that were found on the North Pacific coasts. In more recent times, fur farming has been used <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> <b>animals</b> for their fur. Silver fox farms were started in 1936, mostly in Yakutia. These farms eliminated some of the dangers and uncertainties involved with hunting in the wilderness.|$|E
5000|$|Breeding {{stock is}} a group of animals used for the purpose of planned breeding. When {{individuals}} are looking <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> <b>animals,</b> they look for certain valuable traits in purebred animals, or may intend to use some type of crossbreeding to produce a new type of stock with different, and presumably superior abilities in a given area of endeavor. For example, when breeding swine the [...] "breeding stock should be sound, fast growing, muscular, lean, and reproductively efficient." [...] The [...] "subjective selection of breeding stock" [...] in horses has led to many horse breeds with particular performance traits.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} Species Committee, {{recommendations}} are made each year about which animals {{should be allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>breed,</b> which individual <b>animals</b> should go from one zoo to another, the conditions of such a move (breeding loan, exchange, term free disposition, etc.) and so on.|$|R
50|$|Vanity hunts (also called canned hunts) tend <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> their <b>animals</b> for {{specific}} desirable features {{without regard for}} the genetic health of the population. Breeding efforts can incorporate elements of inbreeding as specific features are aggressively sought. Inbreeding not only reinforces the presence of desirable features but brings with it the risk of inbreeding depression, which can reduce population fitness. Such operations also tend to feature other forms of animal abuse including inadequate housing and improper diet.|$|R
50|$|Beyond the {{concerns}} of conservation organisations, {{there are other reasons}} for individuals or groups <b>to</b> keep rare <b>breed</b> <b>animals.</b> Rare <b>breeds</b> can be popular with hobby farmers, as they often require less intensive management. Some rare breeds are kept by tourist attractions for their value in attracting visitors. Some farmers also prefer to sell meat from rare breeds, as they believe such breeds offer higher quality produce.|$|R

50|$|Wolves {{are less}} {{suitable}} than dogs for working. Swedish wolf biologist Erik Zimen {{once tried to}} form a dog sled team composed entirely of wolves. The experiment failed as the wolves ignored most commands and were far more prone to fighting than sled dogs. North American wolves and wolf hybrids were used as experimental attack dogs by the South African Defence Force in Apartheid South Africa in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> <b>animals</b> capable of tracking guerrillas. Because the wolves would not follow even basic commands, the experiment was abandoned. However, their sense of smell can rival that of established scent hounds. According to reports published in 2006, ongoing research at the Perm Institute of Internal Troops in Russia demonstrated that wolf/dog cross-breeds took 15-20 seconds to track down a target in training sessions, whereas ordinary police dogs took 3-4 minutes. Their success has led to plans to use them as police dogs for the Russian police.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two major}} {{hereditary}} within the breed are: hip dysplasia and hereditary eye disease. Both {{problems can be}} tested for and identified in breeding stock before they pass the trait onto the next generation, so the Standard Schnauzer Club of America recommends that every kennel test their breeding stock for hip and eye problems before breeding and <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> only healthy <b>animals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bay's {{name was}} spelled {{in a variety}} of ways, {{including}} Piashti Bay, Pillage Bay, Baie-de-Pillage, Piastibe, Piashte Bay, and Piestebé. Perhaps for this reason, its residents expressed a desire to change the village's name to Baie-Johan-Beetz in 1910. Johan Beetz (1874-1949) was a Belgian naturalist, who lived in the Bay from 1897 to 1922. He had moved there <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> fur <b>animals,</b> particularly foxes, and built a luxurious manor that residents today call le château (the castle). The bay was renamed in 1914, but the name was not officially adopted until 1965 when the place was incorporated.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{association}} for the Auvergne <b>breed</b> is <b>to</b> {{increase the number of}} births by twenty to fifty per year. For this purpose, it proposed in 2006 €150 in assistance for owners of mares close to the characteristics of the <b>breed</b> <b>to</b> encourage them <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> their <b>animals</b> by one of eight approved stallions to cover part of the costs of travel and board for the stallion. The Regional Natural Park of Volcanoes in Auvergne, the National Stud of Aurillac, and the general councils support the association in its actions. In 2008 it created a catalogue of standards to conform <b>to</b> the <b>breed</b> standard and <b>to</b> follow up the herd. In the following year the first competition for appearance for the breed was organized.|$|R
50|$|Animals with {{homogeneous}} appearance, behavior, {{and other}} characteristics {{are known as}} particular breeds, and they are bred through culling animals with particular traits and selecting for further breeding those with other traits. Purebred animals have a single, recognizable breed, and purebreds with recorded lineage are called pedigreed. Crossbreeds are a mix of two purebreds, whereas mixed breeds are a mix of several breeds, often unknown. Animal breeding begins with breeding stock, a group of animals used {{for the purpose of}} planned breeding. When individuals are looking <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> <b>animals,</b> they look for certain valuable traits in purebred stock for a certain purpose, or may intend to use some type of crossbreeding to produce a new type of stock with different, and, it is presumed, superior abilities in a given area of endeavor. For example, to breed chickens, a breeder typically intends to receive eggs, meat, and new, young birds for further reproduction. Thus, the breeder has to study different breeds and types of chickens and analyze what can be expected from a certain set of characteristics before he or she starts breeding them. Therefore, when purchasing initial breeding stock, the breeder seeks a group of birds that will most closely fit the purpose intended.|$|E
40|$|There is {{no obvious}} line or {{boundary}} that separates wild animals {{from those that}} are not wild. Instead, there are expansive grey areas, of which the most conspicuous encompass the domesticated animals that have reverted to a life outside human control, and the undomesticated animals that thrive within human environments. To examine this dynamic, this article looks at “acclimatisation societies,” which first appeared in the nineteenth century. These societies, which flourished particularly in Australia and New Zealand, sought <b>to</b> <b>breed</b> <b>animals</b> to make them more suitable for domestic purposes...|$|E
