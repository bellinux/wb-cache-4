5|$|A {{district}} {{post office}} {{was established in}} 1871 at the railway siding's station house. By 1908 the post office was run from the chapel house in {{the main part of}} the town, and a shop ran from <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> This building was used for around 70 years as a store, telephone exchange, mail exchange and petrol station. The post office closed in 1977 and has not reopened.|$|E
5|$|After the 2002 season, Furniss {{retired from}} baseball, as he promised himself he would {{if he found}} himself unable to advance beyond Class AA. He {{enrolled}} in medical school at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and completed his residency at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. Furniss practices in the Nacogdoches Medical Center, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> where his father practices.|$|E

5|$|Casson {{set up a}} {{residential}} clinic for women with mental disorders at Dorset House in Bristol in 1929 with enough residential space for 800 patients, and she opened the first school of occupational therapy in the UK in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> the following year. She took {{an active role in}} the therapeutic activities at Dorset House, even playing a part in the patient's production of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discontinuation}} {{of internal}} game development at 3D Realms, {{development of the}} game did not cease entirely. Nine ex-employees including key personnel like Allen Blum, continued game development throughout 2009 from their homes. These employees would later become Triptych Games, an independent studio housed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as Gearbox, with whom they collaborated on the project.|$|E
5|$|During 1983–1984, the {{painting}} was exhibited at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell {{the painting}} to Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.|$|E
50|$|In most primary schools, {{the junior}} primary is located within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> and grounds {{as the primary}} school, {{although}} some junior schools are located on an adjacent or separate site.|$|R

50|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Edinburgh {{society in the}} 18th century, often remarked upon by visitors, was the close proximity and social interaction of the various social classes. Tradesmen and professionals shared <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|R
5|$|On January 1, 1974, the Town of Brampton, {{some of the}} Township of Chinguacousy, {{a portion}} of Toronto Township, and most of Toronto Gore Township merged into the City of Brampton. Municipal offices for Brampton were moved to the Civic Centre, and the statue moved into the Chinguacousy branch of the Brampton Library, within <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> Shirley Morriss was the curator of the facility, until 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Nottingham Panthers were revived largely {{thanks to}} the efforts of Gary Keward. In 1980 the Ice Stadium directors, led by Charles Walker, agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance. The Sheffield Lancers, a team Keward helped to run, were {{relocated}} to Nottingham taking the name of the team that had occupied <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> 20 years earlier. On 20 September 1980 the modern Panthers took to the ice for the first time defeating the Solihull Barons 7–4 at the Ice Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{eradication}} campaign {{led to the}} death of Janet Parker (c.1938–1978) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry Bedson (1930–1978). Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as Bedson's smallpox laboratory. She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that Bedson's team had been investigating. Ashamed of the accident and having blamed himself for it, Bedson committed suicide.|$|E

50|$|Sixth Form Government is a {{government}} secondary school offering advanced level studies, situated on Ethel Street, Saint James, Trinidad and Tobago. At night <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> function as <b>the</b> Polytechnic Institute, a night school for adult education.|$|R
5|$|The murder inquiry, codenamed Operation Braid, {{was one of}} {{the largest}} police {{investigations}} ever undertaken in the Bristol area. The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates' family sought assistance from the public through social networking services and press conferences. Rewards amounting to £60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates' death. The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' landlord, who lived in a flat in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> He was subsequently released without charge.|$|E
5|$|While these {{characteristics}} never occur all together in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building,</b> and none {{are unique to}} Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air. Other Baroque characteristics, such as broken pediments over windows, the extravagant use of statuary, and curved topped windows and doors are all emblematic of Baroque architecture, but can all be found on Baroque building all over Europe.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Reykjavík, Fischer gave a press conference. He lived a reclusive life in Iceland, avoiding entrepreneurs {{and others who}} approached him with various proposals. Fischer moved into an apartment in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> as his close friend and spokesman, Garðar Sverrisson. Garðar's wife, Kristín Þórarinsdóttir, was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient. Garðar's two children, especially his son, were very close to Fischer. Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason, a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions {{with him on a}} wide variety of subjects.|$|E
50|$|The {{buildings}} {{began their}} {{life as the}} Christchurch Workhouse, built in 1881. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> were used as a military hospital during both World War I and World War II - several wards were added during this time.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the end of}} Edo period, local kami {{beliefs and}} Buddhism were intimately {{connected}} in what was called shinbutsu shūgō (神仏習合), {{up to the point}} that even <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> were used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{classes were}} offered in {{buildings}} located in downtown Albany. President Lewis Froman received approval in 1957 {{to establish a}} [...] "private junior college" [...] operating on a daytime schedule in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings.</b> In <b>the</b> summer of 1959, the College purchased {{a portion of the}} site of the Albany Home for Children (Now Parson's Child and Family Center) at New Scotland and Academy Road and a year later the entire Albany Division moved to the new campus, continuing to coexist in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> in daytime and evening schedules. In 1962, the Junior College of Albany received its own degree-granting power, and henceforth all associate degrees (day and evening) were awarded through JCA.|$|R
5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> in which federal judges were holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
5|$|In February 2014, Shelbourne sought court {{approval}} {{to take up}} an offer of up to $135million from Atlas Apartment Holdings intended to underpin the project's emergence from bankruptcy, with a deadline of August 31, 2014 for having a court-approved reorganization plan. At a hearing on March 11, 2014, Shelbourne announced that it had reached agreement on a repayment plan with the project's creditors, including Related Midwest, which had bought up much of the project's debt. Assuming the project finds funding to satisfy that agreement, Atlas said that the building would be built and that Atlas would control the project, but that Kelleher would still be the developer, {{with the intention of}} building <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> planned prior to suspension of construction.|$|E
50|$|It was {{formerly}} Darlaston Community Science College {{which had been}} placed into special measures by OFSTED and failed to raise standards in the allotted time. As a result, it was converted into an Academy on 1 September 2009 using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Purpose-designed to {{accommodate}} secondary and technical classes, {{the place is}} important in demonstrating the Queensland Government's initial approach to the provision of secondary and technical education {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, by accommodating both streams in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The newspaper's {{headquarters}} {{has been}} in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> since <b>the</b> beginning of the 20th century, and therefore it is popularly known as [...] "the Via Solferino newspaper" [...] after the street where it is still located. As the name indicates, it was originally an evening paper.|$|R
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a {{downtown}} apartment {{with one of her}} college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the Povey Brothers, worked as a freelance reporter for The Oregonian, and became an illustrator and society editor for the Portland Spectator, a weekly news magazine. Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for The Oregonian—who were interested in journalism and the arts. In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who lived on a houseboat on the Willamette River, collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale ether.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} almost entirely in London. The {{directors}} somewhat followed the filming style of Bharat Nalluri, {{the director of}} the first two episodes of series one and two, who used London and the River Thames as characters in themselves. The exterior and interior of Freemasons' Hall continued to be a stand-in for Thames House, the headquarters of MI5. However, the Grid, the base of operations of Section D, was a set constructed at the fifth floor in another building. Danny's apartment was also filmed in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>building.</b> Another constructed set was the back of mobile surveillance vans, which was housed near the Grid set.|$|E
5|$|St Andrew's Anglican Church {{has three}} {{distinctive}} internal transept arches, and {{was designed by}} a Presbyterian, Alexander Leckie Elphinstone Junior. The foundation stone was laid in 1883, {{and the top of}} the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was indicative of the area's affluence. Recent Asian influences in Summer Hill have brought about the introduction of non-Christian places of worship. The Wong Tai Sin (or Kwan Yin Kur) temple is located on the corners of Kensington Road and Liverpool Road in a building that was a Masonic temple in the 1920s. <b>The</b> <b>same</b> <b>building</b> was converted into the current temple; the lower floor houses the Taoist deity of Wong Tai Sin, and the upper floor houses the Buddhist Bodhisattva of Kwan Yin.|$|E
50|$|QVC has its {{headquarters}} and television studios in West Goshen Township, near West Chester. It {{is located in}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> that were once the corporate headquarters of Commodore International. Electronics Boutique, when it existed as an independent company, had {{its headquarters}} in West Goshen Township, in proximity to West Chester.|$|R
50|$|Salford City College is {{a further}} {{education}} college based in Salford, England. It opened on 1 January 2009, {{as the result of}} a merger between Salford College, Eccles College and Pendleton College to form a 'supercollege'. Salford City College continues to function in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>buildings</b> that <b>the</b> previous colleges had.|$|R
2500|$|Castiglioni did not {{purchase}} BMW's premises in his transaction with Knorr-Bremse. [...] Instead, he merged his Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFw) into BMW {{and established}} BMW's factory and headquarters at BFw's premises.
