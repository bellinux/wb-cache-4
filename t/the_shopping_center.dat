40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to study how <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in Stavanger region coexist with the city, with special focus on the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and <b>the</b> neighborhoods. In addition, the sustainability aspect is examined to this research in order to provide more comprehensive study. The problem statement relies on understanding how <b>the</b> integrated <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> relate to some aspects such as location, density, accessibility, sustainable transport, and to some extent, economy. In order to comply with these objectives, <b>the</b> development of <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in Stavanger region with their classification is generally discussed, and then some specific <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> were selected based on their distinct aspects mentioned above. The discoveries show that the location and the existing neighborhood’s condition influence the relation between <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and <b>the</b> neighborhoods. <b>The</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in a high density and a robust neighborhood indicate more integration and sustainable than <b>the</b> other <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in <b>the</b> opposite situation. However, city regulations may helps {{to reduce the risk of}} disintegration between <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> and <b>the</b> neighborhoods. This thesis concludes that <b>shopping</b> <b>centers</b> in Stavanger region have been attempting to integrate with the neighborhood and trying to achieve sustainable transportation...|$|R

5|$|A {{branch to}} Sola has been {{considered}} to allow the trains to operate to Sola and the airport. The line would branch from the Sørland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include the airport, Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly <b>the</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>center</b> Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes {{from the airport to}} the city center, and 10 minutes from the airport to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed as part of the light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers.|$|E

Lettuce Entertain You who also operates the food court at Water Tower Place will operate a cafe, food court and market. The top floor was to be occupied by Muvico Theaters, however they pulled out in 2009. The David Barton Gym, the first and largest tenant of the Block 37 project, has {{pulled out of the}} project favoring, instead, the Roosevelt Collection in the south loop. The reason the gym opted out was the delayed opening of the mall, which is scheduled for fall 2009 opening rather than fall 2008 as scheduled. In March 2009, Apple Inc. also withdrew from its leasing agreement, and less than a month later it signed an agreement to develop a new storefront in the Clybourn Corridor on property bounded by North Avenue, Halsted Street and Clybourn Avenue. After Apple backed out of its lease, Lululemon backed out of its lease to be located next to Apple. Other March 2009 tenant signings included Chicago's haberdashery Bigsby & Kruthers, Sunglass Hut, crystal jewelers Swarovski, Starfruit Cafe, and Fast-casual eatery Tahini.

25|$|Takoma-Silver Spring High School, {{built in}} 1924, {{was the first}} high school for Silver Spring. The community's rapid growth led {{to the need for}} a larger school. In 1935, when a new high school was built at Wayne Avenue and Sligo Creek Parkway, it was renamed Montgomery Blair High School. (The school {{remained}} at that location for over six decades, until 1998, when it was moved to a new, larger facility at the corner of Colesville Road (U.S. Route 29) and University Boulevard (Maryland Route 193).
