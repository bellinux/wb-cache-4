5|$|By {{the time}} of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body {{responsible}} for local government) was already engaged in a debate {{about the future of the}} city's defensive walls. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. <b>The</b> <b>Bars</b> restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish <b>the</b> <b>Bars</b> and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.|$|E
5|$|In September 1998, Odwalla {{began to}} sell energy bars made with fruit and grains, named food bars, as an {{alternative}} to its drinks in an attempt to raise revenue following the 1996 E.coli outbreak. The first three flavors released were Cranberry Citrus, Organic Carrot & Raisin, and Peach Crunch, all three of which are now discontinued. Within eight weeks of their release, the Odwalla Bar was one of the top-selling energy bar brands in the market. <b>The</b> <b>bars</b> {{come in a variety of}} flavors, and weigh 2 ounces (56grams) per bar. As of 2001, before Odwalla was acquired by Coca-Cola, food bars accounted for less than five percent of Odwalla's revenue.|$|E
5000|$|After <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> is {{initially}} {{inserted into the}} jig, the middle roller is manually lowered and forced against <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> with a screw arrangement.

5|$|Pipeline {{construction}} {{ended in}} 1977, beginning a gradual decline in Fairbanks' economy. The loss of construction spending was mostly offset by state spending. Taxes on oil {{flowing through the}} pipeline were spent on low-interest loans, grants, and business assistance that poured money into the city. To entice businesses to return to downtown Fairbanks, the city demolished many of <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> favored by pipeline workers and attempted to attract a hotel or major business to the location. This effort was unsuccessful, and the land remained vacant until the late 1990s. Redevelopment of the Fairbanks airport was more successful. A new terminal built in 1984 functioned until 2009.|$|E

The ratio of the width of <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of the saltire in relation to the width of the field is specified in heraldry in relation to shield width rather than flag width.

Galatasaray fans attempted to provoke the Arsenal fans in <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> and the two sides began chanting at each other until bottles were thrown from both sides around 16:00. The Danish police then moved in to separate the fans, and moved the Galatasaray fans back towards the square.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of <b>the</b> <b>bars,</b> and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forms of}} {{xylophone}} {{such as the}} atranatrana are found throughout the island and {{are believed to have}} come across with the original Indonesian settlers. The earliest of these is played uniquely by a pair of women, one of whom sits with her legs outstretched together and <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of the xylophone resting across her legs rather than on a separate resonator box. Each woman strikes the atranatrana with a pair of sticks, one keeping the beat while the second plays a melody. The xylophone bars range from five to seven in number and are made of differing lengths of a rot-resistant wood called hazomalagny. A similar xylophone called katiboky is still played in the southwest among the Vezo and Bara ethnic groups.|$|E

5|$|Police {{raids on}} gay bars were frequent—occurring on average {{once a month}} for each bar. Many bars kept extra liquor in a secret panel behind the bar, or in a car down the block, to {{facilitate}} resuming business {{as quickly as possible}} if alcohol was seized. Bar management usually knew about raids beforehand due to police tip-offs, and raids occurred early enough in the evening that business could commence after the police had finished. During a typical raid, the lights were turned on, and customers were lined up and their identification cards checked. Those without identification or dressed in full drag were arrested; others were allowed to leave. Some of the men, including those in drag, used their draft cards as identification. Women were required to wear three pieces of feminine clothing, and would be arrested if found not wearing them. Employees and management of <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> were also typically arrested. The period immediately before June 28, 1969, was marked by frequent raids of local bars—including a raid at the Stonewall Inn on the Tuesday before the riots—and the closing of the Checkerboard, the Tele-Star, and two other clubs in Greenwich Village.|$|E
5|$|The hotel, {{which today}} has 159 rooms, {{was founded in}} 1898 by the Swiss hotelier, César Ritz, in {{collaboration}} with the French chef, Auguste Escoffier. The new hotel was constructed behind the façade of an 18th-century town house, overlooking one of Paris's central squares. It was among the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom en suite, a telephone and electricity for each room. It quickly established a reputation for luxury, with clients including royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel, including Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway, who lived at the hotel for years. One of <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> of the hotel, Bar Hemingway, is devoted to Hemingway. L'Espadon is a world-renowned restaurant, attracting aspiring chefs {{from all over the world}} who come to learn at the adjacent Ritz-Escoffier School. The grandest suite of the hotel, called the Suite Impériale, has been listed by the French government as a national monument in its own right.|$|E

They show a characteristic profile with a maximum, similar to simulated bars forming in isolated galaxies and observed bars in real galaxies. We adopt the maximum of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> mode as a measure of <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> strength and we estimate <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> length by comparing the density profiles along <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and perpendicular to it. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> strength and <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> length decrease with time, mainly at pericentres, as a result of tidal torques acting at those times and not to secular evolution.
