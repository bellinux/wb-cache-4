5|$|As {{the ships}} were {{traveling}} to <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> the heavy seas, {{combined with the}} chaos of the fighting caused most of the landing force to be thrown off-course and most of the 116th Infantry missed its landing spots. Most of the regiment's tank support, launched from too far off-shore, foundered and sank in the channel. The soldiers of the 116th Infantry were the first to hit <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> at 0630, coming under heavy fire from German fortifications. Company A of the 1st Battalion, 116th Infantry, from the Virginia National Guard in Bedford, Virginia was annihilated by overwhelming fire as it landed on the 116th's westernmost section of <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> along with half of Company C of the 2nd Ranger Battalion which was landing {{to the west of the}} 116th. The catastrophic losses suffered by this small Virginia community led to it being selected for the site of the National D-Day Memorial. The 1st Infantry Division's forces ran into similar fortifications on the eastern half of <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> suffering massive casualties coming ashore. By 0830, the landings were called off for lack of space on <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> as the Americans on Omaha Beach were unable to overcome German fortifications guarding <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> exits. Lieutenant General Omar Nelson Bradley, commanding the American First Army, considered evacuating the survivors and landing the rest of the divisions elsewhere. However, by noon, elements of the American forces had been able to organize and advance off <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> and the landings resumed. By nightfall, the division headquarters landed on <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> with about 60 percent of the division's total strength, and began organizing the push inland. On 7 June, a second wave of 20,000 reinforcements from both the 1st and 29th Divisions was sent ashore. By the end of D-Day, 2,400 men from the two divisions had become casualties on Omaha Beach. Added to casualties at other beaches and air-drops made the total casualties for the Normandy landings 6,500 Americans and 3,000 British and Canadians, lighter numbers than expected.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00 448 B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces, {{having already}} {{completed}} one bombing mission over Omaha late the previous day, returned. However, with the skies overcast and under orders to avoid bombing the troops which were by then approaching <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> the bombers overshot their targets {{and only three}} bombs fell near <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> area.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a path between the ridge and <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> After about 30 minutes of firing by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape to <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines made it to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> in effort {{to keep them from}} successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the landing craft and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E
50|$|The Biloxi wade-ins {{were three}} protests that {{occurred}} on <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Biloxi, Mississippi, between 1959 and 1963. The demonstrations {{were led by}} Dr. Gilbert R. Mason, Sr. {{in an effort to}} desegregate <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of <b>the</b> Mississippi Gulf Coast. Before <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> were desegregated homeowners claimed <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> as private property, and although <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> were built by the Army Corps of Engineers using taxpayer funds, African Americans were restricted to designated areas of the beachfront. The effort to keep <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> segregated was supported by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beaches</b> of Karpathos island can {{be divided}} into four large groups: <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> on <b>the</b> east coast are smaller and gravelly but without wind; <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of <b>the</b> {{southern}} part of the island, near the airport, area made of fine white sand; <b>the</b> sandy <b>beach</b> on <b>the</b> west coast are the most exposed to the Meltemi and they are only available in low wind conditions; <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of <b>the</b> north of the island, accessible only by sea and partly by a jeep.|$|R

5|$|The second wave, {{scheduled}} for 06:35, consisted of 32 LCVPs carrying four more companies of 8th Infantry, {{as well as}} combat engineers and naval demolition teams that were to clear <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> of obstacles. The third wave, {{scheduled for}} 06:45, consisted of eight LCTs bringing more DD tanks plus armored bulldozers to assist in clearing paths off <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> It was to be followed at 06:37 by the fourth wave, which had eight Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) and three LCVPs with detachments of the 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions, assigned to clear <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> between {{the high and low}} water marks.|$|E
5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> {{he found that}} the machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 {{but there was no sign}} of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches to <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and then fired off an emergency signal flare; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff.|$|E
5|$|Today at Omaha jagged {{remains of}} the harbor {{can be seen at}} low tide. The shingle bank is no longer there, cleared by {{engineers}} in the days following D-Day to facilitate the landing of supplies. The beachfront is more built-up and <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> road extended, villages have grown and merged, but the geography of <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> remains as it was and the {{remains of the}} coastal defenses can still be visited. At the top of the bluff overlooking Omaha near Colleville is the American cemetery. In 1988, particles of shrapnel, as well as glass and iron beads resulting from munitions explosions were found in the sand of <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> and the study of them estimated that those particles would remain in the sand of <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> for one to two centuries.|$|E
50|$|Adjoining Sea Point is Three Anchor Bay. <b>The</b> <b>beaches</b> {{along this}} stretch {{are in the}} main covered with mussel shells thrown up by the ocean, unlike <b>the</b> <b>beaches</b> of Clifton and Camps Bay, which are sandy.

5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> was possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> was left uncovered, and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E
