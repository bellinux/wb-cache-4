5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school. Once children have developed a vocabulary, they utilize the sounds that they already know <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this {{is the result of a}} direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Dan {{can visit}} merchants known as 'Spivs' to buy {{additional}} ammunition and services. He {{can also get}} advice from his ghost sidekick named Winston <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> moves or to save the player's game between longer levels. Similar to the previous game, Dan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It also depletes completely if he drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game restarts from the last known save point. Dan can refill his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which automatically refill his health if it is depleted. Whilst defeating enemies, Dan's Chalice of Souls will gradually fill up, which can then be collected and traded with Professor Kift to unlock new weapons and items.|$|E

5|$|Musical notes {{return in}} Banjo-Tooie, but are now used <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> moves from Bottles' brother, the drill {{sergeant}} Jamjars, who assumes Bottles' role {{from the first}} game. All of Banjo and Kazooie's moves from the first game are immediately accessible in Banjo-Tooie, and the player can acquire several new moves such as first-person aiming, new egg types, {{and the ability to}} play as Banjo and Kazooie separately, with each gaining moves they can only use while on their own. Mumbo Jumbo also returns, this time as a playable character who can venture out into each world and use specific magic spells to help Banjo and Kazooie proceed. Taking over Mumbo's previous role of transforming the duo into different forms is Humba Wumba, a Native American woman who acts as Mumbo's rival.|$|E

25|$|Waterlining is slacklining over water. This is {{an ideal}} way <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> tricks, or to just have more fun. Common places to set up waterlines are over pools, lakes, rivers, creeks, between pier or {{railroad}} track pillars, and boat docks. The slackline {{can be set up}} high over the surface of the water, close to the surface or even underneath the surface. It is important, however, that the water be deep enough, free from obstacles, and that the area should not be travelled by boats.|$|E

3000|$|When {{developers}} adopt a framework, {{the need}} <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a <b>new</b> programming language adds <b>to</b> the initial <b>learning</b> curve. Most Qt adopters have <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a <b>new</b> language, since Qt uses a proprietary language, QML. According to practitioners, if a developer needs <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a <b>new</b> language, {{this is a}} possible negative factor against selecting the framework. This learning curve from a new programming language was also experienced in the student survey. In general, most students were willing to invest in learning: 56.8 % wanted <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a <b>new</b> framework during the course. However, some students felt it took too much time <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> QML, {{despite the fact that}} QML resembles JavaScript and thus was designed to be relatively easy to adopt for UI developers. According to one student, [...] "a fundamental issue, like how to add functionality to QML elements, required several hours of brainwork [to learn]". Similarly, some students were not familiar with C++ and reported having difficulties every time they had to write their applications in C++.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{the games}} in SSI's Gold Box series, {{character}} generation is greatly simplified. The player chooses a name, by which they are known throughout the game. There is no race, class or skill selection, and play begins immediately. The single-player character begins the game as a second-level corsair, whose statistics are predetermined; the player cannot upgrade the character's weapons and armor. The character earns experience points by solving puzzles and finishing quests, some of which do not involve combat. The character gains levels in exchange for experience points; gaining levels increases hit points, and grants the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> skills for combat.|$|E

25|$|Reduced {{mental and}} {{cognitive}} ability may afflict old age.Memory loss {{is common in}} old age due to the decrease in speed of information being encoded, stored, and retrieved. It takes more time <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> information. Dementia is a general term for memory loss and other intellectual abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Its prevalence increases in old age from about 10% at age 65 to about 50% over age 85. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50 to 80 percent of dementia cases. Demented behavior can include wandering, physical aggression, verbal outbursts, depression, and psychosis.|$|E

Old bricks, salvaged from demolished buildings in the area, {{were used in the}} restoration of two sets of windows. The building originally had four arched windows; however these were replaced in 1914 by larger arched windows. The reconstruction of these windows was part of the restoration project. Deteriorated samples of the paintwork were studied in order to duplicate the original colours. The roof was restored to its original state using tools that had been used for the original construction. 21 000 fibrous cement slate tiles were laid on the steep roof.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge never {{completed}} a formal education, {{as he left}} school at an early age. However, he has a sharp mind and is always ready <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> skills. Because of his secondary occupation as a treasure hunter, Scrooge {{has become something of}} a scholar and an amateur archaeologist. Starting with Barks, several writers have explained how Scrooge becomes aware of the treasures he decides to pursue. This often involves periods of research consulting various written sources in search of passages that might lead him to a treasure. Often Scrooge decides to search for the possible truth behind old legends, or discovers obscure references to the activities of ancient conquerors, explorers and military leaders that he considers interesting enough to begin a new expedition.|$|E
5000|$|Mastery {{learning}} is a method of instruction in which students thoroughly learn all material they are studying. Students do not progress on <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>new</b> material until they have mastered current material. This gives students a feeling of control, and indeed, of mastery. In language learning this is particularly important, as this feeling of control {{is directly related to}} the ability <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> This is demonstrated by Krashen's research on the [...] "affective filter".|$|R

25|$|For {{a dog to}} be {{considered}} for a Police Department, they must first pass a basic obedience training course. They must be able to obey the commands of their handler without hesitation. This allows the officer to have complete control over how much force the dog should use against a suspect. Dogs trained in Europe are usually given commands in the country's native language. Dogs are initially trained with this language for basic behavior, so, it is easier for the officer <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> words/commands, rather than retraining the dog to new commands. This is contrary to the popular belief that Police Dogs are trained in a different language so that a suspect cannot command the dog against the officer.|$|E
25|$|Helminths {{may cause}} iron-deficiency anemia. This is most severe in heavy {{hookworm}} infections, as Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale feed {{directly on the}} blood of their hosts. Although the daily consumption of an individual worm (0.02–0.07 ml and 0.14–0.26 ml respectively) is small, the collective consumption under heavy infection can be clinically significantly. Intestinal whipworm may also cause anemia. Anemia has also been associated with reduced stamina for physical labor, {{a decline in the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> information, and apathy, irritability, and fatigue. A study of the effect of deworming and iron supplementation in 47 students from the Democratic Republic of the Congo found that the intervention improved cognitive function. Another study found that in 159 Jamaican schoolchildren, deworming led to better auditory short-term memory and scanning and retrieval of long-term memory over a period of nine-weeks.|$|E
25|$|The in-game {{economy in}} Eve Online {{is an open}} economy that is largely player-driven. Non-player {{character}} (NPC) merchants sell skill books used by players <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>new</b> skills and blueprints to manufacture ships and modules. NPC merchants also buy and sell Trade Goods. Some Trade Goods are only for trade between NPC merchants while others have a functional use and are not good for trade with NPC's. The characters themselves gather the necessary raw materials to manufacture {{almost all of the}} ships and ship modules in the game. NPC ships can be looted and salvaged for items and materials. Non-player created ships and equipment may be purchased from various NPC factions as a character gains status with them, and can be resold in the in-game economy.
