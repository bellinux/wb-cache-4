As I remember this first experience, it took place about a week before Christmas, but we still hadn 2 ̆ 7 t found a Christmas tree that we liked. It was then that we 2 ̆ 2 menfolks 2 ̆ 2 decided to get our own tree. I {{was eight years old}} at the time and Sarge was ten. As we started out - the three of us for Dad was to chaperon the adventure - it was decided that Sarge, since he was the older, should carry the axe, while I might carry the rusty and almost <b>toothless</b> <b>saw.</b> Dad, of course, would carry nothing - the head of the family shouldn 2 ̆ 7 t be so weighted down...|$|E
