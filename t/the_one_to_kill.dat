The three escape as Dalmascan Resistance forces assault the palace, and in the sewers they meet the Resistance leader, Amalia, before being captured by Archadian forces. Detained in the Nalbina dungeons, they meet Basch, who was imprisoned but not killed, and who states his twin brother Gabranth was <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the king. The four escape together {{with the help of}} Penelo, and flee to the floating city of Bhujerba.|$|E

25|$|Roberts {{then ran}} into a back storage corridor, where he {{encountered}} employee Rok Sang Kim, who had returned from recycling boxes and therefore hadn't heard the gunfire. Roberts pointed the rifle at him, but didn't shoot him, instead running {{down a flight of}} stairs onto a lower floor. There, he committed suicide at 3:50p.m. In the chaos of the first few minutes after the shooting, there were expectations of mass casualties. Police responded to the scene minutes later and spent the following hours searching the mall for hiding civilians, injured victims, and a possible second shooter, while dozens of ambulances arrived with the expectations of treating dozens of wounded victims, but treated only Kristina Shevchenko for a serious gunshot wound. Roberts fired only seventeen rounds during the entire shooting, including <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> himself. An additional 128 rounds were found in the magazines he dropped and on his person.|$|E

25|$|The {{truth about}} Dumbledore's death is {{revealed}} through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore {{made a terrible}} error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use {{to allow him to}} apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, {{all he could do was}} contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had little more than a year to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time came because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him and for the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.|$|E

She is interrupted by Madame Kovarian and agents of the Silence. [...] Kovarian tells River that she is still theirs, and will be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the Doctor.

Their conversation is interrupted by a car's horn honking - running outside, Aslam is ambushed by Akbar after discovering the body of Dedh Tang, who has been killed by Shoaib for aiding the couple in their escape. Aslam, though injured and initially losing the fight, kills Akbar with a shovel. He calls Khan {{to tell him that}} the murder of Dedh Tang has, in effect, erased his deep-seated loyalty to his former boss. Khan responds by telling Aslam that sending Akbar was a mistake, as he must be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the man he views as also having betrayed him by [...] "stealing" [...] Jasmine.|$|E

500|$|Alongside the single-player mode is {{an online}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which allows players {{to compete in}} several maps. In each multiplayer match, there are two enemy teams: four survivors and four scavengers, and there are three types of games for multiplayer to compete in, played in five different maps: the modes are Team Deathmatch, Private Rescue and Cry for Help. The first mode is a simple PvP combat scenario, with teams pitted against each other, and the winning team being <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> the opposing team in three separate matches. In the second mode, the [...] "survivors" [...] team must take medical supplies to a specific point on the map, while the [...] "scavengers" [...] must reach {{a certain number of}} kills, both within a ten-minute time limit. The third mode, Cry for Help, involves the [...] "survivors" [...] exploring the maps and retrieving batteries for defended radio beacons while being hunted by the [...] "scavengers". Across all three modes, weapons and destroyable environments from the single-player campaign are carried over.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{elements}} which localize the narrative landscape, {{the collection of}} objects handled by the destitute prince throughout his quest is seen by Bădărău as an essence of [...] "archaic civilization" [...] and [...] "forgotten tradition", culminating in the grant of a backsword, the [...] "symbol of knightly valor." [...] In Mircea Braga's view, {{many of them are}} means to a goal, which [...] "can be 'lost' without consequence for the later development of the narrative, as happens, for instance, with the helmet and sword of Statu-Palmă-Barbă-Cot". The animals themselves behave as he they supposed to, changing their behavior {{for the benefit of the}} plot: [...] "the extraordinary horse will not be able to prevent getting lost in the forest" [...] and [...] "is not able to prevent the Bald Man's ruse", but [...] "he will lead , without straying, to Holy Sunday's house" [...] and [...] "shall become <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> [...]" [...] Basing himself on previous studies, Braga also concludes that the bearing of hunting-related symbolism on both the quests and the objects serving to overcome them is a clue to the ancient origin of the tale. In the view of comparatist Liliana Vernică, these items represent several aspects of the universe. Thus, the objects inherited from the king are supposed to symbolize [...] "nature" [...] and [...] "the father's virtues: intelligence (the horse), beauty (the clothes), virility (the weapons) and self-restraint (the bridle)." ...|$|E
60|$|It is true, before man had sinned, it {{was ordained}} to be unto life; but since, {{and because of}} sin, the God of love gave the word of grace. Take the law, then, as God hath {{established}} it; to wit, to condemn all flesh (Gal 3:21); {{and then there is}} room for the promise and the law, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill,</b> the other to heal; and so the law is not against the promises; but make the law a justifier, and faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect (Rom 4:14); and the everlasting gospel, by so doing, thou endeavourest to root out of the world. Methinks, since it hath pleased God to reject the law and the righteousness thereof for life, such dust and ashes as we are should strive to consent to his holy will, especially when in the room of this [covenant] of works there is established a better covenant, and that upon better promises. The Lord hath rejected the law, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof; for, finding fault with them of the law, 'The days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel,' &c. (Heb 8:8). Give God leave to find fault with us, and to condemn our personal performances to death, as to our justification before him thereby; let him do it, I say; and the rather, because he doth by the gospel present us with a better. And certainly, if ever he be pleased with us, it will be when he findeth us in that righteousness that is of his own appointing.|$|E

However, in the 12-parter The Darkest Star, it transpires that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>kill</b> {{him was the}} Gronk himself; changed into a form designed by a cadre of Lyran necromancers to bring him endless agony, Alpha asked his friend to end his torment.|$|R
