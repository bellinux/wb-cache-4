5|$|There {{are many}} more {{citizens}} who live in areas corresponding <b>to</b> <b>classes</b> 1–3 than {{those who live in}} the areas corresponding <b>to</b> <b>classes</b> 5 and 6. For example, in Bogotá 73% of the population live in zones of classes 1–3, whereas only 10% live in zones classified as 5 and 6. Consequently, the tariff system permanently causes deficits which require subsidies paid by the national government.|$|E

Access to credit {{is based on}} reasonable terms, such as the group lending system and weekly-instalment payments, with reasonably long terms of loans, enabling the poor to build on their existing skills to earn better income in each cycle of loans.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 2,000 {{gathered}} on campus {{on the evening}} of Friday, February 15, for a candlelight vigil to commemorate the victims; among other public figures, Jesse Jackson and Robert W. Pritchard spoke. In the days after the shooting, the Lutheran Campus Ministry held nightly candlelight vigils. All classes and athletic events were canceled through February 24, 2008. Faculty and staff returned to work on Tuesday, February 19, and for the remainder of that week received special information and training to help students upon their return <b>to</b> <b>classes</b> the following week.|$|E

5|$|William Stokoe {{proposed}} that these components are {{analogous to the}} phonemes of spoken languages. There {{has also been a}} proposal that these are analogous <b>to</b> <b>classes</b> like place and manner of articulation. As in spoken languages, these phonological units can be split into distinctive features. For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by {{the presence or absence of}} the feature , as illustrated to the right. ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions. There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of syllables in spoken language.|$|E
5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} {{hypothesized}} that schizophrenia {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term <b>to</b> <b>classes</b> of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did not confirm this.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, broke into a building he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 time-sharing computer system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going <b>to</b> <b>classes,</b> instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E

25|$|Thus phonetic series can {{be placed}} into classes, {{depending}} on the range of Middle Chinese initials found in them, and these classes are presumed to correspond <b>to</b> <b>classes</b> of Old Chinese initials.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the other}} Webb compounds, they proved problematic, so in 1904 George Whale began {{rebuilding}} these to simple expansion engines.

25|$|C++ {{introduces}} {{object-oriented programming}} (OOP) features to C.

Nearly 6,000 students live within one-and-a-half miles of campus. 3,800 students, including over half of all freshmen, live in UIC's 10 residence halls.

25|$|In other {{languages}} – including most Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages – third-person personal pronouns (at least those {{used to refer}} to people) intrinsically distinguish male from female. This feature commonly co-exists with a full system of grammatical gender, where all nouns are assigned <b>to</b> <b>classes</b> such as masculine, feminine and neuter. However in some languages, such as English, this general system of noun gender has been lost, but gender distinctions are preserved in the third-person pronouns (the singular pronouns only, in the case of English).|$|E

25|$|A shallow minor of a graph G is a {{minor in}} which the edges of G that were {{contracted}} to form the minor form a collection of disjoint subgraphs with low diameter.
