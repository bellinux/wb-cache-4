40|$|PG Takalar is one {{of sugar}} factory in South Sulawesi which has {{enormous}} potential of sugarcane litter. Sugarcane litter is organic waste that could be processed into organic fertilizer in form of compost. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the potential of sugarcane litter and to determine the machinery requirement for sugarcane litter management in PG Takalar. The result showed that the average availability potential of sugarcane litter in PG Takalar was 19. 96 % or 20 % from each stem of sugarcane. In total, with 4186 ha area of PG Takalar, the potential of sugarcane litter was 32860 ton/year. Nowadays, in PG Takalar, the management of sugarcane litter is done conventionally by burning the litter in the field. It is also found from the study that to manage the sugarcane litter in 4186 ha area, the number of machinery needed to support the mechanization of sugarcane litter management were 48 units of tractor, 13 units of <b>trash</b> <b>rake,</b> 31 units of trailer, 4 units of applicator, 18 units of chopper, 3 units of truck, 3 units of composting turner, and 3 units of loader...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Sugar cane {{plantation}} {{have the}} potential to produce organic fertilizers such as compost from organic waste litter cane. Based on research conducted by Toharisman (1991), litter weight of harvested sugar cane reach 20 - 25 tons/ha. Litter is made up of the wood on the leaves, shoots, and sugarcane are not transported to the factory. Untapped potential by sugar cane plantations in an effort to increase sugar production. It is seen by still doing the burning litter after several days of logging process, because litter can interfere with the operation of equipment and machinery at the time of land preparation. To manage the litter on dry land sugarcane plantations needed mechanization for the activities to be carried out is a strenuous activity both on land and in composting house. The mechanization is technology that serves to manage litter cane into compost whom give benefit to the soil and sugar cane. Tools and equipment for composting such as; tractor, <b>trash</b> <b>rake,</b> trailer, composting turner, loaders, trucks, chopper, and composting house. PG Takalar is one of sugar factory in South Sulawesi which has enormous potential of sugarcane litter. Sugarcane litter is organic waste that could be processed into organic fertilizer in form of compost. The objectives of this study were to determine the potential of sugarcane litter and the machinery requirement for sugarcane litter management in PG Takalar. The study begins by identifying mechanical equipment in plantation to support the system of management litter cane, then test the performance of the mechanical equipment, analyze the requirement of mechanical equipment, costs and economic viability of the sugar cane litter management. The result showed that the average availability potential of sugarcane litter in PG Takalar was 19. 96...|$|E
