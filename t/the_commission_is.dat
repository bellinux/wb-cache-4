Since its inception, the Commission has constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries and numerous memorials. <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> currently {{responsible for the}} care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than 200memorials worldwide. In addition to commemorating Commonwealth military service members, the Commission maintains, under arrangement with applicable governments, over 40,000 non-Commonwealth war graves and over 25,000 non-war military and civilian graves. The Commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states: United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India and South Africa. The current President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.|$|E

5|$|The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is {{the highest}} internal-control {{institution}} of the Communist Party of China (CPC), tasked with enforcing internal rules and regulations and combating corruption and malfeasance in the Party. Since {{the vast majority of}} officials at all levels of government are also Communist Party members, <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>is</b> in practice the top anti-corruption body in China.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of staff were {{retained}} at <b>the</b> Audit <b>Commission</b> to monitor these contracts until <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> abolished.

5000|$|The Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> Professor Hugh Clegg, {{and it was}} {{therefore}} {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Clegg Commission". <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> disbanded by <b>the</b> incoming government of Margaret Thatcher. She complained to Clegg in May 1979 that <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> did not take into account questions of efficiency and overmanning, and felt that <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> effectively placed inflationary pressures on the government wage-bill. <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> abolished in 1980.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} {{responsible for}} the continued commemoration of 1.7million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153countries and approximately 67,000civilians who {{died as a result}} of enemy action during World War II. Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> currently {{responsible for the}} care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200memorials worldwide. The vast majority of burial sites are pre-existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in the United Kingdom, however the Commission has itself constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries worldwide. The Commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave; the largest of these is the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E

5000|$|Shaftesbury was {{the head}} of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> from its {{founding}} in 1845 until his death in 1885. <b>The</b> Lunacy <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> made up of eleven Metropolitan Commissioners. <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>was</b> monumental as it was not only a full-time <b>commission,</b> but it <b>was</b> also salaried for six of its members. The six members of <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> that <b>were</b> full-time and salaried were made up of three members of the legal system and three members of the medical community. The other five members of <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>were</b> all honorary members that simply had to attend board meetings.

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> the {{executive}} branch, {{the candidates are}} chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Amarillo {{became the}} first Texas city and the fifth in United States to use the council-manager form of {{municipal}} government, with all governmental powers resting in a legislative body, called a council (before 2014, it was called a commission). Amarillo's commission is composed of five elected commissioners, {{one of whom is}} the mayor of the city. The mayor and each commissioner serves a two-year term. The role of <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>is</b> to pass ordinances and resolutions, adopt regulations, and appoint city officials, including the city manager. While the mayor serves as a presiding officer of the commission, the city manager is the administrative head of the municipal government and is responsible for the administration of all departments. The city commission holds its regular meetings on Tuesday of each week.|$|E
5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} of the portrait. He befriended Ingres either through his son Édouard Bertin, a student of the painter, or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journals art critic. In either case the genesis of <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a {{supporter}} of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. Ingres was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>commission</b> <b>was</b> critiqued by Haitian {{groups for}} lacking Haitian civil society {{representation}} and accountability mechanisms. Half the representation on <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>was</b> given to foreigners who effectively bought their seats by pledging certain amounts of money. An international development consultant contracted by <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>was</b> quoted as saying, “Look, {{you have to}} realize <b>the</b> IHRC <b>commission</b> <b>was</b> not intended to work as a structure or entity for Haiti or Haitians.

5|$|The Albany Port District Commission is {{a public}} benefit {{corporation}} created {{by the state of}} New York to develop and manage port facilities anywhere in the cities of Albany and Rensselaer. The commission has five members, four of which are nominated by the mayor of Albany and one is nominated by the mayor of Rensselaer. The governor of New York then appoints them to three-year terms.

5|$|The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is an {{intergovernmental}} organisation of six independent member states whose principal {{function is to}} mark, record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members {{who died in the}} two World Wars. <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>is</b> also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who {{died as a result of}} enemy action during World War II. The Commission was founded by Fabian Ware and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission. The change to the present name took place in 1960.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>commission</b> <b>is</b> {{thought by}} some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state {{sponsors}} of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a national missile defense system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E
