5|$|During the night, the American artillery, {{under the}} command of Henry Knox, {{occasionally}} fired shells into Trenton to keep the British on edge. As Cornwallis had, Washington also called for a council of war. Using the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there. By 2am on January 3, the army {{was on its way to}} Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires burning and to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> digging in. By morning, these men too had evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of the American troops were gone.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{primitive}} marginocephalians were bipedal or facultative quadrupedal, and derived {{individuals were}} obligate quadrupedal. This is especially prominent in Ceratopsia, where only the primitive Psittacosaurus is bipedal. All the derived forms were strong quadrupeds, although their stance is controversial. Some <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> fairly columnar, with front limbs erect under the body, {{which would have}} been more efficient for speed. Others think the legs were more sprawling, as evidenced by the shape of the forelimb bones. Although not as fast, this posture would have been efficient for grazing vegetation on the ground. Less is known about bipedal pachycephalosaur locomotion, although they must have had a fairly broad girth in order to make room for their enlarged gut.|$|E

25|$|There {{seemed very}} {{little hope of}} native Christians {{receiving}} anything through the instrumentality of their officials, nor did the foreign powers <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> called upon to provide indemnity for these. All {{the survivors of the}} churches were reduced to absolute poverty. They were harmless, inoffensive people who had no feuds with their neighbors and had not intruded their religion on any one. This at least was true of the Protestant Christians. If a missionary, by means of his personal influence and by the assistance of the local official who might be friendly to him, could bring the neighbors of his persecuted people to see the error of their ways, and persuade them to contribute money for the rebuilding of destroyed houses and for the support of the survivors of the families, I think he was justified in so doing.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{gathered at}} Plymouth, England on 14 September 1585 with Sir Francis Drake {{in command of}} twenty one ships with 1,800 soldiers under Christopher Carleill. Sailing from Plymouth he first attacked Vigo in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. Drake however intended {{this to be a}} diversionary raid where it was hoped to trick the Spanish to <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not heading towards the Caribbean, by doing this he had already made sure his presence was felt at Las Palmas in the Canary islands. After taking on water from the undefended La Gomera island, he continued his voyage, heading south towards the former Portuguese Cape Verde Islands. By virtue of the Iberian Union, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 was in abeyance, and the commencement of war with Spain, Portuguese colonies and ships were now a target for the English.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} those aboard Voyager {{incorrectly}} assessed {{their position in}} relation to the carrier was most prominently supported by Robertson during the first commission: he suggested that Stevens and the others aboard the destroyer may have believed that they were on Melbournes port bow. The navigational lights aboard Melbourne may have been dimmed (there is disagreement on this point), and experimental red floodlights on the flight deck may have been seen and misinterpreted as a port-side navigation light. The second Royal Commission felt that this, combined with the ill health of Stevens, was the more likely cause of the collision. Frame states that for this theory to be plausible, the entire bridge crew had to lose the tactical picture at the same time, which he considered to be too improbable. Ferry is also of the opinion that, unless Melbourne was both in Voyagers radar blind spot and obscured by exhaust from the destroyer, it was unlikely that the bridge crew would <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not to starboard of the carrier.|$|E
25|$|On 1 July 1806, Stuart's force {{including}} 16 guns {{landed in}} the northern part of the Gulf of Santa Eufemia. The location was designed to split Reynier's forces so that they could be destroyed piece by piece. To confuse the French, the 20th Foot landed farther south in a feint attack. Immediately after landing, the Corsican Rangers headed inland, but they soon bumped into three companies of Polish legionaries who chased them back toward the beach. The 78th Foot and elements of the 1/58th Foot and 1/81st Foot reinforced the Corsicans and they drove off the Poles. The Advanced Guard marched inland to occupy Nicastro while the rest of Stuart's command camped on the beach. The troops constructed a fortified camp facing south near the village of Sant'Eufemia. To the north was rough terrain dominated by Calabrian partisans, while a coastal plain stretched to the south, the direction from which the French would probably approach. About 200 Calabrian guerillas under a man named Cancellier joined Stuart, but the Britisher did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> very useful.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} in April 2017, just before the 10th anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the [...] "burglary gone wrong" [...] hypothesis, while adding that it is [...] "not entirely ruled out". Referring to the suspects {{who might have been}} involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had [...] "pretty much closed off that group of people". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of remaining inquiries that they believe are significant: [...] "If we didn't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> significant, we wouldn't be carrying on." [...] Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard is looking for a woman who was seen near 5A {{at the time of the}} disappearance.|$|E

500|$|The {{downloadable}} episode Turnabout Reclaimed {{was written}} by the game designer Yuki Nakamura, {{with the concept of}} [...] "lighthearted fun" [...] to set it apart from the main game. The first thing she decided on was to feature an orca, and have the story take place in an aquarium; it took her several tries to decide {{on the rest of the}} story. One of the scrapped ideas involved the orca stealing treasures from the aquarium and attacking people by the shore during its escape to the sea, with the episode's mystery involving the reason for the orca's behavior. The opening for this draft would have involved guards and detective Fulbright vaguely referring to someone escaping; the intention was that the player would <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> talking about Blackquill, before it was revealed to be the orca.|$|E
500|$|Beck began {{life in a}} {{rooming house}} near {{downtown}} Los Angeles. As a child, {{he lived in a}} declining neighborhood just off Hollywood Boulevard. [...] "By the time we left there, they were ripping out miles of houses en masse and building low-rent, giant apartment blocks," [...] he later recalled. The lower-class family struggled financially, moving to Hoover and Ninth Street, a neighborhood populated primarily by Koreans and Salvadorian refugees. He was sent for a time to live with his paternal grandparents in Kansas, with Beck later remarking that [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> kind of concerned" [...] about his [...] "weird" [...] home life. Since his paternal grandfather was a Presbyterian minister, Beck grew up influenced by church music and hymns. Beck also spent time in Europe with his maternal grandfather, Al Hansen, a visual collage artist and a pioneer in the avant-garde Fluxus movement.|$|E
500|$|Julia Louis-Dreyfus {{expressed}} interest in the role, but ABC executives felt she was not right for the part. Actors originally considered for the role include Courteney Cox, Calista Flockhart, Heather Locklear, Mary-Louise Parker, and Sela Ward. Cherry wrote the part with Parker in mind, but she rejected the offer, later explaining [...] "it just didn’t feel like I was gonna [...] serve {{it as well as}} someone else might". Teri Hatcher auditioned for the role in January 2004 and impressed Cherry immediately. After a second audition, Hatcher read for the role in front of network executives. Cherry praised her performance, saying [...] "it was the best audition I've ever seen in network". Hatcher later commented, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> hot to hire me for Susan... I was maybe on a B-list, certainly not an A-list". Despite her reservations, Hatcher was the third reported cast member to have been cast in the series on February 18, 2004.|$|E

500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky—let them do whatever they want.' ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth it just for the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a lot of these action things with people dying and never addressing them. So I thought it was very interesting to do so".|$|E

She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude. Hughes said: [...] "She’s the first horse who has made me feel lucky to be her owner." [...] Mandella quipped, [...] "We didn’t think she would do it quite like that. We thought it was the girls she was picking on." [...] and added later, [...] "I think the boys pissed her off. I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> telling sexist jokes on the backside." [...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic.
