25|$|In {{white wine}} production, {{pressing}} usually takes place immediately after crushing or/and before primary fermentation. In red wine production, the grapes are also crushed but pressing usually doesn't take place till after {{or near the}} end of fermentation with the time of skin contact between the juice and grapes leaching color, tannins and other phenolics from the skin. Approximately 60-70% of the available juice within the grape berry, the free-run juice, can be released by the crushing process and doesn't require the use of the press. The remaining 30-40% that comes from pressing can have higher pH levels, lower <b>titratable</b> <b>acidity,</b> potentially higher volatile acidity and higher phenolics than the free-run juice depending on the amount of pressure and tearing of the skins and will produce more astringent, bitter wine.|$|E
25|$|The pH {{level of}} a wine is the {{measurement}} {{of the amount of}} free (H+) hydrogen ions. It is related to the <b>titratable</b> <b>acidity</b> {{level of a}} wine but differs in significant ways. Low pH numbers indicate a high concentration of acids in a solution. While pure water is neutral with a pH of 7, wine tends to be more acidic with a pH between 3 and 4. As the acid levels in ripening grapes fall, the concentration of acids are lessening which means the pH level is rising. Yeasts, bacteria, phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins which influence color all have varying tolerance to wines with high pH levels. In general, wines with high pH value tend to have duller colors and less developed flavors and be more prone to wine faults caused by spoilage organisms which makes monitoring the pH levels of grapes during ripening a priority for viticulturists and winemakers.|$|E

40|$|Thirteen {{varieties}} of cabbage, including five commonly used commercial varieties and eight newly developed hybrids, were analyzed {{for their ability}} to undergo lactic acid fermentations. The rates of fermentation, total quantities of acids produced, and chemical analyses indicate that 11 of the 13 selections could support adequate fermentation at any of the three stages of maturation. However, two varieties G 27 × G 51 (105) and G 60 × W- 1 (106), harvested during the earlier phases of the 1967 and 1968 growing seasons, failed to undergo proper fermentations and consistently resulted in producing putrid products. These hybrids when harvested at the late stage of maturation were capable of producing total <b>titratable</b> <b>acidities</b> comparable to the acceptable varieties. However the resulting sauerkrauts were judged to be of poor quality. The inability of these varieties to support adequate fermentations may be due to growth inhibitory substances or the lack of inherent maturation-dependent growth factor(s) essential for the growth of lactic acid bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} schwertmannite (Fe 8 (OH) 5. 5 (SO 4) 1. 25), {{a result}} of acid sulfate soils (ASS) oxidation and severe acidification, {{has been identified as}} a labile source of iron, sulfate and acidity. Schwertmannite forms surface accumulations on coastal flood plains of eastern Australia. These flood plains are subject to wild fire events and fire-stick farming practices. Four samples of naturally occurring schwertmannite, from New South Wales coastal catchments, were converted to hematite by controlled heating. Complete conversion of schwertmannite to hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) occurred after exposure to temperatures of ≥ 500 oC. The unheated schwertmannite and corresponding hematite samples were analysed for soluble <b>acidity</b> and <b>Titratable</b> Actual <b>Acidity</b> (TAA). In addition to acidity, the samples were measured for pH, EC and dissolved and total metals and cations. The schwertmannite and hematite samples were characterised by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) 2 ̆ 6 Energy Dispersive X-ray micro-analysis (EDX), powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), LECO, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and Fourier Transform InfRared (FTIR). The hematite presented as a pseudomorph after schwertmannite. The schwertmannite contain appreciable amounts of soluble <b>acidity</b> and <b>titratable</b> actual <b>acidity.</b> The hematite contained no acidity measurable as soluble <b>acidity</b> and or <b>titratable</b> actual <b>acidity.</b> Theoretical acid loads have been calculated and the environmental implications of fire in areas containing schwertmannite accumulations are discussed. This study provides the first evidence of schwertmannite transformation to hematite as {{a result of}} wild fire events and therefore presents an original and significant insight into the iron cycle in ASS landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Improvements to {{the routine}} methods for the {{determination}} of actual acidity in suspension for acid sulfate soils (ASS) are introduced. The <b>titratable</b> sulfidic <b>acidity</b> (TSA) results using an improved peroxide-based method were compared with the theoretical acidity predicted by the chromium reducible sulfur method for 9 acid sulfate soils. The regression between these 2 measures of sulfidic acidity was highly significant, {{the slope of the}} regression line not significantly different from unity (P = 0. 05) and the intercept not significantly different from zero. This contrasts with results of other workers using earlier peroxide oxidation methods, where TSA substantially underestimated the theoretical acidity predicted by reduced inorganic sulfur analysis. Comparison was made between the 2 principal measurements from the improved peroxide method (TSA and S-POS), with S-POS converted to theoretical sulfidic acidity to allow comparison. The relationship between these 2 measurements was highly significant. The effects of titration in suspension, as well as raising titration end points to pH 6. 5, were investigated, principally with respect to the <b>titratable</b> actual <b>acidity</b> (TAA) result. TAA results obtained by KCl extraction were compared with those obtained using BaCl 2, MgCl 2, and water extraction. TAA in 1 M KCl suspensions titrated to pH 6. 5 agreed well with <b>titratable</b> actual <b>acidity</b> measured using the 25 -h extraction approach of the Lin et al. (2000 a) BaCl 2 method. Both BaCl 2 and KCl solutions were ineffective at fully recovering acidity from synthetic jarosite without repeated extraction and titration. The application of correction factors for the estimation of total actual acidity in ASS is not supported by the results of this investigation. Acid sulfate soils that contain substantial quantities of jarosite or other acid-producing but relatively insoluble sulfate minerals continue to prove problematic to chemically analyse; however, an approach for estimating this component is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The diel, {{intracellular}} fluxes of malate {{across the}} tonoplast are a crucial feature of crassulacean acid metabolism. Nocturnally accumulated malate exits the vacuole during daytime and decarboxylation liberates CO 2 for subsequent processing into organic carbohydrates via Rubisco. It is of vital importance that the decarboxylation reactions {{keep up with}} malate efflux from the vacuole to prevent over-acidification of the cytoplasm, which has recently been showed to induce chlorenchyma cell death and leaf necrosis. Although the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) has been found an important determinant of organic acid remobilization out of the vacuole, the precise mechanisms and their interaction with environmental parameters, responsible for this export process are still matter of conjecture. Therefore the influences of light on malate processing were investigated in more detail in the obligate crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) bromeliad Aechmea ‘Maya’.

2500|$|The major {{acids in}} wine are tartaric and malic acid with citric and succinic acids playing a small role. The <b>titratable</b> <b>acidity</b> or [...] "TA" [...] (also {{referred}} to as [...] "total acidity") is {{the measure of the}} tartaric acid in the grapes. This is the most abundant acid and also the one acid that has the most pronounced and long lasting impact on the taste of the wine. The TA is often measured by neutralizing some grape juice with a standard alkaline solution (such as sodium hydroxide) and then using an indicator (such as phenolphthalein) which changes color depending on the acid levels of the solution. The indicator is added to the grape juice followed by incremental amounts of the alkaline solution as the wine changes color until adding more of the solution ceases to promote a color change. At this point the wine has been neutralized with the amount of the alkaline solution needed to neutralize calculated in a formula to give an indication of how much tartaric acid was in the wine. The TA level is then expressed in a percentage of grams per 100 milliliter. As with must weight, the ideal levels for ripeness will vary according to wine style and winemaking preference. For still table wines, TA levels often fall between 0.60-0.80% for red wine grapes and 0.65-0.85 for whites.|$|E

50|$|Whether {{the wine}} is aging in tanks or barrels, tests are run {{periodically}} {{in a laboratory}} to check {{the status of the}} wine. Common tests include °Brix, pH, <b>titratable</b> <b>acidity,</b> residual sugar, free or available sulfur, total sulfur, volatile acidity and percent alcohol. Additional tests include those for the crystallization of cream of tartar (potassium hydrogen tartrate) and the precipitation of heat unstable protein; this last test is limited to white wines. These tests may be performed throughout the making of the wine as well as prior to bottling. In response to the results of these tests, a winemaker can decide on appropriate remedial action, for example the addition of more sulfur dioxide.Sensory tests will also be performed and again in response to these a winemaker may take remedial action such as the addition of a protein to soften the taste of the wine.|$|E
40|$|Iron {{precipitate}} accumulations from surface environments surrounding waterways (such as {{the side}} of drains and soil surface horizons) in acid sulfate soil landscapes were analysed for their mineralogy, micromorphology and chemical properties. Schwertmannite (Fe 8 (OH) 5. 5 (SO 4) 1. 25) was the dominant mineral in these accumulations. Goethite (α-FeOOH) was the other iron precipitate mineral identified in these accumulations and the data indicate that this iron mineral was formed from schwertmannite, often as pseudomorphs after schwertmannite. The schwertmannite in these accumulations had similar morphology and chemical properties to schwertmannite reported for environments affected by acid mine drainage. The activity of Fe 3 + in the drainage waters in these landscapes appears {{to be controlled by}} schwertmannite during both low flow (dry season) and flood conditions. Iron precipitate accumulations contained appreciable amounts of stored <b>acidity</b> (i. e. <b>titratable</b> actual <b>acidity</b> of between 164 and 443 mol (H+) t- 1, and 1900 to 2580 mol (H+) t- 1 of schwertmannite upon complete conversion to goethite) that tends to buffer these waters to very acidic conditions (i. e. pHs ~ 3. 0 – 3. 5). The relationship between water quality (i. e. pH and sulfate concentration) and type of iron precipitate mineral formed should enable the mineralogy of the iron precipitates in these surface environments to be used to help identify the degree of severity of degradation in these acid sulfate soil landscapes and to monitor the effectiveness of remediation programmes...|$|R
40|$|In coastal lowland acid sulfate soil (CLASS) landscapes, {{the iron}} hydroxy-sulfate mineral schwertmannite (Fe 8 O 8 (OH) 5. 5 (SO 4) 1. 25) forms as pedofeatures such as {{macropore}} coatings and as ground surface layers. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to examine the geochemical behavior of these pedofeatures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Samples of schwertmannite-rich pedofeatures were suspended in water over 10 days to examine their acidification behaviour. An anaerobic incubation was undertaken over 203 days to examine the influence of these pedofeatures on water quality and the reduction of sulfate and formation of sulfide. The results clearly show that the schwertmannite-rich pedofeatures, when introduced to water under aerobic conditions, rapidly release readily available acidity (3 ̆e 70 mol H 2 SO-t 4) whilst retaining significantly greater amounts of <b>titratable</b> actual <b>acidity</b> (3 ̆e 970 mol H 2 SO-t 4). This study provides the first evidence that schwertmannite-rich pedofeatures store acidity in multiple phases of differing availability and describes the behaviour of these phases. Under anaerobic conditions, Schwertmannite-rich pedofeatures enhance the formation of reduced inorganic sulfur species, (aqueous sulfide, iron monosulfide, pyrite and elemental sulfur). The data indicate that schwertmannite-rich pedofeatures act as a reservoir supplying reactants for sulfide formation which thereby promotes an increased production of reduced inorganic sulfur species. The presence of schwertmannite {{and its effect on}} contemporary iron, sulfur and acidity cycling has implications for CLASS land management and water qualit...|$|R
40|$|Post-harvest {{supply chain}} is a {{critical}} point for agro-food marketing. The management of freshness in the storage is fundamental to maintain high profits in the agro-food sector to improve the distribution and to respond to retailers and consumers’ requirements. Plums are considered to have a climacteric-ripening pattern, in which ethylene is the hormone responsible for ripening. Modified atmosphere (MA) storage is a method helpful to maintain the natural quality of fruits. MA added to low temperatures influence fruit metabolism and reduce ethylene production, weight losses, hardness of pulp, preserving vitamins and organic acids. The objective {{of this study was}} to increase the condition of storage and the shelf life of different plum cultivars through the use of MA and different types of plastic film. Considered units are commercial pallets with large batches of product and individual basket units. Qualitative destructive analysis to determine weight losses, total sugar, and <b>acidity</b> <b>titratable</b> were made to compare samples stored in MA and test mantained in normal atmosphere at 0 °C...|$|R
