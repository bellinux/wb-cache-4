5|$|In June 1886, Holmes {{received}} an honorary degree from Yale University Law School. His wife {{of more than}} forty years, who had struggled with an illness <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> her an invalid for months, died on February 6, 1888. The younger Amelia died the following year after a brief malady. Despite his weakening eyesight and a fear that he was becoming antiquated, Holmes continued to find solace in writing. He published Over the Teacups, {{the last of his}} table-talk books, in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{was then}} a major {{intellectual}} center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with {{the future of the}} Arabs. It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English). But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately. At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> worsening over time. Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed there for about a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris. In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans. Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on, when he received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British physician, in Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular. At the same time, he wrote and published several works. Marrash practiced medicine for about a year; however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school. But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival. He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed to dictate his works.|$|E
5|$|John's {{preparations}} have no effect, however, {{as he is}} tricked into {{killing the}} guardian that had been preventing the tragedy, freeing a beast which can control the collective unconsciousness of mankind. John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward. In the process John loses his memory, setting up the {{events leading up to}} the 200th issue. Leading up to the landmark issue, John has little control over events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service. John eventually gives into this offer, and the 200th issue shows how Rosacarnis manipulates his reality, making him raise three children with her, in the guise of Kit Ryan, from Garth Ennis's time on the title, Zed, from Jamie Delano's, and Angie, from the current run, with three different artists, Steve Dillon, Marcelo Frusin and Leonardo Manco each drawing one story, as the past, present and future of the title.|$|E

25|$|As for Queen Anne's {{reaction}} to the scandalous conduct of her Lady of the Bedchamber, there are two versions. The first is that the Queen disapproved of de Vere's repudiation of his highborn wife to marry her Lady of the Bedchamber. The second version is that Queen Anne, through genuine fondness for Agnes, wrote to the Pope, urging him to grant the divorce. The latter story was circulated throughout England, {{with the result that}} Anne lost some of the popularity she had previously enjoyed. The divorce was granted to de Vere upon false evidence which he had submitted to the Pope. It was his love for Agnes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> de Vere from taking up his duties in Ireland where there was rebellion, which he had been given regal powers to quell.|$|E
25|$|A {{stricken}} MCC team {{arrived in}} Perth, Western Australia after the First Test. John Edrich and Dennis Amiss had had their hands broken from the battering {{they received from}} Lillee and Thomson. David Lloyd was recovering from a broken finger <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> {{him out of the}} Test. Keith Fletcher had a bruised arm from the Test, which seemed fine until it was hit by a medium paced delivery in the nets from the assistant-manager Alan Smith and went numb so that he could not bat even though {{it was too late to}} change the XI. Smith was a wicketkeeper who had rarely bowled, but had swung the ball so much in the nets at Lords in 1972 that Geoff Boycott asked him to stop before he destroyed the confidence of the batsman who had to face Bob Massie. Bob Willis was nursing a groin strain and Peter Lever strained a side muscle and had to pull out of the state match. As a result, the team facing the Sheffield Shield champions Western Australia was chosen because only 11 players were fit, and as a result included both wicket-keepers Alan Knott and Bob Taylor, with the latter behind the stumps. The 41-year-old batsman Colin Cowdrey joined the party in Perth, but too late to play in the state game.|$|E
500|$|Mohammed M'Barek {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the French authorities <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> him [...] "in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing". He {{thought it was an}} outrage that the French regarded the dumping of an inconveniently dead body in a ravine as a crime. He {{even went so far as}} to appeal to the new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice. On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then jumped to his feet pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones. [...] "You're the guilty ones, you the rich, who want to take his inheritance!" [...] he shouted as police wrestled with him in the dock. After refusing requests from his lawyer and the judge to sit down and be quiet, M'Barek was taken down to the cells and the hearing temporarily adjourned.|$|E

500|$|With fellow Scientology {{attorney}} Helena Kobrin, Moxon {{filed an}} affidavit in Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Court in March 2000, complaining {{to the judge}} about the criminal prosecution of the Church of Scientology related {{to the death of}} Lisa McPherson. They claimed that the prosecution held an [...] "extreme religious bias" [...] and a [...] "narrow-minded concept of a church". They defended the practice of the Scientology staffers <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> Lisa McPherson at the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida, asserting they had been involved in the [...] "Introspection Rundown", which they called an [...] "entirely religious" [...] practice developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. They wrote that [...] "Forcing a Scientologist to receive psychiatric services would be like forcing an Orthodox Jew to eat pork or forcing a devoted Catholic to have an abortion. It is simply unacceptable and unthinkable to our religious faith and conscience." [...] Moxon said that the wrongful death lawsuit filed by members of McPherson's family against the Church of Scientology was [...] "nothing more than a vehicle to say bad things about the church". The criminal prosecution in the Lisa McPherson case was dropped due to issues with record-keeping by the medical examiner; a wrongful death civil suit was settled in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the match}} against Middlesex, the team {{travelled}} to the north, where the strongest English rugby teams were based. Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until {{many of their}} respective member clubs split from the RFU in 1895 {{over the issue of}} [...] "broken time" [...] payments. The New Zealanders lost to Hull F.C. 1–0, defeated Dewsbury, then lost to Wakefield Trinity. After their first draw of the tour (against Northumberland County) they defeated Stockton-on-Tees and Tynemouth. Joe Warbrick appeared in the match against Tynemouth, but aggravated the foot injury <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> him out of the side until that point. These victories were followed by a 13–4 defeat to Halifax on 10 November. The team then won seven matches in a row, including one against Hawick RFC, their only Scottish opposition of the tour. The last two matches that month were a loss to Swinton and a 9–0 victory over Liverpool and District. The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them. By this point, the team was beset by injuries– of the fifteen players that played against Westmorland County on 24 November, five had injuries. The squad comprised only 26 players, and the tourists were often struggling to field a side. Nevertheless, their heavy schedule continued; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin, where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team.|$|E
500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E

500|$|In late December, Ovechkin {{went on a}} seven-game point streak that {{featured}} the two-point games {{in the final four}} games of the streak. In conjunction with the point streak, he scored eight goals in nine games. Washington went 5–1–1 during the streak, which was eventually snapped in a 5–2 loss to the San Jose Sharks on January 7. In the game prior to the streak being snapped, Capitals' defenseman Mike Green returned from a groin injury <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> him out of the lineup for 23 games. Washington defeated the Calgary Flames 3–1 in the contest, which moved their record to 9–0–0 with Green in the line-up. However, the news coming out of the game was not all good. During the game, the Capitals' leading scorer, Nicklas Backstrom, was elbowed in the head by the Flames' Rene Bourque. Backstrom underwent concussion testing, which proved inconclusive; he suffered from what was described as [...] "concussion-like symptoms" [...] and was eventually placed on the injured reserve. For his actions, Bourque was suspended five games for delivering the elbow. Compounding the Capitals' injury problem was the loss of Mike Green in just his second game back; he re-injured his groin during the contest and was placed on the long-term injured reserve. During a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Ovechkin delivered a hit to Pittsburgh defenseman Zbynek Michalek. On the hit, Ovechkin launched himself into Michalek's shoulder, where the force of the hit caused Ovechkin to make contact with Michalek's head. Later in the game, Michalek delivered an elbow to the back of Matt Hendricks' head, driving it into the glass. The following day, it was announced that Ovechkin was suspended for three games for the reckless hit despite not receiving a penalty on the play during the game. Vice President of Player Safety Brendan Shanahan stated the length of the suspension took into account that Ovechkin was a repeat offender, having been suspended twice before and fined twice as well. It also took into consideration that Michalek was not injured on the play. Despite his own actions, Michalek avoided a fine or suspension. Without Ovechkin, Backstrom or Green, Washington nonetheless defeated defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins in the final game before the All-Star break to move into first place in the Southeast Division.|$|E

On 28 November she was at Diamond Harbour and by 30 December she was at Calcutta. She left Diamond Harbour on 10 January 1797. Ocean was at Kedgeree on 19 March.

2500|$|The Australians dropped Keith Slater and {{replaced}} {{him with the}} veteran fast bowler Ray Lindwall after an absence of 18 months. Although now 37 he had been training hard and had bowled well, having taken 7/73 against the MCC. With 212 Test wickets Lindwall was the second greatest Australian wicket taker after Clarrie Grimmett (216) and {{he was determined to}} beat the record. Ian Meckiff had bruised his Achilles tendon at Sydney and was unfit to play, but any joy the England camp may have felt was reduced when they debuted the [...] "Blonde Giant" [...] Gordon Rorke after he had taken 6/58 against Queensland and 4/57 in the recent tour match. Incidentally, Rorke was the only Australian tailender as the other ten players were First Class cricket centurions. For England, Peter Richardson returned to open the batting with Trevor Bailey because Arthur Milton had re-fractured his broken finger and Raman Subba Row still had a damaged wrist. The alternative opener was Willie Watson—who replaced Ted Dexter—but he had made 141 batting at number 6 against Victoria and May wanted to keep him in the lower-middle order. Peter Loader had a groin strain <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>kept</b> him out of the New South Wales game, but the great shock was that the off-spinner Jim Laker, England's best bowler, could not play because his arthritic spinning finger was immobile. As a result, Frank Tyson was recalled after two years out of the team, having had taken 3/40 and 4/55 in the last two matches. Godfrey Evans replaced Roy Swetman as wicket-keeper even though his broken middle finger had not fully mended as the young Surrey keeper had proved fallible behind the stumps. As a result, May had four fast bowlers and only one spinner on a pitch that was traditionally a good batting surface with low bounce, though the South Australia game at Christmas had seen a green, pacey wicket. This was the only Test in which the three great England fast bowlers of the 1950s Tyson, Trueman and Statham all played together. Mel McInnes was umpire again, much to the annoyance of the England team as he had made mistakes in all his matches leading up to the Fourth Test. It {{should be noted that the}} 1956 Australians successfully asked for the great English umpire Frank Chester to be removed when an illness made his decisions erratic.|$|E
