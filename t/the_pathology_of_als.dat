40|$|Abstract Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases, {{responsible}} for {{the integrity of the}} basement membrane (BM) via degradation of extra-cellular matrix and BM components. These enzymes are presented in central and peripheral nervous system. They are considered {{to be involved in the}} pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral scle-rosis (ALS). ALS is a motor neuron disease, leading to muscle atrophy, paralysis and death within 3 – 5 years from diagnosis. Currently, there is no treatment that can sub-stantially prolong life of ALS patients. Despite the fact that MMPs are not specific for ALS, there is also strong evi-dence that these enzymes are involved in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS.</b> MMPs are able to exert direct neurotoxic effects, or may cause cell death by degrading matrix proteins. The objective of this paper is to provide an updated and com-prehensive review concerning the role of MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS</b> with an emphasis on the significance of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 as well as their tissue inhibitors as potential biomarkers of ALS. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of selected MMPs and TIMPs in ALS pathogen-esis. Moreover, selective MMPs ’ inhibitors might be potential targets for therapeutic strategies for patients with ALS. However, future investigations are necessary before some of those non-specific for ALS enzymes could finally be used as biomarkers of this disease...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} article, we review the many facets of {{mitochondrial}} dysfunction in {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease due to loss of upper motor neurons in cerebral cortex and lower motor neurons in brainstem and spinal cord. Accumulating evidence from recent studies suggests that the many, interconnected facets of mitochondrial dysfunction may play a more {{significant role in the}} etiopathogenesis of this disorder than previously thought. This notion stems from our expanding knowledge of the complex physiology of mitochondria and of alteration of their properties that might confer an intrinsic susceptibility to long-lived, post-mitotic motor neurons to energy deficit, calcium mishandling and oxidative stress. The wealth of evidence implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a major event in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS</b> has prompted new studies aimed to the development of new mitochondria-targeted therapies. However, {{it is now clear that}} drugs targeting more than one aspect of mitochondrial dysfunction are needed to fight this devastating disease...|$|E
40|$|Cu,Zn {{superoxide}} dismutase (SOD 1) has {{been implicated in}} the familial form of the neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). It {{has been suggested that}} mutant mediated SOD 1 misfolding/aggregation {{is an integral part of}} <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS.</b> We study the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of SOD 1 using a hybrid molecular dynamics approach. We reproduce the experimentally observed SOD 1 folding thermodynamics and find that the residues which contribute the most to SOD 1 thermal stability are also crucial for apparent two-state folding kinetics. Surprisingly, we find that these residues are located on the surface of the protein and not in the hydrophobic core. Mutations in some of the identified residues are found in patients with the disease. We argue that the identified residues may play an important role in aggregation. To further characterize the folding of SOD 1, we study the role of cysteine residues in folding and find that non-native disulfide bond formation may significantly alter SOD 1 folding dynamics and aggregation propensity.

Several studies in vivo {{as well as in}} vitro have nominated immunoglobulin G (IgG) isolated from ALS patients as an active contributor to disease onset and progression.

40|$|International audienceThe {{etiology}} of motor neuron degeneration in {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) remains to be better understood. Based on the studies from ALS patients and transgenic animal models, {{it is believed that}} ALS {{is likely to be a}} multifactorial and multisystem disease. Many mechanisms have been postulated to be involved in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS,</b> such as oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial damage, defective axonal transport, glia cell pathology and aberrant RNA metabolism. Mitochondria, which play crucial roles in excitotoxicity, apoptosis and cell survival, have shown to be an early target in ALS pathogenesis and contribute to the disease progression. Morphological and functional defects in mitochondria were found in both human patients and ALS mice overexpressing mutant SOD 1. Mutant SOD 1 was found to be preferentially associated with mitochondria and subsequently impair mitochondrial function. Recent studies suggest that axonal transport of mitochondria along microtubules and mitochondrial dynamics may also be disrupted in ALS. These results also illustrate the critical importance of maintaining proper mitochondrial function in axons and neuromuscular junctions, supporting the emerging “dying-back” axonopathy model of ALS. In this review, we will discuss how mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the ALS variants of SOD 1 and the mechanisms by which mitochondrial damage contributes to the disease etiology...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that neurotrophins support {{regeneration}} and survival of injured motoneurons. Based on these findings, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been clinically investigated for its therapeutic potential in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rapidly progressing and fatal motoneuronal disease. We questioned whether imbalances of neurotrophic levels are indeed involved in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS.</b> Therefore the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF), BDNF, neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3), and neurotrophin- 4 / 5 (NT- 4 / 5) was investigated in postmortem muscle tissue of the biceps from 15 patients with neuropathologically confirmed sporadic ALS and 15 age-matched controls. Using mRNA analysis techniques and quantitative protein measurements, we have demonstrated that both mRNA and protein levels of all four neurotrophins are increased in muscle tissue of ALS patients. The production levels displayed a disease duration dependency and different expression patterns emerged for the four neurotrophins. Whereas the early phase of the disease was characterized by a strong upregulation of BDNF, levels of NGF, NT- 3, and NT- 4 / 5 gradually increased {{in the course of}} the disorder, peaking at later stages. We conclude that decreased neurotrophic support from muscle tissue is most likely not the cause of motoneuron degeneration in ALS. On the contrary, our results suggest that degenerating motoneurons in ALS are exposed to elevated levels of muscle-derived neurotrophins. (D 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, {{caused by}} progressive loss of motor neurons. Changes are {{widespread in the}} subcortical white matter in ALS. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) detects pathological changes in white matter fibres in vivo, based on alterations in the degree (diffusivity, ADC) and directedness (fractional anisotropy, FA) of proton movement. Methods 24 patients with ALS and 24 age-matched controls received 1. 5 T DTI. FA and ADC were analyzed using statistical parametric mapping. In 15 of the 24 ALS patients, a second DTI was obtained after 6 months. Results Decreased FA in the corticospinal tract (CST) and frontal areas confirm existing results. With a direct comparison of baseline and follow-up dataset, the progression of upper motor neuron degeneration, reflected in FA decrease, could be captured along the CST and in frontal areas. The involvement of cerebellum in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS,</b> as suspected from functional MRI studies, could be confirmed by a reduced FA (culmen, declive). These structural changes correlated well with disease duration, ALSFRS-R, and physical and executive functions. Conclusion DTI detects changes that are regarded as prominent features of ALS and thus, shows promise in its function as a biomarker. Using the technique herein, we could demonstrate DTI changes at follow-up which correlated well with clinical progression. </p...|$|E

40|$|Degenerating spinal motor neurons in {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS) {{are characterized}} by a reduced expression of neurofilament light (NF-L) mRNA and {{by the presence of}} inclusions composed of peripherin and neurofilament (NF) proteins. This thesis examines questions related to the formation and toxicity of inclusions containing peripherin. Transfection studies demonstrated that the organization of the penpherin network is disrupted by the larger NF proteins NF-M and NF-H in context of NF-L deficiency. To further investigate the in vivo assembly of peripherin, transgenic mice overexpressing the mouse peripherin gene were generated and then bred with NF-L null mice. Mice overexpressing peripherin developed a late onset motor neuron disease characterized by the formation of peripherin inclusions and by the degeneration of motor axons in two years old mice. Remarkably, a deficiency of the NF-L protein enhanced the formation of inclusions and accelerated the onset of the peripherin-mediated disease by about 15 months. Transgenic mice overexpressing the human NF-H protein in the absence of NF-L (hH;L-/- mice) were then generated to further examine the impact of a NF-L deficiency upon the formation and toxicity of protein inclusions. These mice were characterized by the formation of large perikaryal inclusions containing peripherin and NF-H. Unlike the axonal and perikaryal inclusions formed in peripherin transgenic mice, the inclusions of hH;L-/- mice were not associated with loss spinal motor neuron, thus suggesting that the toxicity of inclusions in peripherin transgenic mice may be related to their axonal localization. Finally, a last series of experiments demonstrated that stab injuries and ischemia can also trigger the formation of peripherin inclusions in brain neurons that are normally silent for peripherin expression. The combined results suggest that peripherin inclusions may participate to <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS</b> and perhaps to neurodegeneration in other di...|$|E

40|$|Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterised by motor {{neuronal}} degeneration leading to muscular wasting and eventually death. 5 % of ALS cases are familial (F ALS) and 20 % {{of these are}} due to mutations in the gene encoding for copperlzinc superoxide dismutase-l (SOD 1). Mice overexpressing human mutant SODl develop a neurodegenerative condition closely resembling ALS. Beyond increasing age, male gender and family history of ALS, {{there are no other}} validated risk factors. However, recently, association between intense physical activity and ALS has been proposed by epidemiological studies. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the response of motor neurones to the stress caused by the presence of the mutant human SOD 1 in the mouse model of F ALS was investigated. In the second part, the genes and pathways involved in the physiological response to the stress caused by voluntary exercise in motor neurones were identified. The final section of this thesis investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key genes involved in the response to exercise were associated with the pathophysiology of ALS. Microarray analysis of motor neurones isolated using laser capture microdissection from the lumbar spinal cord of G 93 A-SOD 1 mice and their littermates at different stages of disease has identified several potential targets for drug therapy, especially at the presymptomatic stage. Applying the same techniques, the transcription profile of motor neurones isolated from the lumbar spinal cord of exercised and sedentary mice was analysed as well as gastrocnemius muscles. Motor neurones showed transcriptional changes involved in neurotrophic factor signalling, electrophysiological changes and synaptic reorganization, while gastrocnemius muscle revealed mcreases in transcripts responsible for neovascularisation and myogenesis. The comparison between the two studies reveals that, although the pathways activated in motor neurones in response to the two stresses are different, the physiological response to exercise requires production of neurotrophic factors and activation of pathways that have been shown to be implicated in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS.</b> In particular, VEGF receptor 2 (KDR) was upregulated in response to exercise. In order to investigate the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility could be implicated in a failure to mount the physiological response to exercise, non-synonymous SNPs in KDR were screened in sporadic ALS cases and controls. Although the screening did not reveal any positive associations, the present study provides additional candidate genes that might confer a genetic susceptibility to ALS in response to intense physical activity.

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) {{and spinal}} muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance (SMA-LED) are two forms of motor neuron diseases at the {{opposite ends of the}} age spectrum, with ALS being mainly an adult-onset progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease, and SMA-LED being a childhood-onset neuromuscular disease, manifested by muscle weakness, joint contracture, abnormal gait, and in some cases combined with intellectual disability. This thesis represents my research on the role of mutant forms of two proteins, namely Tar-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP- 43) and cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain 1 (DYNC 1 H 1) in the pathogenesis of ALS and SMA-LED, respectively. TDP- 43 – an RNA/DNA binding protein – has been implicated in ALS. The function of TDP- 43 in the nucleus is to regulate RNA processing, including RNA splicing and editing. Abnormal expression of the peripherin splice variant per 61 has been found in transgenic mouse models of ALS. In addition, aberrant expression of EAAT 2 (excitatory amino acid glutamate transporter 2) protein has been reported in some ALS cases. Thus, I investigated splicing of peripherin and GLT- 1 (the murine homologue of EAAT 2) RNAs, as potential targets of TDP- 43 and examined whether mutations in TDP- 43 alter the expression levels of the genes encoding the two proteins. My data show that per 61 is expressed in wild type mice at both RNA and protein levels. This suggests a role for this isoform in the assembly of peripherin filaments. Moreover, overexpression of TDP- 43 A 315 T increases the expression level of per 45 (an alternative translated isoform of peripherin) and leads to the instability of the filament network. Analysis of GLT- 1 B, the neuronal splice variant of GLT- 1, reveals significant down-regulation in TDP- 43 A 315 T transgenic mice, indicating impaired RNA processing of GLT- 1 B. Collectively, these data show that the expression of peripherin and EAAT 2 is regulated by TDP- 43, and that aberrant expressions of these two genes caused by TDP- 43 mutations could have a role in <b>the</b> <b>pathology</b> <b>of</b> <b>ALS.</b> A Phe 580 Tyr mutation in the mouse gene Dync 1 h 1 impairs growth factor-induced endocytic trafficking in Dync 1 h 1 +/F 580 Y mouse motor neurons, resulting in aberrant activation of extracellular-signal-related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2) and phosphorylation of the immediate early gene c-Fos. My data show that the induction of c-Fos upon serum starvation and/or growth factor stimulation is ERK 1 / 2 dependent and that the mitogen-activated protein kinase p 38 is also likely to be involved in c-Fos activation during starvation. Moreover, the activation of autophagy is reduced in Dync 1 h 1 +/F 580 Y motor neurons, suggesting a role for cytoplasmic dynein in autophagy induction/formation. In addition, the Dync 1 h 1 F 580 Y/F 580 Y mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit a defect in cell migration, as manifested by a delayed wound closure and reduced levels of paxillin phosphorylation at Tyr 118 (p-paxillin). They also show abnormal and increased number of focal adhesions in spreading assays. Interestingly, human SMA-LED DYNC 1 H 1 R 399 G/R 399 G fibroblasts show defective lamellipodia formation, as well as reduced levels of p-paxillin. Moreover, Dync 1 h 1 +/F 580 Y mouse motor neurons show a defect in exploratory microtubules in the peripheral domain of their growth cones. As the molecular mechanism of growth cone motility is analogous to that found in fibroblasts, the molecular pathogenesis of SMA-LED caused by mutations in cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain 1, is likely to involve impaired growth cone development and axonal pathfinding, which could be exacerbated by the aberrant endocytic trafficking and signalling in mutant motor neurons...|$|E
