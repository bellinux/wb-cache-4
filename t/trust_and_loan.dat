One (964 acres) was located {{to the north}} of a road leading east from Monsildale Road, and another (419 acres) was located to the south of this road.

The variables explained include monetary aggregates, several interest rates, and the major assets of the chartered banks <b>and</b> of the <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> mortgage <b>loan</b> companies. The model differs from existing Canadian models in that we use monthly data rather than quarterly or annual data. We think the shorter observation period permits the econometric estimates to capture the dynamic adjustment processes more accurately. In particular, the mean lags implied by our equations tend to be considerably shorter than those in existing models. Another difference with conventional models is the larger influence given to asset and liability management of the chartered banks in the determination of short-term interest rates. The model is intended primarily for forecasting, and results are presented which indicate its usefulness in that regard...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} satisfaction, trust and information quality as determinants of loan clients’ recommendation of financial service providers in a developing country. Drawing on existing literature, a conceptual model was developed and validated with data from loan clients in Ghana. The study involved a cross-sectional survey of 371 loan customers of leading financial service providers in Ghana. The results show that satisfaction, <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> information quality are significant factors influencing clients ’ recommendation of loan products. Moreover, satisfaction and information quality also contributed significantly to influencing clients ’ trust for financial service providers. The findings provide important implications for inducing loan clients ’ recommendation of financial services to others. While this study is limited in terms of generalizability of the findings in developing countries, it provides avenues for further research for modelling the determinants of loan acquisition intentions of clients in financial markets in other research settings...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the growth}} of the {{institutional}} portfolio (i. e., funds managed by mutual funds, insurance companies, banks, <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> <b>loan</b> companies, etc.) has been truly astonishing. In this article, Professor MacIntosh argues that this growth has important implications for the manner in which Canadian capital markets are regulated. In particular, institutional shareholders tend to be better monitors of corporate managers than retail shareholders. Institutional monitoring has been impeded by a number of features of the regulatory landscape. Professor MacIntosh makes a number of recommendations for changes to corporate and securities laws. Contrary to the fears expressed by some, the decline of the retail investor {{and the rise of the}} institutional investor should be accompanied by enhanced market liquidity and market efficiency. Regulatory policies premised on assuring the continued market presence of retail investors lack a solid theoretical or empirical footing. Professor MacIntosh also notes that market institutionalization has been and will continue to be associated with growth in the so-called 2 ̆ 2 exempt 2 ̆ 2 market. This will exert a brake on the extent to which regulators can regulate non-exempt market transactions, since higher levels of regulation will only drive issuers and investors into exempt markets or to other locales. Finally, Professor MacIntosh notes that the burgeoning derivatives markets present a challenge for regulators. Properly managed, the purchase of derivative securities can greatly reduce portfolio risk. Improperly managed, however, derivatives can greatly increase risk. Professor Macintosh argues that most buyers in derivatives markets are institutional, and that where such buyers dominate, a light-handed regulatory approach is indicated...|$|E
