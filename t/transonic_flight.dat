25|$|For flight speeds {{near the}} speed of sound (<b>transonic</b> <b>flight),</b> {{airfoils}} with complex asymmetrical shapes are used to minimize the drastic increase in drag associated with airflow near {{the speed of}} sound.

25|$|The Hawk was {{designed}} to be manoeuvrable and can reach Mach0.88 in level flight and Mach1.15 in a dive, thus allowing trainees to experience <b>transonic</b> <b>flight</b> before advancing to a supersonic trainer. The airframe is very durable and strong, stressed for +9g, the normal limit in RAF service is +7.5/-4g. A dual hydraulic system supplies power to operate systems such as the aircraft's flaps, airbrakes and landing gear, together with the flight controls. A ram air turbine is fitted in front of the single tail fin to provide backup hydraulic power for the flight controls {{in the event of an}} engine failure, additionally a gas turbine auxiliary power unit is housed directly above the engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the 14 low-altitude <b>transonic</b> <b>flights</b> showed that the prevailing meteorological consideration of the acoustic disturbances below the cutoff altitude during threshold Mach number flight has shown that a theoretical safe altitude appears to be valid {{over a wide range}} of meteorological conditions and provides a reasonable estimate of the airplane ground speed reduction to avoid sonic boom noise during threshold Mach number flight. Recent theoretical results for the acoustic pressure waves below the threshold Mach number caustic showed excellent agreement with observations near the caustic, but the predicted overpressure levels were significantly lower than those observed far from the caustic. The {{analysis of}} caustics produced by inadvertent low-magnitude accelerations during flight at Mach numbers slightly greater than the threshold Mach number showed that folds and associated caustics were produced by slight changes in the airplane ground speed. These caustic intensities ranged from 1 to 3 time the nominal steady, level flight intensity...|$|R

25|$|Another {{critical}} addition {{was the use}} of a power-operated stabilator, {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early <b>transonic</b> <b>flight</b> was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely without a loss of pilot control. The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|An initial {{version of}} the {{aircraft}} was to be test-flown using Frank Whittle's latest engine, the Power Jets W.2/700. This engine, which was envisaged {{to be capable of}} providing 2,000lb of thrust, calculated to be capable of providing subsonic performance; when flown in a shallow dive, it would also be capable of <b>transonic</b> <b>flight.</b> Wood described the engine as being [...] "remarkable as it incorporated ideas far ahead of its time". In order to get the M.52 to achieve supersonic speeds, the installation of projected further development of the W.2/700 engine would be necessary.|$|E

Among the major findings are that multiple, corotating vortices exist up to 20 -deg angle of attack, and the measured flight core location is not well predicted by theory. Planned extensions for this work are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|A novel high Reynolds number design {{method was}} {{investigated}} and conducted for transonic airfoils with an application {{in the outer}} part of a modern transport aircraft wing. In contrast to conventional low Reynolds number design methods, this method exploits full aerodynamic performance and controls the boundary layer properties. Three airfoils were created for <b>transonic</b> free <b>flight</b> conditions with very similar aerodynamic performance, but different boundary layer developments on the upper surface. The performance and boundary layer characteristics of the airfoils were discussed and validated by RANS computations. ...|$|R
40|$|Flight-determined {{lift and}} drag data from <b>transonic</b> <b>flights</b> of seven {{research}} airplane configurations of widely varying characteristics are presented and compared with wind-tunnel and rocket-model data. The airplanes are the X- 5 (590 wing sweep), XF- 92 A, YF- 102 with cambered wing, YF- 102 with symmetrical wing, D- 558 -ii, X- 3, and X-LE. The effects {{of some of}} the basic configuration differences on the lift and drag characteristics are demonstrated. As indicated by transonic similarity laws, most of the configurations demonstrate a relationship between the transonic increase in zero-lift drag and the maximum cross-sectional area. No such relationship was found between the drag-rise Mach number and its normally related parameters. A comparison of flight and wind-tunnel data shows a generally reasonable agreement, but Reynolds number differences can cause considerable variations in the drag levels of the flight and wind-tunnel tests. Maximum lift-drag ratios vary widely in the subsonic region as would be expected from differences in aspect ratio and wing thickness ratio; however, the variations diminish as the Mach number is increased through the transonic region. The attainment of maximum lift-drag ratio in level flight by several of the airplanes was limited by engine performance, stability characteristics, and buffet boundaries...|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} rapid tool for calculating the {{aerodynamic}} characteristics of almost arbitrary wing configurations with sufficient accuracy for preliminary design is presented. The main emphasis {{is put on}} simple validation examples for subsonic and <b>transonic</b> cruise <b>flight</b> cases. An approach for polar transformation to consider transonic effects of swept wings is investigated in detail. 3 D RANS computations have been performed in order to compare the results.

50|$|The X-1C (serial 48-1387) was {{intended}} to test armaments and munitions in the high <b>transonic</b> and supersonic <b>flight</b> regimes. It was canceled while still in the mockup stage, as the development of transonic and supersonic-capable aircraft like the North American F-86 Sabre and the North American F-100 Super Sabre eliminated {{the need for a}} dedicated experimental test vehicle.|$|R
40|$|The quasi-analytical {{approach}} is developed to compute airfoil aerodynamic sensitivity coefficients in the <b>transonic</b> and supersonic <b>flight</b> regimes. Initial investigation verifies the feasibility of this approach as applied to the transonic small perturbation residual expression. Results are compared to those obtained by the direct (finite difference) approach and both methods are evaluated to determine their computational accuracies and efficiencies. The quasi-analytical {{approach is}} shown to be superior and worth further investigation...|$|R

5000|$|Stabilator or all-moving tailIn <b>transonic</b> <b>flight</b> {{shock waves}} {{generated}} by {{the front of the}} tailplane render any elevator unusable. An all-moving tail was developed by the British for the Miles M.52, but first saw actual <b>transonic</b> <b>flight</b> on the Bell X-1; fortunately Bell Aircraft Corporation had included an elevator trim device that could alter the angle of attack of the entire tailplane. This saved the program from a costly and time-consuming rebuild of the aircraft. Transonic and supersonic aircraft now have all-moving tailplanes to counteract Mach tuck and maintain maneuverability when flying faster than the critical Mach number. Normally called a stabilator, this configuration {{is often referred to as}} an [...] "all-moving" [...] or [...] "all-flying" [...] tailplane.|$|E

The <b>flight</b> derivatives were generally consistent and documented the aircraft well. The correlation between the flight data and wind-tunnel predictions is presented and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Progress in gas {{dynamics}} {{coincides with the}} developments of <b>transonic</b> and supersonic <b>flights.</b> As aircraft began to travel faster, the density of air began to change, considerably increasing the air resistance as the air speed approached the speed of sound. The phenomenon was later identified in wind tunnel experiments as an effect caused by the formation of shock waves around the aircraft. Major advances were made to describe the behavior during and after World War II, and the new understandings on compressible and high speed flows became theories of {{gas dynamics}}.|$|R

50|$|The Balanced Flight/Controlled Spin Projectile bullet patent {{has been}} questioned/disputed by the German {{physicist}} Lutz Möller. Mr. Möller realized balanced flight {{has to do}} with the nature of spin stabilized flight and scale of parameters. There were projectiles produced prior to the patent that remain stable through the <b>transonic</b> <b>flight</b> regime. This is a consequence of the spin deceleration and forward deceleration of the projectile being similar enough not to cause undesirable precession and yaw during the <b>transonic</b> <b>flight</b> phase. The main parameter for achieving stable transonic transition is controlling the drag coefficients (Cd) and forward velocity loss around Mach 1 and to a lesser degree controlling the spin deceleration. In other words, any bullet with appropriate drag behaviour around Mach 1 and mass (distribution) will do exactly what the balanced flight projectile patent states.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{aerodynamic}} investigations {{were made}} in transonic and supersonic wind tunnels on a. 008899 scale model of the Boeing model 979 - 145 Ballistic Recoverable Booster. The purpose of the tests was to define the stability and performance characteristics of the BRB at re-entry attitudes in the <b>transonic</b> and supersonic <b>flight</b> regimes. Data were obtained over a Mach number range from 0. 6 to 4. 0 at angles of attack between 50 deg and 85 deg at zero sideslip and at angles of sideslip between - 17. 5 deg and + 15 deg at angles of attack between 50 deg and 85 deg...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests have}} {{demonstrated}} the effectiveness of an array of hot-film sensors using constant voltage anemometry to determine shock position on a wing or aircraft surface at <b>transonic</b> speeds. <b>Flights</b> were conducted at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center using the F- 15 B aircraft and Flight Test Fixture (FTF). A modified NACA 0021 airfoil {{was attached to the}} side of the FTF, and its upper surface was instrumented to correlate shock position with pressure and hot-film sensors. In the vicinity of the shock-induced pressure rise, test results consistently showed the presence of a minimum voltage in the hot-film anemometer outputs. Comparing these results with previous investigations indicate that hot-film anemometry can identify the location of the shock-induced boundary layer separation. The flow separation occurred slightly forward of the shock- induced pressure rise for a laminar boundary layer and slightly aft of the start of the pressure rise when the boundary layer was tripped near the airfoil leading edge. Both minimum mean output and phase reversal analyses were used to identify the shock location...|$|R
40|$|The {{sonic boom}} flight test program {{conducted}} at Jackass Flats, Nevada, {{during the summer}} and fall of 1970 consisted of 121 sonic-boom-generating flights over the 1500 ft instrumented BREN tower. This test program was designed to provide information on several aspects of sonic boom, including caustics produced by longitudinal accelerations, caustics produced by steady flight near the threshold Mach number, sonic boom characteristics near lateral cutoff, and the vertical extent of shock waves attached to near-sonic airplanes. The measured test data, except for the near-sonic flight data, were analyzed in detail to determine sonic boom characteristics for these flight conditions and to determine the accuracy and the range of validity of linear sonic boom theory. The caustic phenomena observed during the threshold Mach number flights and during the <b>transonic</b> acceleration <b>flights</b> are documented and analyzed in detail. The theory of geometric acoustics is shown to be capable of predicting shock wave-ground intersections, and current methods for calculating sonic boom pressure signature away from caustics are shown to be reasonably accurate...|$|R
50|$|Jet engine {{efficiency}} increases with velocity because the speed {{difference between the}} flight and the exhaust is lower, however above the drag divergence Mach number the aerodynamic drag on the airframe overwhelms this effect because supersonic shockwaves begin to form, greatly increasing drag and needing supercritical airfoil designs for <b>transonic</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
50|$|In <b>transonic</b> <b>flight</b> (Mach numbers {{greater than}} about 0.8 {{and less than}} about 1.4), wave drag {{is the result of}} the {{formation}} of shockwaves in the fluid, formed when local areas of supersonic (Mach number greater than 1.0) flow are created. In practice, supersonic flow occurs on bodies traveling well below the speed of sound, as the local speed of air increases as it accelerates over the body to speeds above Mach 1.0. However, full supersonic flow over the vehicle will not develop until well past Mach 1.0. Aircraft flying at transonic speed often incur wave drag through the normal course of operation. In <b>transonic</b> <b>flight,</b> wave drag is commonly referred to as transonic compressibility drag. Transonic compressibility drag increases significantly as the speed of flight increases towards Mach 1.0, dominating other forms of drag at those speeds.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} amount of effort throughout the design process was directed towards reducing the Citation X's total drag. The resulting design includes an area-ruled fuselage for efficient <b>transonic</b> <b>flight,</b> and the aforementioned highly swept supercritical wing. The Citation X's wing is slung below the fuselage rather than passing through it. This allows increased volume in the fuselage, a one-piece wing, and simplified wing-fuselage connections.|$|E

The facility employs the cryogenic approach to achieve high transonic Reynolds numbers at acceptable model loads and tunnel power. By using temperature as a test variable, a unique capability to separate scale effects from model aeroelastic effects is provided. The performance envelope of the facility is shown to provide a ten fold increase in transonic Reynolds number capability compared to currently available facilities...|$|R
50|$|Besides setting several records, the Skyrocket pilots had {{gathered}} important data and understanding {{about what would}} and would not work to provide stable, controlled flight of a swept-wing aircraft in the <b>transonic</b> and supersonic <b>flight</b> regimes. The data they gathered also helped to enable a better correlation of wind-tunnel test results with actual flight values, enhancing the abilities of designers to produce more capable aircraft for the armed services, especially those with swept wings. Moreover, data on such matters as stability and control from this and other early research aircraft aided {{in the design of}} the Century Series of fighter aircraft, all of which featured the movable horizontal stabilizers first employed on the X-1 and D-558 series.|$|R
