Some traditionally religious practices have been adapted by secular practitioners under strictly spiritual understandings, such as yoga and mindfulness meditation. Secular spirituality affects education, relationships to nature, and community togetherness.|$|E

" Web 2. 0 is the second generation of Web-based technologies that emphasize social collaboration, interoperability, user-centered design, and user-generated information sharing (O’Rielly, 2005). Web 2. 0 technologies are increasingly growing in popularity within the institutions of higher learning. Alexander (2006) believes that communities have gone through enormous change via significant innovation tools and services that promote new ways of collaboration. Huang and Behara (2007) state that cost is a major benefit to using Web 2. 0 technologies in higher education because these technologies are available free of charge or for a nominal fee.

Some common features of autoclaves that differentiate them from competing <b>technologies</b> are <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> Autoclaves employ the moist-heat method to sterilize and deactivate refuse in a large pressure vessel where saturated steam is injected. The end product is completely sanitized and even previously bio-hazardous waste can be discarded in a normal municipal landfill. Autoclaves employ the same method of sterilization as converters, but do so using larger and more complex equipment that also has higher safety and energy consumption requirements. In a majority of cases, autoclaves are hub-and-spoke operations requiring regional treatment centers and a supply chain.|$|R

In order to eliminate the commutation failure, a novel hybrid converter configuration for conventional LCC HVDC technology is proposed in [69]. Additionally, the control of AC voltage and reactive power in LCC HVDC system is investigated in [70] and a new control scheme is proposed, which makes the application of LCC HVDC system more flexible. LCC HVDC is preferred for power transmission over long distance transmission, the VSC HVDC system in [66, 67] shows {{that it may be}} the preferred option for multi-terminal DC grid or offshore wind farm integration. While the major challenges for VSC HVDC system include DC circuit breakers, DC/DC converters, and fast DC Grid protection, etc.|$|R

[...] The second misunderstanding is technology is not a part of consciousness. The truth is that technology is a part of consciousness as [...] "the conceptualization of technology has gone through drastic changes." [...] The third misunderstanding is that technology controls society and consciousness, when really technology does not control society and consciousness; meaning [...] "that technology is rooted in consciousness {{as an integral part of}} mental life for everyone. This understanding will most likely alter how both patients and psychologists deal with the trials and tribunes of living with technology." [...] The last misunderstanding is society controls technology and consciousness which is not true, society does not control technology and consciousness. [...] "…(other) accounts fail to acknowledge the complex relational nature of <b>technology</b> <b>as</b> an operation within mind and society. This realization shifts the focus on technology to its origins within the human mind as explained through the theory of technological consciousness." ...|$|R

So rather than seeing <b>technology</b> <b>as</b> blocking direct experience of Being and nature, as Heidegger does, Jones sees <b>technology</b> <b>as</b> a means to more direct experience.|$|R

The dataset consists of a recent and representative sample of Swedish AM users (companies, universities, and research institutes). The authors investigate two questions.

Using a regression analysis technique, the main findings are <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> (i) There is a variation among users’ choice of AM application, {{and the majority of}} users are expanding their AM applications beyond RP. (ii) There are two factors that positively affect the decision of firms to expand classical RP and also incorporate production and management. These two factors are using multiple AM <b>technologies</b> (<b>as</b> opposed to single Fused Deposition Modeling technology) and being small companies.
