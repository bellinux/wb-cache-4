5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved of <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man,</b> but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E

Later it was discovered that Deutsch's mother did not want to consent to the wedding, because Lea was still a minor at the time.|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 110 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. Sonnet 110 was {{published}} {{along with the other}} sonnets in the 1609 Quarto. The sonnet falls in place with the Fair Youth sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The mystery of the young man is still unknown today. However, there are many different theories by various scholars of who <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> may be. There has been much debate whether or not this sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and actors. Whereas others have interpreted sonnet 110 as the poet confessing his love to a young man.|$|E

25|$|The {{house at}} Avenida 3 Ote 201 {{in the city}} of Puebla belonged to Pedro de Carvajal, who was a wealthy and {{respected}} man. However, he lost his young wife as she gave birth to their second child, a boy. When his daughter turned 15, there were many interested suitors but she was not interested in them. One day a monster appeared at a party in the city provoking terror. The monster went to the Carvajal house and ate the younger son, who was playing out front of the house. Pedro offered a large reward for the capture of the beast. One young man, who wanted the hand of Pedro’s daughter, appeared at another festival, bearing the head of the beast. It is said that <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> gained noble title and the hand of the daughter as a reward.|$|E
25|$|Even as an {{adolescent}} {{he realized that}} his real destiny was music. But {{at the insistence of}} his mother, he first went to college, to study philosophy and later law—his father, who had died when Joseph was only seven, had been a lawyer. While at university, however, he continued his musical activities, including composition, although he had had only a few lessons in harmony. Eventually he persuaded his mother to let him show some of his compositions to Edgar Tinel, at the time one of Belgium’s most esteemed musicians. Tinel had never taken on private students (nor would he ever again), “but,” he wrote, “I let myself be conquered because <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> will one day be someone. He played me a sonata of his. I was stupified. He already is someone, but he has never studied. This fellow has written sonatas, trios, variations, duos …” His mother relented, and from 1891 to 1895 Joseph studied with Tinel.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Cecilia {{revolves}} around the heroine, Cecilia Beverley, whose inheritance from her uncle comes with the stipulation that she find a husband who will accept her name. Beset on all sides by would-be suitors, the beautiful and intelligent Cecilia's heart is captivated by a man whose family's pride in its birth and ancestry would forbid the only son-and-heir's change of name. <b>This</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> finally persuades Cecilia, against all her good judgement, to agree to marry him secretly, so that their union – and the consequent change of name – can {{be presented to the}} family as a fait accompli. The work received praise for the mature tone of its ironic third-person narration, but was viewed as less spontaneous than her first work, and weighed down by the author's self-conscious awareness of her audience. Some critics claim to have found the narration intrusive, while some of her friends found the writing too closely modelled on Johnson's. Edmund Burke greatly admired the novel, but moderated his praise with criticism of the enormous array of characters and tangled, convoluted plots.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Tavis Morello , an Eagle Scout, {{and staff}} member working at Yawgoog Scout Reservation {{was fired for}} admitting he was gay to Scouting Official Gary Savignano, who then {{proceeded}} to confiscated Morello's Eagle Scout card. Director of the Narragansett Council at the time, Lyle Antonides, defended the action stating that “I think <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is {{just trying to get}} a headline.” In response to the firing of their fellow staff member, {{the vast majority of the}} Reservations staff staged a sit-in as a sign of support, causing the camp to shut down. Following this, GLAD and the Rhode Island affiliate of the ACLU looked into the situation. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown is quoted as saying, “Based on the information I’ve heard, this person was terminated because he acknowledged he was gay. And that’s illegal.” Due to mounting legal pressures and increasing amounts of negative publicity, by the end of the camping season, the Narragansett Council had reversed its decision and offered to reinstate Morello, both as an employee and as an Eagle Scout.|$|E

500|$|The Roughriders offered Speedie double his Browns salary as the Canadian leagues {{tried to}} make names for {{themselves}} by signing top-level NFL players. Paul Brown refused to match the offer, and Speedie, who was making $11,000 per year with the Browns, joined the Canadian team for the 1953 season. Brown then threatened to sue Speedie for violating his existing contract with the team, saying the Browns had exercised an option to extend the deal after it expired {{in the summer of}} 1953. [...] "This was a case of jumping a contract, pure and simple, as <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> morally and ethically had a contract with us", Brown said at the time.

500|$|Psychiatric {{examinations}} {{and psychological}} tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature {{young man who}} was strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of [...] "an obvious mental breakdown". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> is developing a mental illness of hypomanic nature," [...] he wrote in his report. In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related what the doctor described as [...] "elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility".|$|E
500|$|Tchaikovsky began {{showing a}} keen {{interest}} in Glazunov shortly after hearing about the premiere of Glazunov's First Symphony from Taneyev. At that time, Tchaikovsky wrote Balakirev, [...] "Glazunov interests me greatly. Is there any chance that <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> could send me the symphony so that I might take a look at it? I should also like to know whether he completed it, either conceptually or practically, with your or Rimsky-Korsakov's help." [...] Balakirev replied, [...] "You ask about Glazunov. He is a very talented young man who studied for a year under Rimsky-Korsakov. When he composed his symphony, he did not need any help." [...] Tchaikovsky studied the score for Glazunov's First String Quartet, and wrote his brother Modest, [...] "Despite its imitation of Korsakov ... a remarkable talent is discernible." [...] Glazunov later sent Tchaikovsky a copy of his Poème lyrique for orchestra, about which Tchaikovsky had written enthusiastically to Balakirev, and had recommended for publication to his publisher P. Jurgenson.|$|E
500|$|The game's plot, as {{described}} by Dave Grossman: [...] "It's a story about <b>this</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who comes to an island {{in search of his}} life's dream. He's pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds up thinking that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You’re laughing, but there's actually something deeper going on as well." [...] When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer's and Grossman's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman's was [...] "very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor" [...] and Schafer's was [...] "just a little more in your face". In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer [...] "were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together". Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line [...] "I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.|$|E
