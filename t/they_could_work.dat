5|$|The archdiocese offers {{religious}} education classes {{in all of}} its 111 parishes for children who attend public and other non-religious schools. According to the 2007 Official Catholic Directory, there were 95,837 students enrolled in these classes. This same source lists as teachers 2760 laity, 58 religious sisters, and 43 priests and religious brothers. Religious education classes are also offered to adults throughout the archdiocese. In 1997, Archbishop Favalora adopted a policy requiring all volunteers, employees, teachers and priests to be fingerprinted and have a background check before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with children. Several years later, this policy was enshrined and adopted by all U.S. Bishops in the Charter for Protection of Young People.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 2001, during the original {{run of the}} Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A {{major part of the}} graphical design was adjusting the characters so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> in human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework was done with the setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Protestantism {{was focused}} on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. Many Bibles were large, {{illustrated}} and highly valuable objects. In {{the early part of the}} century the Genevan translation was commonly used. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorised King James Version and the first Scots version was printed in Scotland in 1633, but the Geneva Bible continued to be employed into the seventeenth century. Bibles often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out. The seventeenth century marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.|$|E

The Nuremberg Laws classified people as Jews (Volljuden) if they had three or four Jewish grandparents, and as mixed blood (Mischling) if they had one or two. It meant inter alia that the Wittgensteins were restricted in whom they could marry or have sex with, and where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

25|$|European railway {{air brakes}} include the Kunze-Knorr brake (invented by Georg Knorr and {{manufactured}} by Knorr-Bremse) and the Oerlikon. The working principle {{is the same}} as for the Westinghouse air brake. In the steam era, Britain's railways were divided– some using vacuum brakes and some using air brakes– but there was a gradual standardization on the vacuum brake. Some locomotives, e.g. on the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, were dual-fitted so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with either vacuum- or air-braked trains. In the diesel era, the process was reversed and British Railways switched from vacuum-braked to air-braked rolling stock in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Lanying did not marry, but {{she loved}} two men. The {{first one was}} Qichang Guan. Lanying and Qichang were in {{different}} classes of the same middle school. After graduation from middle school, Qichang went to another city with his parents, so they separated. But they continued their relationship by mail. Lanying and Qichang had different dreams about future. Qichang told Lanying {{that he wanted to}} marry her in the future and <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> as teachers in a middle school. However, Lanying was more ambitious. So when time went by, they stopped writing to each other. At the age of 17, Qichang died due to leukemia.|$|E
25|$|Littlejohn {{was accused}} of taking {{insufficient}} care to check the facts before publishing an article critical of cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. Littlejohn suggested Monroe, who prefers the singular they pronoun, chose {{to give up their}} job; in fact Monroe's young boy was unsettled with a range of different carers. As Monroe had grown up in a home with foster children they are aware of the potential for harming him. Monroe tried unsuccessfully to negotiate flexible hours so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> and look after their baby, but gave up their job so they could look after the child better. Littlejohn suggested incorrectly Monroe was an unemployed welfare claimant.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} process {{oriented}} psychology centres around {{the idea of}} 'process': a meaningful, connected pattern over time that can be observed and tracked through non-intentional signals (e.g. non-verbal communication, body symptoms, dreams, accidents, conflicts). It is claimed that becoming consciously aware of the 'dreaming process' may help to deal with disturbances including mental and physical distress, relationship troubles and social issues. The theory of a 'dreaming process' began with Arnold Mindell's concept of the 'dreambody', developed from Jungian dream analysis and the observation that dreams and body symptoms were meaningfully connected. Mindell asserted that a therapist could work with body experiences to reveal the unconscious just as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> with dreams.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Dickinson {{recommended}} Lowe {{to lead the}} Greater Dallas Council of Churches, and the leadership accepted him. The Council of Churches became a legitimate agency of the churches through which <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> “for justice and {{what is best for}} the City of Dallas” rather than a way of mobilizing area churches to support the policies of the Dallas Citizens Council. Lowe remained president for three years. He successfully increased the budget, and two programs were begun: one a city-wide counseling service staffed by ministers, and the other a permanent ministry at the county jail. A third program and by far the most controversial was Block Partnership, a plan to help solve problems in minority neighborhoods and to improve race relations by linking them with comparatively affluent white church groups. More than fifty partnerships were established between black and white neighborhoods, and a lot of problems were solved.|$|E

50|$|The Buchenwald Resistance was a {{resistance}} group of prisoners at Buchenwald concentration camp. It involved Communists, Social Democrats, and people affiliated with other political parties, unaffiliated people, and both Jews and Christians. Because Buchenwald prisoners {{came from a}} number of countries, the Resistance was also international. Members tried to sabotage Nazi efforts where <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> <b>worked</b> to save the lives of inmates who were children and in {{the last days of the}} camp, with many Nazis fleeing the approaching allied troops, they tried to gain control of the camp itself. After liberation, the prisoners created documents related to their experiences and formed an international committee to look after the welfare of survivors.|$|R
25|$|Christie had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} in archaeology. She met her second husband, Sir Max Mallowan, a distinguished archaeologist, {{on a trip}} to the excavation site at Ur in 1930. But her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology. Prior to meeting Mallowan, Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology, but once the two married, they made sure to only go to sites where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> together. Christie accompanied Mallowan on countless archaeological trips, spending 3–4 months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud. She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.|$|E
25|$|In 1515, {{after some}} wrangling, Ferdinand II {{was able to}} reclaim the island from Diego Colón, Viceroy of the Indies. By then, Isla de la Mona was an {{important}} point of trade between Spain {{and the rest of}} Latin America, as well as a rest stop for the crews of boats carrying slaves. With his possession of the island, King Ferdinand II gave the resident Taínos two options if they wished to continue living on the island: <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> by fishing, making hammocks and cultivating plants, or they could become miners and help in the mining of guano and other minerals. Realizing that mining would require intense labor, the majority of inhabitants chose to work as fishermen and farmers. By accepting this option, they also were exempted from paying imposed taxes, and were able to avoid the hard labor many other natives endured in mines. In time, natives from other neighboring islands were brought to Mona Island to assist with labor.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, the Students' Representative Council (SRC) was {{established}} to provide representation to the institution's students in relations with management and staff, this was {{in contrast to the}} mainly social activities of the SUS and the WSH, who were both recognised societies of the SRC. The SRC had offices on University Square, close to the WSH premises and held its meetings in the Union building. These three student organisations came together in 1965 to address ways that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>work</b> better and be more inclusive of all students at the University, in advance of the opening of a new Union building opposite the main Lanyon Building on University Road. This resulted in the establishment of a combined constitution for the three which were {{to be known as the}} Students' Representative Council of the Students' Union, which took effect from 1 October 1966. Its name was shortened to the Students' Union in 1975, with the SRC renamed the Students' Union Council in the early 2000s.|$|E
