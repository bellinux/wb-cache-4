All C. coli (43 strains), C. cryaerophila (34 strains), C. fennelliae (5 strains), C. fennelliae-Campylobacter-like organism 3 (2 strains), C. jejuni (66 strains), C. jejuni subsp. doylei (3 strains), hippurate-negative C. jejuni-C. coli (15 strains), "C. upsaliensis" (39 strains), H. mustelae (5 strains), W. curva (1 strain), and W. recta (1 strain) hydrolyzed indoxyl acetate.

40|$|Summary. Ram {{spermatozoa}} were washed with hypotonic tris-HCl buffer {{and obtained}} almost free of seminal plasma and cytoplasmic droplets. Acrosomes were dislodged by incubating the spermatozoa with a cationic detergent (Hyamine 2389). The acrosomal preparation and the buffer washings were examined {{for the following}} lysosomal enzymes: acid phosphatase, aryl sulphatase, =bN-acetylglucosaminidase, phospholipase A and proteases. All enzyme activities were detected, both in washings and in acrosomal preparations. The levels of activity in the latter were much higher than could be expected on the assump-tion that all activities were due to contamination by washings. Protease activity was greatest at pH 7 = [...] After vital staining with Euchrysine 3 R, acrosomal fluorescence in ram, bull, boar and human spermatozoa is not very conspicuous. How-ever, acrosomes of guinea-pig, hamster and several rodents show the brilliant orange-red fluorescence typical of lysosomes. As spermatids mature, red-fluorescing granules around the Golgi zone condense to form the red-fluorescent pro-acrosomes. Acid phosphatase was detectable histochemically in granules, pro=req- acrosomes, acrosomes and the pellets obtained by high-speed centrifuga-tion of acrosomal preparations. At all developmental stages, histo-chemical <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> bromochloroindoxyl <b>acetate</b> esterase showed that this enzyme was present only in the acrosome.

40|$|Alongside the {{well-established}} carbon {{catabolite repression}} by glucose and other sugars, acetate causes repression in Aspergillus nidulans. Mutations in creA, encoding the transcriptional repressor involved in glucose repression, also affect acetate repression, but mutations in creB or creC, encoding {{components of a}} deubiquitination system, do not. To understand the effects of acetate, we used a mutational screen that was similar to screens that uncovered mutations in creA, creB, and creC, except that glucose was replaced by acetate to identify mutations that were affected <b>for</b> repression by <b>acetate</b> but not by glucose. We uncovered mutations in acdX, homologous to the yeast SAGA component gene SPT 8, which in growth <b>tests</b> showed derepression <b>for</b> <b>acetate</b> repression but not for glucose repression. We also made mutations in sptC, homologous to the yeast SAGA component gene SPT 3, which showed a similar phenotype. We found that acetate repression is complex, and analysis of facA mutations (lacking acetyl CoA synthetase) indicates that acetate metabolism is required for repression of some systems (proline metabolism) but not for others (acetamide metabolism). Although plate tests indicated that acdX- and sptC-null mutations led to derepressed alcohol dehydrogenase activity, reverse-transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed no derepression of alcA or aldA but rather elevated induced levels. Our results indicate that acetate repression is due to repression via CreA together with metabolic changes rather than due to an independent regulatory control mechanism.

40|$|Two new {{techniques}} for {{the determination of}} monomer reactivity ratios in copolymerization under high-pressure conditions have been developed, viz., the “sandwich ” and the “quenching ” method. Both methods are based on repeated quantitative gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction mixture during the low-pressure stages preceding and succeeding the high-pressure stage, of which the kinetics is under investigation. Application of the “sandwich ” method implies the occurrence of reaction during both low-pressure stages and consequently the low-pressure kinetic data are re-quired to obtain the transition points of low to high pressure and vice versa. These points constitute the initial and final conditions of the relevant high-pressure reaction. On the contrary, in the “quenching ” method no reaction occurs during the low-pressure stages, owing to the lower tem-perature and the high activation energy of the initiator decomposition. As a consequence, the initial and final conditions of the high-pressure stage can be determined by a simple averaging procedure. Both methods have been <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> the ethylene-vinyl <b>acetate</b> copolymerization at 62 OC and 600 kg/cm 2 with tert-butyl alcohol as solvent, and appear to lead to almost identical monomer reactivity ratios, although the “quenching ” method is slightly preferred in case of copolymerization reactions.

30|$|The high NMR signal {{intensity}} <b>for</b> <b>acetate</b> and SN-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine in Arctic charr fed diet FM {{compared with}} diet ST indicates increased {{activity of the}} fatty acid metabolic pathway in the former. Increased acetate and SN-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine in the liver and intestinal tissues {{has been shown to}} be related to catabolism of dietary fatty acids in rainbow trout and sea bream (Randall et al. 2013; Robles et al. 2013). In general, fish meal contains high amounts of choline (4.3  g/kg; Barlow et al. 1979), which supports our findings of a higher NMR signal intensity for diet FM compared with diet ST. In the present study, the slightly higher content of crude fat in diet FM than in diet ST cannot explain the difference in NMR signal intensity <b>for</b> <b>acetate</b> between fish fed these two diets, since no difference in NMR signal intensity <b>for</b> <b>acetate</b> was observed between diets FM and FZ, despite the higher content of crude fat in diet FM. However, crude fat analyses do not distinguish between structural lipids, such as membrane lipids, and storage lipids, such as tri-acyl glycerols. A higher content of tri-acyl glycerol would be expected to result in more acetate being formed. Increased catabolism of ketogenic amino acids (Ile, Leu, Tryp, Lys, Phe) can also result in increased acetate concentrations in the liver. However, the highest contents of these amino acids were found in fish fed diet ST and therefore cannot explain the higher NMR signal intensity <b>for</b> <b>acetate</b> in fish fed diets FM and FZ. The NMR signal intensities for inosine and β-alanine were higher in fish fed diet FZ than diet ST, which could reflect the high content of pyrimidines and purines in the zygomycete-based diet (Wasternack 1978). β-alanine is normally metabolised to acetyl-CoA through the malonate semialdehyde pathway, which can explain the higher acetate concentration in the FZ group. β-alanine is involved in antioxidant and buffer activities in fish (Snyder et al. 2008) and elevated levels of β-alanine are found in tissues due to environmental changes and acute stress (Aragao et al. 2008).|$|R

Methane concentrations increased by 11 cm, despite pore water sulphate not being removed until 45 cm. Neither upward methane diffusion or anaerobic oxidation of methane seemed to be important in this zone. In the near-surface sulphate-reduction zone (5 – 25 cm) turnover time to methane for the non-competitive methanogenic substrate trimethylamine was most rapid (80 days), and were much longer <b>for</b> <b>acetate</b> (7900 days), methanol (40, 500 days) and bicarbonate (361, 600 days). Methylamine-utilizing Methanosarcinales were the dominant (60 – 95 %) methanogens in this zone. In deeper sediments rates of methanogenesis from competitive substrates increased substantially, with acetate methanogenic rates becoming ∼ 100 times greater than H 2 /CO 2 methanogenesis below 50 cm. In addition, there was a dramatic change in methanogen diversity with obligate acetate-utilizing, Methanosaeta related sequences being dominant. At a similar depth methanol turnover to methane increased to its most rapid (1700 days). This activity pattern is consistent with deeper methanogen populations (55 cm) being dominated by acetate-utilizing Methanosaeta with H 2 /CO 2 and alcohol-utilizing Methanomicrobiales also present. Hence, there is close relationship between the depth distribution of methanogenic substrate utilization and specific methanogens that can utilize these compounds.
