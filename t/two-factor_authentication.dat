5|$|Valve added Steam Guard {{functionality}} to the Steam {{client in}} March 2011 {{to protect against}} the hijacking of accounts via phishing schemes, one of the largest support issues Valve had at the time. Steam Guard was advertised {{to take advantage of the}} identity protection provided by Intel's second-generation Core processors and compatible motherboard hardware, which allows users to lock their account to a specific computer. Once locked, activity by that account on other computers must first be approved by the user on the locked computer. Support APIs for Steam Guard are available to third-party developers through Steamworks. Steam Guard also offers two-factor, risk-based authentication that uses a one-time verification code sent to a verified email address associated with the Steam account; this was later expanded to include <b>two-factor</b> <b>authentication</b> through the Steam mobile application, known as Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator. If Steam Guard is enabled, the verification code is sent each time the account is used from an unknown machine.|$|E

25|$|This <b>two-factor</b> <b>authentication</b> is {{intended}} to {{make it difficult for}} an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key, although it does not prevent so-called Man in the Browser (MITB) attacks. However, the user (or malicious third party) can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account. Thus the PayPal implementation does not offer the security of true <b>two-factor</b> <b>authentication.</b>|$|E

To increase the security of logging for authorized persons we often introduce a <b>two-factors</b> <b>authentication,</b> where the first step is verification of the user's identity and in a second step is required to insert a one-time password called OTP. This thesis deals with implementation of OTP and integration into the selected sys-tem. It also includes test and verification of the functionality of the selected solution...|$|R

25|$|To help users {{protect their}} Battle.net accounts, Blizzard {{implemented}} a <b>two-factor</b> <b>authentication</b> {{option for the}} service. Launched in 2008, this was initially through a separate device that could be purchased from Blizzard, encoded with the user's credentials. The device fit on a keychain and would generate pseudorandom numbers linked to the player's account, which they would enter when logging into Battle.net to affirm their identity. Later, Blizzard introduced the Battle.net mobile application for iOS and Android platforms in 2009, replicating the same functionality. An update during June 2016 simplified the process, allowing the user, when logging into their Battle.net account from a computer, to simply press a single button on their connected mobile device to affirm their authenticity. Though not required to use Battle.net, some game aspects require the user to enable <b>two-factor</b> <b>authentication</b> through either the device or mobile app, such as Diablo IIIs Auction House (which uses real money transactions).|$|E

25|$|Strong {{authentication}} requires {{providing more}} than one type of authentication information (<b>two-factor</b> <b>authentication).</b> The username {{is the most common}} form of identification on computer systems today and the password is {{the most common form of}} authentication. Usernames and passwords have served their purpose but in our modern world they are no longer adequate. Usernames and passwords are slowly being replaced with more sophisticated authentication mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The Bank of America's website is one {{of several}} that ask users to select a {{personal}} image (marketed as SiteKey), and display this user-selected image with any forms that request a password. Users of the bank's online services are instructed to enter a password only when they see the image they selected. However, several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent. In addition, this feature (like other forms of <b>two-factor</b> <b>authentication)</b> is susceptible to other attacks, such as those suffered by Scandinavian bank Nordea in late 2005, and Citibank in 2006.|$|E

Newell stated that the application was a strong request from Steam users and sees it as a means [...] "to make [...] richer and more accessible for everyone".

40|$|User {{authentication}} in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSN) is {{a critical}} security issue due to their unattended and hostile deployment in the field. Since sensor nodes are equipped with limited computing power, storage, and communication modules; authenticating remote users in such resource-constrained environments is a paramount security concern. Recently, M. L. Das proposed a <b>two-factor</b> user <b>authentication</b> scheme in WSNs and claimed that his scheme is secure against different kinds of attack. However, in this paper, we show that the M. L. Das-scheme has some critical security pitfalls and cannot be recommended for real applications. We point out that in his scheme: users cannot change/update their passwords, it does not provide mutual authentication between gateway node and sensor node, and is vulnerable to gateway node bypassing attack and privileged-insider attack. To overcome the inherent security weaknesses of the M. L. Das-scheme, we propose improvements and security patches that attempt to fix the susceptibilities of his scheme. The proposed security improvements can be incorporated in the M. L. Das-scheme for achieving a more secure and robust <b>two-factor</b> user <b>authentication</b> in WSNs...|$|R

The Argus camera company, originally a subsidiary of International Radio, manufactured cameras in Ann Arbor from 1936 to the 1960s.

Ann Arbor Terminals manufactured a video-display terminal called the Ann Arbor Ambassador during the 1980s. Barracuda Networks, which provides networking, security, and storage products based on network appliances and cloud services, opened an engineering office in Ann Arbor in 2008 on Depot St. and recently announced it will move downtown to occupy the building previously used as the Borders headquarters.

After that we prove the proposed scheme is autonomous and effective for both sides in the authentication process...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>two-factor</b> multiserver <b>authentication</b> {{protocol}} {{was developed to}} avoid multiple number of registrations using multiple smart-cards and passwords. Recently, a variety of <b>two-factor</b> multiserver <b>authentication</b> protocols have been developed. It is observed that the existing RSA-based multiserver authentication protocols are not suitable in terms of computation complexities and security attacks. To provide lower complexities and security resilience against known attacks, this article proposes a two-factor (password and smart-card) user authentication protocol with the RSA cryptosystem for multiserver environments. The comprehensive security discussion proved that the known security attacks are eliminated in our protocol. Besides, our protocol supports session key agreement and mutual authentication between the application server and the user. We analyze the proof of correctness of the mutual authentication and freshness of session key using the BAN logic model. The experimental outcomes obtained through simulation of the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) S/W show that our protocol is secured. We consider the computation, communication, and storage costs and the comparative explanations show that our protocol is flexible and efficient compared with protocols. In addition, our protocol offers security resilience against known attacks and provides lower computation complexities than existing protocols. Additionally, the protocol offers password change facility to the authorized user...|$|R

BeamAuth is deployable immediately by any login-protected web server with only minimal work, and it neither weakens nor interferes with other anti-phishing techniques.
