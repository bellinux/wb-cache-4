5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not to know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> {{even though he is}} seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E
25|$|Huckabee has voiced {{his support}} for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has {{generally}} taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed. He has said that whenever he hears people start talking about hunting when referring to the Second Amendment, he realizes {{they do not know}} what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.|$|E
500|$|Actor Diedrich Bader guest {{starred in}} the episode as the sheriff. The Simpsons {{producer}} Ian Maxtone-Graham directed Bader during his recording session, telling the guest star to do a Southern accent. The episode also features guest appearances from talk show host Charlie Rose and film producer Robert Evans as themselves. Evans and Rose appear in a scene {{at the beginning of}} the episode, when Homer stays up late and watches television because of his fear that he might die in his sleep. Rose is seen interviewing Evans on the television, and as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Evan's film Love Story, Rose says: [...] "And the critics loved it, too. I remember Vincent Canby said, [...] 'I'm going to kill you, Homer. You are so dead.'" [...] The last part is imagined by Homer, who has become incredibly sleepy. Later in the interview, when talking about his unsuccessful film The Two Jakes, Evans says: [...] "I said to myself, 'Evans, you forgot Hollywood Rule No. 1: [...] Kill Homer Simpson.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Dawkins was {{confirmed}} into the Church of England {{at the age}} of 13, but began to grow sceptical of the beliefs. After learning about Darwinism and the scientific reason why living things look as though they have been designed, Dawkins lost the remainder of his religious faith. He said that his understanding of science and evolutionary processes led him to question how adults in positions of leadership in a civilized world could still be so uneducated in biology, and is puzzled by how belief in God could remain among individuals who are sophisticated in science. Dawkins notes that some physicists use 'God' {{as a metaphor for the}} general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which causes confusion and misunderstanding among people who incorrectly think <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> a mystical being which forgives sins, transubstantiates wine, or makes people live after they die. He disagrees with Stephen Jay Gould's principle of nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA) and suggests that the existence of God should be treated as a scientific hypothesis like any other. Dawkins became a prominent critic of religion and has stated his opposition to religion as twofold: religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence. He considers faith—belief that is not based on evidence—as [...] "one of the world's great evils".|$|E
500|$|Like other fantasy novels, the Septimus Heap {{series is}} set in an {{imaginary}} world. Maps are provided {{in all of the}} books. Magyk contains a map of the Castle and its surroundings to the Port in the south. An enlarged map of the Castle is also included. Flyte has a map showing the Badlands and the Borderlands in the north. Physik has an enlarged map of the Castle with more details showing the Alchemie chambers. Queste has a map for the House of Foryx, drawn by Snorri for Marcellus. Syren keeps the past maps but adds the isles of Syren. The map in Syren also mentions that the country that Septimus lives in is called [...] "The Small Wet Country Across the Sea". Darke has a map similar to that in Magyk, however, instead of including Marram Marshes which are south of the castle, it includes a map of the Darke Halls, bleak creek and the bottomless whirlpool. It also includes an enlarged map of the castle. At the end of Fyre, Septimus writes in the snow that the date is [...] 4 July 12,004. The book ends with a quote from Arthur C Clarke: [...] "Any Sufficiently Advanced Technology is Indistinguishable from Magyk"., hinting that the series {{is set in}} the far future. This also hinted at by a dialogue between Lucy Gringe and Wolf Boy in Syren about the Red Tube. Wolf Boy says he has heard stories that people used to travel to the moon in things like that. Lucy dismisses this, however, it's apparent <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Apollo moon missions. [...] Hints that the story is set in the future also reveal themselves when Septimus and the possessed Syrah enter a chamber that goes up and down with the press of a button, indicating that they used an elevator.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is always}} {{disagreement}} between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished {{area of the}} sea {{in the shape of}} a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats. Scientists would survey the entire field, make lots of unsuccessful hauls, and conclude that it contains few fish. The fishermen would make a beeline to the goals, catch the fish around them, and say the scientists do not know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> The subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there's lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly ...|$|E

2500|$|For much of {{its early}} history, the Smith Center's {{atmosphere}} was compared unfavorably to that of Carmichael and other college arenas. Florida State player Sam Cassell was famously {{quoted as saying that}} the Dean Dome “is not a Duke kind of crowd. It’s more like a cheese-and-wine crowd, kind of laid back." [...] In contrast, Carmichael Auditorium was known for its noise level; before one game, the Virginia Cavaliers couldn't hear their names announced during player introductions because of the din. Over time, however, the Smith Center developed its own tradition as a basketball mecca. After the Tar Heels defeated then top-ranked Ohio State in 2006, Buckeyes coach Thad Matta stated, [...] "I think I’ve never been in a building that was as loud as that building was at times." [...] Earlier, after the then top-ranked Connecticut Huskies were defeated by Carolina at the Dean Dome in 2004, Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said, [...] "I don't know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> because there was no 'wine and cheese' crowd here today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such criticism, Wolf said, [...] "All {{the people}} who are attacking me right now for 'conspiracy theories' have no idea what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> ... people who assume the {{dominant}} narrative MUST BE TRUE and the dominant reasons MUST BE REAL are not experienced in how that world works." [...] To her nearly 100,000 Facebook followers, Wolf maintained, [...] "I stand by what I wrote." [...] However, in a follow-up Facebook post two days later, Wolf retracted her statement: [...] "I am not asserting that the ISIS videos have been staged," [...] she wrote. [...] "I certainly sincerely apologize if one of my posts was insensitively worded. I have taken that one down. ... I am not saying the ISIS beheading videos are not authentic. I am not saying they are not records of terrible atrocities. I am saying that they are not yet independently confirmed by two sources as authentic, which any Journalism School teaches, and the single source for several of them, SITE, which received half a million dollars in government funding in 2004, and which is the only source cited for several, has conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers of news outlets." [...] Wolf did not say how it was possible to independently verify the videos posted by SITE.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1946, Cowles {{was hired}} as the head {{basketball}} coach at the University of Michigan, succeeding Bennie Oosterbaan. [...] Upon hiring Cowles, Michigan's athletic director Fritz Crisler said, [...] "In recommending Mr. Cowles, I feel that we are very fortunate. [...] He is absolutely in my estimation the best possible man for the position we could select." [...] In {{his first year at}} Michigan, he led the team to a 12–8 record. [...] The following year, he led the 1947–48 Michigan Wolverines to a 16–6 (.727) record. [...] The team won the 1948 Big Ten Conference championship. [...] In February 1948, as Cowles led the Wolverines to a turnaround season, the press focused on Cowles' success in Ann Arbor. [...] The Toledo Blade sports editor wrote:"Win, lose or draw in the red hot scramble for the Western Conference basketball title, the University of Michigan team has done so surprisingly well this season that Coach Ozzie Cowles is getting as much applause on the Ann Arbor campus as came to Fritz Crisler after the football season. [...] Michigan for years has prided itself on its well rounded athletic program. ... But until Cowles was lured away from Dartmouth to take charge of the Wolverine cagers, basketball wasn't going too well at Michigan. ... Those who should know what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> say that Michigan is winning this year, not because of any great supply of sterling cage performers, but because of the personality and coaching finesse of Cowles." ...|$|E
