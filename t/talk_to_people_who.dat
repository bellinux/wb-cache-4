This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E

The airliner's flight crew continued the approach and landed without incident; the DC-6 was almost completely unscathed except for some minor damage to a fuselage-mounted radio antenna and the No. 4 propeller.

500|$|Jagger {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll" [...] by AllMusic and MSN, with Billboard sharing a similar sentiment calling him [...] "the rock and roll frontman". Musician David Bowie joined many rock bands with blues, folk and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid-1960s, and he was to recall: [...] "I used to dream of being their Mick Jagger". Bowie would also offer that [...] "I think Mick Jagger would be astounded and amazed if he realized that to many people he is not a sex symbol, but a mother image." [...] Jagger appeared on Rolling Stone List of 100 Greatest Singers at number 16; in the article, Lenny Kravitz wrote: [...] "I sometimes <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. [...] His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection." [...] This edition also cites Mick Jagger as a key influence on Jack White, Steven Tyler and Iggy Pop.|$|E

50|$|In {{private life}} (family, friends, clubs, local pubs etc.), the dialect is still used {{relatively}} {{frequently in the}} region. However, it has almost vanished as a vernacular in public places.

2500|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} {{and its effects}} vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted for two days. The morning of the first day, August 22, was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger, who at that point was staying at Misenum, {{on the other side}} of the Bay of Naples about [...] from the volcano, which may have prevented him from noticing the early signs of {{the eruption}}. He was not to have any opportunity, during the next two days, to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had witnessed the eruption from Pompeii or Herculaneum (indeed he never mentions Pompeii in his letter), so he would not have noticed early, smaller fissures and releases of ash and smoke on the mountain, if such had occurred earlier in the morning. Around 1:00 P.M., Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, spewing up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day, August 23, pyroclastic flows in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights seen on the mountain were interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense, and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By evening of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.|$|E

5000|$|... "We cannot simply {{expect them}} to say, 'Our older people have had {{experience}} and they have proved to themselves certain things, therefore they are right.' That isn't the way {{the best kind of}} young people think. They want to experience for themselves.

Miss Todd greatly dreaded the speaking-trumpet; she did not usually care one straw for Mrs. Leake's tongue, nor much for her carriage and horses, or county standing; but the Littlebath world called on Mrs. Leake; and Miss Todd being at Rome did as Romans do.|$|E

I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> run these companies in the US, United Kingdom and Switzerland and then I researched the type of personality working at them".|$|R

5000|$|Vinyl is a 2000 {{documentary}} film by Toronto filmmaker/record collector Alan Zweig. In the film, Zweig seeks not to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> collect vinyl records to discuss music, {{but rather to}} discuss what drives someone to collect records in the first place. Zweig spends {{a large portion of}} the film in stylized self-filmed [...] "confessions", where he expounds on his life in regard to record collecting, feeling it has prevented him from fulfilling his dreams of a family.|$|E
5000|$|Preservation {{architect}} Gordon Olschlager {{moved into}} one of the units in 1992 and restored it using Ain's original drawings. Olschlager removed additions that were not part of Ain's original design. Olschlager also restored the sliding glass walls and sliding wood room dividers. [...] Olschlager did not reverse all of the modifications, however, noting: [...] "When you <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> know Gregory Ain, they say that he would have been comfortable with people personalizing their space." [...] Olschlager won a Merit Award in the Western Home Awards for his work on the Avenel Cooperative.|$|E

Code-switching takes place when a bilingual uses two or more languages in a conversation {{and this is a}} natural effect of knowing more than one language. Codeswitching can take place {{due to a lack of}} sufficient vocabulary in one of the languages to express an idea (not to be confused with a lack of sufficient vocabulary knowledge from the speaker)and so the speaker expresses the idea using another language. However, codeswitching can also be done to convey special emphasis or establish cultural identity.|$|R

Hanpei Hattori, a detective who provides comedy relief, helps them. During some battles, Professor Gill uses his evil flute to stop Jiro from becoming Kikaider. Jiro manages {{to find a way}} to drown out or block the sound of the flute. Dr. Kohmyoji (wandering with amnesia) is usually a figure in the background. Mitsuko and Masuru often <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have encountered him, but never manage to catch up with him. On occasion, when Kikaider is damaged, Dr. Kohmyoji manages to fix him, without quite knowing what he is doing.|$|E

Professor Megan Winget of the University of Texas is the coordinator {{of a project}} to study {{the best way to}} preserve video game history. A BBC interview with her revealed:During preliminary work many people mentioned the importance of the murder of Lord British — actually the avatar of Richard Garriott, co-creator of Ultima Online.

As a result, he embarked on {{writing a book on}} Hinduism and ecology, and that brought him to Vrindavan [...] "with a completely fresh pair of eyes". [...] "Instead of just thinking, well, this must be the way it is and there's nothing I can do, I began thinking, well, why has it become dilapidated, why is it not being looked after, and what could possibly change things?

50|$|He imbibed {{socio-cultural}} ethos {{from his}} upbringing in several {{rural areas of}} Andhra Pradesh, and this prompted {{him to make the}} movie in the Telugu language.

Referring to filming the burrakatha (a story telling technique used in southern India) scene {{at the beginning of the}} film, Domalpalli said:If you <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> perform a Burrakatha, you will see a huge difference in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it...

We made a promise we can't deliver - we didn't win the election outright and there are compromises in coalition."
