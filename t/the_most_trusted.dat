5|$|The companions, {{including}} the elite companion cavalry and pezhetairoi infantry, represented a substantially larger group than the king's bodyguards. The {{ranks of the}} companions were greatly increased {{during the reign of}} Philip II when he expanded this institution to include Upper Macedonian aristocrats as well as Greeks. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> or highest ranking companions formed a council that served as an advisory body to the king. A small amount of evidence also suggests that an assembly of the army during times of war and a people's assembly during times of peace existed in ancient Macedonia. The first recorded instance dates to 359 BC, when Philip II called together a number of assemblies to address them with speech and raise their morale following the death of Perdiccas III of Macedon in battle against the Illyrians.|$|E

Atahualpa was in awe of these men dressed in full clothing, with long beards and riding horses (an animal he had never seen). In town Pizzaro set a trap for the Inca and the Battle of Cajamarca began. The Inca forces greatly out numbered the Spanish; however, the Spanish superiority of weapons and tactics and the fact that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> Inca generals were in Cusco led to an easy defeat and the capture of the Incan Emperor.|$|E
25|$|In 1531, Guicciardini was {{assigned}} the governorship of Bologna, {{the most important}} city in the northern Papal States by Clement VII.

Guiccardini defended him in Naples in 1535 before Charles V, contesting the exiled rebels' accusations of tyranny. He assisted in successfully negotiating the marriage of Alessandro to the emperor Charles V’s daughter Margaret of Parma in 1536, and for a short time Gucciardini was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> advisor to Alessandro until the Duke's assassination in 1537.|$|E

He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is happy with what he gets. He grew up in an orphanage and was evicted from a slum due to neglecting bills at the start of the series, and he joined TNT on accident.

25|$|Romanian {{spirituality is}} greatly {{influenced}} by its strong connections with the Eastern Christian world. The modern national mythology contends Romanians are An island of Latinity in a Slavic sea and The only Orthodox Christian Latin people. There {{are only a few}} Romanian Catholics (of both the Roman and Greek rites) and a small number of Protestants, the vast majority of Romanians being Romanian Orthodox (over 81%). Despite the diminishing importance of the church in recent generations, it remains <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> institution in Romania. Church attendance is high in rural communities and among the elders in the cities. Also, despite accusations of collaborationism with the communist regime, which continue to plague the Romanian Church, some clerics such as Dumitru Stăniloae and Richard Wurmbrandt openly protested against political interventions in religious business. There are also some Muslims living in the country.|$|E
25|$|He {{came from}} a family of criminals: his father died when he was a child, and his mother died after being riddled by machine gun fire during a botched robbery attempt in his teenage years. He has three younger brothers, a set of {{triplets}} called Tim, Tom and Tumb, who are professional criminals and frequently try to use Bob as the scapegoat in their criminal schemes. Despite this, Bob refuses to follow the criminal career path and frequently berates his brothers for it, despite them being clearly more successful than Bob. He stopped berating them after they joined the TNT under The Great Caesar. Bob has a poetic side: he frequently tries to write books or poems that end up being rejected by even the worst publishers and/or ridiculed by other TNT members. He is mostly at odds with Number One for abnormally poor salary and his tyrannical attitude, and he is usually attacked by Number One with his stick when Bob provokes him. Despite this, he is one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> TNT agents.|$|E
25|$|Arms Procurement and {{shipping}} activities of LTTE were largely clandestine. Prior to 1983, it procured weapons mainly from Afghanistan via the Indo-Pakistani border. Explosives were purchased from commercial markets in India. From 1983 to 1987, LTTE acquired {{a substantial amount}} of weapons from RAW and from Lebanon, Cyprus, Singapore, and Malaysia-based arms dealers. LTTE received its first consignment of arms from Singapore in 1984 on board the MV Cholan, the first ship owned by the organisation. Funds were received and cargo cleared at Chennai Port with the assistance of M. G. Ramachandran, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. In November 1994, the LTTE was able to purchase 60 tonnes of explosives (50 tonnes of TNT and 10 tonnes of RDX) from Rubezone Chemical plant in Ukraine, providing a forged Bangladeshi Ministry of Defense end-user certificate. Payments for the explosives were made from a Citibank account in Singapore held by Selvarasa Pathmanathan. Consignment was transported on board MV Sewne. The same explosives were used for the Central Bank bombing in 1996. Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia remained <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>trusted</b> outposts of LTTE, after India alienated it after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.|$|E
