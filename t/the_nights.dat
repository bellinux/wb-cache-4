5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Saidor, the Japanese elected to retreat rather than fight, and withdrew over {{the foothills of}} the rugged Finisterre Range. For the Japanese {{soldiers}} involved, the march was a nightmare, as they struggled through the jungles, across the swollen rivers, and over cliffs and mountains. Men succumbed to fatigue, disease, starvation, drowning, and even exposure, <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> in the Finisterres being bitterly cold. Hampered by the rugged terrain, inclement weather, signal failures, misunderstandings, over-caution, and above all the resolute and resourceful Japanese, US troops were unable to prevent large numbers of the retreating Japanese from slipping past them.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} during Amenhotep I's reign the first water clock was invented. Amenhotep's court {{astronomer}} Amenemheb took credit for creating this device in his tomb biography, although the oldest surviving mechanism {{dates to the}} reign of Amenhotep III. This invention was of great benefit for timekeeping, because the Egyptian hour was not a fixed amount of time, but was measured as 1/12 of the night. When <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> were shorter in the summer, these waterclocks could be adjusted to measure the shorter hours accurately.|$|E
5|$|Sonic Team {{decided to}} give all {{characters}} in the game voices as Iizuka believed that full dialogue helps add depth to both the story and gameplay. With Nights already designed as an androgynous character, the team wanted to leave impressions regarding gender up to the player, despite Nights having a female voice in the game. The team designed <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> franchise to have a distinctly British style, in contrast to Sonic the Hedgehog, {{which was designed to}} be more American. Thus, Bellbridge—the game's main setting—closely resembles London, and all of the game's characters have English accents. The development team consisted of 26 members of Sonic Team in the United States, while all sound work and CGI was developed in Japan.|$|E
5|$|The next day, an {{additional}} 53,823 men were embarked, {{including the first}} French soldiers. Lord Gort and 68,014 men were evacuated on 31 May, leaving Major-General Harold Alexander {{in command of the}} rearguard. A further 64,429 Allied soldiers departed on 1 June, before the increasing air attacks prevented further daylight evacuation. The British rearguard of 4,000 men left on the night of 2–3 June. An additional 75,000 French troops were retrieved over <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> of 2–4 June, before the operation finally ended. The remainder of the rearguard—40,000 French troops—surrendered on 4 June. Churchill made a point of stating in his We shall fight on the beaches address in the House on 4 June, that the evacuation had been made possible through the efforts of the RAF.|$|E

5|$|The {{recession}} of the 1930s was only halted by the increasing tension as the Second World War loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield {{were set to}} work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, {{but it was the}} heavy bombing over <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> of 12 and 15 December 1940 (now known as the Sheffield Blitz) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The sisters {{remained}} with their squadrons until 1917 {{when they were}} converted into minelayers, Bellona in May and Boadicea in October, Bellona replacing her sister in the 2nd Battle Squadron that month. After her conversion, Boadicea {{was assigned to the}} 4th Battle Squadron in January 1918 and neither ship was reassigned {{before the end of the}} war. They laid mines at the entrance to the Kattegat on <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> of 18/19 and 24/25 February 1918 and both made several other sorties to lay their mines before the end of the war. They were placed in reserve after the war and taken out of service in 1920. Bellona was quickly sold for scrap in 1921, but Boadicea was not sold until 1926.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} made in September 2008, the Social Democrats, the Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party and the Danish People's Party {{agreed to}} not fund {{an expansion of}} the metro northwest. Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays through Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended {{to the rest of the}} week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the system could be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Trafford Park {{was largely}} {{turned over to}} the {{production}} of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124incendiaries and 120high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.|$|E
5|$|German {{submarines}} {{and surface}} warships sortied {{to attack the}} Allied invasion fleet, and the Australian members of Coastal Command participated in attacks on these vessels. The two RAAF flying boat squadrons operated intensively throughout June, but did not sink any German ships or submarines. The aircrew {{of two of the}} British B-24 Liberators that sank German submarines during this period included Australian personnel, however, and Australians were on board several of the other RAF aircraft flying anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols. In addition, No.455 Squadron took part in several attacks on E-boats operating near Normandy as well as German shipping travelling through the English Channel. No.460 Squadron and Australians in other Bomber Command units also participated in raids on E-Boat bases at Le Havre and Boulogne on <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> of 14/15 June and 15/16 June respectively.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, for the North Vietnamese {{the battle}} was {{just one part of}} the May Offensive, {{although}} they later claimed to have killed 800 Australians during a single attack—a fact which may have indicated the importance they placed on it at the time. They had reacted quickly and proficiently to mount a battalion attack on the first night in an attempt to push the Australians off their line of communications; however, while the attacks on Coral and Balmoral had been well co-ordinated, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had repeatedly surrendered the element of surprise with preparatory fire and poor light discipline alerting the defenders on each occasion. Meanwhile, rigid command-and-control arrangements and a lack of radio communications had forced the North Vietnamese to operate on fixed schedules, preventing them from taking the initiative or responding rapidly to changing situations. Such inflexibility had resulted in predictability, with the communist commanders ultimately committing their forces to a frontal assault on Coral on the first night, and mounting very similar attacks against Balmoral on <b>the</b> <b>nights</b> of 26 and 28 May, both of which ended in costly failures.|$|E
