5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color receptivity, <b>trichromatic</b> vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light level required for human vision. This is partly {{the result of}} cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light. Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats' eyes. Unlike some big cats, such as tigers, domestic cats have slit pupils. These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration, and are needed since the domestic cat's pupils are much larger, relative to their eyes, than the pupils of the big cats. At low light levels a cat's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes. However, domestic cats have rather poor color vision and (like most nonprimate mammals) have only two types of cones, optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green. A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which {{might be due to}} a third type of cone. However, this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true <b>trichromatic</b> vision.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the <b>trichromatic</b> colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E

25|$|Perception {{of color}} begins with {{specialized}} retinal cells containing pigments with different spectral sensitivities, known as cone cells. In humans, {{there are three}} types of cones sensitive to three different spectra, resulting in <b>trichromatic</b> color vision.|$|E
25|$|The RGB color {{model is}} based on the Young–Helmholtz theory of <b>trichromatic</b> color vision, {{developed}} by Thomas Young and Hermann Helmholtz in the early to mid nineteenth century, and on James Clerk Maxwell's color triangle that elaborated that theory (circa 1860).|$|E
25|$|In September {{researchers}} {{were able to}} give <b>trichromatic</b> vision to squirrel monkeys.

25|$|In the 1920s, W. David Wright and John Guild {{independently}} {{conducted a}} series of experiments on human sight which laid the foundation for the specification of the CIE XYZ color space.

25|$|Many {{invertebrates}} have {{color vision}}. Honeybees and bumblebees have <b>trichromatic</b> color vision which is insensitive to red but sensitive to ultraviolet. Osmia rufa, for example, possess a <b>trichromatic</b> color system, which they use in foraging for pollen from flowers. In {{view of the}} importance of color vision to bees one might expect these receptor sensitivities to reflect their specific visual ecology; for example the types of flowers that they visit. However, the main groups of hymenopteran insects excluding ants (i.e., bees, wasps and sawflies) mostly have three types of photoreceptor, with spectral sensitivities similar to the honeybee's. Papilio butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision. The most complex color vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp) with up to 12 spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.|$|E
25|$|In most Catarrhini (Old World {{monkeys and}} apes—primates {{closely related to}} humans) there are three types of color receptors (known as cone cells), {{resulting}} in <b>trichromatic</b> color vision. These primates, like humans, are known as trichromats. Many other primates (including New World monkeys) and other mammals are dichromats, which is the general color vision state for mammals that are active during the day (i.e., felines, canines, ungulates). Nocturnal mammals may {{have little or no}} color vision. Trichromat non-primate mammals are rare.|$|E
25|$|Holmium oxide {{has some}} fairly {{dramatic}} color changes {{depending on the}} lighting conditions. In daylight, it is a tannish yellow color. Under <b>trichromatic</b> light, it is a fiery orange red, almost indistinguishable from the way erbium oxide looks under this same lighting. This {{is related to the}} sharp emission bands of the phosphors. Holmium oxide has a wide band gap of 5.3 eV and thus should appear colorless. The yellow color originates from abundant lattice defects (such as oxygen vacancies) and is related to internal transitions at the Ho3+ ions.|$|E
25|$|UVS is also {{demonstrated}} to serve functions in foraging, prey identification, and frugivory. Similar advantages afforded to <b>trichromatic</b> primates over dichromatic primates in frugivory are {{generally considered to}} exist in birds. The waxy surfaces of many fruits and berries reﬂect UV light that advertise their presence to UVS birds. Common kestrels be able to locate the trails of voles with vision; these small rodents lay scent trails of urine and feces that reﬂect UV light, making them visible to the kestrels. However, this view has been challenged by the finding of low UV sensitivity in raptors and weak UV reflection of mammal urine.|$|E
25|$|The CIE {{assembled}} {{a committee to}} study the matter and accepted the proposal to use the latter approach, which has the virtue of not needing spectrophotometry, {{with a set of}} Munsell samples. Eight samples of varying hue would be alternately lit with two illuminants, and the color appearance compared. Since no color appearance model existed at the time, it was decided to base the evaluation on color differences in a suitable color space, CIEUVW. In 1931, the CIE adopted the first formal system of colorimetry, which is based on the <b>trichromatic</b> nature of the human visual system. CRI is based upon this system of colorimetry.|$|E
25|$|Early amniotes {{had four}} opsins in the cones of their retinas {{to use for}} {{distinguishing}} colours: one sensitive to red, one to green, and two corresponding to different shades of blue. The green opsin was not inherited by any crown mammals, but all normal individuals did inherit the red one. Early crown mammals thus had three cone opsins, the red one and both of the blues. All their extant descendants have lost one of the blue-sensitive opsins but not always the same one: marsupials and placentals (except for cetaceans) retain one blue-sensitive opsin while monotremes retain the other. Some placentals and marsupials, including humans, subsequently evolved green-sensitive opsins; like early crown mammals, therefore, their vision is <b>trichromatic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The common {{fluorescent}} lamp relies on fluorescence. Inside the glass tube is a partial vacuum {{and a small}} amount of mercury. An electric discharge in the tube causes the mercury atoms to emit mostly ultraviolet light. The tube is lined with a coating of a fluorescent material, called the phosphor, which absorbs the ultraviolet and re-emits visible light. Fluorescent lighting is more energy-efficient than incandescent lighting elements. However, the uneven spectrum of traditional {{fluorescent lamp}}s may cause certain colors to appear different than when illuminated by incandescent light or daylight. The mercury vapor emission spectrum is dominated by a short-wave UV line at 254nm (which provides most of the energy to the phosphors), accompanied by visible light emission at 436nm (blue), 546nm (green) and 579nm (yellow-orange). These three lines can be observed superimposed on the white continuum using a hand spectroscope, for light emitted by the usual white fluorescent tubes. These same visible lines, accompanied by the emission lines of trivalent europium and trivalent terbium, and further accompanied by the emission continuum of divalent europium in the blue region, comprise the more discontinuous light emission of the modern <b>trichromatic</b> phosphor systems used in many compact fluorescent lamp and traditional lamps where better color rendition is a goal.|$|E

This specification was upheld by a decree of December 7, 1955.

500|$|It is a dopant in {{some types}} of glass in lasers and other {{optoelectronic}} devices. Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1g of europium oxide. Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on {{the composition of the}} host structure. UV to deep red luminescence can be achieved. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green terbium phosphors give [...] "white" [...] light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make <b>trichromatic</b> systems in TV and computer screens. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper-doped zinc sulfide is europium-doped strontium aluminate. Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens. It is also used in the anti-counterfeiting phosphors in euro banknotes.|$|E
500|$|Like {{all three}} species of Palaeopropithecus, Archaeoindris {{exhibited}} derived traits {{not seen in}} the two other less specialized genera of sloth lemur.

[...] Its skull was wider than that of Megaladapis, but shorter, measuring [...] [...] Its face was shorter than that of Palaeopropithecus, with its eyes directed further forward. [...] The neurocranium (braincase) was small and elevated relative to the face, unlike Palaeopropithecus. Postorbital constriction (narrowing of the skull behind the eye sockets) is pronounced. [...] The skull also bore a low, broad sagittal crest (a ridge of bone {{on the top of}} the skull to which jaw muscles attach) and robust but smaller nuchal crests (ridges of bone on the back of the skull to which neck muscles attach). [...] Unlike Palaeopropithecus the rims of the orbits (eye sockets) were not as thick. [...] The area of the orbit was , comparable to that of gorillas. [...] Based on the ratio of its orbit area to the size of its optic canal, Archaeoindris had low retinal summation, meaning its eyes were less sensitive to light (like living diurnal lemurs). [...] Yet the ratio was not as low as in comparably sized apes, suggesting Archaeoindris had low visual acuity and lacked <b>trichromatic</b> color vision.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>trichromatic</b> color vision in primates occurred as {{the ancestors of}} modern monkeys, apes, and humans switched to diurnal (daytime) activity and began consuming fruits and leaves from flowering plants.

2500|$|Two {{complementary}} {{theories of}} color vision are the <b>trichromatic</b> {{theory and the}} opponent process theory. The <b>trichromatic</b> theory, or Young–Helmholtz theory, proposed in the 19th century by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz, as mentioned above, states that the retina's three types of cones are preferentially sensitive to blue, green, and red. Ewald Hering proposed the opponent process theory in 1872. It states that the visual system interprets color in an antagonistic way: red vs. green, blue vs. yellow, black vs. white. [...] Both theories are now accepted as valid, describing different stages in visual physiology, visualized in the diagram on the right. Green←→Magenta and Blue←→Yellow are scales with mutually exclusive boundaries. In {{the same way that}} there cannot exist a [...] "slightly negative" [...] positive number, a single eye cannot perceive a bluish-yellow or a reddish-green. (But such impossible colors can be perceived due to binocular rivalry.) ...|$|E
2500|$|With indexed color images, {{the palette}} always stores <b>trichromatic</b> colors {{at a depth}} of 8 bits per channel (24 bits per palette entry). Additionally, an {{optional}} list of 8-bit alpha values for the palette entries may be included; if not included, or if shorter than the palette, the remaining palette entries are assumed to be opaque. The palette must not have more entries than the image bit depth allows for, but it may have fewer (for example, if an image with 8-bit pixels only uses 90 colors then it does not need palette entries for all 256 colors). [...] The palette must contain entries for all the pixel values present in the image.|$|E
2500|$|Color {{processing}} {{begins at}} a very early level in the visual system (even within the retina) through initial color opponent mechanisms. Both Helmholtz's <b>trichromatic</b> theory, and Hering's opponent process theory are therefore correct, but trichromacy arises {{at the level of the}} receptors, and opponent processes arise at the level of retinal ganglion cells and beyond. [...] In Hering's theory opponent mechanisms refer to the opposing color effect of red–green, blue–yellow, and light–dark. However, in the visual system, it is the activity of the different receptor types that are opposed. Some midget retinal ganglion cells oppose L and M cone activity, which corresponds loosely to red–green opponency, but actually runs along an axis from blue-green to magenta. Small bistratified retinal ganglion cells oppose input from the S cones to input from the L and M cones. This is often thought to correspond to blue–yellow opponency, but actually runs along a color axis from yellow-green to violet.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{wavelengths}} stimulate two or {{all three}} kinds of cone cell because the spectral sensitivity curves of the three kinds overlap. Certain tristimulus values are thus physically impossible, for example LMS tristimulus values that are non-zero for the M component and zero for both the L and S components. Furthermore, LMS tristimulus values for pure spectral colors would, in any normal <b>trichromatic</b> additive color space, e. g. the RGB color spaces, imply negative values {{for at least one}} of the three primaries because the chromaticity would be outside the color triangle defined by the primary colors. To avoid these negative RGB values, and to have one component that describes the perceived brightness, [...] "imaginary" [...] primary colors and corresponding color-matching functions were formulated. The CIE 1931 color space defines the resulting tristimulus values, in which they are denoted by [...] "X", [...] "Y", and [...] "Z". In XYZ space, all combinations of non-negative coordinates are meaningful, but many, such as the primary locations , , and , correspond to imaginary colors outside the space of possible LMS coordinates; imaginary colors do not correspond to any spectral distribution of wavelengths and therefore have no physical reality.|$|E
