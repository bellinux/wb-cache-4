5|$|Many lakes {{had several}} land owners, however, and {{following}} disagreements over Fresh Pond, the lawyer Simon Greenleaf was charged to adjudicate a solution in 1841. Greenleaf {{decided that the}} right <b>to</b> <b>harvest</b> ice would be divided up in proportion {{with the amount of}} the shore line owned by the different claimants; from then onwards, the rights <b>to</b> <b>harvest</b> ice could be bought and sold and the value of land adjacent to sites such as Fresh Pond increased rapidly, with one owner who purchased land at $130 ($2,500 in 2010 terms) an acre (0.4 hectares) in the 1820s refusing an offer of $2,000 ($44,000) an acre by the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|Warfare was not {{uncommon}} in the Yavapai world, and they made changing alliances for security. Wi:pukba (Wipukepa) and Guwevkabaya (Kwevkepaya) bands formed alliances with Western Apache bands, to attack and defend against raids by the Pima and Maricopa bands from the south. Because of the greater strength of the Pima/Maricopa, Yavapai/Apache raids generally conducted small-scale quick raids, followed by a retreat to avoid counter-attack. The Yavapai defended their lands against Pima incursions, when the Pima would invade <b>to</b> <b>harvest</b> saguaro fruits.|$|E
5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs <b>to</b> <b>harvest</b> their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their natural enemies.|$|E
5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} <b>to</b> <b>harvest</b> them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team <b>to</b> <b>harvest</b> fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Production {{and growth}} of plants {{in many parts of}} the world due to {{degradation}} and water scarcity have been limited and particularly, in recent decades, agriculture is faced with stress. In the most parts of Iran, especially in the Khorasan Razavi province, drought is a fact and water is very important. Due to melon cultivation in this province, and the conditions of quality and quantity of water resources and water used to produce the melon product in this province, any research done on the use of saline and brackish waters is statistically significant. Materials and Methods: To study the effects of different water salinity and water management on some of the agronomic traits of late summer melon with drip irrigation, an experiment with 7 treatments and 3 repetitions was conducted in a randomized complete block design, in Torogh station, Mashhad. The irrigation treatments were: 1 - fresh water from planting <b>to</b> <b>harvesting,</b> 2 - water (3 dS/m) from planting <b>to</b> <b>harvesting,</b> 3 - water (6 dS/m) from planting <b>to</b> <b>harvesting,</b> 4 - water (6 dS/m) from 20 days after plantation <b>to</b> <b>harvesting,</b> 5 -water (6 dS/m) from 40 days after plantation <b>to</b> <b>harvesting,</b> 6 -water (3 dS/m) from 20 days after plantation <b>to</b> <b>harvesting,</b> 7 -water (6 dS/m) from 40 days after plantation <b>to</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Row spacing and plant spacing were 3 m and 60 cm, respectively and the pipe type had 6 liters per hour per unit of meters in the drip irrigation system. Finally, the amount of salinity water, number of male and female flowers, number of seed germination, dry leaves' weight, leaf area, chlorophyll (with SPAD) etc. were measured and all data were analyzed by using MSTAT-C software and all averages of data, were compared by using the Duncan test. Results and Discussion The results of analysis of data showed the following: Number of seeds germination: Salinity in water irrigation had no significant effects on the number of seed germination. However, there was the most number of seed germinations in the fresh water treatments. However, with increased water salinity, the time of seed germination reduced. The maximum delay in germination of seeds was in the treatment that was irrigated with fresh water from the beginning of cultivation. Number of flowers: First, the male flowers appeared and after 5 to 7 days, the appearance of female flowers began. The effect of irrigation treatments on female flower appearance was significant. With increased water salinity, the number of male flowers decreased. There was the lowest male flower in the treatment that was irrigated with saline water from the beginning, but there was no significant difference among the other treatments. Root, steam and leaves: The effect of saline irrigation water on dried leaves’ weight and dry root weight was significant at 1...|$|R

5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close <b>to</b> <b>harvest</b> was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation exacerbated the issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E
