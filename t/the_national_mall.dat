5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, L'Enfant's {{vision of a}} grand {{national}} capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings, including a railroad station on <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Mall.</b> Congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying Washington's ceremonial core. What {{became known as the}} McMillan Plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the Capitol grounds and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Mall,</b> clearing slums, and establishing a new citywide park system. The plan is thought to have largely preserved L'Enfant's intended design.|$|E
