5|$|As {{physical}} {{on the ice}} as Bouchard was, he {{was also}} regarded as a clean player and only rarely participated in hockey fights. Immensely strong, most players avoided engaging him in fights and Bouchard more often would be the person to break up combatants. However, it was a fight involving Bouchard {{which led to a}} significant change in the role of referees. During the 1946–47 season, Bouchard became involved in a prolonged and one-sided fight with Boston's Terry Reardon. Due to the fight, Clarence Campbell, president of the NHL, added to the duties of referees; for the first time they had the responsibility of breaking up fights. Then <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in March 1947, in a game in Boston, as the Canadiens were coming back onto the ice for the beginning of the third period, a female fan attacked Bouchard spearing him with a hat pin. Bouchard responded by pushing the woman away forcefully. A few moments later, Boston police were leading Bouchard out to a police car. According to Bouchard, Pat Egan of the Boston Bruins, interceded and talked the police out of the arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{publication}} of Home of the Gentry, Goncharov took {{an opportunity to get}} acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from The Precipice, the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: [...] "Remember, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied." [...] In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in The Precipice), which, being [...] "a weak one", had been [...] "magnanimously sacrificed" [...] by Turgenev. The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of Home of the Gentry, but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this [...] corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, [...] "it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this." ...|$|E

And I continued to show what was in me. There were the times I brought the Razzle Dazzle in with a bigger load of oysters than any other two-man craft; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> when we raided far down in Lower Bay, and mine was the only craft back at daylight to the anchorage off Asparagus Island; there was the Thursday night we raced for market and I brought the Razzle Dazzle in without a rudder, first of the fleet, and skimmed the cream of the Friday morning trade; and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> I brought her in from Upper Bay under a jib, when Scotty burned my mainsail.
