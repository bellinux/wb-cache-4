40|$|Thesis (DTech. {{degree in}} Mathematics and Statistics) Tshwane University of TechnologyFor decades, the {{development}} of rhythmic corrugations on untarred roads has fascinated road engineers and technicians and even travellers. Numerous researchers have proposed theories about the formation and movement of these corrugations. Automobile tyres are essentially designed for use on tarred or concrete road surfaces. However, these tyres are also used on dirt roads, which often develop corrugations {{as a result of}} the interaction between the vehicle and dry road surfaces. Designing a tyre suited to corrugated dirt road conditions would be advantageous for rural inhabitants as well as the economy of a country. The aim of this research is to investigate the tangential oscillation of the vehicle <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface when the tyre strikes an obstacle in the road and the effect of this tangential oscillation on the formation of corrugations. A theoretical analysis of the nature and frequency of the tangential oscillation of the tread surface of the rubber tyre was done. A mathematical model (torsional oscillator model) of the tangential oscillations of the rubber <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface was proposed, in the form of an ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. To verify this model, static experiments were performed on a wheel with a rigid, stationary axle. Dynamic experiments were then carried out on the tyre of a vehicle. It was found that, when a vehicle is travelling a corrugated dirt road and an obstacle (such as a corrugation) is struck in the road, the tread surface of the rubber tyre will oscillate tangentially. A second theoretical model, the forced telegraph equation model, in the form of a partial differential equation, was also proposed. Correlation between the graphs of the two models was evident. The experiments and observations in this research are consistent with the hypothesis that corrugations are formed, at least partially by the tangential oscillation of the vehicle <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface. It is suggested that, to minimize the formation of dirt road corrugations, the design of tyres must take into account the tangential oscillation of the rubber <b>tyre’s</b> <b>tread</b> surface. If the tangential oscillation of the tyres’ tread surface can be effectively damped, their tendency to generate corrugations might be reduced...|$|R

40|$|Blending of {{recycled}} scrap rubber such as reclaimed rubber with virgin rubber has {{increased over the}} last few years, especially in the manufacture of tyre components. The reason for this is the growing concern about the effect of rubber product waste on the environment and the rise in the costs of virgin rubbers. In this study, physicomechanical properties such as tensile properties, tear strength, hardness, resilience, abrasion resistance, ageing performance, and swelling behaviour as well as carbon black dispersion rating of 85 / 15 virgin NRinovel reclaimed ground rubber tyre (GRT) revulcanisates were evaluated and compared with those of control vulcanisates. Results revealed that the abrasion volume loss of blends of virgin NR and novel reclaimed rubber revulcanisates is lower than that of revulcanisate prepared with a blend of 85 / 15 virgin NRI reclaimed rubber (Control (Rec)), produced locally, and comparable with that of 100 % NR vulcanisate (Control (NR)). Although the tensile strength and elongation at break of the virgin NRinovel reclaimed rubber revulcanisates are lower than those of the Control (NR) vulcanisate, these values are at a level acceptable for <b>tyre</b> <b>treads.</b> Hence, the 85 / 15 virgin NRinovel reclaimed rubber revulcanisates prepared with the readily available, low-cost, environmentally friendly amino compound can be used {{as an alternative to the}} Control (NR) and Control (Rec) vulcanisates in <b>tyre</b> <b>treads...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due {{to higher}} demand of {{petroleum}} and petroleum based synthetic rubbers, {{the price of}} Ribbed Smoked Sheets (RSS) has been gone up.

The first step of the study reveals that the blend having RSS and scrap rubber in the ratio 80 : 20 is the most suitable economical blend to obtain a balance of technical properties.

40|$|Ground {{rubber tyre}} (GRT) {{produced}} by recycling of tyre waste or rejects {{is used as}} a filler in the manufacture of tyre components, mainly to reduce the cost. Rubber matrix-GRT compositions generally exhibit poor mechanical properties due to poor matrix-filler adhesion and lack of reactive sites on GRT particle surfaces. Therefore, GRT is modified by employing various types of reclamation processes to enhance mechanical properties. The modified GRT known as reclaimed rubber is widely used as a component in rubber blends in many applications, especially in tyre manufacturing. This study is focused on developing a cost effective, environmental friendly mechano-chemical reclamation process for GRT to produce reclaim rubber using a readily available amino compound. Initially, influence of the amino compound on rubber compound properties was evaluated and results indicate that it acts as an activator for sulphur vulcanization. Properties of GRT modified with the amino compound indicate that the amino compound acts as a reclaiming agent as well. Comparison of properties of natural rubber (NR) / novel reclaimed rubber blend compounds and revulcanisates with those of the controls reveal that the former can be used as alternatives to the latter in the manufacture of <b>tyre</b> <b>treads.</b> Replacement of 30 % of virgin NR in the vulcanisates with the novel reclaimed rubber retains about 65 - 85 % of strength properties, elongation at break and resilience. Abrasion volume loss is at an acceptable level and ageing properties are comparable to those of the 100 % virgin NR vulcanisate. Further, most of the properties of the virgin NR / novel reclaimed rubber composites are comparable to those of the corresponding composites prepared by blending NR with commercially available reclaimed rubbers. Accordingly, the novel reclaimed rubber could be a suitable component to blend with virgin NR in the manufacture of <b>tyre</b> <b>treads</b> with required properties.

50|$|Deliberate {{shaping of}} moulded <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> design, {{rather than merely}} concentrating on a rubber surface that didn't fail rapidly, began {{at the start of}} the 1920s. There was little {{theoretical}} background to this though until the mid-1920s. The 1922 London Motor Show displayed a range of tread patterns that were reported on by The Autocar. Some of these, from Miller and the French firm of , display what would now be recognised as the classic bar grip pattern of sharp-edged transverse bars with a wide central rib. However these were supplied for narrow high-pressure tyres, for use on roads and at relatively high speeds. Their design was based on simple notions of transverse bars giving fore-and-aft traction, without any developed theory of tread design or experimental measurements of their performance. In practice, such square-edged tread blocks wore badly and unevenly, the initially flat blocks tending to wear with a sloping top surface. This wear pattern was one reason for the practicing of rotating tyres between wheels, so that they spent equal periods wearing in each direction.|$|E
40|$|The regular <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> {{pattern design}} process is often based upon {{experience}} and experimental evaluations and may take about 2 years. The use of engineering tooling could improve and speed up this process. The research objective is therefore to develop experimental and simulation tooling by which interior <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise can be predicted, analysed and optimized. The physics of tyre-road noise is {{explained in a}} comprehensive manner as {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics is needed to evaluate, measure, analyse or optimize tyres with respect to noise. The first engineering tool developed is an instrumented vehicle with dedicated measurement and processing technologies, enabling quantification of the terminology used in subjective evaluations of tyre-road noise. The three most important <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics are: level, tonalness and modulation/drumming. They can be quantified, respectively, by the Sound Pressure Level, the so-called order spectrum and the (bandpass filtered) sound pressure variation during one tyre revolution. While rolling on smooth roads, the <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern geometry in the tyre-road contact is considered to be the main origin of contact pressure variations, resulting in vibrations and noise. The second engineering tool is a simulation procedure of this source. In the new source modelling approach, the averaged tread pattern height in contact is calculated. The model predicts (R 2 = 0. 76) the correct trends of the three <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics, by using the trend of their geometrical cause. The model can be used to reduce exterior as well as interior <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise. From these <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise characteristics dedicated Sound Quality Metrics are defined: for level the Standard Deviation (STD), for tonalness the Order Prominence (OP) and for modulation the Multi-Order Modulation (MOM). They correspond very well (respectively R 2 = 0. 96, 0. 60 and 0. 80) with the human perception of the noise characteristics. An increase in each of the metrics results in a worse subjective perception of the <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern noise. The metrics are applicable for measured and simulated sounds. In the third engineering tool the three metrics are combined to model the human percpetion of <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> patternn noise. The human perception model is obtained through a linear regression of these tyre related Sound Quality Metrics on the subjective rating of simulated sounds. The output of the model is called the Sound Quality Preference Index (SQPI) predicting the human perception of <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> pattern sounds correctly (R 2 = 0. 94). The coupled source - human perception model can be used to speed up and improve the current <b>tyre</b> <b>tread</b> patter design process...|$|E
