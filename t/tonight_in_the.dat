25|$|Griffin {{scored a}} coup when Tonight Show host Jack Paar accidentally emerged onto {{the set of}} Play Your Hunch during a live broadcast, and Griffin got him {{to stay for a}} {{spontaneous}} interview. After Paar left The Tonight Show, but before Johnny Carson took over (Carson was still hosting Who Do You Trust? for ABC), Griffin was one of the many guest hosts who presided over <b>Tonight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interim. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts, and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful however, and was cancelled in 1963.|$|E
25|$|While Rather had {{inherited}} Cronkite's ratings lead, {{the success of}} the Evening News with Rather at the helm fluctuated wildly. After a dip to second place, Rather regained the top spot in 1985 until 1989 when he ceded the ratings peak to rival Peter Jennings at ABC's World News Tonight. By 1992, however, the Evening News had fallen to third place where it remained until Bob Schieffer who acted as the interim anchor between Rather and Katie Couric saw the Evening News rise to #2 ahead of ABC World News <b>Tonight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wake of the death of Peter Jennings but remaining behind NBC Nightly News. Rather has been a frequent collaborator with CBS News producer Susan Zirinsky, who was producer of the news while he was a reporter and anchor.|$|E
