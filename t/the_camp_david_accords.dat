25|$|Pope Shenouda III had {{arguments}} with then President Anwar Sadat over both <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords</b> {{and what he}} said was the president's deficient response to growing Islamism. After a series of protests that led president Sadat to depose Pope Shenouda III, he was exiled by Sadat and sent to the Nitrian Desert, to return three years after Sadat's assassination following an amnesty by Sadat's successor Hosni Mubarak.|$|E
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords</b> of {{the late}} 1970s, Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in March 1979. Under its terms, the Sinai Peninsula {{returned}} to Egyptian hands, and the Gaza Strip remained under Israeli control, {{to be included in}} a future Palestinian state. The agreement also provided for the free passage of Israeli ships through the Suez Canal and recognition of the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba as international waterways.|$|E
25|$|In 1973 The Syrian and Egyptian armies {{launched}} the Yom Kippur War, a well-planned surprise attack against Israel. The Egyptians and Syrians advanced {{during the first}} 24–48 hours, after which momentum began to swing in Israel's favor. Eventually a Disengagement of Forces agreement was signed between the parties and a ceasefire took effect that ended the war.

50|$|After {{the war of}} 1967 Port Fouad was {{the only}} piece of Sinai held by the Egyptians. The Israeli army tried to capture Port Fouad during the War of Attrition, but failed. After the October War, <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accord</b> in 1978 Israel agreed to return Sinai to Egypt peacefully, and later the two {{countries}} signed a peace treaty. Today Port Fouad is a major Air Defence Position for Egypt. Despite its important location, as of 2006, Port Fouad was still considered a residential zone, with very few facilities and no major downtown or city center.|$|R
25|$|In 1981, the Knesset {{enacted the}} Golan Heights Law, ostensibly as a {{reaction}} to Syrian provocations. This extended the Israeli rule of law to the Golan Heights. (It was also thought to have been motivated by the recent US AWACS sale to Saudi Arabia.) This act was widely considered an informal annexation. It was criticized by the United States as a violation of <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords</b> and condemned by the UN Security Council in Resolution 497.|$|E
25|$|After the {{oil crisis}} of 1973, France had {{changed to a}} more pro-Arab policy and was {{accordingly}} rewarded by Saddam with closer ties. He made a state visit to France in 1975, cementing close ties with some French business and ruling political circles. In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq. Saddam led Arab opposition to <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords</b> between Egypt and Israel (1979).|$|E
25|$|Since about 1970, the United States {{has become}} the {{principal}} ally of Israel. In 1979 an uneasy Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty was signed, based on <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords.</b> In 1993, Israel signed Oslo I Accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization, followed by establishment of the Palestinian National Authority and in 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty was signed. Despite efforts to finalize the peace agreement, the conflict continues {{to play a major}} role in Israeli and international political, social and economic life.|$|E
50|$|Nepal is {{the first}} and until {{recently}} only country in South Asia to recognize the existence of Israel. Nepal has maintained diplomatic relations and continues to support the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. Nepal voted in favour of Security Council Resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which upheld the right of all {{the states in the}} region to live in peace. Nepal has also welcomed every initiative from whatever quarter that seeks to resolve the Middle East problems like <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accord</b> signed between Egypt and Israel in 1978 and the renewed peace process sponsored time to time by countries like the USA.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} agreement, the U.S. began {{economic}} and military aid to Egypt, and political backing for its subsequent governments. From <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> peace <b>accords</b> in 1978 until 2000, the United States has subsidized Egypt's armed forces with over $38 billion worth of aid. Egypt receives about $1.3 billion annually.|$|R

25|$|Jimmy Carter, {{running as}} someone {{who was not a}} part of the Washington {{political}} establishment, was elected president in 1976. On the world stage, Carter brokered <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords</b> between Israel and Egypt. In 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 66 Americans hostage, resulting in the Iran hostage crisis. With the hostage crisis and continuing stagflation, Carter lost the 1980 election to the Republican Ronald Reagan. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the remaining U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day hostage crisis.|$|E
25|$|Egypt was {{involved}} in several wars against Israel and was allied with other Arab countries. The first was the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, right after the state of Israel was founded. Egypt went to war again in the Six-Day War of 1967 and lost the Sinai Peninsula to Israel. They went to war yet again in the Yom Kippur War of 1973. In 1979, President of Egypt Anwar Sadat and Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin signed <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords,</b> which gave back the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt {{in exchange for the}} recognition of Israel. The accords are still in effect today. In 1981, Sadat was assassinated by members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad under Khalid Islambouli. The assassins were Islamists who targeted Sadat for his signing of the Accords.|$|E
25|$|In Middle East affairs, Brown {{supported}} President Carter's {{efforts as}} an intermediary in the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations leading to <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords</b> of September 1978 and the signing {{by the two}} nations of a peace treaty in March 1979. Elsewhere, {{the fall of the}} Shah from power in Iran in January 1979 eliminated a major U.S. ally and triggered a chain of events that played havoc with American policy in the region. In November 1979, Iranian revolutionaries occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took more than 50 hostages. Brown participated closely in planning for a rescue operation that ended in failure and the loss of eight U.S. servicemen on 2425 April 1980. Not until the last day of his administration, on 20 January 1981, could President Carter make final arrangements for the release of the hostages.|$|E

25|$|According to an Egyptian Government 2006 poll of 1000 Egyptians (taken at {{the time}} of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict), 92% of Egyptians view Israel as an enemy nation.

25|$|According {{to those}} who knew him, the war deeply {{depressed}} Dayan. He went into political eclipse for a time. In 1977, despite having been re-elected to the Knesset for the Alignment, he accepted the offer to become Foreign Minister in the new Likud government led by Menachem Begin. He was expelled from the Alignment, as a result and sat as an independent MK. As foreign minister in Begin's government, he was instrumental in drawing up <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords,</b> a peace agreement with Egypt. Dayan resigned his post in October 1979, because of a disagreement with Begin over whether the Palestinian territories were an internal Israeli matter (the Camp David treaty included provisions for future negotiations with the Palestinians; Begin, who {{did not like the}} idea, did not put Dayan in charge of the negotiating team). In 1981 he founded a new party, Telem.|$|E
25|$|After {{ascending}} to {{the presidency}} in 1977, Carter named Strauss as U.S. Trade Representative. The position enjoyed cabinet level status, while allowing Strauss to apply his considerable negotiating skills to America's troubled relations with its trading partners. As Trade Representative, Strauss successfully completed the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations, and secured the agreement's ratification by the US Congress in the Trade Act of 1979. Then, Carter asked Strauss to undertake an even more challenging task, as his Personal Representative to the Middle East. Carter's previous efforts had already resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords</b> between Israel and Egypt, and Carter hoped that Strauss {{would be able to}} build on the success. The handshake of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Al Sadat on the White House lawn was a high point of Carter's presidency, but dark clouds were gathering on the horizon.|$|E
25|$|Begin’s most {{significant}} achievement as Prime Minister was {{the signing of}} a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979, for which he and Anwar Sadat shared the Nobel Prize for Peace. In the wake of <b>the</b> <b>Camp</b> <b>David</b> <b>Accords,</b> the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula, which was captured from Egypt in the Six-Day War. Later, Begin’s government promoted the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Begin authorized {{the bombing of the}} Osirak nuclear plant in Iraq and the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to fight PLO strongholds there, igniting the 1982 Lebanon War. As Israeli military involvement in Lebanon deepened, and the Sabra and Shatila massacre, carried out by Christian Phalangist militia allies of the Israelis, shocked world public opinion, Begin grew increasingly isolated. As IDF forces remained mired in Lebanon and the economy suffered from hyperinflation, the public pressure on Begin mounted. Depressed by the death of his wife Aliza in November 1982, he gradually withdrew from public life, until his resignation in October 1983.|$|E
