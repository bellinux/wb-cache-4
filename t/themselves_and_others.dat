5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
5|$|Theatre also greatly {{influenced}} Alejo Carpentier's work. In all his work, Carpentier uses the characters he creates {{to explore the}} notions of subjectivity and identity, analyzing {{the way in which}} individuals see <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> within cultural settings. In order to achieve such an analysis, Carpentier makes use of spectatorship: his characters perceive a spectacle in alterable ways which parallel their alterable ways of experiencing the world. Spectacle situations are also sometimes used by Carpentier as a tool for the characters to reframe and rethink the world, as well as to establish individual and group identity.|$|E

He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was at the very heart of Butlin's and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. That night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require an army of people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was formed.|$|E
5|$|A {{radiation}} accident occurred in Samut Prakan Province, Thailand in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed cobalt-60 radiation source was recovered by scrap metal collectors who, {{together with a}} scrapyard worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> nearby to ionizing radiation. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of radiation sickness and eventually sought medical attention. The Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of , and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be {{the root cause of}} the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to <b>themselves,</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E

25|$|Ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} {{subjective}} experience, {{and the meaning}} created from it, is not an individual event. Phenomenologists such as Gadamer, Mikahil Bakhtin, John Macmurray, and Taylor have articulated this by addressing the concept known as dialogism, or in other words, the process of engaging in dialogue, or conversation, with others in an ongoing effort for humans to co-create meaning for <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> in the world. Additionally, creating subjective truth and meaning, along with engaging in dialogue, requires two mental faculties: memory and imagination.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Sikhs and the Mughals further deteriorated following {{the execution of the}} ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur by Aurengzeb, who was highly intolerant of Sikhs, partially driven by his desire to impose Islamic law. Following the executions of their leaders and facing increasing persecution, the Sikhs officially adopted militarization for self-protection by creating the Khalsa; the executions also prompted formalization of various aspects of the Sikh faith. The tenth and final guru, Guru Gobind Singh formally included the kirpan as a mandatory article of faith for all baptised Sikhs, making it a duty for Sikhs to be able to defend <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> from oppression.|$|E
25|$|The Justification Hypothesis (JH) {{is a novel}} {{proposal}} that allows for both {{the understanding of the}} evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b>|$|E

25|$|Social views also better {{explain the}} {{ambiguity}} of racial definitions. An individual may self-identify as one race based on one set of determinants (for example, phenotype, culture, ancestry) while society may ascribe the person otherwise based on external forces and discrete racial standards. Dominant racial conceptions influence how individuals label both <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> within society. Modern human populations are becoming more difficult to define within traditional racial boundaries due to racial admixture. Most scientific studies, applications, and government documents ask individuals to self-identify race from a limited assortment of common racial categories. The conflict between self-identification and societal ascription further complicates biomedical research and public health policies. However complex its sociological roots, race has real biological ramifications; the intersection of race, science, and society permeates everyday life and influences human health via genetics, access to medical care, diagnosis, and treatment.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but also what people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E
25|$|Activity is {{preferable}} to inactivity because it facilitates well-being on multiple levels. Because of improved general health and prosperity in the older population, remaining active is more feasible now than when this theory was first proposed by Havighurst nearly six decades ago. The activity theory is applicable for a stable, post-industrial society, which offers its older members many opportunities for meaningful participation.Weakness: Some aging persons cannot maintain a middle-aged lifestyle, due to functional limitations, lack of income, or lack {{of a desire to}} do so. Many older adults lack the resources to maintain active roles in society. On the flip side, some elders may insist on continuing activities in late life that pose a danger to <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>others,</b> such as driving at night with low visual acuity or doing maintenance work to the house while climbing with severely arthritic knees. In doing so, they are denying their limitations and engaging in unsafe behaviors.|$|E
