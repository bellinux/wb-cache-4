5|$|As {{the city}} grew, several {{prominent}} buildings were {{constructed in the}} late 19th century, including the Grand Lodge of Canada in 1855, West Flamboro Methodist Church in 1879 (later purchased by Dufferin Masonic Lodge in 1893), a public library in 1890, and the Right House department store in 1893. The first commercial telephone service in Canada, the first <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> in the British Empire, and the second <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> in all of North America were each established in the city between 1877–78. The city had several interurban electric street railways and two inclines, all powered by the Cataract Power Co.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, Tesla {{moved to}} Budapest, Hungary, {{to work under}} Tivadar Puskás at a {{telegraph}} company, the Budapest <b>Telephone</b> <b>Exchange.</b> Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so {{he worked as a}} draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest <b>Telephone</b> <b>Exchange</b> became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.|$|E

In 1932, the first automatic <b>telephone</b> <b>exchanges</b> in Iceland were opened, and in 1986, all telephones in the country were connected to automatic <b>telephone</b> <b>exchanges.</b> The laying of fibreoptic cable around the country began in 1985. The first digital <b>telephone</b> <b>exchanges</b> were opened in 1984, and this technology extended to all <b>telephone</b> <b>exchanges</b> 11 years later.|$|R

5|$|A {{district}} {{post office}} {{was established in}} 1871 at the railway siding's station house. By 1908 the post office was run from the chapel house in {{the main part of}} the town, and a shop ran from the same building. This building was used for around 70 years as a store, <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange,</b> mail exchange and petrol station. The post office closed in 1977 and has not reopened.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{post office}} in Meander by 1888, {{probably}} started the previous year. Prior to this there was an unofficial post office, a mail depot run by locals. The post office continued in a separate building until then postmaster, Harold Taylor, retired in 1977. After this post function was a service provided by the local store. There was a manual <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> in the post office building. This was replaced with an automatic exchange in June 1975.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its disbandment, {{the rebels}} in Bjelovar {{had used the}} {{telegraph}} station and <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> in the town to issue false orders to parts of the 104th Infantry Regiment directing them to withdraw from their positions. The rebels also contacted the Germans by telephone and sent representatives to meet the Germans at the Drava bridgeheads, to advise them that the roads had been cleared of obstacles, and the rebels invited them to enter Bjelovar. Rebels and deserters began to converge on Bjelovar, bringing with them many Serb officers and soldiers who soon filled the town's jails.|$|E

5|$|Sallal {{ordered that}} the {{military}} academy in San'a go on full alert— opening all armories and issuing weapons to all junior officers and troops. On the evening of September 25, Sallal gathered known leaders of the Yemeni nationalist movement and other officers who had sympathized or participated in the military protests of 1955. Each officer and cell would be given orders and would commence {{as soon as the}} shelling of al-Badr's palace began. Key areas that would be secured included Al-Bashaer palace (al-Badr's palace), Al-Wusul palace (Reception area for dignitaries), the radio station, the <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange,</b> Qasr al-Silaah (The Main Armory), and the central security headquarters (Intelligence and Internal Security).|$|E
5|$|The {{rebels in}} Bjelovar used the {{telegraph}} station and <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> {{in the town}} to issue false orders to parts of the 104th Infantry Regiment directing them to withdraw from their positions. The rebels also contacted the Germans by telephone and sent representatives to meet the Germans at the Drava bridgeheads, to advise them that the roads had been cleared of obstacles, and Makanec invited them to enter Bjelovar. Nedeljković's threats to bomb the town did not materialise, and rebels and deserters began to converge on Bjelovar, bringing with them many Serb officers and soldiers who soon filled the town's jails.|$|E
5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held Palo Alto, California IP-telephony network switch {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful.|$|E

5|$|Wormshill {{retained}} its own <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> until the 1990s, {{when it became}} part of the Maidstone exchange. A red telephone box remains in the village after residents insisted that it not be replaced with a modern design however the telephony was disconnected (and the box sealed) in November 2009 as a result of lack of use. An informal village noticeboard {{is on the side of}} an old flint and wood barn that was part of the former Home Farm. The post box and telephone box are at the same location. The telephone box is a listed building.|$|E
5|$|Because of William's {{impending}} {{retirement and}} the consequent fall in the family's income, Ferrier's hopes of attending a music college could not be realised. In August 1926 she left school to start work as a trainee at the GPO <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> in Blackburn. She continued her piano studies under Frances Walker, and in November 1928 was the regional winner in a national contest for young pianists, organised by the Daily Express. Although unsuccessful in the London finals which followed, Ferrier won a Cramer upright piano as a prize. On 10 March 1929 she made a well-received appearance as an accompanist in a concert at Blackburn's King George's Hall. After further piano competition successes she was invited to perform a short radio recital at the Manchester studios of the BBC, and on 3 July 1930 made her first broadcast, playing works by Brahms and Percy Grainger. Around this time she completed her training and she became a fully fledged telephonist.|$|E
5|$|Madras {{was linked}} {{to the rest of the}} world through {{telegraphs}} in 1853 and a civilian telegraph service was introduced on 1 February 1855. Soon afterwards, telegraph lines linked Madras and Ootacamund with other cities in India. A Telegraph department was set up in 1854, with a Deputy Superintendent stationed in Madras city. The Colombo-Talaimannar telegraph line established in 1858, was extended to Madras in 1882, thereby connecting the city with Ceylon. Telephones were introduced in the presidency in 1881 and on 19 November 1881, the first <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> with 17 connections was established at Errabalu Street in Madras. A wireless telgraphy service was established between Madras and Port Blair in 1920 and in 1936, the Indo-Burma radio telephone service was established between Madras and Rangoon.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle at}} the palace {{continued}} until guards surrendered to the revolutionaries the following morning. The radio station was first to fall, secured after a loyalist officer was killed and resistance collapsed. The armory was perhaps the easiest target, as a written order from Sallal was sufficient to open the storage facility, beat the royalists, and secure rifles, artillery and ammunition for the revolutionaries. The <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange</b> likewise fell without any resistance. At the Al-Wusul Palace, revolutionary units remained secure {{under the guise of}} granting and protecting diplomats and dignitaries staying there to greet the new Imam of Yemen. By late morning on September 26, all areas of San'a were secure and the radio broadcast that Muhammad al-Badr had been overthrown by the new revolutionary government in power. Revolutionary cells in the cities of Taiz, Al-Hujja and the port city of Hodeida then began securing arsenals, airports and port facilities.|$|E
5|$|At 01:15 the Handley-Page bomber piloted by the Australian Ross Smith {{took off}} {{carrying}} 16, 112-lb bombs to bomb Afulah railway junction and smash the central <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange.</b> At 05:20 Bristol Fighters flying over Afulah saw labourers working {{to repair the}} railway station, while at Bir el Hanuta, an Ottoman infantry battalion was seen moving southward to reinforce the front line. Flying west of the railway line, initial movements northward near Bir Ghaneim, already indicated {{the beginnings of a}} retreat. At 06:00 a bombing raid by D.H.9s attacked Afulah again. Later two Bristol Fighters reported 5,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, guns and 600 transport, retiring in disorder near Et Tire. On this massed Ottoman force, 20 small bombs were dropped and over 2,000 machine gun bullets were fired. At 10:00 the Nablus area appeared quiet, while shortly afterwards Jenin was bombed. At 11:30 the pilot reported having seen the leading cavalry division of Desert Mounted Corps, approaching Liktera on the Plain of Sharon. On the cavalry’s right rear at Kakon, Ottoman units were reported alarmed and beginning to move, while further south at Kalunsawe the roads were full of retreating army units.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the advance units of the Leningrad Front arrived at Tallinn early on 22 September, German troops had {{practically}} abandoned {{the city and the}} streets were empty. The last German unit to leave Tallinn that morning was the 531st Navy Artillery Battalion. Before embarkation, all stationary artillery and armaments, special equipment, guns that could not be evacuated, ammunition, the <b>telephone</b> <b>exchange,</b> the radio broadcast house, locomotives and railroad cars, and the railway were destroyed. The Tallinn power plant was fired upon from the sea and the Old City Harbour was destroyed. The retreating German units had no combat contact with the Red Army in Tallinn. The Government of Estonia had failed to concentrate the Estonian soldiers retreating from the Narva and Emajõgi fronts, as the units were scattered and mixed with the German detachments withdrawing towards Latvia. Therefore, the government lacked significant military forces to repulse the Soviet forces concentrated around Tallinn. The units securing the national capital and the government were led by Rear Admiral Johan Pitka. Troops of the Leningrad Front seized Tallinn on 22 September. Jüri Uluots, acting President of Estonia, evacuated to Sweden. In the following days, several pro-independence Estonian battle groups attacked the Soviet troops in Harju and Lääne counties without success.|$|E
