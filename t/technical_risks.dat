5|$|The DDL project's {{problems}} harmed the Australian shipbuilding industry. The {{cancellation of}} both the DDLs and another project to develop an Australian fast combat support ship design led to a perception that <b>technical</b> <b>risks</b> needed to be minimised when selecting new warships, and it was preferable to rely on proven foreign designs. Australian industry was also left with a bad impression as companies {{involved in the project}} had devoted considerable resources to preparing tenders for the DDL.|$|E
25|$|The Development Concept Paper {{examined}} performance, schedule, cost estimates, and <b>technical</b> <b>risks</b> {{to provide}} a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program. But in practice, what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military. It aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military. Rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{timetable}} set by the RCAF, Avro decided that Arrow program would adopt the Cook-Craigie plan. Normally a small number of prototypes of an aircraft were hand built and flown to find problems, and when solutions were found these changes would be worked into the design and then the production line would be set up. In a Cook-Craigie system, the production line was set up first and a small number of aircraft were built as production models. Any changes would be incorporated into the jigs while testing continued, with full production starting when the test program was complete. As Jim Floyd noted at the time, this was a risky approach, however: [...] "...it was decided to take the <b>technical</b> <b>risks</b> involved to save time on the programme... I will not pretend that this philosophy of production type build from the outset did not cause us a lot of problems in Engineering. However, it did achieve its objective." ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis examines the problems affecting the {{quantitative assessment of}} <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> in Department of Defense major weapon systems acquisition. A decision Theory approach is used. Commercial techniques and current DoD methods of <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> assessment are investigated. TASCFORM TM technology values are used in a linear regression model to characterize the growth of technology over time. The model residuals provide a probability distribution for estimating the likelihood of achieving a specified level of technical performance. The benefit of a utility function describing <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> perceptions is considered. The Expanded Pearson-Tukey method of describing risk is also investigated. Continued research into technology valuation techniques is recommended. A test case application of the Expanded Pearson-Tukey method is also recommended, to determine its ability to provide reliable and timely quantitative <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> information.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. This research examines how <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> management has evolved throughout the Department of the Navy (DoN) {{and to what}} extent acquisition programs have implemented best practice methods and techniques. A sample of DoN program managers, risk managers, and other acquisition professionals was surveyed to determine attitudes on <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> management and what fundamental methods are being applied. Survey data was also collected to determine what impact Department of Defense (DoD) and DoN <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> guidance has had on the acquisition community and what guidance documents are being used. For cases where best-in-class <b>technical</b> <b>risk</b> management methods and techniques have not been applied, this research offers some potential solutions.
