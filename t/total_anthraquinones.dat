40|$|Vismia guianensis is a {{plant species}} of high {{occurrence}} in the Amazon and northeastern Brazil, {{which has been}} studied lately, because of its antimicrobial and anticancer properties. In order to make an herbal medicine, National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance of Brazil, recommends {{the production of a}} drug and plant extracts analysis report indicating: method, specifications and results obtained. The drug was characterized by particle size, amount of water and the total ash content; and plant extract through its density, pH and dry residue. The quantification of <b>total</b> <b>anthraquinones</b> and method validation was done by UV-VIS spectroscopy. The drug in this study produced a coarse powder whose determination of water is within the acceptable limits and the total ash content was 1. 64 %. The extractive solution showed a low pH, density of 0. 89 mg/mL and 9. 5 % on yields from solids. HPLC found that the EtOAc fraction of the plant extract is consisted of phenolic compounds and anthraquinones. And the method of quantification of <b>total</b> <b>anthraquinones,</b> using emodin as external standard, was validated by UV-VIS spectroscopy at λ 290 nm, determining that in 1 g of extractive solution there are 42. 85 mg of <b>total</b> <b>anthraquinones.</b> The results obtained served as reference for the quality control of drug and plant derivative of this species; and the validation of the quantification method showed a high performance...|$|E
30|$|The {{pharmacological}} assays {{indicated that}} five FS extracts could effectively protect against •OH-induced DNA damage. The correlation analysis {{suggested that the}} average R values of total phenolics, <b>total</b> <b>anthraquinones,</b> aloe-emodin, rhein, and emodin were respectively 0.843, 0.833, 0.753, 0.820, and 0.784, while those of total sugars and total saponins were respectively 0.103 and 0.0068. The mechanistic analysis revealed that five FS extracts could also scavenge •OH, •O 2 –, DPPH• & ABTS•+ radicals, and reduce Cu 2 + to Cu+. MTT assay revealed that the viability of MSCs which were treated with •OH radicals has been effectively protected by EAFS (3 and 30 μg/mL).|$|E
30|$|The <b>total</b> <b>anthraquinones</b> {{content was}} {{determined}} by the colorimetric method (Zhang et al. 2005). In brief, the sample methanol solution (0.4  mL, 4  mg/mL) was separately added into tubes. After the methanol solvent was removed at 70 °C, the sample residue was dissolved with 2  mL distilled water, followed by the addition of 1  mL concentrated hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture was incubated at boiling water for 30  min and shaken continually, then cooled and extracted by diethyl ether (10  mL/time, 3 – 5 times). After the extract was combined and evaporated to dryness, 6  mL NaOH aqueous solution (5 %, w/v) was added and mixed vigorously. After standing at room temperature for 45  min, the reaction mixture was measured using a spectrophotometer (Unico 2100) at 520  nm. The standard curve was prepared using different concentrations of emodin and the results were expressed as emodin in milligrams per gram extract.|$|E

The present work aimed to study exclusively on various seeds of Cassia species for exploration and phytochemical estimation of anthraquinones and for its laxative activity. Three species of Cassia namely C. fistula, C. angustifolia,, C. siamea have been taken for the study in which three varieties of Cassia fistula has been taken viz. C. fistula seed marketed, C. fistula seed collected and C. fistula pod. The process {{was carried out in}} which initially the samples of different varieties were extracted by four methods namely maceration, percolation, decoction and Soxhlation. The crude extract obtained was subjected for qualitative and quantitative estimation of anthraquinones. The content of <b>total</b> <b>anthraquinone</b> glycoside in the crude extract prepared by each extraction method was determined by U. V. spectrophotometry. The extract prepared by maceration method (Cassia siamea) exhibit highest content of anthraquinone glycoside of followed by extract of percolation method, Soxhlation and decoction method.

40|$|Mercury (Hg) causes severe {{nephrotoxicity}} {{in subjects}} with excess exposure. This work attempted to identify whether a natural medicine—rhubarb—has protective effects against mercuric chloride (HgCl 2) -induced acute renal failure (ARF), and which of its components contributed most to the treatment. Total rhubarb extract (TR) were separated to the <b>total</b> <b>anthraquinones</b> (TA), the total tannins (TT) and remaining component extract (RC). Each extract was orally pre-administered to rats for five successive days followed by HgCl 2 injection to induce kidney injury. Subsequently, renal histopathology and biochemical examinations were performed in vitro to evaluate the protective effects. Pharmacological studies showed that TR and TA, but not TT or RC manifested significant protection activity against HgCl 2 -induced ARF. There were also significant declines of serum creatine, urea nitrogen values and increases of total protein albumin levels in TR and TA treated groups compared to HgCl 2 alone (p < 0. 05). At last, the major components in TA extract were further identified as anthraquinones by liquid chromatography coupled mass spectroscopy. This study thus provides observational evidences that rhubarb could ameliorate HgCl 2 -induced ARF and its anthraquinones in particular are the effective components responsible for this activity in rhubarb extract...|$|E
