40|$|Abstract. Hemochromatosis {{is rare in}} {{domestic}} mammals. Five clinical cases and one preclinical case of hemochromatosis were diagnosed in Salers and Salers-cross cattle. Clinical disease developed between 9 and 22 months of age. Animals were healthy until weaning but then lost weight, developed rough hair coats, and lost incisor teeth. In two animals, hemochromatosis was identified by liver biopsy, biochemical evidence of hepatic injury, and/or elevated transferrin saturation values. At necropsy, carcasses were thin, with firm dark brown livers and lymph nodes, soft bones, and brown-colored small bowel. The principal histologic changes were hepatocellular siderosis and periportal, bridging, and perivenular fibrosis. Siderocalcinosis involved collagen, elastin, reticulin, and basement membrane components in liver, lymph nodes, spleen, duodenum, and kidney. Hepatic iron concen-trations in clinically affected cattle were 1, 500 – 10, 500 g/g wet weight (reference range for cattle 300 g/ g). Ultrastructurally, the heaviest intrahepatic deposition was in hepatocytes, which contained large intracytoplas-mic siderosomes. Iron deposition in bone was associated with osteopenia. Genetic analysis indicated a common ancestral bull in the pedigrees of five of six affected cattle; no pedigree was available for the remaining animal. Four dams of five affected animals were phenotypically normal and had histologically normal livers. <b>Test</b> <b>mating</b> of four cows to the ancestral bull resulted in a female calf that developed clinicopathologic and histologic evidence of preclinical hemochromatosis by 40 days of age.

No selection was detected on the locus linked to class I gene. For the locus linked to class II gene, observed heterozygosity was higher than expected {{in the first year}} and lower in the second year, suggesting overdominance and underdominance, respectively.

Study was conducted at the Kutuharju Reindeer Research Station where we had access to a herd of semi-domesticated reindeer. We manipulated OSR on two levels in two enclosures, a female biased treatment (3 ♂: 6 ♀ = OSR 0. 5) and a sex balanced treatment (3 ♂: 3 ♀ = OSR 1). Female reindeer were injected with 1 ml of estrumate prior to a trial to promote early and synchronized oestrous to assure competition among our 1. 5 -year-old males. We predicted that with increasing OSR, male-male aggression would increase and courtship behaviours would decrease, unless males adopted alternative mating tactics. Conversely, female-female aggression was predicted to decrease with increasing OSR. The propensity for males to act agonistically was predicted to increase with increasing OSR. Male-male rate of aggression did not differ between treatments. Female-female rate of aggression was found to decrease significantly with increasing OSR. Propensity to act agonistically was not significantly different between treatments. 1. 5 -year-old males may be too young and inexperienced to behave predictably.

Despite more than 120 years occurrence in Europe and intense research, there are still gaps in knowledge of its life history and ecology. Investigation into O. limosus invasive success requires identifying the mechanisms that enabled them to establish dense and widespread populations from small initial numbers without observable limitation by an introduction bottleneck. In part, O. limosus success may lie in its ability to reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis. Moreover, there are possible other mating scenarios, because of two mating seasons (autumn and spring) in O. limosus. This work investigated the effect of four reproductive scenarios (autumn mating only, spring mating only, autumn and spring mating, and without mating) on the reproductive success of O. limosus. Females successfully reproduced in all <b>tested</b> <b>mating</b> regimes using parthenogenesis as well as log term sperm storage.

Besides revealing a multiple mating strategy and showing that females do not produce enough eggs to fully occupy a male's brood pouch during the extent of a pregnancy, results reveal a complex pattern with different-sized females adopting different investment tactics. In contrast to small, less attractive females, who show a much more constant reproductive effort through the <b>tested</b> <b>mating</b> contexts, large females seem able to monitor the number and quality of available males responding accordingly by 1) laying more eggs {{in the presence of}} several large males or saving efforts for future breeding and 2) laying larger eggs in larger males while depositing smaller ones in lower quality individuals as a consequence of a serial mating process (large males first, small males later).

In this study we <b>test</b> <b>mate</b> preferences of female squirrel treefrogs Hyla squirella and female túngara frogs Physalaemus pustulosus for similar combinations of acoustic and visual components of their multimodal courtship signals. In a two-choice playback experiment with squirrel treefrogs, the visual stimulus of a male model significantly increased the attractivness of a relatively unattractive slow call rate. A previous study demonstrated that faster call rates are more attractive to female squirrel treefrogs, and all else being equal, models of male frogs with large body stripes are more attractive. In a similar experiment with female túngara frogs, the visual stimulus of a robotic frog failed to increase the attractiveness of a relatively unattractive call. Females also showed no preference for the distinct stripe on the robot that males commonly bear on their throat. Thus, features of conspicuous signal components such as body stripes are not universally important and signal function is likely to differ even among species with similar ecologies and communication systems. Finally, we discuss the putative information content of anuran signals and suggest that the categorization of redundant versus multiple messages may not be sufficient as a general explanation {{for the evolution of}} multimodal signaling.

40|$|Both inter- and intrasexual {{selection}} {{have been}} implicated in the origin and maintenance of species-rich taxa with diverse sexual traits. Simultaneous disruptive selection by female mate choice and male-male competition can, in theory, lead to speciation without geographical isolation if both act on the same male trait. Female mate choice can generate discontinuities in gene flow, while male-male competition can generate negative frequency-dependent selection stabilizing the male trait polymorphism. Speciation may be facilitated when mating preference and/or aggression bias are physically linked to the trait they operate on. We tested for genetic associations among female mating preference, male aggression bias and male coloration in the Lake Victoria cichlid Pundamilia. We crossed females from a phenotypically variable population with males from both extreme ends of the phenotype distribution in the same population (blue or red). Male offspring of a red sire were significantly redder than males of a blue sire, indicating that intra-population variation in male coloration is heritable. We <b>tested</b> <b>mating</b> preferences of female offspring and aggression biases of male offspring using binary choice tests. There was no evidence for associations at the family level between female mating preferences and coloration of sires, but dam identity {{had a significant effect}} on female mate preference. Sons of the red sire directed significantly more aggression to red than blue males, whereas sons of the blue sire did not show any bias. There was a positive correlation among individuals between male aggression bias and body coloration, possibly due to pleiotropy or physical linkage, which could facilitate the maintenance of color polymorphism [Current Zoology 59 (2) : 221 - 229, 2013]. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Sexual {{selection}} {{has been}} hypothesised as favouring mate choice resulting in production of viable offspring with genotypes providing high pathogen resistance. Specific pathogen recognition is mediated by genes {{of the major}} histocompatibility complex (MHC) encoding proteins fundamental for adaptive immune response in jawed vertebrates. MHC genes may {{also play a role}} in odour-based individual recognition and mate choice, aimed at avoiding inbreeding. MHC genes are known to be involved in mate choice in a number of species, with 'good genes' (absolute criteria) and 'complementary genes' (self-referential criteria) being used to explain MHC-based mating. Here, we focus on the effect of morphological traits and variation and genetic similarity between individuals in MHC class IIB (MHCIIB) exon 2 on mating in a free-living population of a monogamous bird, the grey partridge. Results: We found no evidence for absolute mate choice criteria as regards grey partridge MHCIIB genotypes, i. e., number and occurrence of amino acid variants, though red chroma of the spot behind eyes was positively associated with male pairing success. On the other hand, mate choice at MHCIIB was based on relative criteria as females preferentially paired with more dissimilar males having a lower number of shared amino acid variants. This observation supports the 'inbreeding avoidance' and 'complementary genes' hypotheses. Conclusions: Our study provides one of the first pieces of evidence for MHC-based mate choice for genetic complementarity in a strictly monogamous bird. The statistical approach employed can be recommended for <b>testing</b> <b>mating</b> preferences in cases where availability of potential mates (recorded with an appropriate method such as radiotracking) shows considerable temporal variation. Additional genetic analyses using neutral markers may detect whether MHC-based mate choice for complementarity emerges as a by-product of general inbreeding avoidance in grey partridges...|$|R

However, very few studies yet <b>tested</b> <b>mating</b> system parameters other than outcrossing rates; and the direct effects of the genetic diversity of the pollen received by maternal plants (i. e. correlated paternity) has often been overlooked. In this study, we investigated the relation between correlated paternity and progeny performance in two common Mediterranean shrubs, Myrtus communis and Pistacia lentiscus. To do so, we collected open-pollinated progeny from selected maternal plants, calculated mating system parameters using microsatellite genotyping and conducted sowing experiments under greenhouse and field conditions. Our results showed that some progeny fitness components were negatively affected by the high correlated paternity of maternal plants. In Myrtus communis, high correlated paternity had {{a negative effect on}} the proportion and timing of seedling emergence in the natural field conditions and in the greenhouse sowing experiment, respectively. In Pistacia lentiscus, seedling emergence time under field conditions was also negatively influenced by high correlated paternity and a progeny survival analysis in the field experiment showed greater mortality of seedlings from maternal plants with high correlated paternity. Overall, we found effects of correlated paternity on the progeny performance of Myrtus communis, a self-compatible species. Further, we also detected effects of correlated paternity on the progeny emergence time and survival in Pistacia lentiscus, an obligate outcrossed species. This study represents one of the few existing empirical examples which highlight the influence that correlated paternity may exert on progeny performance in multiple stages during early seedling growth.

40|$|Sexual {{selection}} is increasingly recognized to depend upon, and to fluctuate with, major ecological factors in natural environments. The operational sex ratio (OSR) and population density {{can affect the}} opportunity for, and strength of, sexual selection but their effects are rarely {{taken into account in}} laboratory behavioural studies. In Bicyclus anynana, a model butterfly for mate choice studies, the experimental set-up widely used in laboratories often involves very high densities compared to the field, male-biased sex ratios and small cage volumes. We hypothesized that these conditions impede the proper expression of female mating preference by promoting male competition and sexual harassment of females. Using various cage volumes, we separately manipulated OSR and density to cover the range of values used in B. anynana laboratory mating experiments and to approach field values. Male competition, quantified by the number and duration of courtships aborted by males, became stronger with increasing densities, specifically under more male-biased sex ratios, and decreasing cage volumes. Thus, male eagerness to mate was essentially due to the use of small cage volumes and very high experimental densities. Concomitantly, female choosiness, quantified by the proportion of rejections of male mating attempts, decreased with increasing densities under a male-biased sex ratio. Females also accepted more matings with decreasing cage volume, and mated more rapidly with increasing density. We conclude that the laboratory social environments frequently used to <b>test</b> <b>mate</b> choice in B. anynana, with unnaturally high densities and male-biased sex ratios, exacerbate male–male competition and strongly hinder female choice, biasing the estimates of the strength and direction of sexual selection that were shaped under very different natural environments in the wild.

In tests that check for carcinogens, maximum tolerated dosage is first determined, then a range of doses are given to around 50 animals throughout the notional lifespan of the animal of two years. After death the animals are examined for sign of tumours. Differences in metabolism between rat and human however means that human may not respond {{in exactly the same way}} to mutagen, and dosages that produce tumours on the animal test may also be unreasonably high for a human, i.e. the equivalent amount required to produce tumours in human may far exceed what a person might encounter in real life. Mice with recessive mutations for a visible phenotype may also be used to check for mutagens. Females with recessive mutation crossed with wild-type males would yield the same phenotype as the wild-type, and any observable change to the phenotype would indicate that a mutation induced by the mutagen has occurred. Mice may also be used for dominant lethal assays where early embryonic deaths are monitored. Male mice are treated with chemicals under <b>test,</b> <b>mated</b> with females, and the females are then sacrificed before parturition and early fetal deaths are counted in the uterine horns.

Until now, studies have not directly explored the relationship between mating group size and sex allocation, which we here achieve in the simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano. Using transgenic focal worms with ubiquitous expression of green-fluorescent protein (GFP), we assessed the number of wild-type mating partners carrying GFP+ sperm from these focal worms when raised in different social group sizes. This allowed us to <b>test</b> directly how <b>mating</b> group size was related to the sex allocation of focal worms. We find that the proportion of male investment initially increases with increasing mating group size, but then saturates as predicted by theory. To our knowledge, this is the first direct <b>test</b> of the <b>mating</b> group size model in a simultaneously hermaphroditic animal. ...|$|R

Here we provide a simple protocol on how to sample and rapidly identify C. elegans wild isolates. We outline how to find suitable habitats and organic substrates, followed by describing isolation and identification of C. elegans live cultures based on easily recognizable morphological characteristics, molecular barcodes and/or <b>mating</b> <b>tests.</b> This protocol uses standard laboratory equipment and requires no prior knowledge of C. elegans biology...|$|R
