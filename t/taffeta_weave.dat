"Grosgrain" [...] is {{commonly}} {{used to refer to}} a heavy, stiff ribbon of silk or nylon woven via <b>taffeta</b> <b>weave</b> using a heavy weft which results in distinct transverse ribs. Historically grosgrain was made from wool, silk, or a combination of fibers such as silk and wool or silk and mohair. When a combination of fibers was used, the end result was sometimes given the name grogram, silk mohair, gros de Tours or gros de Napels.|$|E
5000|$|In {{industry}} the selvage may be {{thicker than}} the rest of the fabric, and is where the main weft threads are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying. More simply, they [...] "finish" [...] the left and right-hand edges of fabric as it exits the loom, especially for the ubiquitous [...] "criss-cross" [...] simple or tabby weave, referred to in industry as <b>taffeta</b> <b>weave.</b> Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe. The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used. A water- or air-jet loom creates a fringed selvage that is the same weight as the rest of the cloth, as by the weft thread is drawn via a jet nozzle, which sends the weft threads through the shed with a pulse of water. The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place. Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{presented}} {{experimental work}} describes the nondestructive examination of polymer based composites using an acoustic method under {{the consideration of}} nonlinear effects. The technique {{is based on the}} fact that material behaves more nonlinearly in the presence of damage than in the undamaged state during dynamic load. Damaged structures show an increased nonlinear transmission behavior. Consequently, the level of nonlinearity is an indication of the damage severity. The aim is to analyze the nonlinear transfer behavior and if a quantification can be used to determine the damage severity. The focus is on the type of nonlinear acoustic spectroscopy methods that analyses the modulation spectrum. When two harmonic waves are applied with different frequencies to a damaged material, the amplitude of the high-frequency wave will be modulated by the low-frequency wave and the created spectrum manifests an intermodulation by showing new frequencies such as sidebands and higher harmonics. Samples made of glass fiber reinforced vinyl ester respectively epoxy, both <b>taffeta</b> <b>woven,</b> and pre-damaged by application of tensile tests using different levels of tension have been considered. A new experimental setup has been developed and a clearly visible increase of the intermodulation with increasing damage has been noticed for both materials. Finally, the method is proven to nondestructively evaluate the damage state of composites...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{presented}} {{experimental work}} describes the nondestructive damage examination of polymer-matrix composites using acoustic methods under {{the consideration of}} nonlinear effects. The aim is to analyze these nonlinear effects {{in order to provide}} a quantification of the nonlinear acoustic transmission which is related to the damage state and its severity in the composite material. The first objective was to study the effectiveness of the distortion evaluation method and its related parameter: the BTotal Difference Frequency Distortion^ (TDFD) parameter. The TDFD was utilized as a new damage indicator to quantify the progressive damage state in composite materials. The TDFD method had initially been proposed to characterize the distortion of audio amplifiers. A custom-made setup was developed that imposes acoustic signals to the structure. The samples’ vibrations were afterwards analyzed by a laservibrometer and further spectrum evaluations. The developed method was applied to two composite materials, both reinforced with <b>taffeta</b> <b>woven</b> glass-fibers, but having different thermoset polymer matrix, i. e. vinylester and epoxy. The damage was introduced in the specimen by tensile tests with a stepwise increase of the tension loading. It was observed that damage influences the intensity of nonlinear intermodulation after having introduced two harmonic and constant signals of different and randomly chosen frequencies in the specimen. The nonlinear intermodulation was then quantified by computing the TDFD parameter. In the specific case of epoxy based composites, high frequency peaks were noted for the high tensile loading levels only. The TDFD parameter was then modified in order to take into account this effect. For both studied composites, the modified TDFD parameter increases with the damage accumulation caused by the applied stepwise tensile loading...|$|R

Three cellulosic <b>taffeta</b> plain <b>weave</b> fabrics of 100 % flax, cotton and bamboo viscose were used in different combinations. The properties of the woven fabrics and produced composites were characterized using several mechanical tests. The cotton & viscose composite appears to be the best materials combination, exhibiting improved breaking force (0. 5 % of Xylanase PLUSTM) and percentage of elongation at maximum force (0. 1 % of Xylanase PLUSTM), as well as better results on the peel adhesion test (0. 5 % of AlternaFuel® MAXTM). The flax & cotton combination did not show any improvement for all the tested properties. Flax & viscose combination, despite not having shown peel strength improvement, exhibits remarkable elongation and breaking force (0. 5 % ofXylanase PLUSTM). Since there is no posterior emission ofvolatile products, one canexpect agreat public acceptance.

Today most raw silk taffeta is produced in India and Pakistan. There, even in the modern period, handlooms were long widely used, but since the 1990s it has been produced on mechanical looms in the Bangalore area. From the 1970s until the 1990s, the Jiangsu province of China produced fine silk taffetas: these were less flexible than those from Indian mills, however, which continue to dominate production. Other countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East also produce silk taffeta, but these products are not yet equal in quality or competitiveness to those from India. The most deluxe taffetas, however, are still woven in France, Italy, Russia, and the United Kingdom.|$|R
