Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E

The increased uncertainty among certain groups of natives (natives, in particular, who are low-skilled, and who might perceive their labour market opportunities to be weaker {{with the arrival of the}} Mariel Cubans) should work to impact fertility negatively since it might induce these natives to delay their childbearing plans in anticipation of <b>tougher</b> <b>economic</b> conditions in the future (Ranjan 1999; Sobotka et al. 2011).

25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1921, Snively became a {{candidate}} for mayor of Duluth, was elected, and kept the position {{for a total of}} sixteen years--a record for Duluth mayors. Snively was sixty-one years old when {{he was elected to the}} office, and his first proclamation as mayor was his promise to make Duluth the most beautiful city in the Northwest, if not the country. The completion and promotion of Skyline Parkway, the city's hilltop boulevard, became Snively's personal project throughout his four terms in office. The idea for the city-wide boulevard is credited to William King Rogers of Ohio, who also oversaw construction of its initial segment from 1889 to 1891. After that, work on the boulevard fell off, and was piecemeal at best until Snively came into office. During his administration, the boulevard's expansion served as both a way to beautify the city and provide jobs during <b>tough</b> <b>economic</b> times in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|The {{sandwich}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} there was a great deal of animosity between the chain and its franchises over its Buck Double promotion, which was driving average checks and profits. The Buck Double had been running for since October 2010 to the introduction of the XT, eventually had taken upwards 10% of all sales in the restaurants - cannibalizing sales from other higher priced items. Combined with the ongoing economic downturn at the time, the value- oriented promotion had sent overall profits for the chain down by as much as 3.3%. The introduction was seen as a way to help stop the sales slide and prop up the chain's flagging sales. By mid-2011, the financial crisis was also still lingering and many chains, Burger King included, had moved to a discounting as a way to attract customers who were unwilling to spend money during <b>tough</b> <b>economic</b> times. The discounting fit into the barbell strategy as these deals would often encourage people to purchase more food, often at higher price points.|$|E

The results confirmed our hypothesis and suggested that restructuring the banks into shareholding companies could improve both pure technical efficiency and scale economies of the banks.
