2500|$|On 23 August 2011, the Polish Presidency of the European Union {{organised}} {{a conference}} {{on the occasion of}} the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes. The EU presidency cited the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusions of 10 June and the EU's Stockholm Programme, which emphasises that [...] "remembrance of [...] shared history is necessary to understand contemporary Europe." [...] European officials adopted the Warsaw Declaration for the European Day of Remembrance for the Victims of Totalitarian Regimes. The Warsaw Declaration vows that the suffering of victims of totalitarian regimes [...] "will not sink into oblivion." [...] The declaration states that [...] "crimes of totalitarian regimes in Europe should be acknowledged and condemned, regardless of their type and ideology." [...] Justice Minister Krzysztof Kwiatkowski said that the [...] "Warsaw Declaration is a unanimous agreement of all EU member states <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything we can to prevent any totalitarian regime from reviving in all the countries making up one big European family." [...] EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding stated on this occasion: ...|$|E

It is always to be aimed at {{so far as it}} is possible; and when you have time and opportunity, some portions of a landscape may, as you gain greater skill, be rendered with an approximation almost to mirrored portraiture. Still, whatever skill you may reach, there will always be need of judgment to choose, and of speed to seize, certain things that are principal or fugitive; and you must give more and more effort daily to the observance of characteristic points, and the attainment of concise methods.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{there may}} {{come into my}} art also, no less than into my life, a still deeper note, one of greater unity of passion, and {{directness}} of impulse. Not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art. We {{are no longer in}} art concerned with the type. It is with the exception <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I cannot put my sufferings into any form they took, I need hardly say. Art only begins where Imitation ends, but something must come into my work, of fuller memory of words perhaps, of richer cadences, of more curious effects, of simpler architectural order, of some aesthetic quality at any rate.|$|E
60|$|There {{are some}} pawnbrokers’ shops {{of a very}} {{superior}} description. There are grades in pawning as in everything else, and distinctions must be observed even in poverty. The aristocratic Spanish cloak and the plebeian calico shirt, the silver fork and the flat iron, the muslin cravat and the Belcher neckerchief, would but ill assort together; so, the better sort of pawnbroker calls himself a silver-smith, and decorates his shop with handsome trinkets and expensive jewellery, while the more humble money-lender boldly advertises his calling, and invites observation. It is with pawnbrokers’ shops of the latter class, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We have selected one for our purpose, and will endeavour to describe it.|$|E

60|$|It is {{with the}} story of the war which {{followed}} the conversation of Harry Furness and Herbert Rippinghall <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> not with that of the political occurrences which preceded it. As to these, at least, no doubts or differences of opinion can arise. The incidents of the war, its victories and defeats, its changing fortunes, and its final triumph are matters beyond the domain of politics, or of opinion; and indeed when once the war began politics ceased to have much further sway. The original questions were lost sight of, and men fought for king or Parliament just as soldiers nowadays fight for England or Prance, without in any concerning themselves with the original grounds of quarrel.|$|E

What is the use of Davy-lamps? what is the use of all our care as to the ventilation, if at any moment the gas may be fired at a lamp opened for lighting a pipe? I like my pipe, but if I thought there was ever any chance of its becoming my master I would never touch tobacco again." ...|$|E
6000|$|First, then, He will be {{faithful}} to us in this: He will keep us from those allurements {{of the world that}} a suffering saint is subject to. They that suffer have other kinds of temptations upon this account than other Christians have. The liberty of others, while they are in bonds, is a temptation to them. The peace of others, while they are in trouble, is a temptation to them. The enjoyments of others, while their houses are empty and their goods taken away, while their own water is sold unto them, and while they are buying their own wood, is a great temptation to them (Lam 5:4). And this temptation, were it not <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a God that is faithful, would assuredly be a great snare unto them. But [...] "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted," [...] as to this, [...] "above that ye are able" [...] (1 Cor 10:13).|$|E

It is a meeting of fifty-seven {{representative}}s of the various trades unions of the country, to elect a single representative to take the chair whenever meetings of this company shall be necessary. This gathering does not exist as a society in any shape or form and we have therefore neither rules nor usages. Mr. Dartrey and Mr. Tallente, although they are honorary members, are, I am sure, welcome guests, and whatever either of them wishes to say to us will, I am sure, be listened to. There is no business. All <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to vote, to choose our leader for the next twelve months. There are two names put forward--Saunderson and Miller. It is my business only to count the votes you may record. Presuming {{that no one else}} wishes to speak, I shall ask Mr. Dartrey to say those few words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § XXX. What? {{the reader}} asks in some surprise,--Stucco! {{and in the}} great Gothic period? Even so, but not stucco to imitate stone. Herein lies all the difference; it is stucco confessed and understood, and laid on the bricks {{precisely}} as gesso is laid on canvas, in order to form them into a ground for receiving color from the human hand,--color which, if well laid on, might render the brick wall more precious than {{if it had been}} built of emeralds. Whenever we wish to paint, we may prepare our paper as we choose; the value of the ground in no wise adds to the value of the picture. A Tintoret on beaten gold would be of no more value than a Tintoret on coarse canvas; the gold would merely be wasted. All <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to make the ground as good and fit for the color as possible, by whatever means.|$|E
60|$|But {{it is with}} The Court <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at present, {{not with}} Yarleys. Mr. Champers-Haswell had a {{week-end}} party. There were ten guests, all men, and {{with the exception of}} Alan, who it will be remembered was one of them, all rich and in business. They included two French bankers and three Jews, everyone a prop of the original Sahara Syndicate and deeply interested in the forthcoming flotation. To describe them is unnecessary, for they have no part in our story, being only financiers of a certain class, remarkable for the riches they had acquired by means {{that for the most part}} would not bear examination. The riches were evident enough. Ever since the morning the owners of this wealth had arrived by ones or twos in their costly motorcars, attended by smart chauffeurs and valets. Their fur coats, their jewelled studs and rings, something in their very faces suggested money, which indeed was the bond that brought and held them together.|$|E
