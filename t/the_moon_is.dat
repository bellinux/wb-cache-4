5|$|Plotinus {{argued that}} since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on mankind should depend on their {{position}} {{with respect to the}} zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> full, but bad when <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.|$|E

5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but only when <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{thought to}} have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} {{explanation is that the}} Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> visible for {{two weeks}} every 27.3 days at the North and South Pole. The Moon's light is used by {{zooplankton}} in the Arctic {{when the sun is}} below the horizon for months on end.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 20×16×14km across. A surface area estimate would be between 840 and 1,600 (~1,200) km2. This {{makes it the}} smallest of the four inner moons. The bulk, composition and mass of Adrastea are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea, around 0.86g/cm3, its mass can be estimated at about 2kg. Amalthea's density implies that <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%, and Adrastea may be similar.|$|E
40|$|Thermoelastic stress {{calculations}} {{show that}} if <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> initially molten {{only in the}} outer few hundred kilometers, as in the magma ocean model of <b>the</b> <b>moon,</b> <b>the</b> highlands crust should be aseismic. In contrast, if <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> initially totally molten, high stress (1 to more than about 3 kbar), shallow (0 to about 6 km deep), compressional moonquakes should be occurring in the highlands crust. Calculations of the minimum stress drops made for the 28 observed shallow moonquakes suggest that 3 of them probably have stress drops in the kbar range. Thus, these very limited seismic data {{are consistent with the}} model that <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> initially totally molten...|$|R

5|$|All of Uranus's moons {{are named}} after {{characters}} from {{the works of}} William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. The names of all four satellites of Uranus then known were suggested by John Herschel in 1852 {{at the request of}} Lassell. Ariel is named after the leading sylph in The Rape of the Lock. It is also the name of the spirit who serves Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest. <b>The</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> also designated UranusI.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along {{the rim of the}} crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|Craters of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{in south-central}} Idaho, midway between Boise and Yellowstone National Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains.

However, the rugged landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one paved road across the northern end.|$|E

5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> personified as <b>the</b> male god *Meh1not. The ancient Sumerians {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> god Nanna, {{who was the}} father of Inanna, the goddess of the planet Venus, and Utu, the god of the sun. Nanna was later known as Sîn, and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery. In Greco-Roman mythology, the Sun and <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>are</b> represented as male and female, respectively (Helios/Sol and Selene/Luna); this is a development unique to the eastern Mediterranean and traces of an earlier male <b>moon</b> god in <b>the</b> Greek tradition are preserved in the figure of Menelaus.|$|R

Together Morgan and Lizzie capture the fleet, killing Delgado in the process, and capture Sahin. Sahin tells Morgan that the Circle believes the Lake of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> the Fountain of Youth and that his intention from the beginning was to prevent the Circle from obtaining the Fountain.|$|E
5|$|Several {{nightjar}} {{species are}} known to be more likely to lay in the two weeks before the full moon than the during the waning moon, possibly because insect food may be easier to catch as the moon waxes. A study specifically looking at the European nightjar showed that the phase of <b>the</b> <b>moon</b> <b>is</b> a factor for birds laying in June, but not for earlier breeders. This strategy means that a second brood in July would also have a favourable lunar aspect.|$|E
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana, the Devi-Bhagavata Purana and the Linga Purana {{declare that}} Ila ascended to heaven with {{both male and}} female anatomy. Ila is {{considered}} the chief progenitor of the Lunar Dynasty through Pururavas and of the Solar Dynasty through his brother Iksavaku and sons Utkala, Gaya, and Vinatashva. The marriage of Ilā, a descendant of the Sun, and Budha, the son of <b>the</b> <b>Moon,</b> <b>is</b> the first union of the solar and lunar races recorded in the scriptures.|$|E

5|$|The Dark Side of <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> {{the eighth}} album by English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions following {{the departure of}} founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett, in 1968, that characterised their earlier work. It thematically explores conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.|$|E
5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. This {{is partly due to}} the brightness enhancement of the opposition effect; at quarter phase, <b>the</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>is</b> in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
