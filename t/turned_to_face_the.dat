5|$|At 15:00, {{with the}} {{detached}} division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure {{and attempted to}} pass across {{the stern of the}} rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvere the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam, having {{consolidated}} {{his control}} over Baghdad, now <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> {{threat posed by}} the Buyids. To this end, he strengthened his ties with the Baridis of Basra, by handing over Wasit, as previously agreed, appointing Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as vizier of the Abbasid court (although the latter remained at Wasit and did not visit Baghdad), and, finally, by marrying himself to one of al-Baridi's daughters. Bajkam's success against the Buyids was mixed: Wasit was saved from Buyid attack, and the Baridis led a successful campaign in Susiana, but an expedition into Jibal was crushed by the third Buyid brother, Hasan. The alliance with the Baridis quickly soured, however, as al-Baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing Bajkam, and ajkam was aware of this. In late August 940, Bajkam removed al-Baridi from the vizierate and launched an attack on Wasit, which the Baridis abandoned without resistance. In the meantime, the Baghdad was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace, with fanatical members of the Hanbali school imposing their tenets on the general populace.|$|E

2500|$|Often, the batsman is {{only allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> next {{delivery}} if {{they hit the}} ball. If they miss and are not dismissed, they must attempt to play the next ball (which is bowled from where the ball ended up after the previous delivery) without being allowed <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> it. Sometimes additionally, if the batsman does not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> ball before a fielder picks it up, they would have <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> their waist and <b>face</b> <b>the</b> fielder bowling in order to hit the ball.|$|R

25|$|From around 1849 Darwin stopped {{attending}} church, but Emma and {{the children}} continued to attend services.

25|$|The Éolienne Bollée is {{an unusual}} wind turbine, unique for having a stator and a rotor, as a water turbine has. The eponymous {{invention}} was first patented in 1868 by Ernest Sylvain Bollée in France. A further patent dated 1885 differed mainly in two ways: First, in how the turbine was <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> wind and second, in an improvement which increased the flow of wind through the turbine was added. The turbines built according to the 1885 patent were commercially successful.|$|E
50|$|In fact, it is {{usual in}} German {{heraldry}} for charges in a composite {{coat of arms}} <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> center; this practice is known as heraldic courtoisie ('courtesy').|$|R

25|$|In {{order to}} allow both range and bearing to be {{measured}} at the same time, separate antennas, receivers, amplifiers and displays were needed. The antennas were mounted on triangular trusses mounted rigidly to a wooden cabin, in turn mounted on an AA gun carriage bearing system which allowed the entire cabin to be rotated around the vertical axis. For tracking, the transmitter and receiver cabins were both <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> {{general direction of the}} target. The result was an unwieldy system of some complexity.|$|E
25|$|Darwin was on {{good terms}} with the local curate. He contributed to the church, helped with parish {{assistance}} and proposed a benefit society which became the Down Friendly Society with Darwin as guardian and treasurer. On Sundays Emma took the children to church. Darwin sometimes went with them {{as far as the}} lychgate to the churchyard, and then he would go for a walk.

25|$|Scripts {{are also}} {{graphically}} {{characterized by the}} direction in which they are written. Egyptian hieroglyphs were written either left to right or right to left, with the animal and human glyphs <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the line. The early alphabet could be written in multiple directions: horizontally (side to side), or vertically (up or down). Prior to standardization, alphabetical writing was done both left-to-right (LTR or sinistrodextrally) and right-to-left (RTL or dextrosinistrally). It was most commonly written boustrophedonically: starting in one (horizontal) direction, then turning {{at the end of the}} line and reversing direction.|$|E
50|$|In {{fish that}} exhibit rheotaxis, it {{can easily be}} {{demonstrated}} by creating an artificial current within a tank using pumps. No matter which way the pumps force the current to flow, the fish will immediately <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> oncoming current.|$|R

25|$|A {{solar oven}} is turned towards {{the sun and}} left until the food is cooked. Unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire, which may require {{more than an hour}} of {{constant}} supervision, food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over, both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the trapped heat to escape and thereby slows the cooking process. If wanted, the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours, to turn the oven to face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight. If the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day, then the solar oven is often <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> point where the sun will be when it is highest in the sky, instead of towards its current position.|$|E

500|$|Early on the 16thday, the [...] "soul" [...] of Aravan is {{transferred}} {{back to his}} repainted head and the cuvami tirukkan tirattal ("opening of the god's holy eyes") ceremony is performed with painting of the pupils. The head is then paraded around the village on a portable platform called a ketayam. The ketayam is accompanied by two other platform-chariots, one holding the chest plate and epaulettes of Aravan—without which the festival is considered incomplete; the other carries his flower-crown. The ceremony ends with a sacrificial offering of roosters. Aravan's head is fixed on the post, with his large epaulettes and chest plate fixed to his body, which is made of straw and surrounded by a garland. The image is then paraded across the village in preparation for his kalappali and ritual re-enactment of his death on the eighth day of the war. At noon his chariot turns north, a symbolic gesture representing his kalappali and then he is <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> ceremonial Kurukshetra battlefield, symbolizing his entry onto the battlefield to die {{at the hands of}} Alambusha. On arrival in Kurukshetra, the garlands are removed, indicating the removal of his flesh and his defeat on the eighth day of war.|$|E
50|$|The Apostles' Creed {{is used in}} the non-Eucharistic {{services}} of Matins and Evening Prayer (Evensong).
