We present constructions based on dense lattice packings and nested lattice (Voronoi) shaping. Our codes achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of quasi-static MIMO fading channels for any fading statistics, and perform very well also at practical, moderate values of signal to noise ratios (SNR). Then, we extend the construction to the case of large block lengths, by using trellis coset coding.

40|$|Summary form only given. In this paper, {{we examine}} the effect of block size on the {{performance}} of trellis based quantization. In particular, the Viterbi and tailbiting BCJR algorithms are compared. It is shown that for short blocks of data, the T-BCJR algorithm achieves a superior performance over the Viterbi algorithm (VA). One approach is to use the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) heuristic and the T-BCJR algorithm. If the MAP-encoder does not produce a tailbiting state sequence, the path is modified for a number of stages {{at the beginning and end}} of the block such that it tailbites. The enclosed figure shows MSE as a function of block size and sample position, respectively, for a rate R= 1 bit per sample, 32 -state trellis quantizer and an IID Gaussian source. The effects of start-up are clearly visible. For the T-BCJR algorithm, the distortion is evenly distributed across the whole block. The performance decrease for short blocks stems from the increase in the number of tailbiting violations for short blocks and the suboptimal modification to ensure tailbiting. The results presented here hold for a large class of <b>trellis</b> <b>constructions,</b> such as TC...|$|R

30|$|Recent {{contributions}} {{proposed to}} exploit the efficiency of turbo decoding by integrating the arithmetic decoder in an iterative decoding process [13, 16 – 18]. These contributions used finite-state machine representations for the AC to apply Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) decoding algorithms. Iterative decoding is then performed by concatenating the ACs with a Recursive Systematic Convolutional Code (RSCC). It is worth {{pointing out that the}} techniques introduced in [13, 16] were applied for JPEG 2000 compressed image transmission. We notice that all the proposed techniques rely on specific <b>trellis</b> <b>constructions</b> with eventually pruning, which results in various efficiencies in terms of error correction performance. However, in the proposed trellises the states number increases with the source symbol sequence length L, and the source alphabet size U. Thus, the decoding complexity becomes intractable for large values of L and U. Recently, some contributions considered JSC decoding methods including a Low-Density Parity-Check Code (LDPC) for channel coding with application to image transmission. In [19], the authors considered rate-compatible LDPC codes to apply unequal error protection on the compressed JPEG 2000 bit-stream. Extra information provided by the error-resilience mode of the JPEG 2000 encoder was delivered to the LDPC decoder and iterative decoding was performed in [20].|$|R

Furthermore, the <b>trellis</b> <b>construction</b> needs {{the transmission of}} the source statistics as side information. Consequently, trellis-based decoding {{is very hard to}} apply with adaptive AC (the trellis changes with symbol probabilities). The proposed soft-input arithmetic decoder is very simple and can easily be extended to the adaptive context-based ACs.|$|E
30|$|An {{alternative}} {{to reduce the}} decoding complexity is to consider trellis representations for the constituent codes other than the conventional trellis usually adopted. For nonrecursive convolutional encodes, there is a trellis structure, the minimal trellis[6], which represents the coded sequences minimally under various complexity measures. The interest on the minimal trellis representation comes from its good error performance versus decoding complexity trade-off[7 – 10] and its potential power consumption and hardware utilization reductions[11]. However, the minimal <b>trellis</b> <b>construction</b> presented in[6] cannot be readily applied to turbo codes. The {{reason is that the}} mapping between information bits and coded bits produced by the minimal trellis corresponds to nonrecursive convolutional encoders, while systematic, recursive mappings are required in turbo coding. This article presents a method which can fill this gap.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{potential}} for capacity increase in multiple-antenna wireless communication systems has drawn considerable attention to space–time codes. However, {{most of the}} existing space–time code construction methods have assumed ideal channel models: either quasi-static fading or fast fading. In this work, we propose a systematic space–time <b>trellis</b> code <b>construction</b> method for correlated fading channels. We derive the performance criteria that take into account both spatial and temporal channel correlation, assuming that the space–time correlation matrixis of full rank. Moreover, we introduce a new design criterion and analyze {{the properties of the}} space–time trellis codes satisfying the proposed criterion. Using the design criterion, we develop a code construction procedure that jointly considers diversity advantage and coding advantage for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas and any memoryless modulation. The flexibility of the proposed code construction method is demonstrated by designing space–time trellis codes for two, three, and four transmit antennas with quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK), 8 PSK (phase-shift keying), and 4 ASK (amplitude-shift keying) modulations. The simulation results demonstrate that not only can our method generate new codes for an arbitrary number of antennas, but in some special cases, where previously proposed codes exist, our codes also perform very well.

40|$|Since {{the frantic}} race towards the Shannon bound [1] {{commenced}} {{in the early}} 1950 ’s, linear block codes have become integral components of most digital communication systems. Both binary and non-binary linear block codes have proven themselves as formidable adversaries against the impediments presented by wireless communication channels. However, prior to the landmark 1974 paper [2] by Bahl et al. on the optimal Maximum a-Posteriori Probability (MAP) trellis decoding of linear block codes, practical linear block code decoding schemes were not only based on suboptimal hard decision algorithms, but also code-specific in most instances. In 1978 Wolf expedited the work of Bahl et al. by demonstrating the applicability of a block-wise Viterbi Algorithm (VA) to Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) trellis structures as a generic optimal soft decision Maximum-Likelihood (ML) trellis decoding solution for linear block codes [3]. This study, largely motivated by code implementers’ ongoing search for generic linear block code decoding algorithms, builds on the foundations established by Bahl, Wolf and other contributing researchers by thoroughly evaluating the VA decoding of popular binary and non-binary linear block codes on realistic narrowband and wideband digital communication platforms in lifelike mobile environments. Ideally, generic linear block code decoding algorithms must not only be modest in terms of computational complexity, but they must also be channel aware. Such universal algorithms will undoubtedly be integrated into most channel coding subsystems that adapt to changing mobile channel conditions, such as the adaptive channel coding schemes of current Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), 3 rd Generation (3 G) and Beyond 3 G (B 3 G) systems, as well as future 4 th Generation (4 G) systems. In this study classic BCJR linear block code <b>trellis</b> <b>construction</b> is annotated and applied to contemporary binary and non-binary linear block codes. Since BCJR trellis structures are inherently sizable and intricate, rudimentary trellis complexity calculation and reduction algorithms are also presented and demonstrated. The block-wise VA for BCJR trellis structures, initially introduced by Wolf in [3], is revisited and improved to incorporate Channel State Information (CSI) during its ML decoding efforts. In order to accurately appraise the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performances of VA decoded linear block codes in authentic wireless communication environments, Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), flat fading and multi-user multipath fading simulation platforms were constructed. Included in this task was the development of baseband complex flat and multipath fading channel simulator models, capable of reproducing the physical attributes of realistic mobile fading channels. Furthermore, a complex Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) system were employed as the narrowband communication link of choice for the AWGN and flat fading channel performance evaluation platforms. The versatile B 3 G multi-user multipath fading simulation platform, however, was constructed using a wideband RAKE receiver-based complex Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum Multiple Access (DS/SSMA) communication system that supports unfiltered and filtered Complex Spreading Sequences (CSS). This wideband platform is not only capable of analysing the influence of frequency selective fading on the BER performances of VA decoded linear block codes, but also {{the influence of the}} Multi-User Interference (MUI) created by other users active in the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system. CSS families considered during this study include Zadoff-Chu (ZC) [4, 5], Quadriphase (QPH) [6], Double Sideband (DSB) Constant Envelope Linearly Interpolated Root-of- Unity (CE-LI-RU) filtered Generalised Chirp-like (GCL) [4, 7 - 9] and Analytical Bandlimited Complex (ABC) [7, 10] sequences. Numerous simulated BER performance curves, obtained using the AWGN, flat fading and multi-user multipath fading channel performance evaluation platforms, are presented in this study for various important binary and non-binary linear block code classes, all decoded using the VA. Binary linear block codes examined include Hamming and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, whereas popular burst error correcting non-binary Reed-Solomon (RS) codes receive special attention. Furthermore, a simple cyclic binary linear block code is used to validate the viability of employing the reduced trellis structures produced by the proposed trellis complexity reduction algorithm. The simulated BER performance results shed light on the error correction capabilities of these VA decoded linear block codes when influenced by detrimental channel effects, including AWGN, Doppler spreading, diminished Line-of-Sight (LOS) signal strength, multipath propagation and MUI. It also investigates the impact of other pertinent communication system configuration alternatives, including channel interleaving, code puncturing, the quality of the CSI available during VA decoding, RAKE diversity combining approaches and CSS correlation characteristics. From these simulated results it can not only be gathered that the VA is an effective generic optimal soft input ML decoder for both binary and non-binary linear block codes, but also that the inclusion of CSI during VA metric calculations can fortify the BER performances of such codes beyond that attainable by classic ML decoding algorithms.

40|$|As {{existing}} {{wireless communication}} systems and standards cannot fully support the new, emerging multimedia applications, the designers of future wireless systems {{will have to}} face the challenge of devising coding and modulation methods that can provide reliable communication at very high data rates. To achieve this goal, {{one of the most promising}} techniques suggested recently is the exploitation of the spatial dimension: by employing multiple transmit and receive antennas, the detrimental effects of channel fading can be significantly reduced. This thesis aims to contribute to the field of wireless communications by developing efficient coding and decoding methods for systems having multiple transmitand receive antennas. First, we propose a systematic space-time <b>trellis</b> code <b>construction</b> method for the quasi-static, flat multi-antenna channel model by exploiting the trellis structure. The method can be used to construct space-time trellis codes for an arbitrary number of transmit antennas and any memoryless modulation.

We also propose a new code design criterion, the uniqueness criterion, and develop a systematic space-time trellis code design method for the correlated fading channel model. Finally, we propose a fast decoding algorithm for space-frequency-coded multi-antenna OFDM systems. The central component of the algorithm is a modulation independent decoding framework, which is based on a new interpretation of the sphere decoding problem. Using this decoding framework, we devise several SF block code decoding algorithms: a modulation independent decoding algorithm that can be used with any memoryless modulation, and 2 modulation specific decoding algorithms for QAM and PSK constellations using the idea of fast nearest neighbor search.

40|$|Trellis {{quantization}} is {{a finite}} state machine based method for data compression. It is mainly applied to quantizing noise-like sources. In this thesis new trellis codes suitable for low rate quantization are derived. Rate-distortion theory predicts source coding performance, but unfortunately provides only limited insight in how to construct good codes. In general, good trellis source codes combine a good trellis structure with suitable reproducer values. Further, to obtain excellent performance good codes must be combined with suitable trellis search algorithms. All these code design topics are addressed in the thesis. The new contributions {{can be divided into}} four main parts. The first considers the pure form trellis coding problem, i. e., <b>trellis</b> code <b>constructions</b> consisting of a single trellis populated by reproducer letters. These codes do not require further processing such as entropy coding. Entropy-constrained trellis codes are treated separately. We compare a method based on simple scaling of the set of reproducer values to constructions with individually optimized reproducer levels. Results show that the proposed methods are competitive with the best in the literature. Many real-life systems for data transmission are based on short information blocks and it is shown that the Viterbi search algorithm is not suitable for such short source sequences. Instead we propose a method based on the tailbiting BCJR algorithm and derive it from rate-distortion theoretic arguments. The thesis provides one of the first major studies of the tailbiting BCJR algorithm for source coding. In the final part of the thesis the new trellis codes are applied to image coding. All trellises have in common a code design based on linear congruential (LC) recursions. These are the key elements in pseudo-random number generators. Here they are used to associate the trellis branches with reproducer values. LC trellis codes are easy to generate and analyze. In addition to competitive performance the new codes easily adapt to different sources, state sizes, and coding rates. We also point out two label correlation measurements that predict good trellis code performance...|$|R
