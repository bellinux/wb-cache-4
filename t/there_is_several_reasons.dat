The thesis is composed of ten chapters, each of them describing the legal regulation of the real property law in different historical period of time. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic characteristics of real property law in the past, beginnings of its concept as a fundamental human right and specificities of the soil including mentioning the exclusive Czech legal institute buildings being a real property. Chapter Two shows the essential institutes of legal relations to the real properties from the beginnings of Czech statehood (feudalism and absolutism times) [...] ...|$|E

Ann Gustavsson made {{in the year of}} 2007 a study over rejuventation of freshwater great mussels in nine watersystems and considered that the rejuventation within the populations were all along the line poor. This study orients from her work and points to determine if there is a connection between the poor juventation and pollution of nitrogen and phosphorous from industries and private sanitations. The study was performed with the software program ArcGIS 9. 2 to take out drainage areas for the concerned habitats and contact was made with the concerned authoritys. When it comes to supervision of private sanitations is it the countys and for industries is it the county administrative board. Most of the countys had a very difficult way to reach their data of the private sanitations and those who had data had great holes in their knowledge in them. The greatest emission of nitrogen was without doubt the industries, but a more even allocation could be seen in the pollution of phosphourus, where the industries and the private sanitations stood for about fifty- fifty of the pollution. The greatest emission of nitrogen and phosphourus happened in Viskan, in the drainage area for Lekvad,there it was a lack of mussels. The species of Anodonta anatina showed a strong positive correlation between emission of nitrogen and phosphourus with the way of juvenile mussels in the population. More studies is need to do in these areas, both when it comes to continuing mapping of rejuventation within the freshwater great mussels in several waters and template value for pollution of nitrogen and phosphourus, that is very doubtful today. Even studies concerning other factors, like predation, host fishes and the influence of poison and medic drugs is needing to do, as it is few studies concerning this today...|$|E
