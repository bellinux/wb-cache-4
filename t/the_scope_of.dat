5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> {{review of the}} {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> judicial review depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v.

The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test {{was only part of}} the obiter dicta of the case.

40|$|We {{explore how}} {{knowledge-based}} connections to {{domestic and foreign}} locations affect <b>the</b> technological <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> firm innovations. Inspired by a blend of Economic Geography and International Business perspectives, we propose a theoretical framework that distinguishes between domestic subnational differences and cross-national spatial heterogeneity. Further, we combine the Penrosean view of managerial capabilities with the attention-based theory of the firm. Analyzing a sample of US-based firms between 1990 and 2006, we show that both domestic and international knowledge connectedness affect <b>the</b> technological <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> firm innovations, but their effects are different. The breadth of international knowledge connectedness appears to be positively associated with <b>the</b> technological <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> firm innovations. However, the breadth of domestic knowledge connectedness positively contributes to <b>the</b> technological <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> firm innovations {{up to a certain}} point, beyond which the bounded rationality of managers constrains firms’ ability to further leverage subnational heterogeneity. Thus, domestic search {{is more likely to be}} challenged by limited managerial bandwidth. Lastly, domestic and international knowledge connectedness significantly interact with each other to explain <b>the</b> technological <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> firm innovations...|$|R
