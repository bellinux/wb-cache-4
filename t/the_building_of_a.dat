5|$|An {{agreement}} {{exists between}} BAA and West Sussex County Council preventing <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second runway before 2019. Nevertheless, consultations were launched in 2002 by the Department for Transport, at which proposals for additional facilities and runways were considered. It was agreed {{that there would}} be no further expansion at Gatwick unless it became impossible to meet growth targets at London Heathrow Airport within existing pollution limits.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} electricity for local homes. <b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who had considerable interests in coal and banking.|$|E

5|$|By the 1970s {{the airport}} was again {{in need of}} {{expansion}} and modernization. In 1973 the newly created Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority (MNAA) finalized a master plan to coordinate the long-term growth of the airport along projected increases in needed passenger capacity. This plan included <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new terminal and a new parallel runway across Donelson Pike to handle increasing operations by reducing the time between consecutive takeoffs and landings.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{line through}} Lier started in 1895, and construction commenced in 1901. The line opened on 12 July 1904 and was initially profitable, {{in part because}} of tourist traffic. In 1920, the Drammen Line was converted to standard gauge, resulting in expensive transshipment between the two lines. This and falling traffic caused the line to become unprofitable. The Lier line was closed for ordinary traffic on 23 October 1932. All traffic ceased on 1 January 1937 and the track was demolished shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the Log Revolution and the end of April 1991, nearly 200 incidents involving the use of explosive devices and 89 attacks on the Croatian police were recorded. The Croatian Ministry of the Interior started arming an increasing number of special police forces, and this led to <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real army. On 9 April 1991, Croatian President Tuđman ordered the special police forces to be renamed Zbor Narodne Garde ("National Guard"); this marks the creation of a separate military of Croatia.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, {{after his}} {{accession}} to the throne, George V ordered {{the revival of}} the Installation ceremony, perhaps prompted by the first Installation ceremony of the more junior Order of St Michael and St George, held a few years earlier, and <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new chapel for the Order of the Thistle in 1911. The Installation ceremony took place on 22 July 1913 in the Henry VII Chapel, and Installations have been held at regular intervals since.|$|E
5|$|In an {{election}} held on September 19, 1995, {{the residents of}} King County voted against a 1-percentage-point sales tax increase to fund <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> replacement stadium.

5|$|In the 1860s {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small jetty was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the Napier Commission suggested <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> replacement, but it was 1901 before the Congested Districts Board provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the Highlands and Islands in the 19th century as Doirneagan Hirt, Hirta's pebbles.|$|E

5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} who owned the manor {{in what was then}} an isolated rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E
5|$|Muntz Street was readily {{accessible}} by public transport.

In 1882, <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tramline along the Coventry Road to Small Heath Park was authorised, and four years later, the Coventry Road steam tramway route was opened to a terminus near Dora Road, a few yards past the ground. In {{the early years of}} the 20th century, this line was converted for use by electric trams.|$|E
5|$|Paris–Roubaix {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} races of {{professional}} road cycling. It was first run in 1896 and has stopped only for the two world wars. The race was created by two Roubaix textile manufacturers, Théodore Vienne (born 28 July 1864) and Maurice Perez. They had been behind <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> velodrome on 46,000 square metres at the corner of the rue Verte and the route d'Hempempont, which opened on 9 June 1895.|$|E

However, he also started the rebuilding of York Minster, which had been damaged by fire in 1137, and helped with <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church at Ripon.

5|$|Since 1771, Battersea and Chelsea {{had been}} linked by the modest wooden Battersea Bridge. As London grew {{following}} {{the advent of}} the railways, Chelsea began to become congested, and in 1842 the Commission of Woods, Forests, and Land Revenues recommended the building of an embankment at Chelsea to free new land for development, and proposed <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge and the replacement of Battersea Bridge with a more modern structure.|$|E
5|$|The Abercromby baronets owned a {{significant}} amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century. By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House, which was sited {{on the other side of}} the River Deveron. Lady Jane Abercromby's son, Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, continued to enhance the grandeur of the estate policies by commissioning <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new mansion and several other buildings.|$|E

5|$|The Conservators {{applied for}} a second act of {{parliament}} in 1707, as they needed a further £3,800 to finance projects including <b>the</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> half-lock {{and the removal of}} a shoal just below Knapp Bridge. Boats carrying 15tons of cargo could reach Taunton by 1717. The navigation included a lock and two or more half-locks, consisting of a pair of gates to hold back the water, and an agreement to build a towpath between Ham Mills and Taunton was reached in 1724.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>building</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church {{dedicated}} to Saint George during the 6th century CE indicates that {{by this time}} Jifna, now under Byzantine rule, had become a Christian town.

5|$|The {{effort to}} {{construct}} a hill passenger railway system throughout the mountainous regions of India commenced in 1878 with the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway project.

By 1881, the line was completed up to Darjeeling.|$|E
