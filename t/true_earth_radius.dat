40|$|Applying {{survival}} function analysis {{to the planet}} radius distribution from the Kepler sample, we have identified two natural divisions of planet <b>radius</b> at 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> and 10 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii.</b> These divisions place constraints on planet formation and interior structure model. The division at 4 R separates small exoplanets from the ones above. When combined with the recently-discovered radius gap at 2 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii,</b> it supports the treatment of planets 2 - 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> as a separate group, likely water worlds. Thus, for planets around solar-type FGK main-sequence stars, we argue that 2 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> is the separation between water-poor and water-rich planets, and 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> is the separation between gas-poor and gas-rich planets, and we propose the following classification scheme: ( 10 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii)</b> gas giants.

40|$|We {{study the}} masses and radii of 65 exoplanets smaller than 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> with orbital periods shorter than 100 days. We {{calculate}} the weighted mean densities of planets in bins of 0. 5 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> and identify a density maximum of 7. 6 g/cc at 1. 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii.</b> Planets with radii up to R = 1. 5 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> increase in density with increasing radius. Above 1. 5 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii,</b> planet density rapidly decreases with increasing radius, indicating that these planets {{have a large}} fraction of volatiles by volume overlying a rocky core. Including the solar system terrestrial planets with the exoplanets below 1. 5 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii,</b> we find ρ = 2. 43 + 3. 39 (R/R_E) g cm^- 3 for R < 1. 5 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii,</b> {{which is consistent with}} rocky compositions. For exoplanets between 1. 5 and 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii,</b> we find M/M_E = 2. 69 (R/R_E) ^ 0. 93. The RMS of planet masses to the fit between 1. 5 and 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> is 4. 3 M_E with reduced χ^ 2 = 6. 2. The large scatter indicates a diversity in planet composition at a given radius. The compositional diversity can be due to planets of a given volume (as determined by their large H/He envelopes) containing rocky cores of different masses or compositions.

40|$|On 1 February 2011 the Kepler Mission {{released}} {{data for}} 156, 453 stars observed {{from the beginning}} of the science observations on 2 May through 16 September 2009. There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class-sizes; 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (radius < 1. 25 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii),</b> 288 super-Earth size (1. 25 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> < <b>radius</b> < 2 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii),</b> 662 Neptune-size (2 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> < <b>radius</b> < 6 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii),</b> 165 Jupiter-size (6 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> < <b>radius</b> < 15 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii),</b> and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> < <b>radius</b> < 22 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii).</b> In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Five are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74 % of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 6 % for Earth-size candidates, 7 % for super-Earth size candidates, 17 % for Neptune-size candidates, and 4 % for Jupiter-size candidates. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17 % of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 33. 9 % of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems.

This inner cut-off is 0. 04 AU for rocky worlds (1 - 2 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii),</b> 0. 08 AU for water worlds (2 - 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii),</b> and 0. 4 AU for gas-rich planets (> 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii).</b> Moreover, the transitional planets (4 - 10 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii)</b> and gas giants (> 10 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii)</b> have a different statistical distribution inside 0. 4 AU which is uniform in a^(1 / 2). This difference in distribution is likely caused by {{the difference in the}} efficiency of planet migration in the inner disk, and the susceptibility to host stellar irradiation, for gas-poor ( 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii)</b> planets.

50|$|Some of the Kepler transiting planets with radii in {{the range}} 1-4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> have had their masses {{measured}} by radial-velocity or transit-timing methods.

However, between 1.5 and 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> the density decreases with increasing radius. This indicates that above 1.5 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> planets tend to have increasing amounts of volatiles and gas. Despite this general trend, {{there is a wide}} range of masses at a given radius, which could be because gas planets can have rocky cores of different masses or compositions and could also be due to photoevaporation of volatiles.Thermal evolutionary atmosphere models suggest a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth as a dividing line between rocky and gaseous planets.Excluding close-in planets that have lost their gas envelope due to stellar irradiation, studies of the metallicity of stars suggest a dividing line of 1.7 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> between rocky planets and gas dwarfs; then another dividing line at 3.9 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> between gas dwarfs and gas giants. These dividing lines are statistical trends and do not necessarily apply to specific planets because there are many other factors besides metallicity that affect planet formation, including distance from star - there may be larger rocky planets formed at larger distances.An independent reanalysis of the data suggests that there are no such dividing lines {{and that there is a}} continuum of planet formation between 1 and 4 <b>Earth</b> <b>radii</b> and no reason to expect that the amount of solid material in a protoplanetary disk determines whether super-Earths or mini-Neptunes form.
