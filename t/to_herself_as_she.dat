2500|$|Seven years later, {{after months}} of {{bullying}} by Madison Drake (Seraphina Beh) and Alexandra D'Costa (Sydney Craven), Louise (now Tilly Keeper) is pushed onto lit candles by Alexandra at her school prom, causing her to suffer burns. She is taken to hospital and Lisa arrives. Sharon is furious with Lisa's absence and that Sonia contacted her. Lisa and Sharon argue over Phil being away in Italy and leaving Louise. Louise chooses Sharon to remain whilst she is given pain relief over Lisa and Sharon tells Lisa how Louise gained her injuries. Lisa insists on caring for Louise instead of Sharon. Lisa tells Sharon that Louise wanted to live with Phil when she got a new boyfriend, which she admits was a relief. She is furious that Sharon went to Italy with Phil and Louise {{was left in the}} care of her former sister-in-law Michelle Fowler (Jenna Russell), who she never has met. Sharon gives Lisa the choice of being there or not for Louise and she opts to remain. Louise argues with Lisa over feeling abandoned and getting the blame, but opens up to Lisa, admitting she is scared. Lisa meets Louise's half-brother, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid) and Lisa criticises Ben's past behaviour towards Louise. Lisa apologises to Ben and they make amends as Phil turns up, who is unimpressed with Lisa's presence and Lisa, Sharon and Louise ask Phil to give Lisa a chance. Lisa apologises to Phil for the past mistakes regarding Louise and says that they both need to be there for her, but Phil physically throws Lisa out of the hospital, ordering her to stay away from Louise. Lisa stays with Louise at the hospital and Lisa stands up to Phil, telling him she is not going and Phil allows Lisa to visit Louise. Phil warns Lisa not to mess up. Lisa sees her therapist and lies that she has been doing fun things with Louise. Louise's best friend Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield) goes to see Louise, but Lisa says Louise has requested no visitors and Lisa tells Bex her plans for Louise if she was well. Louise is distressed when Lisa and Bex arrange for her boyfriend Travis Law-Hughes (Alex James-Phelps) to visit her. Lisa talks <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watches Louise with Phil, Sharon and Bex. Lisa takes keys to Phil's house and lets herself in, talking to and smashing photos, but cuts herself on glass. Lisa arrives distressed in the café and Sonia consoles her. The doctor gives Lisa consent to take Louise outside and Lisa tells Louise she has been discharged. Lisa plans to take Louise, going to Liverpool Street station. Phil and Sharon find Louise's room empty and the doctor reassures them of Lisa and Louise's whereabouts, although they find Louise's belongings gone. Phil is angry as the doctor explains how Louise is at a crucial stage in her recovery and the police tell Phil and Sharon what they are doing. Phil and Sharon are told Lisa switched cabs and find Lisa's flat, which is empty. Louise wakes up and Lisa lies to her that she and Phil agreed for her to be away from the square while Phil and Sharon question Lisa's capabilities. The police, Phil and Sharon discuss Lisa being traced through her cash withdrawals in Castle Point and that she has a mental health team. [...] Louise is in agony without her medication and Lisa prevents Louise from using the phone by cutting the cord. Louise figures out Lisa is off her medication. Louise's phone dies as she tries to phone the police and Lisa prevents Louise from leaving, but when Lisa allows her to go, Louise chooses to stay with and comfort Lisa when she is distressed. Bex gives Phil and Sharon information on a hotel where Lisa and Louise are at and compared to Sharon, Phil shows a lack of regard to Lisa's mental health. Phil finds Louise and she wants him to leave. Phil gains entry to their room and Lisa hits Phil over the head with a phone. Phil shouts at a struggling Lisa as Louise deteriorates and Lisa and Louise go to hospital together.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, yes; go {{and have}} it out with mamma, next best <b>to</b> Amy <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is run away--eh, Guy?' said Mr. Edmonstone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly fools--like two children!" [...] Arabella whispered <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> morosely, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> rejoined her companions, {{with whom}} she {{preserved}} a preoccupied silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks like}} a fairy world," [...] said Meg, smiling <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> stood behind the curtain, {{watching}} the dazzling sight.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{she stopped}} on the landing to recover her breath; then whispered <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went on and {{approached}} Mr. Blyth's door: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll see," [...] {{said the}} marvelling Miss Nugent <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went slowly upstairs. [...] "He's got impudence enough for forty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Fanny {{had much}} rather it were William's," [...] said Edmund, smiling at her. [...] "Poor Fanny! not allowed <b>to</b> cheat <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> wishes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Great heavens, what a language!' cried Lavinia, who {{had been}} vainly endeavouring <b>to</b> 'support' <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> 'fell' in every {{direction}} over and into the full gutters.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care--I don't care!" [...] she moaned, {{telling the}} lie aloud <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> hoped that by this means {{she would come}} to believe it.|$|R
60|$|Had {{her years}} of levity and {{indifference}} been fatal to him? was ever her question <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> knelt {{and prayed for}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "The 'am!" [...] {{repeated}} Mrs Butt softly <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gazed in perplexity {{round her}} little kitchen, [...] "did 'e order a 'am?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not bad," [...] <b>she</b> said <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> adding, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{passed into}} the {{adjoining}} park, [...] "but the other may be better, and I will have the best." ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{the whole}} band {{turned and ran}} off in the {{direction}} mentioned-- Alizay being last, as he paused just long enough to cut the bonds of Idazoo, but left her <b>to</b> disentangle <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> best could.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well done!" [...] he exclaimed; [...] "I {{always knew}} that she was a plucky girl, and it needed courage, I can tell you, <b>to</b> burn <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> has done, <b>to</b> say nothing of risking spoiling her beauty for life. No slight {{sacrifice}} for a woman." ...|$|R
60|$|Molly {{had begun}} to hum a tune <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> watched the rain. She stopped. A {{profound}} and ghastly silence brooded over the canoe.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{very clever}} young man he is!" [...] thought Susan <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> pulled the warm clothes round about her {{shoulders}} and ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said she}} <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> fixed an immediate-delivery stamp upon the letter, [...] "that ought {{to bring him}} here before lunch to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|She glowed and, suddenly, she quivered {{with the}} shock of coming <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> had fallen down from a star. There was a sound of {{rippling}} water and a shapeless mass glided {{out of the dark}} void she confronted. A voice below her feet said: ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bell put out {{her hand}} for the sketch, trying <b>to</b> bethink <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did so in what least uncivil way she could refuse the present.

60|$|And then (as Alice {{afterwards}} described it) {{all sorts}} of things happened in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: 'and very like birds they look,' Alice thought <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.|$|R
60|$|Her {{strength}} was nearly spent, but the cabman {{was on the}} watch, and, driving up to the entrance, climbed down and bundled her into the cab. The drive was all too short for her <b>to</b> compose <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> would have liked, and she met the accusatory glance of Martha with but little of her old spirit.|$|R
6000|$|Felix looked, {{disregarding}} the friendly injunction, at once. At the same moment, Muriel turned her eyes {{quickly in the}} self-same direction. Neither made the faintest sign of outer emotion; but Muriel clenched her white hands hard, till the nails dug into the palm, in her effort <b>to</b> restrain <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> murmured very low, in an agitated voice, [...] "Un vapeur, un vapeur!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Fanny {{made the}} tea. [...] "I can {{understand}} that," [...] she said <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> moved away {{to leave the}} room; [...] "I'm out of spirits myself." ...|$|E

6000|$|My command {{was again}} obeyed, and the psychic slowly came back <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did so I said, warningly, to Mrs. Cameron: [...] "Do not utter another word {{of this in}} Mrs. Harris's presence. She seems to be {{extremely}} sensitive to hypnotic influence, and I think she had better {{go out into the}} air at once." ...|$|R
