40|$|In {{the present}} work, results of gas {{velocity}} measurements with a newly developed vane anemometer (HTA - High Tem per a ture Anemometer) are compared with re sults of measurements obtained from Laser-Doppler Anemometer (LDA). The measurements {{were carried out}} at the combustion test rig of ALSTOM Combustion Services Ltd. in Derby/UK, and demonstrate the usability and accuracy of the HTA under severe conditions. The test rig was provided with a <b>triple</b> <b>register</b> low NOx coal burner firing pulverised Colombian blended coal at a constant thermal load of 30 MW. Although the environment was both very hot (up to 1350 °C) and dust laden, the vane anemometer worked with an accuracy comparable to the reference LDA measurement. Since the anemometer represents a relatively simple to use and low cost option compared with LDA, {{it is seen as}} aviable alternative for gas velocity measurements in difficult environments. The measurement results are also demonstrated to compare favourably with the results from CFD calculations of the flow in the combustion chamber of the test rig...|$|E
50|$|In 1997 {{the breed}} entered the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service {{recording}} program. In January 2006 the breed became eligible {{to compete in}} AKC Spaniel Hunt tests for official AKC titles. In July 2006 the Boykin Spaniel was eligible to earn AKC titles in AKC agility, tracking, rally obedience, and regular obedience. On January 1, 2008 the Boykin Spaniel {{became part of the}} American Kennel Club's Miscellaneous Group. In the April 2009 board meeting, the AKC voted to move the Boykin Spaniel into the Sporting Group. In December 2009 the Boykin Spaniel officially became an AKC registered breed. The American Kennel Club studbook for the Boykin Spaniel is currently open. It is proposed to remain open until January 2015. During this time period all UKC and BSS registered dogs may be dual or <b>triple</b> <b>registered</b> to include the AKC registration. Even after the studbook is closed, the AKC parent club can request that it be reopened to allow more dogs to be registered at any time to expand the gene pool. At the same time, the Boykin Spaniel Society continued to pursue its vision of the breed. However, Boykin Spaniel Society members are not prohibited from triple or dual-registering their dogs. The Boykin Spaniel Society has a Code of Ethics for members and breeders, and sponsors two National field trial events and breed rescue.|$|R
50|$|In {{his rookie}} season in the Ontario Hockey League, Corrado played in 63 games, scoring 1 goal. He {{followed}} that up by playing 67 of 68 regular season games in the following season. His offensive output more than <b>tripled</b> as he <b>registered</b> 4 goals and 30 points. He then added another goal and four assists in eight playoff games.|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} the phase- 2 upgrade of the ATLAS detector, the entire inner tracker (ITk) of ATLAS will be replaced. This {{includes}} the pixel detector and the corresponding detector control system (DCS). The current baseline is a serial powering scheme of the detector modules. Therefore a new detector control system is being developed with emphasis on the supervision of serially powered modules. Previous chips had been designed to test the radiation hardness of the technology and {{the implementation of the}} modified I 2 C as well as the implementation of the logic of the CAN protocol. This included tests with <b>triple</b> redundant <b>registers.</b> The described chip is focusing on the implementation in a serial powering scheme. It was designed for laboratory tests, aiming for the proof of principle. The concept of the DCS for ATLAS pixel after the phase- 2 upgrade is presented as well as the status of development including tests with the prototype ASIC...|$|R
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1949, Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler, working as an advisor to the Dodgers, for batting help. At Sisler's suggestion, Robinson spent hours at a batting tee, {{learning}} {{to hit the ball}} to right field. Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball, on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball. Robinson also noted that [...] "Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second". The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from [...]296 in 1948 to [...]342 in 1949. In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and <b>triples,</b> and <b>registered</b> 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game—the first All-Star Game to include black players.|$|R
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions smart objects col lecting {{and sharing}} data at {{a global scale}} via the Internet. One {{challenging}} issue is how to disseminate data to relevant consumers efficiently. This paper leverages semantic technologies, such as Linked Data, which can facilitate machine- to-machine (M 2 M) communications to build an efficient information dissemination system for semantic IoT. The system integrates Linked Data streams generated from various data collectors and disseminates matched data to relevant data consumers based on conjunctive <b>triple</b> pattern queries <b>registered</b> in the system by the consumers. We also design a new data structure, CTP-automata, to meet the high performance needs of Linked Data dissemination. We evaluate our system using a real-world dataset generated from a Smart Building Project. With CTP-automata, the proposed system can disseminate Linked Data at a speed of {{an order of magnitude}} faster than the existing approach with thousands of registered conjunctive queries.

5|$|Barnes lingered for {{a further}} ten minutes on 96 before {{reaching}} his century with a straight drive from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours in reaching <b>triple</b> figures. Having <b>registered</b> his century and fulfilled his bet, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He stepped out of his ground to attack Laker, but missed, as did Evans, who was unable to stop the ball as it spun down the leg side. Barnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two consecutive shots over the long on boundary and two fours. Barnes was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary by Cyril Washbrook from the bowling of Yardley. He struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings and the speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 2/296 in 277 minutes after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the hat-trick ball. He survived a loud lbw appeal to deny Yardley his hat-trick; Australia consolidated and eventually declared at 7/460 on the fourth day.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (TDES) {{algorithm}} {{and their}} efficient hardware implementation in cyclone II Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is analyzed {{with the help}} of Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) concept. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) has been the most extensively used encryption algorithm in recent times. Triple DES is the common name for the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA or Triple DEA) block cipher, which applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher algorithm three times to each data block.

40|$|DES and Triple-DES with {{improved}} security against power analysis attacks. This is programmed in verilog. DES & TDES is basically used in various cryptographic applications and wireless protocol security layers. The proposed designs use Boolean masking, a previously introduced technique to protect smart card implementations from these attacks. Triple DES {{was the answer}} {{to many of the}} shortcomings of DES. Since {{it is based on the}} DES algorithm, it is very easy to modify existing software to use Triple DES. It also has the advantage of proven reliability and a longer key length that eliminates many of the shortcut attacks that can be used to reduce the amount of time it takes to break DES. However, even this more powerful version of DES may not be strong enough to protect data for very much longer. The DES algorithm itself has become obsolete and is in need of replacement. DES encrypts data in 64 -bit and it is a symmetric algorithm. The key length is 56 -bits. This paper covers DES and Triple DES algorithm with Cipher Block concept, simulation results, basic FPGA technology and the implementation details of the proposed DES and <b>Triple</b> DES architecture. <b>Register</b> transfer level (RTL) of DES and Triple DES algorithm is designed, simulated and implemented separately using Verilog in different FPGA devices including Cyclone II, Spartan 3, Vertex 5 and Vertex E series FPGAs.

40|$|Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) {{has gained}} {{momentum}} in connecting everyday {{objects to the}} Internet and facilitating machine-to-human and machine-to-machine communication with the physical world. IoT offers the capability to connect and integrate both digital and physical entities, enabling a whole new class of applications and services. This thesis firstly reviews the state-of-the-art research efforts in IoT from datacentric perspectives, including data stream processing, data storage models, complex event processing, and searching in IoT by identifying an IoT data taxonomy, which includes ten key data elements of IoT data under three categorizations. In this thesis, we focus ourselves on three aspects of data management in IoT: data dynamics, data velocity, and data incompleteness. More specifically, we study data dynamics in dynamic graphs, handle data velocity in streams, and tackle data incompleteness via sharing. In IoT, connections and relations between things are universal and highly dynamic. It is natural to model these connections and relations using dynamic graphs. Meanwhile, shortest path computation {{is one of the}} most fundamental operations for managing and analyzing graphs. In this thesis, we focus on the problem of computing the shortest path distance in graphs subject to edge failures. We propose SIEF, a Supplemental Index for Edge Failures in a dynamic graph, which is based on distance labeling, to support distance queries in dynamic graphs with edge failures efficiently. In IoT, one challenging issue is how to disseminate streaming data to relevant consumers efficiently. Semantic technologies aim to facilitate machine-to-machine (M 2 M) communication and are attracting more and more interest from both academia and industry, especially in the emerging IoT. This thesis leverages semantic technologies, such as Linked Data, which can facilitate M 2 M communications to build an efficient information dissemination system for semantic IoT. The system integrates Linked Data streams generated from various data collectors and disseminates matched data to relevant data consumers based on <b>triple</b> pattern queries <b>registered</b> in the system by the consumers. We also design new data structures, TP-automata and CTP-automata, to meet the high performance needs of Linked Data dissemination. To tackle data incompleteness, we consider large-scale information sharing scenarios among mobile objects in IoT. By leveraging semantic techniques, we propose broadcasting Linked Data on-air to allow simultaneous access to the information and to achieve better scalability. We introduce a novel air indexing method to reduce the information access latency and energy consumption. We also study the data placement problem of periodic XML data broadcast in IoT environments to facilitate data sharing in IoT. Taking advantage of the structured characteristics of XML data, we present a theoretical analysis on the XML data placement on a wireless channel, which forms the basis of our novel data placement algorithm. This thesis also discusses on-going and emerging IoT applications, and open research issues for processing and managing IoT data. Several representative domains where IoT can make profound changes are explored, and some key directions for future research and development from a data-centric perspective are identified.
