50|$|The Z1 {{featured}} full instrumentation and {{an electric}} start, produced 82 bhp {{and had a}} maximum speed of 130 mph to 132 mph(210 km/hr). It met with positive reviews from the motorcycle press, who praised its smoothness, damped vibration, easy-starting (kick-start and electric were both available), straight-line stability and linear acceleration. Steering was accurate and the bike handled well, but testers said the rear <b>tire,</b> <b>chain</b> and rear shocks all wore out quickly.|$|E
40|$|The motion {{resistance}} ratio, gross traction {{ratio and}} net traction ratio of a wheel cable skidder were determined and mathematical models derived for three tire inflation pressure values {{with or without}} <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> on forest road in mountainous conditions. The motion resistance ratio increases {{with the increase of}} tire inflation pressure. On the contrary, the gross traction ratio increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure. However, when the tires are equipped with <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> the skidder motion resistance is higher. The motion resistance ratio with <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> also increases with the decrease of tire inflation pressure due to windage between the <b>tires</b> and <b>chains,</b> which results in lower tractive performance of <b>tire</b> <b>chains.</b> Therefore, by using <b>tire</b> <b>chains,</b> an increase of gross tractive ratio could be achieved, as well as the increase of motion resistance ratio compared to <b>tires</b> without <b>chains.</b> The results of the study show that it is strongly recommended to use <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> as tightly as possible...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{tractive}} {{performance of}} a new tire, a worn tire, and a worn tire with forestry <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> was measured in four soil types. Two of the soil types simulated forest-floor conditions with one soil type having a surface cover of pine straw and the other having a surface cover of sod. The two remaining soil types were bare. The worn tire with and without chains had higher net traction than the new tire. Tractive efficiency was highest for the worn <b>tire</b> without <b>chains</b> in all soil types...|$|R
50|$|All {{prefecture}}s of Japan, {{except for}} the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa, require the motorized vehicles to be fitted with winter <b>tires</b> or <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> if the road is icy or slushy. If tread grooves of snow tires are worn off for more than 50% of its original depth, tires must be replaced to meet the legal requirements. Drivers will be fined for failing {{to comply with the}} snow <b>tire</b> or <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> requirements. Nationwide studded tire restrictions for passenger vehicles came in effect in April 1991, followed by restrictions for commercial trucks in 1993. Studded tires are technically still legal in Japan, but the usage is restricted by environmental law and it is a criminal offence to operate a vehicle fitted with studded tire on dry asphalt or concrete.|$|R

50|$|Alternatives include studded tires {{which are}} snow tires with metal studs {{individually}} mounted into {{holes in the}} treads, and emergency traction devices which may be similar to <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> but mount around the tire through openings in the rim and snow socks which are fabric rather than chain or cable. These allow higher operating speeds and don't require the operator to install them (studs), but chains generally give the best traction in severe conditions.|$|R

50|$|Most <b>tire</b> <b>chains</b> are {{wrapped around}} the {{circumference}} of the tires and held in place with rim chains, which may be chain or cable, elastic or adjustable tensioners.
