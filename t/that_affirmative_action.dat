5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> {{in the form}} of racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E

25|$|Connerly's {{opposition}} {{to affirmative action}} has generated both opposition and support. Connerly believes affirmative action {{is a form of}} racism and that people can achieve success without preferential treatment in college enrollment or in employment. He thinks that selective affirmative action discriminates against minorities such as Asian Indians and South East Asians, as some of their people have experienced discrimination in the past, but they do not receive the benefits of race-based admissions. Critics contend Connerly fails to recognize the damaging extent of past racism for African Americans and Hispanics, that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> can overcome the residual effects of past discrimination on people of color.|$|E
500|$|Silber and Nesmith, {{who felt}} <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> would lower {{academic}} hiring standards, triggered strife among {{students and faculty}} (including then-dean of students Nancy Richardson) at the School of Theology. Their opponents believed <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> helped increase equality in a system developed by white men. Richardson advocated affirmative action to Nesmith, arguing {{that it would not}} lower academic standards and the school's administration should reexamine its assumptions about race, women and minorities. Richardson was fired in 1981, with Nesmith attributing her termination to [...] "pedagogical and ideological differences" [...] with the administration. Richardson sued, claiming discrimination by Boston University.

30|$|Of course, one {{solution}} to the above problem would be to include more treated states. However, most states <b>that</b> banned <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> have done so too recently to be contained in our data 13. Two states <b>that</b> banned <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> during the period for which we have data are Texas and Florida; however, each introduced top x % plans in which the top x % of students within a high school were guaranteed admission to an in-state public university 14. Louisiana and Mississippi were both affected by the court ruling <b>that</b> ended <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in Texas, but both states were under desegregation orders, so {{they may not have}} been under pressure to comply with the ruling 15. In addition, neither state’s public universities are as selective as the institutions typically affected by bans on racial preferences (see Blume and Long (2014)). Of the <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> banning states, the sole remainder is Washington, which voted to ban <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> in 1999. In principle, Washington could be included with our analysis; however, using two policy change states instead of one would still be insufficient for classical estimation of standard errors 16. Finally, there are several advantages to using California. First, it is a large state with a significant URM population. In addition, it has been well-established that the more selective UC schools practiced significant race-based <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> prior to Prop 209, and finally, the measurement of how admissions rules changed at the UC after Prop 209 has been documented by Antonovics and Backes (2014).|$|R

[...] The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.|$|E

In West Bengal, literacy rates were found to be low even after fulfilling the 73rd amendment from 1992. The amendment established <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> by allotting 33% of seats at panchayats, or local self-governments, to women.

2500|$|After his {{appointment}} to the University of California board of regents in 1993, Connerly began {{to learn more about}} the workings of its affirmative action program. In 1994, he heard from Jerry and Ellan Cook, whose son had been rejected at the University of California, San Francisco (UC) Medical School. [...] Connerly became convinced <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action,</b> as practiced by the UC, was another kind of racial discrimination. Cook, a statistician, had presented data showing that white and Asian students were being denied admission despite having better grades and test scores than other students who were being admitted. Connerly proposed abolishing the controversial racially based programs, while allowing the university to consider social or economic factors. The regents passed the proposal in January 1996 despite protests from activist Jesse Jackson and other supporters of affirmative action. The year after affirmative action was abolished, the number of Asian students admitted to UC increased markedly.|$|E
2500|$|The Court's {{majority}} ruling, {{authored by}} Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, {{held that the}} United States Constitution [...] "does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body." [...] The Court held that the law school's interest in obtaining a [...] "critical mass" [...] of minority students was indeed a [...] "tailored use". O'Connor noted that sometime in the future, perhaps twenty-five years hence, racial affirmative action {{would no longer be}} necessary in order to promote diversity. It implied <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> should not be allowed permanent status and that eventually a [...] "colorblind" [...] policy should be implemented. The opinion read, [...] "race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time." [...] "The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today." [...] The phrase [...] "25 years from now" [...] was echoed by Justice Thomas in his dissent. Justice Thomas, writing that the system was [...] "illegal now", concurred with the majority only on the point that he agreed the system would still be illegal 25 years hence.|$|E

The main results are <b>that</b> banning <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> increases the black-white test score gap and decreases college enrollment and social welfare of the minority group. <b>Affirmative</b> <b>Action,</b> Discrimination, Public Policy, Education, Asymmetric Information...|$|R

50|$|Opponents {{of affirmative}} action such as George Sher believe <b>that</b> <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> devalues the accomplishments {{of people who are}} chosen based on the social group to which they belong rather than their qualifications, thus {{rendering}} affirmative action counterproductive.

30|$|Economic theory {{suggests}} <b>that</b> eliminating <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> could {{have important implications}} for human capital accumulation.

First, the removal of racial preferences directly affects admissions probabilities, which in turn affects the return to studying prior to college application. Second, banning <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> could lead underrepresented minorities to feel institutionally discouraged from attending college, and they could respond by putting forth less effort in preparing for postsecondary education. Finally, if colleges react to bans on <b>affirmative</b> <b>action</b> by changing their admissions process more broadly, then this too could lead students to shift the focus of their efforts in high school.|$|R
