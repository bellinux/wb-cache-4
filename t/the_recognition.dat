5|$|A {{controversy}} exists about <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> of Peleinae and Patholopinae, {{comprising the}} genera Pelea and Pantholops respectively, as subfamilies. In 2000, American biologist George Schaller and palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba suggested {{the inclusion of}} Pelea in Reduncinae, though the grey rhebok, the sole species of Pelea, is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology. Pantholops, earlier classified in the Antilopinae, was later placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae. However, molecular and morphological analysis supports the inclusion of Pantholops in Caprinae.|$|E

5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia.

The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph.
