5|$|A team of {{scientists}} from Oxford University, the University of Vienna and the Max Planck Institute conducted tests on ten untrained Tanimbar corellas (Cacatua goffini), and found that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to solve complex mechanical puzzles.|$|E
5|$|James Palermo, {{artistic and}} general {{director}} of the Grant Park Music Festival felt that the musicians were able to interact more effectively with the new sound system because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to hear each other better.|$|E
5|$|William Tinsley Keeton (1933–1980) studied homing pigeons, {{showing that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to {{navigate}} using the earth's magnetic field, the sun, {{as well as}} both olfactory and visual cues.|$|E
2500|$|Men are {{required}} to perform the fard salat in [...] (jama'ah), behind an imam when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able.</b> According to most Islamic scholars, performing prayers in congregation is mustahabb (recommended) for men, when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able,</b> but <b>is</b> neither required nor forbidden for women.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to being able to}} break down polymers, lysosomes are capable of fusing with other organelles & digesting large structures or cellular debris; through cooperation with phagosomes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to conduct autophagy, clearing out damaged structures. Similarly, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to break-down virus particles or bacteria in phagocytosis of macrophages.|$|R

5|$|After {{the decades}} of {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution offered the Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; they held the absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to markedly alter the power structure.|$|E
5|$|Although Duke Andrew {{made every}} effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus before they could escape, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric's and Duke Andrew's cousin, was willing to give shelter to King Ladislaus, {{although}} Duke Andrew threatened him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Székesfehérvár, and buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 24 April, B Company had fought off seven assaults before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to rejoin the {{remainder}} of their battalion on {{what became known as}} Gloster Hill. By this time the battalion was vastly outnumbered, low on ammunition and cut off from United Nations lines. Large himself was shot in the left shoulder and, along with most of the remaining Glosters, was forced to surrender.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} part, the Mercedes drivers set only one run of timed laps as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> {{to save their}} tyres for the race, well clear of the competition. Lewis Hamilton was fastest, half a second ahead of Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel between the two. Romain Grosjean was {{eliminated}} after a spin at turn six. He was joined on the sidelines by both Saubers, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Sergio Pérez.|$|E
5|$|Eloe Fanouche of RAM {{focussed}} {{on another}} aspect:Unlike many groups <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> {{to capture the}} ethereal quality of their recorded sound on stage...

5|$|His staff {{searched for}} volunteers in the Unteroffiziersschulen (non-commissioned {{officers}} schools) and supplementary units. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> {{to bring together}} roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E
50|$|Together with Betaproteobacteria such as Thiomonas intermedia, Halothiobacillus species play an {{important}} role in global carbon and sulfur cycles. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to depend entirely on inorganic compounds (CO2 and reduced sulfur) for their carbon and energy needs. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to promote corrosion of concrete, acidification of mine tailings, and bioleaching of low-grade ores.|$|R
50|$|Research {{has found}} that manatee vibrissae are so {{sensitive}} that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to perform active touch discrimination of textures. Manatees also use their vibrissae to navigate the turbid waterways of their environment. Research has indicated that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to use these vibrissae to detect hydrodynamic stimuli {{in the same way}} that fish use their lateral line system.|$|R
50|$|Practitioners eat {{in silence}} so <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to meditate on how their food is grown {{in nature and}} by the Creator.

5|$|In June 1970, the Dubna {{team made}} {{improvements}} on their original experiment, providing a purer target {{and reducing the}} intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to find 9.1MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes identifiable as either 256103 or 257103; thus, the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{soon learned}} that no ship was likely to call at Godthaab until the {{following}} spring, though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving Ivigtut {{at the end of}} October.

5|$|Sucker Punch made {{suggested}} improvements {{they would}} like to see for the DualShock 4 gamepad. Second Sons designer Jaime Griesemer traveled to Sony's headquarters in Japan to discuss such improvements. The developers found <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to adopt the DualShock 4's touchpad into Second Sons gameplay (for example, players emulate the in-game fingerprint scanner using the DualShock 4 touchpad).|$|E
50|$|Research {{has also}} {{examined}} whether non-human primates <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to conserve. Chimpanzees <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to make judgements on whether two quantities of liquid {{are the same}} or different, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to conserve correctly when liquids are transformed based on inferences. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> to correctly conserve for solid quantities, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not <b>able</b> to complete conservation of number tasks. Orangutans <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to differentiate between same and different quantities of liquid but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only <b>able</b> to pseudoconserve, similar to children in {{the second stage of}} conservation development, and ultimately fail to correctly complete conservation of liquid tasks (see Age of conservation ability).|$|R

5|$|The Byzantines {{wasted no}} time {{exploiting}} the situation and signed a peace treaty with their Christian neighbours and with one of Bayezid's sons. By signing the treaty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to recover Thessalonika {{and much of the}} Peloponnese. The Ottoman civil war ended in 1413 when Mehmed I, {{with the support of the}} Byzantine Empire, defeated his opponents.|$|E
5|$|The Paleo-Indians {{that survived}} are {{now known as}} the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the {{extinction}} of most big game and were primarily hunter-gatherers who depended on smaller game and fish. They relied on plants for food more than their ancestors. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to adapt to the shifting climate and the resulting change of animal and plant populations.|$|E
5|$|The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) {{daylight}} bombing offensive over Europe commenced in January 1943. It {{was having}} an increasing impact. By July, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to reach deep into Germany and demanded more and more attention from the Luftwaffe.

5|$|The {{process of}} using the 256 {{graphics}} tiles on the NES was handled with special programming techniques. The team streamlined the process by dividing the number of tiles into two groups of 128 and separating them into enemy characters and protagonists. By further dividing the tiles into four groups of 64, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to reduce graphical processing and switch out tilesets to use as background cogs and floor animations.|$|E
