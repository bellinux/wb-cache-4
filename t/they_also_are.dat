5|$|A line of rats with {{hereditary}} kidney cancer {{were developed}} by Japanese researchers. They have a mutation in the FLCN homolog that produces a truncated protein, though they do not develop the cutaneous or pulmonary symptoms seen in humans. Heterozygotes have renal abnormalities seen very early in life that develop into clear cell and hybrid tumors, significantly shortening the animals' lifespan; <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> prone to endometrial and salivary gland clear cell hyperplasia as well as rhabdomyolysis. Homozygotes do not survive to birth. When a wild-type FLCN gene was added, the phenotype was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen {{quite often}} in {{cartoons}} whenever a scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jabberjaw, and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.|$|E

5|$|Silkies {{appear in}} two {{distinct}} varieties: bearded and non-bearded. Bearded Silkies {{have an extra}} muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, buff, grey, partridge, and white. Alternative hues, such as cuckoo, lavender, red, and splash also exist. The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to have a small walnut-colored comb, dark wattles, and turquoise-blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on each foot. Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking, Faverolles, and Sultan.|$|E
5|$|Two {{antennae}} ("feelers") {{are attached}} to the head; these organs detect chemicals, air currents, and vibrations; <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence. In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.|$|E
5|$|Under federal law, private-party sellers are not {{required}} to perform background checks on buyers, whether at a gun show or other venue. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> {{not required}} to record the sale, or ask for identification. This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform background checks on almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E

5|$|Anthropomorphised ants {{have often}} been used in fables and children's stories to {{represent}} industriousness and cooperative effort. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> mentioned in religious texts. In the Book of Proverbs in the Bible, ants are held up as a good example for humans for their hard work and cooperation. Aesop did the same in his fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. In the Quran, Sulayman {{is said to have}} heard and understood an ant warning other ants to return home to avoid being accidentally crushed by Sulayman and his marching army. In parts of Africa, ants are considered to be the messengers of the deities. Some Native American mythology, such as the Hopi mythology, considers ants as the very first animals. Ant bites are often said to have curative properties. The sting of some species of Pseudomyrmex is claimed to give fever relief. Ant bites are used in the initiation ceremonies of some Amazon Indian cultures as a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are solely responsible for their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of executives in the legislative process.|$|E
5|$|The robin uses auditory, visual, {{olfactory}} {{and possibly}} vibrotactile cues to ﬁnd prey, but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection. It is frequently seen running across lawns picking up earthworms, and its running and stopping behavior is a distinguishing characteristic. In addition to hunting visually, {{it also has}} the ability to hunt by hearing. Experiments have discovered that it can find worms underground by simply using its listening skills. It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left, right or forward to detect movement of its prey. In urban areas, robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where sprinklers are in use. <b>They</b> <b>also</b> <b>are</b> attracted to freshly turned earth in gardens, where worms and grubs are abundant targets. Occasionally, they may visit bird feeders if mealworms or animal-fat suet is offered.|$|E
