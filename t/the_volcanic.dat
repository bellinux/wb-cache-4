5|$|Currently the Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field is}} not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field's magma system is. The existing network of seismographs {{has been established}} to monitor tectonic earthquakes and is {{too far away to}} provide a good indication of what is happening beneath <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field. It may sense an increase in activity if <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field becomes very restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption. It might detect activity only after <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field has started erupting.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behaviour, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this would likely be abandoned in part because of <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field's remoteness.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>volcanic</b> {{origin of}} the ash is {{evidenced}} by its distinctive mineralogy–the ash was deposited directly upon the water, so its angular quartz grains differ from the clastic sediments rounded through the erosion process that carries them to the sea. As <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash settled to the bottom, it was admixed with these terrigenous components, producing a distinctive lithology in the sedimentary rock.|$|E
500|$|The {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate and Antarctic Plate {{beneath the}} South America Plate {{is responsible for}} the formation of <b>the</b> Andean <b>Volcanic</b> Belt. This volcanic belt is subdivided into <b>the</b> Northern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone and <b>the</b> Austral <b>Volcanic</b> Zone. <b>The</b> Austral <b>Volcanic</b> Zone features six Quaternary volcanoes and is [...] long. It is separated from <b>the</b> Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone by <b>the</b> Patagonian <b>volcanic</b> gap, where arc volcanism ceased 12 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The {{subduction}} of the Nazca Plate {{beneath the}} South American Plate in the Peru-Chile Trench leads to <b>volcanic</b> activity in <b>the</b> Andes. This <b>volcanic</b> activity presently occurs in three segments, <b>the</b> Northern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone and <b>the</b> Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone. There {{is an additional}} volcanic belt south of <b>the</b> Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Austral <b>Volcanic</b> Zone. Sabancaya is located in <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone of <b>the</b> Andes, which extends through southern Peru. Many volcanoes in <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone are poorly known, owing to their remote locations and adverse conditions such as high altitude.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Andean <b>Volcanic</b> Belt is {{typically}} subdivided into four sectors, <b>the</b> Northern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone and two southern Volcanic Zones. In Bolivia's Altiplano, volcanic activity commenced 26,000,000 {{years ago as}} part of <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone. Approximately 44 <b>volcanic</b> centres in <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone show evidence of post-glacial activity.|$|R
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes {{that the}} events in Völuspá {{occurring}} {{after the death of}} the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions on Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in Völuspá, especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions, and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr's name occurs in some Icelandic place names, among them the lava tube caves Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> central region of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Laguna del Maule is a {{volcanic}} {{field in the}} Andes mountain range of Chile, close to, and partly overlapping, the Chile-Argentina frontier. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field is in the Talca province of Chile's Maule Region. It is {{a segment of the}} Southern Volcanic Zone, part of the Andean Volcanic Belt. Many of <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during postglacial times, after glaciers had retreated from the area. This activity has generated cones, lava domes, lava coulees and lava flows which surround Laguna del Maule lake. The field gets its name from the lake which is also the source of the Maule river. Some of <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> centres were active during and before the last glaciation; at least three caldera formation events are associated with the system.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} events elsewhere {{interacted with}} groundwater and magma creating numerous pit craters. Many of these pit craters {{have been filled}} with water creating several crater lakes. In some places glacial till and fluvial sands and gravels are maintained under the several lava flows that form <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field. Paleosols are found, but are rare. Glaciation has left a thick blanket of till over nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> deposits and therefore outcrop is largely limited to cliffforming exposures in several valleys.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the Andes {{occurs in}} four {{distinct}} regions: <b>the</b> Northern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, and <b>the</b> Austral <b>Volcanic</b> Zone. All {{but the last}} are geographically associated with the subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate; <b>the</b> Austral <b>Volcanic</b> Zone involves <b>the</b> subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South American Plate.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>volcanics</b> on Ellesmere Island {{has been}} uncertainly {{associated}} to both <b>the</b> early <b>volcanic</b> activity of <b>the</b> Iceland hotspot and the Alpha Ridge. <b>The</b> Ellesmere Island <b>Volcanics</b> {{are part of}} the High Arctic Large Igneous Province.|$|R
50|$|La Pacana {{is part of}} <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, one of <b>the</b> four <b>volcanic</b> zones {{that make}} up <b>the</b> Andean <b>Volcanic</b> Belt and which are {{separated}} from each other by gaps without ongoing volcanic activity. A number of stratovolcanoes and ignimbrite-forming centres have erupted in <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone since <b>the</b> Miocene, about 50 of which {{are considered to be}} active. In addition, <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone features about 18 minor <b>volcanic</b> fields. <b>The</b> largest historical eruption of the Andes occurred in 1600 at Huaynaputina in Peru in <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, and most active volcano of <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone is Láscar in Chile.|$|R
5|$|The {{composition}} of Lastarria's gases {{has changed over}} time, {{with an increase in}} the magmatic component between 2009 and 2012, which may be due either to different measurement methods or to changes in <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> activity at Lastarria.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no reports}} of {{historical}} activity. A small geothermal field is associated with <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> complex, consisting of fumaroles, mud volcanoes and thermal anomalies.|$|E
5|$|Above these ignimbrites {{are found}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Esk Pike Sandstone Formation. These were deposited in water, probably in a caldera lake, as <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> rocks weathered and were eroded. Structures in these rocks suggest the faults were still active and the caldera was still subsiding. Layers of tuff and lapilli-tuff indicate some ongoing volcanism.|$|E
5|$|La Reforma {{is one of}} 11 {{volcanic}} centres in Baja California. In {{addition to}} La Reforma-Tres Virgenes, the other centres are Cerro Prieto, El Pinacate, <b>the</b> San Quintin <b>volcanic</b> field, <b>the</b> Puertecitos <b>volcanic</b> province, San Luis Island, <b>the</b> Jaraguay <b>volcanic</b> field, <b>the</b> San Borja <b>volcanic</b> field, Punta Púlpito, <b>the</b> Mencenares <b>volcanic</b> complex and La Purísima.|$|R
5|$|The Andes are {{a site of}} {{volcanic}} activity, which is usually subdivided into four separate <b>volcanic</b> zones: <b>the</b> Northern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone, <b>the</b> Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zone and <b>the</b> Austral <b>Volcanic</b> Zone. These volcanic zones are separated by gaps where no recent volcanic activity has occurred. These gaps are not static; the gap separating the Austral and <b>the</b> Southern <b>Volcanic</b> Zones has been moving northward for the past 15-20 million years.|$|R

5|$|Between 2004 and 2007, ground {{inflation}} {{began in}} <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> field, indicating {{the intrusion of}} a sill beneath it. The rate of inflation is faster than those measured on other inflating volcanoes such as Uturunku in Bolivia and Yellowstone in the United States and {{has been accompanied by}} anomalies in soil gas emission and seismic activity. This pattern has created concern about the potential for impending large-scale eruptive activity.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Mentolat has been ongoing since the Pleistocene, with the earliest explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago. An eruption {{during the late}} Glacial formed the MENo tephra. <b>The</b> <b>volcanic</b> activity has been inferred from tephra layers in lakes and outcrops.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Minoan eruption, {{the walls of the}} caldera formed a nearly {{continuous}} ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and the tiny island of Aspronisi. This cataclysmic eruption was centered on a small island just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the then-existing caldera. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by <b>the</b> <b>volcanic</b> ash and lava, then collapsed again.|$|E
50|$|Kari-Kari is a Miocene caldera in the Potosi department, Bolivia. It {{is part of}} the El Fraile {{ignimbrite}} {{field of}} <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone of <b>the</b> Andes. <b>Volcanic</b> activity in <b>the</b> Central <b>Volcanic</b> Zone has generated 44 volcanic centres with postglacial activity and a number of calderas, including <b>the</b> Altiplano-Puna <b>volcanic</b> complex.|$|R
