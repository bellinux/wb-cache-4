5|$|XXI Bomber Command {{arrived on}} Saipan on October 12, 1944, {{and from the}} start Hansell was beset {{by a host of}} serious command problems, the worst of which were {{continued}} teething problems with the B-29, tardy delivery of aircraft, aircrews untrained in high altitude formation flying, primitive airfield conditions, lack of an air service command for logistical support, no repair depots, a total absence of <b>target</b> <b>intelligence,</b> stubborn internal resistance to daylight operations by his sole combat wing, subordinates in the XXI Bomber Command who lobbied for his removal, and Hansell’s inferiority in rank in dealing with other AAF commanders in the theater. Furthermore, Hansell was soon prohibited from flying combat missions with his command, possibly because of limited knowledge of the atomic bomb or the perception that he knew the existence of Ultra.|$|E

500|$|Landing on {{the eastern}} flank No. 3 Commando would assault the Goebbels {{artillery}} battery, while No. 4 Commando {{would be responsible for}} the Hess battery on the western flank. The Hess battery consisted of six [...] guns in a concrete emplacement [...] inland from the coastal cliffs. The emplacement was surrounded by two rows of barbed wire, and protected by several machine gun posts. A nearby anti-aircraft tower could also defend against a ground attack on the guns. The commandos were responsible for their own planning and selected two landing beaches codenamed Orange one and two. Orange One at Varengeville was overlooked by a chalk cliff but had two gullies leading {{to the top of the}} cliff. Before the war there were steps down to the beach. But these had been removed and the gullies filled with barbed wire and other obstacles. The second beach Orange Two was at Quiberville [...] further west at the mouth of the River Saane. This offered access to the top of the cliffs but was covered by two machine gun pillboxes and barbed wire and it was further away from their <b>target.</b> <b>Intelligence</b> had estimated that the strength of the battery was between 120–175 men, supported by two infantry companies stationed nearby.|$|E

This was the heaviest shore bombardment since the Korean War. Firing without air spotting, the battleship {{had to rely on}} Israeli <b>target</b> <b>intelligence.</b> [...] "In a nine-hour period, the USS New Jersey fired 288 16-inch rounds, each one weighing as much as a Volkswagen Beetle. In those nine-hours, the ship consumed 40 percent of the 16-inch ammunition available in the entire European theater... in one burst of wretched excess," [...] New Jersey seemed to be unleashing eighteen months of repressed fury.|$|E

TICOM (<b>Target</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Committee), the United States effort to capture German {{intelligence}} assets after the war, found that captured documents provided little information on {{the execution of the}} unit, with the records of the Mathematical and Cryptological section having been destroyed. The field covered by Pers Z S, over 25 countries for a period of 25 years, stymied the TICOM as few interrogators were available, and they also lacked experience in cryptographic diplomatic system. This was the first TICOM investigation. Inevitably there were some areas which were not covered.|$|E
