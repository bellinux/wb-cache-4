However, the issue is often discussed in the media in terms of feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the history and {{context of the use}} of Native American names and images and why their use by sports teams should be eliminated.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix was {{controversial}} and received many negative reviews. It {{was criticized for}} Tripp's alleged bias in favor of homosexuality, dismissive treatment of psychoanalytic theories, rambling style, sexism, focus on male homosexuality and neglect of lesbianism, and failure to discuss the gay liberation movement. The book drew a negative reaction from psychoanalysts, including an ethics complaint against Tripp with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Psychological</b> Association. Tripp himself believed that it had received a negative reaction from the gay media and from some gay people. Nevertheless, it was influential and has received praise as an important work on homosexuality. Commentators have supported Tripp's view that erotic feeling depends on resistance to its satisfaction.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Redskins name {{controversy}} {{involves the}} name and logo of the Washington Redskins, a National Football League (NFL) franchise in the Washington metropolitan area. Native American individuals, tribes and organizations have been questioning the use of {{the name and}} image for decades. According to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Psychological</b> Association as of 2010, over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts have published resolutions or policies that state that the use of Native American names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a harmful form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice, contributing to other problems faced by Native Americans. The Washington, D.C., team is only one example of the larger controversy, but it receives more public attention because modern dictionaries define the name as derogatory or insulting and because the team represents the nation's capital.|$|E
