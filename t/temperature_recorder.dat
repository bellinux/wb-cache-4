The growth period, representative of 3 yr, was stained in the skeleton with a fluorochrome (calcein). Temperatures were recorded at 2 h intervals within the shallow, cryptic reef enclosure that the sclerosponge inhabited on the northern coast of Jamaica, allowing the formulation of a direct empirical relationship between Sr/Ca and temperature.

40|$|The thermal {{physiology}} of most {{birds and mammals}} is characterised by considerable spatial and temporal variation in body temperature. Body temperature is, therefore, a key parameter in physiological, behavioural and ecological research. Temperature measurements on freely moving or free-ranging animals in the wild are challenging but can be undertaken using a range of techniques. Internal temperature may be sampled using thermometry, surgically implanted loggers or transmitters, gastrointestinal or non-surgically placed devices. Less invasive approaches measure peripheral temperature with subcutaneous passive integrated transponder tags or skin surface-mounted radio transmitters and data loggers, or use infrared thermography to record surface temperature. Choice of technique is determined by focal research question and region of interest that reflects appropriate physiological or behavioural causal mechanisms of temperature change, as well as welfare and logistical considerations.

40|$|Sclerosponges {{have great}} {{potential}} as seawater <b>temperature</b> <b>recorders.</b> These animals precipitate their skeletons in carbon and oxygen isotopic equilibrium {{with the surrounding}} seawater (Druffel and Benavides, 1986). Their skeletons also display chemical properties that vary directly with changes in environmental conditions. Lack of photosynthetic symbionts allows sclerosponges to live below the photic zone, providing the potential to investigate past marine conditions beyond the range of corals. Individual sponges live for several centuries, preserving archives of pre-and postindustrial seawater variations within single specimens (Hartman and Reiswig, 1980). Cross-correlation of successively older specimens could yield up to 2000 years of marine history. Extracting environmental information {{can be accomplished by}} determining elemental characteristics preserved in skeletal growth bands. A method is presented here that utilizes energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to provide inexpensive assessment of magnesium (Mg) : calcium (Ca) and chlorine (Cl) : calcium (Ca) ratios at high spatial resolution, yielding environmental data with correspondingly high temporal resolution. The relationship between environmental conditions and skeletal characteristics is defined by a spectral transfer function, which can then be applied to skeletal carbonate data from ancient sponges to reconstruct past environmental conditions.

The hatch dates of larvae were estimated using otolith microincrement analysis. Larvae were split into 3 groups; those developing from eggs laid {{early in the season}} when temperatures were low (6. 4 to 9. 8 degreesC), those developing mid-season (8. 3 to 12. 5 degreesC), and those developing late (10. 9 to 15. 6 degreesC). The number and size distribution of red and white myotomal muscle fibres varied between larvae from early- and mid-spawners in relation to estimated age. At approximately 60 d, the cross-sectional area of white muscle in mid-season larvae was 145 % greater than in early-season larvae of an equivalent age because of 60 % more muscle fibres and a 22 % greater mean fibre diameter. The number and average diameter of red muscle fibres were proportional to body length, with no differences between the groups of larvae.

Disruption of reproductive synchronicity or reduced fecundity may adversely affect their ability to recover and repopulate degraded areas.

In order to track gametogenesis and identify the time of spawning, tissue samples from S. siderea were collected from August 2007 {{on a weekly basis}} until November, when a reduction in gametes, indicative of spawning, was observed. Estimated spawning time was compared with lunar phase as well as water temperature data obtained from permanent digital <b>temperature</b> <b>recorders</b> deployed throughout Broward County to determine if either of these environmental cues affected spawning time.
