40|$|Chemotherapy has {{provided}} a realistic approach for controlling schistosomiasis in resource-poor settings such as sub-Saharan Africa and control programmes have mainly adopted an age-targeted strategy of implementation. However, it is being increasingly argued that the setting-specific {{context in which the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> schistosome <b>infections</b> occurs may render this global approach of chemotherapy implementation inefficient.

Hence the degree of the spatial heterogeneity, that often characterises the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>infections,</b> may differ for different endemic settings depending on the extent of the interaction between these processes.
