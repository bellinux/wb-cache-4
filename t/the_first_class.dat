The second class were armed similarly to <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>class,</b> but without a breastplate for protection, and with an oblong rather than a round shield. The second class stood immediately behind <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>class</b> when the army was drawn up in battle formation. The third and fourth classes were more lightly armed and carried a thrusting-spear and javelins. The third class stood behind the second class in battle formation, normally providing javelin support. The poorest of the propertied men of the city comprised the fifth class. They were generally too poor to afford much equipment at all and were armed as skirmishers with slings and stones. They were deployed in a screen in front of the main army, covering its approach and masking its manoeuvres.|$|E

5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. <b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, <b>the</b> <b>First</b> <b>Class</b> badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank.
