40|$|Very long chain acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) {{dehydrogenase}} (VLCAD) deficiency is {{a severe}} disorder of mitochondrial beta-oxidation in infants. We report adult onset of attacks of painful rhabdomyolysis. Gas chromatography identified strongly {{elevated levels of}} <b>tetradecenoic</b> <b>acid,</b> 14 : 1 (n- 9), tetradecadienoic acid, 14 : 2 (n- 6), and hexadecadienoic acid, 16 : 2 (n- 6). Palmitoyl-CoA and behenoyl-CoA dehydrogenase in fibroblasts were deficient. Muscle VLCAD activity was very low. DNA analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations in the VLCAD gene. The relatively mild clinical course {{may be due to}} residual enzyme activity {{as a consequence of the}} two missense mutations. Treatment with L-carnitine and medium chain triglycerides in the diet did not reduce the attacks of rhabdomyolysi...|$|E
40|$|Colwellia psychrerythraea 34 H is a Gram-negative cold-adapted {{microorganism}} that adopts many {{strategies to}} cope with the limitations associated with the low temperatures of its habitat. In this study, we report the complete characterization of the lipidA moiety from the lipopolysaccharide of Colwellia. LipidA and its partially deacylated derivative were completely characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and chemical analysis. An unusual structure with a 3 -hydroxy unsaturated <b>tetradecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> as a component of the primary acylation pattern was identified. In addition, the presence of a partially acylated phosphoglycerol moiety on the secondary acylation site at the 3 -position of the reducing 2 -amino- 2 -deoxyglucopyranose unit caused tremendous natural heterogeneity in the structure of lipidA. Biological-activity assays indicated that C. psychrerythraea 34 H lipidA did not show an agonistic or antagonistic effect upon testing in human macrophages...|$|E
40|$|One yeast strain, SY 16, was {{selected}} as a potential producer of a biosurfactant, and identified as a Candida species. A biosurfactant produced from Candida sp. SY 16 was purified and confirmed to be a glycolipid. This glycolipid-type biosurfactant lowered the surface tension of water to 29 dyne/cm at critical micelle concentration of 10 mg/l (1. 5 x 10 - 5 M), and the minimum interfacial tension was 0. 1 dyne/cm against kerosene. Thin-layer and high-pressure liquid chromatography studies demonstrated that the glycolipid contained mannosylerythritol as a hydrophilic moiety. The hydrophilic sugar moiety of the biosurfactant {{was determined to be}} β-D- mannopyranosyl-(1 → 4) -O-mesoerythritol by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fast atom bombardment mass-spectroscopy analyses. The hydrophobic moiety, fatty acids, of the biosurfactant was determined to be hexanoic, dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, and <b>tetradecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The structure of the native biosurfactant was determined to be 6 -O-acetyl- 2, 3 -di-O-alkanoyl-β-D-mannopyranosyl-(1 → 4) -O-meso-erythritol by NMR analyses. We newly determined that an acetyl group was linked to the C- 6 position of the D-mannose unit in the hydrophilic sugar moiety. ope...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{derivatization}} procedure for the simultaneous gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of {{free fatty acids}} and 3 -hydroxyfatty acids in plasma. Derivatization of target compounds involved trifluoroacetylation of hydroxyl groups and tert-butyldimethylsilylation of the carboxyl groups. This new derivatization procedure {{had the advantage of}} allowing the complete baseline separation of free fatty acids and 3 -hydroxyfatty acids while the superior gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric properties of tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives remained unchanged, permitting a sensitive analysis of the target compounds. Thirty-nine plasma samples from control subjects and patients with known defects of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation were analyzed. A characteristic increase of long-chain 3 -hydroxyfatty acids was observed for all of the long-chain 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase-deficient and mitochondrial trifunctional protein-deficient plasma samples. For medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, decenoic and <b>tetradecenoic</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively, were the main abnormal fatty acids, whereas the multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase-deficient patients showed variable increases of these unusual intermediates. The results showed that this selective and sensitive method is a powerful tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation disorder...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the capsaicinoids content and the volatile compounds of fresh hot pepper from Burundi at red stage. The Capsaicinoids were extracted in acetone and separated using column chromatography on silica gel, then evaluated quantitatively using a reverse phase High performance liquid chromatography/Photodiode array detection (RP-HPLC/PAD). The volatile compounds were extracted by hydrodistillation and then re-extracted and concentrated by SPME fiber at 55 ºC for 30 min and analyzed using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Seventy volatile compounds were identified, of which aliphatic esters, alcohols, terpenoids and acids were the main classes. Hexyl pentanoate, hexyl isopentanoate, Pentyl 3 - methylbutanoate, 10 - undecenol, 3, 3 - dimethyl cyclohexanol, β-chamigrene, Pentadecanoic acid, (E) - 9 - <b>tetradecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> and Hexadecanoic acid were found to be the major volatile constituents. Capsaicin (CAPS) 47. 632 mg/g and dihydrocapsaicin (DHCAPS) 23. 096 mg/g were the major capsaicinoids and their contents converted in Scoville heat value (142931) show that the Scotch Bonnet variety is a high hot chili pepper according to the Scoville scale...|$|E
40|$|E. D. B. and M. I. contributed {{equally to}} this article. ABSTRACT Cell-cell {{signaling}} in Xylella fastidiosa has {{been implicated in}} the coordination of traits enabling colonization in plant hosts as well as insect vectors. This cell density-dependent signaling {{has been attributed to}} a diffusible signaling factor (DSF) produced by the DSF synthase RpfF. DSF produced by related bacterial species are unsaturated fatty acids, but that of X. fastid-iosawas thought to be different from those of other taxa. We describe here the isolation and characterization of an X. fastidiosa DSF (XfDSF) as 2 (Z) -tetradecenoic acid. This compound was isolated both from recombinant Erwinia herbicola expressing X. fastidiosa rpfF and from an X. fastidiosa rpfC deletion mutant that overproduces DSF. Since an rpfFmutant is impaired in biofilm formation and underexpresses the hemagglutinin-like protein-encoding genes hxfA and hxfB, we demonstrate that these traits can be restored by ca. 0. 5 M XfDSF but not by myristic acid, the fully saturated <b>tetradecenoic</b> <b>acid.</b> A phoA-based X. fasti-diosa biosensor that assesses DSF-dependent expression of hxfA or hxfB revealed a high level of molecular specificity of DSF sig-naling. IMPORTANCE X. fastidiosa causes diseases in many important plants, including grape, where it incites Pierce’s disease. Virulence of X. fastidiosa for grape is coordinated by cell-cell signaling molecules, designated DSF (Diffusible Signaling Factor). Mutants blocked in DSF production are hypervirulent for grape, suggesting that virulence is suppressed upon DSF accumulation and that disease could be controlled by artificial elevation of the DSF level in plants. In this work, we describe the isolation of the DS...|$|E
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{fatty acid}} compositions of 368 strains of Campylobacter species or Campylobacter-like organisms {{were determined by}} gas-liquid chromatography. Most of the strains (339) were placed {{in one of three}} groups based on differences in fatty acid profiles. Group A contained Campylobacter jejuni (97 %) and most C. coli (83 %) strains and was characterized by the presence of a 19 -carbon cyclopropane fatty acid (19 : 0 cyc) and 3 -hydroxytetradecanoic acid (3 -OH- 14 : 0). Group B included all C. laridis and some C. coli (17 %) strains; its profile was similar to that of group A, except that 19 : 0 cyc was absent. Group C contained C. fetus subsp. fetus and C. fetus subsp. veneralis and was characterized by the presence of 3 -OH- 14 : 0 and 3 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acid (3 -OH- 16 : 0) and the absence of 19 : 0 cyc. Twenty-nine isolates were placed in four additional groups. Group D included the type strain of "C. cinaedi" and 14 other isolates, which were differentiated by the presence of dodecanoic acid (12 : 0), 3 -hydroxydodecanoic acid (3 -OH- 12 : 0), and 3 -OH- 16 : 0 and the absence of hexadecenoic acid (16 : 1) and 3 -OH- 14 : 0. Group E contained the type strain of "C. fennelliae" and two additional isolates, which were differentiated by the presence of a 16 -carbon aldehyde and a 16 -carbon dimethylacetyl and the absence of 16 : 1. Group F included the type strain and one reference strain of C. cryaerophila and six human isolates whose phenotypic characteristics were similar to those of this species; this group was distinguished by the presence of two isomers of 16 : 1, <b>tetradecenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (14 : 1), and 3 -OH- 14 : 0. Group G included three stains of C. pyloridis and was characterized by the presence of 19 : 0 cyc, 3 -OH- 16 : 0, and 3 -hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (3 -OH- 18 : 0) and by the absence of 16 : 1 and 3 -OH- 14 : 0...|$|E
