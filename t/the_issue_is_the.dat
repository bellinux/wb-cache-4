5|$|The United States naval gunfire support {{debate is}} an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and {{independent}} groups like the United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided. At the heart of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Vickers' {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most extensive yet undertaken. As well as analysing {{the distribution of}} a large number of rhetorical devices throughout the play, he also devised three new authorship tests; an {{analysis of}} polysyllabic words, an analysis of the distribution of alliteration and an analysis of vocatives. His findings led him to assert, with complete confidence, that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1. Vickers' findings have yet to be challenged.|$|E
25|$|Another wrinkle in <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> unnatural {{geographic}} location of this Eastern-Time-Zoned region. In the western Indiana counties where Eastern time is observed (South Bend and Lafayette south to Terre Haute and Vincennes), around the summer solstice, the sun neither sets until after 9:20 pm, {{nor does it}} reach solar noon until almost 2:00 pm. During the winter months when standard time is observed, school buses in western regions lose a valuable hour of the sun's rays as they pick up children in the morning. Another notable observation is that schools in the Eastern Time Zone of Indiana tend to have far more 2-hour delays, mainly {{due to the fact}} that sunlight is required for many road de-icing components to work. With the sun rising as late as 8:20 am in some areas, available sunlight is inadequate to safely thaw the roads for school buses to pick up all their passengers on time. The argument is that if the same area were in its geographically natural Central time zone, the sun would be up an hour sooner, and it would have an additional hour to thaw the roads every morning.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{topic of}} the second episode of the third season of Elementary, a Sherlock Holmes remake that aired on November 6th, 2014.

2500|$|Adding {{confusion}} to <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} Roddenberry {{is quoted as}} saying he disliked the films, and [...] "didn't much consider them canon". There exists no definitive list of which films in particular Roddenberry disliked, or what elements in them he did not consider canon. For example, the reference book Star Trek Chronology states that Roddenberry considered elements of [...] and [...] to be apocryphal, but it does not specify which particular elements in the films Roddenberry objected to.|$|E

2500|$|Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Death Penalty Information Center, Reprieve, {{and other}} antideath-penalty groups have not {{proposed}} a lethal-injection protocol which {{they believe is}} less painful. Supporters {{of the death penalty}} argue that the lack of an alternative proposed protocol is testament {{to the fact that the}} painfulness of the lethal injection protocol is not the issue. Instead, supporters [...] argue that <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> continued existence of the death penalty, since if the only issue [...] the painfulness of the procedure, then Amnesty International, HRW, or the DPIC should have already proposed a less painful method.|$|E
50|$|Complicating <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{criminal}} case against Jason Strickland. If Haleigh died, {{the state could}} bring murder charges against Strickland. But if she lived, even in a vegetative state, the charges brought against Strickland were significantly less severe. Many perceived the actions of Strickland to be an attempt at evading homicide charges.|$|R

2500|$|Complicating <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} the U.S. {{government}} {{did not have a}} formal definition of broadcasting, or any specific regulations, until December 1, 1921, when a broadcast service category was essentially grafted onto the existing Limited Commercial license category, as an authorization that was granted to a select group of designated stations. (A license class dating back to 1912, not all Limited Commercial stations were authorized to make broadcasts.) Before these new regulations were adopted, there were no prohibitions restricting broadcasting stations from operating under amateur or experimental licenses. A specific [...] "broadcasting station" [...] license did not exist until one was created by the Federal Radio Commission in 1927.|$|E
2500|$|Sahgal {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying she felt that Amnesty was risking its reputation by associating with and thereby politically legitimising Begg, because Cageprisoners [...] "actively promotes Islamic Right ideas and individuals". She said the issue was not about Begg's [...] "freedom of opinion, nor about his right to propound his views: he already exercises these rights fully as he should. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> ... <b>the</b> importance of the human rights movement maintaining an objective distance from groups and ideas that are committed to systematic discrimination and fundamentally undermine the universality of human rights." [...] The controversy prompted responses by politicians, the writer Salman Rushdie, and journalist Christopher Hitchens, among others who criticised Amnesty's association with Begg.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel wrote Where Civic Republicanism and Deliberative Democracy Meet (1996) for the Hastings Center Report. In {{this article}} Emanuel {{questioned}} whether a defect in our medical ethics causes {{the failure of}} the US to enact universal health care coverage. The macro level of <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> proportion of total gross national product allotted to health care, the micro level is which individual patient will receive specific forms of health care, e.g., [...] "whether Mrs. White should receive this available liver for transplantation." [...] In between are the basic or essential health care services that should be provided to each citizen. The end-stage renal disease program {{is an example of a}} service that increases the total cost of health care, and reduces the amount that can be spent on basic or essential health care.|$|E

40|$|Partial {{differential}} equations with highly oscillatory, random coefficients describe many applications in applied {{science and engineering}} such as porous media and composite materials. Homogenization of PDE states that {{the solution of the}} initial model converges to the solution to a macro model, which <b>is</b> characterized by <b>the</b> PDE with homogenized coefficients. Particularly, we study PDEs with a large potential, a class of PDEs with a potential properly scaled such that the limiting equation has a non-trivial (non-zero) potential. This thesis consists of the investigation of three <b>issues.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> convergence of Schodinger equation to a deterministic homogenized PDE in high dimension. <b>The</b> second <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> convergence of the same equation to a stochastic PDE in low dimension. <b>The</b> third <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> convergence of elliptic equation with an imaginary potential...|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{a different}} {{judge of the}} High Court departed from the view taken in Tang Kin Hwa. In Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon definitively answering the question left open by Phang {{as to whether the}} two tests for apparent bias were the same. He thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, [...] "suspicion" [...] suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. [...] "Reasonable" [...] suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, [...] "likelihood" [...] points towards something being likely, and [...] "real" [...] suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined. Here, then, the inquiry is directed more towards the actor than the observer. <b>The</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> degree to which a particular event is not likely or possible.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, in Re Shankar Alan s/o Anant Kulkarni (2006), Judicial Commissioner Sundaresh Menon {{thought that}} there was a real {{difference}} between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests.

Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable.|$|E
