40|$|Tool life is an {{important}} parameter in machining processes, affecting directly the quality of machined components and the process cost. It is already shown that various parameters can affect tool life such as process parameters, i. e. depth of cut, cutting speed and feed, or material properties of cutting tool and workpiece. The determination {{of the effect of}} each parameter on tool life is of crucial importance when designing the manufacturing process of a product in order to select suitable process parameter values and tool types. Several empirical formulas for the determination of tool life exist in the relevant literature; {{especially in the case of}} CBN cutting <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning,</b> a cubic polynomial formula was proposed to model the relationship between tool life and cutting speed. The determination of the polynomial parameters was performed by conducting cutting experiments for several cutting speeds, without the aid of a design of experiments (DoE) method in order to model properly this non-linear relationship.

The conventional materials like tungsten carbide(WC), titanium carbide(TiC), cubic boron nitride (CBN) and diamond used as cutting <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> operations on lathe are expensive. Titanium grade 5 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V), SS 440 C/AISI 440 C and SS 316 {{are some of the}} materials which satisfy the necessary requirements for turning metals and polymer materials.

The cutting forces at play are determined using lathe tool dynamometer and plotted on a MCD (Merchant’s Circle Diagram). The cutting tools are also subjected to tests to determine tool life, wear and work hardening.

Coromant {{is a leading}} manufacturer of cemented carbide <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning,</b> milling and drilling. The insert (cemented carbide) {{is the part of}} the tool that does the actual cutting in the workpiece. The thesis assignment was to develop a CAD Toolbox available to insert designers in UGS NX 3 CAD-system at Sandvik Coromant. It could contain for instance geometry or help programs or a combination of them. The main purposes with the Toolbox should be to facilitate the designer’s daily work, maintain standard and to integrate engineering knowledge. The thesis work was carried out at Sandvik Coromant, CTDP department in Sandviken, Sweden. Part of the project task was {{to find out what the}} Toolbox should be filled with in the future and to create the first object in the Toolbox. The chosen example object was the Wiper Cutting Edge, which is a patented insert nose configuration with several connected radii after each other, providing better workpiece surface finish or increased productivity. To find out the designers needs and therefore what objects to add in the Toolbox a survey was conducted at the Design Insert department at Sandvik Coromant. A questionnaire was handed out to the designers and the answers generated a list of widely different objects, for example ready NX 3 drawing templates. A number of NX 3 functions that might be useful in the Toolbox were tested and evaluated in the thesis, e. g. User Interface Styler, User Defined Feature (UDF) and Knowledge Fusion (KF). KF is a Knowledge Based Engineering application within UGS NX 3, which can enable rules controlling the user when designing. To evaluate the different functions a Wiper NX 3 sketch was created meeting the demands from the insert designers and thesis assignment. One stated demand was that the Toolbox has to be compatible with Teamcenter Engineering, which is a Product Lifecycle Management solution from UGS. The final selected Wiper Object solution was Knowledge Fusion enabled UDF’s with added Open C API-functions. Among the advantages with the KF enabled UDF concept compared to other solutions are that a new NX 3 dialog window can be connected to the UDF and that programming rules can evaluate dialog input data and give interactive feedback to the user. Depending on type of Toolbox object the application technique in NX 3 could vary. Sometimes standalone UDF’s are advantageous and sometimes KF could be beneficial to use together with a UDF. The Toolbox objects are accessed through a CAD Toolbox icon toolbar or a CAD Toolbox menu inside NX 3. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} precision mechanical components such as bearings, fuel injectors, gears and hydraulic components, which are made of hardened steels, {{and have to be}} machined to a high degree of precision. Traditionally these components are being ground. Due to the development of ceramic and cubic boron nitride <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> this process are now being challenged by hard turning. In the metal cutting industry, machining with a single point tool in heat-treated products with a hardness of above HRC 55 is normally considered as hard turning. Important factors such as quality, lead-time and cost can be improved thanks to hard turning. To ensure the quality of hard turned products, many different parameters must be considered. One of these parameters is residual stress generated in the work piece. Residual stresses have a great impact on the fatigue life of the product and must therefore be controlled. The knowledge of residual stress in terms of how it affects the component and how it is generated and measured is not widespread within the industry. In order to have a controlled implementation of hard turning in the industry, the effect of cutting conditions on the residual stresses must be clarified. In prior research there have been several reports on the improvement of the fatigue life of hard turned products. There have been several explanations for the enhanced product performance. One reason for the improved fatigue life has been {{explained by the fact that}} hard turning produces a better product in terms of roundness. Another idea is that hard turning generates an untempered martensitic layer which is harder than the bulk material and which has good wear resistance. However, most reports attribute improved fatigue life to the compressive stresses generated by hard turning. It has been suggested that the cutting conditions should be chosen on the basis of their effect on residual stress. In this work, the effect of cutting conditions impact on generated residual stresses has been measured using the X-ray diffraction method. The approach has been empirical and statistical methods have been used. The effects on residual stress from different input factors such as different cutting conditions have been investigated. It was found that the residual stress is generated in two different ways. The creation of stresses is mainly controlled by temperature on the surface and under the surface the mechanical generation is the dominating process. Both a summary table explaining how cutting parameter affects the residual stress and a program called cutting advisor have been developed. A fatigue test on bearings showed that the life can be doubled with stresses generated in hard turning...|$|E
40|$|Lately, the {{enormous}} generation of databases {{in almost every}} aspect of life has created a great demand for new, powerful <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> <b>turning</b> data into useful information. Therefore, researchers were encouraged to explore and develop new machine learning ideas and methods. Mixture models are one of the machine learning techniques receiving considerable attention due to their ability to handle efficiently and effectively multidimensional data. Generally, four critical issues have to be addressed when adopting mixture models in high dimensional spaces: (1) choice of the probability density functions, (2) estimation of the mixture parameters, (3) automatic determination of the number of components M in the mixture, and (4) determination of what features best discriminate among the different components. The main goal of this thesis is to summarize all these challenging interrelated problems in one unified model. In most of the applications, the Gaussian density is used in mixture modeling of data. Although a Gaussian mixture may provide a reasonable approximation to many real-world distributions, it is certainly not always the best approximation especially in computer vision and image processing applications where we often deal with non-Gaussian data. Therefore, we propose to use three highly flexible distributions: the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD), the asymmetric Gaussian distribution (AGD), and the asymmetric generalized Gaussian distribution (AGGD). We are motivated by the fact that these distributions are able to fit many distributional shapes and then can be considered as a useful class of flexible models to address several problems and applications involving measurements and features having well-known marked deviation from the Gaussian shape. Recently, researches have shown that model selection and parameter learning are highly dependent and should be performed simultaneously. For this purpose, many approaches have been suggested. The vast majority of these approaches can be classified, from a computational point of view, into two classes: deterministic and stochastic methods. Deterministic methods estimate the model parameters for a set of candidate models using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, then choose the model that maximizes a model selection criterion. Stochastic methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be used in order to sample from the full a posteriori distribution with M considered unknown. Hence, in this thesis, we propose three learning techniques capable of automatically determining model complexity while learning its parameters. First, we incorporate a Minimum Message Length (MML) penalty in the model learning step performed using the EM algorithm. Our second approach employs the Rival Penalized EM (RPEM) algorithm which is able to select an appropriate number of densities by fading out the redundant densities from a density mixture. Last but not least, we incorporate the nonparametric aspect of mixture models by assuming a countably infinite number of components and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations for the estimation of the posterior distributions. Hence, the difficulty of choosing the appropriate number of clusters is sidestepped by assuming that there are an infinite number of mixture components. Another essential issue in the case of statistical modeling in general and finite mixtures in particular is feature selection (i. e. identification of the relevant or discriminative features describing the data) {{especially in the case of}} high-dimensional data. Indeed, feature selection has been shown to be a crucial step in several image processing, computer vision and pattern recognition applications not only because it speeds up learning but also because it improves model accuracy and generalization. Moreover, the learning of the mixture parameters (i. e. both model selection and parameters estimation) is greatly affected by the quality of the features used. Hence, in this thesis, we are trying to solve the feature selection problem in unsupervised learning by casting it as an estimation problem, thus avoiding any combinatorial search. Finally, the effectiveness of our approaches is evaluated by applying them to different computer vision and image processing applications...|$|E
