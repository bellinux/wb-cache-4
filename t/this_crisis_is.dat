25|$|Aplastic crises are acute worsenings of the patient's {{baseline}} anaemia, producing pale appearance, fast heart rate, and fatigue. <b>This</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>is</b> normally {{triggered by}} parvovirus B19, which directly affects production of {{red blood cells}} by invading the red cell precursors and multiplying in and destroying them. Parvovirus infection almost completely prevents red blood cell production {{for two to three}} days. In normal individuals, this is of little consequence, but the shortened red cell life of SCD patients results in an abrupt, life-threatening situation. Reticulocyte counts drop dramatically during the disease (causing reticulocytopenia), and the rapid turnover of red cells leads to the drop in haemoglobin. This crisis takes 4 days to one week to disappear. Most patients can be managed supportively; some need blood transfusion.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{opposition}} coalition winning Perak in the 2008 general election, Mohammad Nizar Jamaluddin of Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) was appointed {{as the new}} Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) of the state eventually, although the Democratic Action Party (DAP) won the most seats compared to other opposition parties. The Menteri Besar {{did not come from}} the Chinese-dominant party as the state constitution states that the Chief Minister must be a Muslim, unless the Sultan specially appoints a non-Muslim Chief Minister. As DAP does not have any Muslim assemblymen, if the Sultan insists that the Chief Minister must be a Muslim, then the assemblymen would have to come from either Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) or PAS, which formed the coalition state government with DAP. On 3 February 2009, Barisan Nasional, the national ruling party, gained control over the state government, after the defections of three Pakatan Rakyat assemblymen. However, several cases have been filed in the Kuala Lumpur High Court challenging the validity of the new Barisan Nasional government, causing a constitutional crisis. Adding to <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>is</b> the fact that the Pakatan Rakyat Menteri Besar has refused to resign and states that he is still the legal Menteri Besar until he is removed through vote of no confidence or snap election.|$|E
500|$|In 212, {{during the}} reign of Caracalla, Roman {{citizenship}} was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. But despite this gesture of universality, the Severan dynasty was tumultuous—an emperor's reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution—and, following its collapse, the Roman Empire was engulfed by the Crisis of the Third Century, a period of invasions, civil strife, economic disorder, and plague. In defining historical epochs, <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>is</b> sometimes viewed as marking the transition from Classical Antiquity to Late Antiquity. Aurelian (reigned 270–275) brought the empire back from the brink and stabilized it. Diocletian completed the work of fully restoring the empire, but declined the role of princeps and became the first emperor to be addressed regularly as domine, [...] "master" [...] or [...] "lord". This marked the end of the Principate, {{and the beginning of the}} Dominate. Diocletian's reign also brought the empire's most concerted effort against the perceived threat of Christianity, the [...] "Great Persecution". The state of absolute monarchy that began with Diocletian endured until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453.|$|E
5000|$|The {{population}} of Malawi had increased {{rapidly in the}} decades before the food crisis. From 3 million in 1950 the population grew to 9,6 million in 1991.

This means that two thirds of <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> caused by the population growth since 1950.

This means that 78% of <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> caused by the population growth since 1950 and the other 22% by the drought.

40|$|In the {{generation}} after World War II a wide perception of an information crisis plagued all scientific professions. <b>This</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> an “information explosion ” that scientists confronted from exponentially increasing num-bers of publications. One significant result of <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>was</b> the emer-gence of the “information wars”—the professional battle between scien-tists (documentalists) and humanists (librarians) over information retrieval. Scientists often blamed an unresponsive library com-munity {{for failing to}} develop new techniques to ease the burdens that resulted from too much information. They believed card catalogs were too slow and inefficient, and they desired new automated systems for informa-tion retrieval.

2500|$|Both Russia and Ukraine {{claimed to}} have emerged triumphant from the dispute, but both {{countries}} sustained major blows to their economies {{in the middle of}} an already serious economic crisis. Gazprom was estimated to have lost about $1.5billion in revenues due to lack of sales, while Ukraine lost an estimated $100million in transit fees and was speculated to have incurred major economic losses due to much of its industry, the backbone of its economy, being temporarily shut down. Analysts pointed out that the crisis and the way it was handled had a negative and possibly irreversible impact on the reputations of both Russia as an energy supplier, and Ukraine as a transit country. According to the Czech foreign minister, [...] "The main lesson learned from <b>this</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>is</b> that Russia and Ukraine aren’t reliable suppliers. Europe must think about alternative sources and pipelines." [...] The President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso similarly expressed during the crisis that by failing to honor supply agreements Russia and Ukraine could no longer be considered reliable energy partners.|$|E
2500|$|Nietzsche {{approaches}} {{the problem of}} nihilism as a deeply personal one, stating that this problem {{of the modern world}} is a problem that has [...] "become conscious" [...] in him. Furthermore, he emphasizes both the danger of nihilism and the possibilities it offers, as seen in his statement that [...] "I praise, I do not reproach, [...] arrival. I believe {{it is one of the}} greatest crises, a moment of the deepest self-reflection of humanity. Whether man recovers from it, whether he becomes master of <b>this</b> <b>crisis,</b> <b>is</b> a question of his strength!" [...] According to Nietzsche, it is only when nihilism is overcome that a culture can have a true foundation on which to thrive. He wished to hasten its coming only so that he could also hasten its ultimate departure. Heidegger interprets the death of God with what he explains as the death of metaphysics. He concludes that metaphysics has reached its potential and that the ultimate fate and downfall of metaphysics was proclaimed with the statement [...] "God is dead".|$|E
