5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings <b>that</b> <b>often</b> visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive.

5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies <b>that</b> <b>often</b> include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is a byproduct that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E

5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles <b>that</b> <b>often</b> overlap.
