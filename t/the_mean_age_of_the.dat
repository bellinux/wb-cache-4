500|$|Prevalence of AD in populations is {{dependent}} upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population of interest.

Prevalence rates in less developed regions are lower. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2005, 0.379% of people worldwide had dementia, and that the prevalence would increase to 0.441% in 2015 and to 0.556% in 2030.

Another study estimated that in 2006, 0.40% of the world population (range 0.17–0.89%; absolute number , range [...] ) were afflicted by AD, and that the prevalence rate would triple and the absolute number would quadruple by 2050.|$|E

Results: <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> G 2 (onset of testicular growth) and PH 2 (onset of pubic hairs growth) was 11. 57 ± 1. 54 and 12. 43 ± 1. 07 years. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> G 5 (final stage of testicular growth) and PH 5 (final stage of pubic hairs growth) was 15. 43 ± 0. 8 and 15. 69 ± 1. 1 years. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> BMI in <b>the</b> early stages of puberty (G 2) was 16. 32 ± 2. 02.
