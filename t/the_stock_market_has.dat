5000|$|According to Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana and others, as of 2011, {{institutional}} shareholders {{have become}} more active in challenging CEOs, if not necessarily the CEO's pay.

5000|$|In this book, Gordon {{focuses on}} the history of American finance {{industry}} and Wall Street, telling many interesting stories along the way such as how Chase Manhattan started off as a water company and why Merrill Lynch was named after two brokers, and not one. The book explains many concepts about how <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> shaped itself into one we know it today, including stories about the first corner in the Wall Street history to the most recent, the Hunt's brothers attempt to corner the silver market in 1980. Gordon also explains that every time a player misuses the market to his advantage, the invisible hand of Adam Smith pushes the system to correct itself. The books tells about prominent finance personalities, such as Jacob Little, the first great Wall Street plunger; Commodore Vanderbilt, the Street's greatest tactician; Hetty Green, the [...] "richest woman in the world," [...] who was terrified of being poor; J. P. Morgan, the country's most important banker, who twice saved it from economic disaster when the government couldn't; Richard Whitney, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, who was a thief; and Charles E. Merrill, who brought Wall Street to Main Street and transformed both in the process.|$|E
5000|$|The myRA {{program was}} {{announced}} on January 28, 2014, by President Barack Obama during the 2014 State of the Union Address, stating:"Let’s {{do more to}} help Americans save for retirement.

[...] And while <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> <b>has</b> doubled {{over the last five}} years, that doesn’t help folks who don’t have 401ks. That’s why, tomorrow, I will direct the Treasury to create a new way for working Americans to start their own retirement savings: MyRA. It’s a new savings bond that encourages folks to build a nest egg. MyRA guarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in." [...] - President ObamaThe President signed the memo in a public ceremony at U.S. Steel's Irvin plant in the Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania on January 28, 2014. In late 2014, a pilot version of the program launched with approximately 60 employers participating, allowing for testing and feedback. Approximately 3,000 myRA accounts were opened during the pilot phase, and average individual contributions during the pilot were around $20-$50 per month. On December 15, 2014, the United States Treasury published the final regulations governing the myRA accounts. The Treasury finally declared the program ready to use and available across the country in November 2015.|$|E
