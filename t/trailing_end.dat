5|$|Bakker {{received}} a large advance for the novel from Bantam Books, {{rumored to be}} in the six-figure range. The book was prominently featured at the American Booksellers' Convention in Chicago, alongside Michael Crichton's The Lost World. Coverage of the event noted that both novels were on the <b>trailing</b> <b>end</b> of the dinosaur fad fueled by Jurassic Park, as the new trend in American books was shifting toward politics {{in the aftermath of the}} 1994 US elections.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. He {{shows that the}} shape of the egg favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the <b>trailing</b> <b>end</b> sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
25|$|After {{escaping}} the promoter and shedding {{most of the}} transcription factors for initiation, the polymerase acquires new factors for {{the next phase of}} transcription: elongation. Transcription elongation is a processive process. Double stranded DNA that enters {{from the front of the}} enzyme is unzipped to avail the template strand for RNA synthesis. For every DNA base pair separated by the advancing polymerase, one hybrid RNA:DNA base pair is immediately formed. DNA strands and nascent RNA chain exit from separate channels; the two DNA strands reunite at the <b>trailing</b> <b>end</b> of the transcription bubble while the single strand RNA emerges alone.|$|E

25|$|In {{the year}} 2293, retired Captain James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott, and Pavel Chekov attend the maiden voyage of the Federation {{starship}} USS Enterprise-B, {{under the command}} of the unseasoned Capt. John Harriman. During the voyage, Enterprise is pressed into a rescue mission to save two El-Aurian ships from a strange energy ribbon. Enterprise is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but the starship becomes trapped in the ribbon. Kirk goes to deflector control to alter the deflector dish, allowing Enterprise to escape, but the <b>trailing</b> <b>end</b> of the ribbon rakes across Enterprises hull, exposing the section Kirk is in to space; he is presumed dead.|$|E
25|$|It is {{typically}} constructed from a short piece or tuft of yarn {{placed in the}} free air stream where it is visible to the pilot. In closed cockpit aircraft, it is usually taped to the aircraft canopy. It may also be mounted on the aircraft's nose, either directly on the skin, or elevated on a mast, in which case {{it may also be}} fitted with a small paper cone at the <b>trailing</b> <b>end.</b> They are commonly used on gliders, but may also be found on jet aircraft (especially fighters), ultralight aircraft, light-sport aircraft, autogyros, airplanes and helicopters. Its usefulness on airplanes with a tractor configuration (single propeller at the nose) is limited because the propeller creates turbulence and the spiral slipstream displaces the string to one side.|$|E

The size of mesh in the cod end is a {{determinant}} {{of the size of}} fish which the net catches. Consequently, regulation of mesh size is a common way of managing mortality of juvenile fishes in trawl nets.|$|E

2500|$|Three Class 43 {{locomotives}} {{have been}} written off in railway accidents, all of which occurred on the Great Western Main Line. [...] 43011 was written off in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash, 43019 was written off after the Ufton Nervet rail crash, and 43173 was scrapped at Pig's Bay in Essex after heavy damage in the Southall rail crash. [...] In all cases, the damage was to the leading power car – the <b>trailing</b> <b>end</b> power cars {{at the other end}} of the HST set suffered only limited or no damage, and were returned to service. [...] At Ladbroke Grove and Ufton Nervet the accidents were ultimately caused by factors not involving the HST sets or their drivers, although the set involved in the Ladbroke Grove crash had a faulty AWS system; however, the Southall accident was due to the HST colliding with a Freight train, which was entering Southall Goods Yard, at approximately 13.20 GMT, crossing the main lines. The immediate cause of the crash was the result of the driver of the HST passing a red signal without stopping. In addition, the leading power car of the set had a faulty Automatic Warning System which if operational would have alerted the driver to his error and possibly prevented the accident. Following investigation, this system has since been required to be kept operational and switched on for all use of the Intercity 125 fleet.|$|E

He wanted to find a fallen post, but as he struggled forward the half-seen poles came back out of the icy mist in an unending row. He had been out two hours and had not reached the worst spot. The line had no doubt broken at Silver's Gulch.|$|E
50|$|The jack {{operates}} {{in the manner}} of a caterpillar's walk: climbing (or descending) along the strands by releasing the clamp at one end, expanding the cylinder, clamping there, releasing the <b>trailing</b> <b>end,</b> contracting, and clamping the <b>trailing</b> <b>end</b> before starting over again.
