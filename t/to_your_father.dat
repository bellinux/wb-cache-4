2500|$|The {{punishment}} of being stoned outside the city, prescribed in [...] for a stubborn and rebellious son, {{was also the}} punishment prescribed for blaspheming {{the name of the}} Lord in [...] The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary suggests that [...] "parents are considered God's representatives and invested with a portion of his authority over their children" [...] and therefore refusal to obey the voice of one's father or mother, when they have chastened one, is akin to refusal to honor the name of God. [...] uses the same words, [...] "a glutton and a drunkard", as , also linked in the succeeding verses of Proverbs to the need for obedience to and respect for one's parents: [...] "Listen <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old" [...] (...)

The drying floors were thin and perforated to permit the heat to pass through and escape through a cowl in the roof which turned with the wind. The freshly picked hops from the fields were raked in to dry and then raked out to cool before being bagged up {{and sent to the}} brewery. The Kentish dialect word kell was sometimes used for kilns ("The oast has three kells.") and sometimes to mean the oast itself ("Take this lunchbox <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> he's working in the kell."). The word oast itself also means [...] "kiln".|$|E

Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story." ...|$|E
