[...] The album was released on October 11, 1994 through Immortal and Epic Records.

[...] Another bomb disposal team member said that the lead character's [...] "swagger would put a whole team at risk.

Sinestro starts out as Hal Jordan’s mentor, {{slightly}} suspicious and not sure of him because obviously Hal is the first human being who’s made into a Green Lantern. He's certainly very strict and unsure of the wisdom of Hal becoming a Green Lantern". Strong said, the character [...] "is a military guy but isn't immediately bad. It's <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> lends himself to becoming bad {{over the course of}} the comics being written, but initially he’s quite a heroic figure." [...] He also revealed that the outfit and other aspects of the character very closely follow the character's early days, [...] "That widow's peak and thin mustache was for some reason originally based on David Niven... So I would like to do justice to the Sinestro that was conceived for the comic books".|$|E

6000|$|... "Here we are," [...] he continued, [...] "compelled {{to inhabit}} this land {{and do not}} meet with proper {{protection}} from the infidel. Now, sir, this is a crying evil, {{and it is only}} becoming in one who has the true faith, and is a loyal subject of the All-Powerful, to point out with due humility that He is growing very remiss in His affairs, and is losing a good deal of His prestige. And what, senor, is at the bottom of it? Favoritism. We know that the Supreme cannot Himself be everywhere, attending to each little trick-track that arises in the world--matters altogether beneath His notice; and that He must, like the President of Venezuela or the Emperor of Brazil, appoint men--angels if you like--to conduct His affairs and watch over each district. And it is manifest that for this country of Guayana the proper person has not been appointed. Every evil is done and there is no remedy, and the Christian has no more consideration shown him than the infidel. Now, senor, in a town near the Orinoco I once saw on a church the archangel Michael, made of stone, and twice as tall as a man, with one foot on a monster shaped like a cayman, but with bat's wings, and a head and neck like a serpent. Into this monster he was thrusting his spear. That is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> should be sent to rule these latitudes--a person of firmness and resolution, with strength in his wrist. And yet it is probable that this very man--this St. Michael--is hanging about the palace, twirling his thumbs, waiting for an appointment, while other weaker men, and--Heaven forgive me for saying it--not above a bribe, perhaps, are sent out to rule over this province." ...|$|E

50|$|At {{a deeper}} level, it {{reflects}} the fragmentation of human lives.

60|$|For Arick {{is really}} {{what you call a}} savage, though a savage is a very {{different}} sort of a person, and very much nicer than he is made to appear in little books. He is <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> everybody smiles to, or makes faces at, or gives a smack as he goes by; the sort of person that all the girls on the plantation give the best seat to and help first, and love to decorate with flowers and ribbons, and yet all the while are laughing at him; {{the sort of person who}} likes best to play with Austin, and whom Austin, perhaps (when he is allowed), likes best to play with. He is all grins and giggles and little steps out of dances, and little droll ways to attract people's attention and set them laughing. And yet, when you come to look at him closely, you will find that his body is all covered with scars! This happened when he was a child. There was war, as is the way in these wild islands, between his village and the next, much as if there were war in London between one street and another; and all the children ran about playing in the middle of the trouble, and, I dare say, took no more notice of the war than you children in London do of a general election. But sometimes, at general elections, English children may get run over by processions in the street; and it chanced that as little Arick was running about in the Bush, and very busy about his playing, he ran into the midst of the warriors on the other side. These speared him with a poisoned spear; and his own people, when they had found him, in order to cure him of the poison scored him with knives that were probably made of fish-bone.|$|E

5000|$|By profession, Nelson was a photomicroscopy {{researcher}} at the University of California's Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

5000|$|Acting under a {{description}} {{has important implications}} for interpreting our selves. Self-understanding involves understanding our acts and hence understanding the descriptions under which we act. This issue has been illustrated with discussions of particular cases such as autism and multiple personality disorder. In contemporary society, the descriptions under which people act constitute the kind of act and <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> <b>that</b> commits the act. By illustration, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked why he did that, he might answer [...] "to show who's boss", [...] "because I have ADHD", or [...] "because I was provoked". Hacking is not concerned with which description best suits the act, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them.|$|E
