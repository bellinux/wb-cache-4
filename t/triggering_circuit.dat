50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a charging circuit, a <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> receives the triggering signal, the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> stops {{the operation of the}} charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, the charging circuit is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} battery-less power management circuits for micro-power energy converters, allowing energy harvesting systems to operate under continuous and intermittent conditions. The proposed <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> is a fully passive, normally open, single pole, single throw, analog switch driven by a nano-power CMOS control unit. The <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> starts in an OPEN state until the voltage, at its input terminal, reaches a high threshold, when it toggles to the CLOSED state. Once the input voltage drops below a low threshold, the <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> returns to the OPEN state. In the CLOSED state, the <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> creates a low resistance path between the input and output terminals, while at the OPEN state the input is isolated from the output.

The feasibility of {{the application of a}} PWM scheme to the current-fed inverter in this particular field is investigated. The steady-state performance of the system is evaluated by a simulation program which is based on the state-space method of analysis. The analytical results by simulation are verified experimentally on a laboratory set-up of a power level of 100 watts at about 1 kHz.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report details the background to surge arresters and surge protective device components, viz., spark gaps, gas discharge tubes and metal oxide varistors. Current surge protective device technologies are detailed for several of the larger surge protective device manufacturers worldwide. Tests were performed using both 8 / 20 μs and 10 / 350 μs current impulses to verify the voltage and current response of gas discharge tubes with or without series MOVs and triggering circuits. Measurements obtained from the test setup were compared against each other, sharing a total impulse current of 35. 8 kA peak using an 8 / 20 μs waveform and 10. 2 kA peak using a 10 / 350 μs current impulse waveform. In the work presented, it is shown that series varistors dampened any voltage and current oscillatory behaviour superimposed from the current impulse generator due to their voltage clamping properties, which similarly do not allow any follow current to flow after a surge has subsided.

40|$|ESD, the {{discharge}} of electrostatically generated charges into an IC, {{is one of the}} most important reliability problems for ultra-scaled devices. This electrostatic charge can generate voltages of up to tens of kilovolts. These very high voltages can generate very high electric fields and currents across semiconductor devices, which may result in dielectric damage or melting of semiconductors and contacts. It has been reported that up to 70 % of IC failures are caused by ESD. Therefore, it’s necessary to design a protection circuit for each pin that discharges the ESD energy to the ground. As the devices are continuously scaling down, while ESD energy remains the same, they become more vulnerable to ESD stress. This higher susceptibility to ESD damage is due to thinner gate oxides and shallower junctions. Furthermore, higher operating frequency of the scaled technologies enforces lower parasitic capacitance of the ESD protection circuits. As a result, increasing the robustness of the ESD protection circuits with minimum additional parasitic capacitance is the main challenge in state of the art CMOS processes. Providing a complete ESD immunity for any circuit involves the design of proper protection circuits for I/O pins in addition to an ESD clamp between power supply pins. In this research both of these aspects are investigated and optimized solutions for them are reported. As Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) has the highest ESD protection level per unit area, ESD protection for I/O pins is provided by optimizing the first breakdown voltage and latch-up immunity of SCR family devices. The triggering voltage of SCR is reduced by a new implementation of gate-substrate triggering technique. Furthermore, a new device based on SCR with internal darlington pair is introduced that can provide ESD protection with very small parasitic capacitance. Besides reducing triggering voltage, latch-up immunity of SCR devices is improved using two novel techniques to increase the holding voltage and the holding current. ESD protection between power rails is provided with transient clamps in which the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> keeps the clamp “on” during the ESD event. In this research, two new clamps are reported that enhance the <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit</b> of the clamp. The first method uses a CMOS thyristor element to provide enough delay time while the second method uses a flip flop to latch the clamp into “on” state at the ESD event. Moreover, the stability of transient clamps is analyzed and it’s been shown that the two proposed clamps have the highest stability compared to other state of the art ESD clamps. Finally, in order to investigate the impact of ESD protection circuits on high speed applications a current mode logic (CML) driver is designed in 0. 13 μm CMOS technology. The protection for this driver is provided using both MOS-based and SCR-based protection methods. Measurement results show that, compared to MOS-based protection, SCR-based protection has less impact on the driver performance due to its lower parasitic capacitance...|$|E

40|$|Power {{quality is}} one of the most talked about topics these days. Both the power {{utilities}} and customers are quite concern with the quality of the power supply, whether it be the power generated by the power utilities or the power consumed by the customers respectively. They need these supplies to be at its optimum value so that the cost is efficient; otherwise problems such as over voltage, under voltage, voltage swell, voltage sag, noise and harmonic caused by the disturbances in power supply could be disastrous. Several methods have been suggested and applied as the solution to these problems. One of the methods is by employing on-load power transformer with tap changer, where the output voltage of the power transformer remains constant irrespectively to the input voltage or variation of the load. The existing mechanical on-load tap changing power transformer has few disadvantages, as it is slower, produces arching each time the tap setting is changed and needs regular maintenance. With the emergence of high power semiconductor devices such as triac, problems associated with the mechanical on-load tap changing power transformer have been properly rectified.

Automated and manual tracking techniques were developed to extract the complex wing and body motions of dipteran insects, ideal micro aerial systems, in free flight. Video sequences were captured by three high speed cameras (7500 fps) oriented orthogonally around a clear flight test chamber. Synchronization and image-based triggering were made possible by an automated <b>triggering</b> <b>circuit.</b> A multi-camera calibration was implemented using image-based tracking techniques. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the insect were generated from the 2 -D images by shape from silhouette (SFS) methods. An intensity based segmentation of the wings and body was performed using a mixture of Gaussians. In addition to geometric and cost based filtering, spectral clustering was also used to refine the reconstruction and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to find the body roll axis and wing-span axes. The unobservable roll state of the cylindrically shaped body was successfully estimated by combining observations of the wing kinematics with a wing symmetry assumption. Wing pitch was determined by a ray tracing technique to compute and minimize a point-to-line cost function. Linear estimation with assumed motion models was accomplished by discrete Kalman filtering the measured body states. Generative models were developed for different species of diptera for model based tracking, simulation, and extraction of inertial properties. Manual and automated tracking results were analyzed and insect flight simulation videos were developed to quantify ground truth errors for an assumed model.
