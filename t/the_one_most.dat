5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>most</b> depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). This group of RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>most</b> closely associated with paralysis.|$|E
5|$|Many Flemish {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>most</b> widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man like Richard de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being Flemish.|$|E

25|$|The {{dimension}} of physical quantities {{of interest in}} mechanics can be {{expressed in terms of}} base dimensions M, L, and T – these form a 3-dimensional vector space. This is not the only valid choice of base dimensions, but it is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>most</b> commonly used. For example, one might choose force, length and mass as the base dimensions (as some have done), with associated dimensions F, L, M; this corresponds to a different basis, and one may convert between these representations by a change of basis. The choice of the base set of dimensions is thus a convention, with the benefit of increased utility and familiarity. The choice of base dimensions is not arbitrary, because the dimensions must form a basis: they must span the space, and be linearly independent.|$|E
25|$|Dream pop had {{developed}} {{out of the}} indie rock scene of the 1980s, when bands like Cocteau Twins, The Chameleons, The Passions, Dif Juz, Lowlife and A.R. Kane began fusing post-punk and ethereal experiments with bittersweet pop melodies into sensual, sonically ambitious soundscapes. The 4AD record label is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>most</b> associated with dream pop, though others such as Creation, Projekt, Fontana, Bedazzled, Vernon Yard, and Slumberland also released significant records in the genre. A louder, more aggressive strain of dream pop {{came to be known}} as shoegazing; key bands of this style were Lush, Slowdive, My Bloody Valentine, Alison's Halo, Chapterhouse, Curve and Levitation. These bands kept the atmospheric qualities of dream pop, but added the intensity of post-punk-influenced bands such as The Chameleons and Sonic Youth.|$|E
