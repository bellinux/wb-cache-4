Kohlberg's difficulties in obtaining empirical evidence {{for even a}} sixth stage, however, led him to emphasize the speculative nature of his seventh stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{texts and}} artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, {{although}} not identical but generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly {{in their respective}} mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras {{in a manner similar}} to Shiva Nataraja. The similarities in the dance iconography suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> link between ancient Indra and Shiva.|$|E
5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E

5|$|What then is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered {{side by side with the}} greatest.|$|E
5|$|Veronica learns <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her {{that it is the}} secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room and ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E

25|$|Several {{circumstances}} {{have been}} identified {{that are associated with}} an increased risk of sleep paralysis. These include insomnia, sleep deprivation, an erratic sleep schedule, stress, and physical fatigue. It is also believed <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> genetic component in the development of RISP, because there is a high concurrent incidence of sleep paralysis in monozygotic twins. Sleeping in the supine position has been found an especially prominent instigator of sleep paralysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of osteoarthritis is correlated {{with a history}} of previous joint injury and with obesity, especially with respect to knees. Since the correlation with obesity has been observed not only for knees but also for non-weight bearing joints and the loss of body fat is more closely related to symptom relief than the loss of body weight, it has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> metabolic link to body fat as opposed to just mechanical loading.|$|E
25|$|The odour of the peat-smoke, {{especially}} in winter time, {{can add to}} the general atmosphere of the island.

In 2008, with the large increase in the price (and theft) of LPG and heating oil, there are signs <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> return to peat cutting.|$|E

25|$|Some {{research}} suggests <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> degree of inherited susceptibility to develop sleep bruxism. 21–50% {{of people with}} sleep bruxism have a direct family member who had sleep bruxism during childhood, suggesting that there are genetic factors involved, although no genetic markers have yet been identified. Offspring {{of people who have}} sleep bruxism are more likely to also have sleep bruxism than children of people who do not have bruxism, or people with awake bruxism rather than sleep bruxism.|$|E
25|$|Axonal {{degeneration}} and regeneration {{are common}} processes in many nerve disorders. As {{a consequence of}} myelin remodeling, the internodal length is known to remain persistently short. Little is known about how neurons cope with the increased number of nodes except <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> compensatory increase in Na+ channels so that the internodal density is restored. Nevertheless, most extant research findings maintain that regenerated axons may be functionally deficient, as the access to the K+ channel under the paranodal myelin may be increased.|$|E
25|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology explanation for conversion disorder {{is that the}} symptoms may have been evolutionarily advantageous during warfare. A non-combatant with these symptoms signals non-verbally, possibly to someone speaking a different language, that she or he is not dangerous as a combatant and also may be carrying some form of dangerous infectious disease. This can explain that conversion disorder may develop following a threatening situation, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> group effect with many people simultaneously developing similar symptoms (as in mass psychogenic illness), and the gender difference in prevalence.|$|E
