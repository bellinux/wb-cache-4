5000|$|<b>Toggle</b> {{mechanisms}} are four-bar linkages that are dimensioned {{so that they}} can fold and lock. The <b>toggle</b> positions are determined by the colinearity of two of the moving links. The linkage is dimensioned so that the linkage reaches a <b>toggle</b> position just before it folds. The high mechanical advantage allows the input crank to deform the linkage just enough to push it beyond the <b>toggle</b> position. This locks the input in place. <b>Toggle</b> {{mechanisms are}} used as clamps.|$|R

5|$|In 1973 a jadeitite axehead {{was found}} {{alongside}} the track; {{it is thought}} to have been placed there as an offering. One of over 100similar axe heads found in Britain and Ireland, its good condition and its precious material suggest that it was a symbolic axe, rather than one used to cut wood. Because of the difficulty of working this material, which was derived from the Alpine area of Europe, all the axe heads of this type found in Great Britain are thought to have been non-utilitarian and to have represented some form of currency or be the products of gift exchange. Radiocarbon dating of the peat in which the axe head was discovered suggests that it was deposited in about 3200 BC. Wooden artefacts found at the site include paddles, a dish, arrow shafts, parts of four hazel bows, a throwing axe, yew pins, digging sticks, a mattock, a comb, <b>toggles,</b> and a spoon fragment. Finds made from other materials, such as flint flakes, arrowheads, and a chipped flint axe (in mint condition) have also been made.|$|E

25|$|A forging press, {{often just}} called a press, {{is used for}} press forging. There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or <b>toggles</b> to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy Mystic Quest {{eliminates}} {{the system of}} random enemy encounters, a trademark of the main series. Instead, battles are represented in dungeons as stationary enemy sprites, and the player is given the option of approaching the enemy and engaging a battle. Once engaged in battle, the player is thrust into the battle screen, which presents a window-based menu with three commands to choose from: battle, run, or control. Running from battle transports the player back to the field screen, while choosing [...] "control" [...] <b>toggles</b> between the ally's battle mode, where the player can manually control the main character's ally or opt for a computer-controlled ally. If players choose to battle, they are presented with a submenu of four more options: physically attack the enemy, cast a spell, use a curative item (such as a Cure potion), or defend. The game's battle system relies on conditional turn-based combat, where the characters and enemies cycle through [...] "rounds" [...] in battling each other, with the most turns awarded to the fastest character. Character health is represented by an incremental life bar, although the player may choose to have it displayed in numerical fractions as in most role-playing games. If all character life bars reach zero, the game is over, but the player is given the option of continuing and restarting the battle. [...] If the player chooses this option, however, the main character's attack power may suffer temporarily as a penalty. [...] A character's performance in battle is determined by numerical figures (called statistics) for vitality, attacking power, defensive capabilities, speed, magical prowess, accuracy, and evasion. Character statistics are driven by experience points (EXP) gained from winning battles, which accumulate until players achieve milestones known as [...] "experience levels." [...] Besides awarding experience points, battling enemies also earns the player Gold Pieces (GP), {{which can be used}} to buy weapons, armor, and curative items. In the absence of random enemy encounters, battlefields are scattered across the world map. Players are immediately thrust into a battle when entering a battlefield, and must win ten enemy battles to [...] "clean out" [...] the battlefield. Once a battlefield is cleaned out, players are awarded either a large amount of experience, a large amount of GP, a piece of armor, or a magic spell.|$|E
