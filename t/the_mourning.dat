5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mourning</b> dove {{was thought}} to be the {{passenger}} pigeon's closest living relative, based on morphological grounds. <b>The</b> <b>mourning</b> dove was even suggested to belong to the same genus, Ectopistes, and was listed by some authors as E. carolinensis.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{individual}} mourning doves {{is estimated to}} be approximately 475 million. The large population and its vast range explain why <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> dove is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk. As a gamebird, <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> dove is well-managed, with more than 20 million (and up to 40–70 million) shot by hunters each year.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mourning</b> dove is {{a related}} species to the {{passenger}} pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius), which was hunted to extinction in the early 1900s. For this reason, {{the possibility of using}} mourning doves for cloning the passenger pigeon has been discussed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mourning</b> dove {{is closely}} related to the eared dove (Zenaida auriculata) and the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni). Some {{authorities}} describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus Zenaidura, but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus Zenaida. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> dove, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of Zenaida, using a separate genus would interfere with the monophyly of Zenaida by making it paraphyletic.|$|E

5|$|Unlike any other, the Belgian folk metal band Ithilien {{preferred}} {{to focus their}} lyrics on very personal subjects such as loss, perseverance or grief. The album Shaping the Soul is for example constructed based on Elisabeth Kubler-Ross model of <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> process.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the fleeing}} Troilus whom swift-footed Achilles catches, {{dragging}} {{him by the}} hair from his horse. The young prince takes refuge in the nearby temple. But the warrior follows him in, and beheads him at the altar before help can arrive.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mourning</b> dove {{occupies}} {{a wide variety}} of open and semi-open habitats, such as urban areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and lightly wooded areas. It avoids swamps and thick forest. The species has adapted well to areas altered by humans. They commonly nest in trees in cities or near farmsteads.|$|E
5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are diurnal birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize {{mourning}} dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> dove's vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.|$|E

5|$|Although al-Jamri's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the morning, <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> processions only began after the sunset Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times. Ultimately, it began at 6:00 in Muqsha village before moving along {{the west side of}} Budaiya highway to Bani Jamra, where al-Jamri was buried at 10:00. The weather was extremely cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black mourning clothes and carrying black flags. According to a number of Al-Wasat writers, the funeral was the largest in the modern history of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E

After the Trojans witness Achilles' treatment of Hector's body, Troilus insists on rejoining the battle despite his wounds and Hecuba's attempts to stop him.

5|$|Representations of the Virgin and John the Evangelist flank Christ {{in small}} {{rectangular}} panels {{at either end}} of his outstretched arms. Both are dark-skinned, and bear agonised and sorrowful expressions as they rest their heads on their hands and face inwards towards Christ. In keeping with the Franciscan idea, the gilding surrounding <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> saints is kept to a minimum. The size and positions of the figures are reduced compared to usual Byzantine iconography to maintain sole focus on the passion of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Sculptural figuration was {{to become}} a {{hallmark}} of van der Weyden's mature work, and is best typified by the Madrid Descent, where <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> figures are shaped and take on poses more usually seen in sculpture. Erwin Panofsky identified this work and The Madonna Standing as van der Weyden's earliest extant work; they are also his smallest panels. Panofsky dated both panels as 1432–34, and believed them to be early works based on stylistic reasons, their near miniature scale, and because of the evident influences of both Campin and van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|The Kalam {{people of}} New Guinea {{highlands}} called it konmayd, and deemed {{it a good}} bird; if it came and chattered when a new garden was tilled, {{then there would be}} good crops. It is said to be taking care of pigs if it is darting and calling around them. It may also be the manifestation of the ghost of paternal relatives to the Kalam. Called the kuritoro bird in New Guinea's eastern highlands, its appearance was significant in <b>the</b> <b>mourning</b> ceremony by a widow for her dead husband. She would offer him banana flowers; the presence of the bird singing nearby would confirm that the dead man's soul had taken the offering.|$|E
