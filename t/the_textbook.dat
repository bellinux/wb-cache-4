5|$|Sampson's {{agenda for}} the 1930 session {{was lost in the}} fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of <b>the</b> <b>textbook</b> commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers stripped away and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing his}} job as school {{inspector}} following the decisions of a hostile National Liberal executive, Mihai Eminescu {{spent much of his}} time in Bojdeuca, where he was looked after by the couple. For five months after quarreling with Samson Bodnărescu, his fellow poet and previous landlord, Eminescu even moved inside the house, where he reputedly pursued his discreet love affair with woman writer Veronica Micle, and completed as many as 22 of his poems. Creangă introduced his younger friend to a circle of companions which included Zahei Creangă, who was by then a cantor, as well as Răceanu, priest Gheorghe Ienăchescu, and clerk Nicșoi (all of whom, Călinescu notes, had come to share the raconteur's lifestyle choices and his nationalist opinions). Eminescu was especially attracted by their variant of simple life, the rudimentary setting of Creangă's house and the group's bohemian escapades. Circumstances drew the two friends apart: by 1877, Eminescu had relocated in Bucharest, the capital city, regularly receiving letters in which Creangă was asking him to return. He was however against Eminescu's plan to marry Veronica Micle, and made his objection known to the poet. In 1879, as a sign that he was formalizing his own affair with Tinca Vartic, Creangă purchased the Bojdeuca in her name, paying his former landlord 40 Austrian gulden in exchange. That same year, he, Răceanu and Ienăchescu published <b>the</b> <b>textbook</b> Geografia județului Iași ("The Geography of Iași County"), followed soon after by a map of the same region, researched by Creangă and Răceanu. A final work in the area of education followed in 1880, as a schoolteacher's version of Maiorescu's study of Romanian grammar, Regulile limbei române ("Rules of the Romanian Language").|$|E
