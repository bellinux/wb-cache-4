In August and September 2006, he starred as Lieutenant Frank Cioffi in Curtains, a new Kander and Ebb musical staged at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. In March 2007, Curtains opened on Broadway and on June 10, 2007, Pierce won the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical at the 61st Tony Awards for his performance. In his acceptance speech, Pierce said the first words he spoke on a Broadway stage were, [...] "I'm sorry, I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to leave." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} a phenomenological study exploring experience of time by patients living close to death. The empirical data consists of 26 open-ended interviews from 23 patients living with severe incurable disease receiving palliative care in Norway. Three aspects of experience of time were revealed as prominent: 1. Entering {{a world with}} no future; living close to death alters perception of and relationship to time. 2. Listening {{to the rhythm of}} my body, not looking at the clock; embodied with severe illness, it is the body not the clock that structures and controls the activities of the day. 3. Receiving time, taking time; being offered not asked for help, is like receiving time that confirms humanity, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for help which is like taking others time and thereby revealing own helplessness. Experience of time close to death is discussed as an embodied experience of inner, contextual, relational dimensions in harmony and disharmony with the rhythm of nature, environment and others. Rhythms in harmony provide relief, while rhythms in disharmony, confer weakness and limit time...|$|R

60|$|He {{wrote his}} two letters at once. That to Lady Carbury was very short. He would {{be delighted to}} see her and Henrietta at the time named,--and would be very glad should it suit Felix to come also. He did not {{say a word about}} the Board, or the young man's {{probable}} usefulness in his new sphere of life. To Montague his letter was longer. 'It is always best to be open and true,' he said. 'Since you were kind enough to say that you would come to me, Lady Carbury has proposed to visit me just {{at the same time and}} to bring her daughter. After what has passed between us I need hardly say that I could not make you both welcome here together. It is not pleasant to me <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to postpone your visit, but I think you will not accuse me of a want of hospitality towards you.' Paul wrote back to say that he was sure that there was no want of hospitality, and that he would remain in town.|$|E
60|$|The Duchess {{before dinner}} {{submitted}} herself {{and all her}} troubles at great length to the Duke, but the Duke could give her no substantial comfort. Of course {{it had all been}} wrong. He supposed that they ought not to have been found walking together in the dark on Sunday afternoon. The hunting should not have been arranged without sanction; and the return home in the hired carriage had no doubt been highly improper. But what could he do? If the marriage came off it would be all well. If not, this niece must not be invited to Mistletoe again. As to speaking to Lord Rufford, he did not quite see how he was to set about it. His own girls had been married in so very different a fashion! He could imagine nothing so disagreeable as <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a gentleman his intentions. Parental duty might make it necessary when a daughter had not known how to keep her own position intact;--but here there was no parental duty. If Lord Rufford would speak to him, then indeed there would be no difficulty. At last he told his wife that, if she could find an opportunity of suggesting to the young Lord that he might perhaps say a word to the young lady's uncle without impropriety,--if she could do this in a light easy way, so as to run no peril of a scene,--she might do so.|$|E

5000|$|Later that year, he {{was arrested}} at a card game run by Soprano family capo Jimmy Altieri.

Soprano assigned Gualtieri {{to see if he}} could feel out where Bonpensiero's loyalties lay, by checking him for a wire, even authorizing him to kill his old friend if he saw one. Soprano was obviously distressed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Gualtieri to do this to a trusted member of the crew. However, his orders were cut-and-dried, that if Gaultieri did not see a wire, he was not to do the hit. Gualtieri then surprised Bonpensiero with a trip to a bath house, where he refused to undress and left, blaming high blood pressure. This behavior served to heighten his crew's suspicions, but meant Paulie had to abide by Tony's orders. After this experience, he disappeared. While he was away, Gualtieri took over his collections, and the crew killed Altieri, taking the heat off Bonpensiero as the crew figured Jimmy was the [...] "rat." ...|$|E
40|$|Powerpoint: [URL] {{blending}} and {{the indirect}} framing of directive constructions Speakers resort to pseudo-directive constructions {{when attempting to}} get someone to do something without giving the impression of restricting the addressee's freedom of choice of action or without impinging upon the addressee's self-assessment that s/he has that freedom of choice. One efficient (i. e. face-saving) strategy consists in blending a covert coding of the speaker's authority and an overt coding of the addressee's freedom of non-compliance into the same construction. This is generally done compressively, both at the formal and conceptual levels. In XXXX (2005), we showed that the you (don't) want to/ wanna X construction (e. g. {{you want to make}} a left turn, you don't wanna miss that) displayed the main properties of a grammatical blend (Fauconnier and Turner 1996), among which the dual inheritance principle and, above all, compression (morphosyntactic and conceptual). In this case, grammatical blending successfully frames the directive as collaborative work (the speaker appears as willing to help the addressee) and thus mitigates the inherent coerciveness of the act. In this paper I will show that grammatical blending may serve the same function in expansive (pseudo-) directive strategies: (1) A- I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to leave. B- You're kicking me out? A- No, I'm not saying that. B- Ok, then I can stay? ( [...] .) A- I'm asking you to leave. B- Are you kicking me out? A- No. (2) I told you again not to take any photographs. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to stay behind. (3) I'm afraid I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to check with the Defense Department. (4) Mister, you can say anything you want about me, but I'm gonna have to ask you not to talk about my horse that way. In this construction (I am going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you to X) the driving force of the illocutionary intent (Speaker wants Addressee to X > structural type: 'Speaker asks Addressee to X') is disguised as something impending (going to) and extrinsic from the speaker's own will (have to). The compositional combination of directive strategies is blended into a composite construction. However, despite its internal complexity, the expanded construction assumes some morphosyntactic and prosodic unity, insofar as each of its formal components displays a high degree of collostruction strength to the composite structure (Stefanowitsch and Gries 2003, 2005). This paper will show that compression - a defining property of conceptual integration (Fauconnier and Turner 2000) - does not (always) correspond in a one-to-one fashion with morphosyntactic chunking in a grammatical blend. This observation will be corroborated by empirical research on innovative directive strategies in Japanese (Smith 1992, Sunaoshi 1995, Takano 2005). Those case studies, combined with a critical examination of recent works on the topic (Fauconnier and Turner 2002, Mandelblit 2000, etc.), will form the basis for a renewed (and expanded) definition of grammatical blending. Finally, these newly defined constructional integration networks will be described in light of the Fuzzy Construction Grammar framework (Desagulier 2005). REFERENCES Blum-Kulka, S. 1989.
