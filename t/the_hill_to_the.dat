5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E
5|$|Mount Osmond {{is a small}} {{suburb of}} 2,497 people in the South Australian capital city of Adelaide. It {{is part of the}} City of Burnside local {{government}} area and located {{in the foothills of the}} Adelaide Hills, five kilometres south east of the city centre. The suburb is high on the hill of the same name, which is the last hill on the right when approaching Adelaide down the South Eastern Freeway before the road levels out onto the Adelaide Plains. It is bounded to the north by the suburb of Beaumont, to the north-east by Burnside, to the east by Waterfall Gully, to the south by Leawood Gardens/Eagle On <b>The</b> <b>Hill,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south-west by Urrbrae, to the west by Glen Osmond and to the north-west by St Georges.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought {{residential}} development on the hilltops {{to the west and}} east of Valley. On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Boles's men {{concentrated}} to the north-west {{corner of}} town, before the Church of St Lawrence. A regiment of Waller's infantry, five companies of Haslerig's, and five companies of Kentish Men attacked Alton {{from the north}} and north-west. The Royalist infantry, however, took effective cover inside buildings, out of which they fired quickly; they particularly favoured a large brick house near the church. This house, however, was soon abandoned as Waller's artillery, positioned at the foot of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, fired upon it, forcing these defenders to retreat to the church. The Parliamentary regiments from London and four companies from Farnham Castle descended the hill: Waller's Red Regiment attacked a lunette and breastwork which the Royalists had built and which they were using as an effective fortification. The Green Regiment flanked the Royalists which were behind these fortifications forcing them out, while marching through town under the cover of smoke from a thatch house which they had set on fire. Soon after, the rest of Waller's men entered the town en masse, flying their colours and pushing Boles's men back to the Church of St Lawrence. From the church and nearby fortifications (including a large earthwork on its north side), the Royalists held their ground for two hours. The Royalists fired from the windows of the church, and employed a scaffolding inside the church proper to fire from greater heights.|$|E

Another notable rise is <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west that is occupied by the University of Havana and the Prince's Castle.

25|$|On {{the night}} of October 24, 1838, Captain Bogart's unit had camped {{along the banks of}} Crooked River in Bunkham's Strip. Patten and the Mormon rescue company {{approached}} from the north along the main road. At daybreak on the 25th, the Mormons encountered the militia's sentries. A brief firefight ensued with each side testifying that the other had fired first. One of the sentries, John Lockhart, shot Patrick Obanion, the Mormons' scout. Obanion later died from this wound. Lockhart and the other guards then fled down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> militia camp which took up a defensive position.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get over the top of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get {{to the other side of}} the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E

The formal garden is still there and a garden for the disabled has been constructed by Frodsham Round Table. In the park there are play facilities for children. The coach house has been developed into the Castle Park Arts Centre which has a small café and showrooms for the arts. Other outbuildings are now used as offices for small businesses. The park and gardens have been designated at GradeII in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.|$|E

25|$|In 1505 Lisbon {{was being}} ravaged by the plague, which had arrived by ship from Italy. The {{king and the}} court were even forced to flee Lisbon for a while. The site of São Roque, outside the city walls (now an area known as the Bairro Alto), became a {{cemetery}} for plague victims. At {{the same time the}} king of Portugal, Dom Manuel I (reigned 1495–1521), sent to Venice for a relic of St. Roch, the patron saint of plague victims, whose body had been translated to that city in 1485. The relic was sent by the Venetian government, and it was carried in procession up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plague cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Queensland economy revived and the National Association's {{financial}} position firmed. Substantial improvements and re-arrangements of the Exhibition Grounds {{were made in}} 1906 {{in time for the}} August show. A fine new grandstand, designed by Brisbane architect Claude William Chambers, was erected at a cost of £6248. (In 1923, this stand was renamed the John MacDonald Stand in honour of a long-serving National Association councillor). The sideshow booths which had been located on <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of the main ring, were moved to the valley on the northwest side of the railway, their place being taken by machinery exhibits. The hill has since been known as Machinery Hill and the valley as Sideshow Alley.|$|E
25|$|A young William Bligh, {{the future}} captain of , later {{claimed to have}} been {{watching}} with a spyglass from Resolution as Cook's body was dragged up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town where it was torn to pieces. In fact, Cook's remains were treated differently: the high esteem in which the islanders held Cook caused them to retain his body. Following their practice of the time, they prepared his body with funerary rituals usually reserved for the chiefs and highest elders of the society. The body was disembowelled, baked to facilitate removal of the flesh, and the bones were carefully cleaned for preservation as religious icons. Some of Cook's remains, thus preserved, were eventually returned to his crew for a formal burial at sea.|$|E
