40|$|An {{accurate}} orientation {{is crucial to}} a satisfactory position in pedestrian navigation. The orientation estimation, however, is greatly affected by errors like <b>the</b> <b>biases</b> of gyroscopes. In order to minimize the error in <b>the</b> orientation, <b>the</b> <b>biases</b> of gyroscopes must be estimated and subtracted. In {{the state of the}} art it has been proposed, but not proved, that the estimation of <b>the</b> <b>biases</b> can be accomplished using magnetic field measurements. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of using magnetic field measurements to estimate <b>the</b> <b>biases</b> of medium-cost micro-electromechanical sensors (MEMS) gyroscopes. We carry out the evaluation with experiments that cover both, quasi-error-free turn rate and magnetic measurements and medium-cost MEMS turn rate and magnetic measurements. The impact of different homogeneous magnetic field distributions and magnetically perturbed environments is analyzed. Additionally, the effect of <b>the</b> successful <b>biases</b> subtraction on <b>the</b> orientation and the estimated trajectory is detailed. Our results show that the use of magnetic field measurements is beneficial to <b>the</b> correct <b>biases</b> estimation. Further, we show that different magnetic field distributions affect differently <b>the</b> <b>biases</b> estimation process. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>biases</b> are likewise correctly estimated under perturbed magnetic fields. However, for indoor and urban scenarios <b>the</b> <b>biases</b> estimation process is very slow...|$|R

Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; {{it found that}} Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects <b>the</b> <b>bias</b> of individual jurors rather than {{an interpretation of the}} law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they felt that it was the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as {{dean of the school of}} theology.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} new stock price model “The biased geometric Brownian motion”. In short, <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> geometric Brownian motion {{is a normal}} geometric Brownian motion with a newly introduced “biased factor”. The forecasting performance of <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> geometric Brownian motion was tested in order to evaluate whether the efficient portfolio which is constructed from prediction of share prices from this new model will outperforms an optimal portfolio created from the current or past information. The formulation of <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> factor employs <b>the</b> fundamental and principle knowledge on fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory. Factors which are closely relate to the recent performance of the stock such as the daily rate of return and price movement are described by linguistic variables which are characterised by fuzzy sets. The defuzzification of these variables is the process to calculate the value of <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> factor. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> factor, <b>the</b> genetic algorithm was constructed in order to solve the portfolio optimisation problem. The genetic algorithm is {{used to determine the}} optimal portfolio in the performance test of <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> geometric Brownian motion. Several tests were conducted in order to verify the performance of <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> geometric Brownian motion and the genetic algorithm. In the end, it turns out that both the original and <b>the</b> <b>biased</b> geometric Brownian motion are unsuitable for the prediction of share price in the current economic recession.

The reasons for <b>the</b> <b>bias</b> are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E
5|$|Wooller was a {{dissident}} {{member of the}} Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). In 1991, Wooller accused the ICAEW of having built-in bias when it marked examinations during a recession, and used PE II (Professional Education II) results to show <b>the</b> <b>bias.</b> Wooller was fined by the ICAEW in 1995 for promoting unaccredited MBA courses. Wooller formed a ginger group when the ICAEW tried to merge with the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) in 1995. Wooller's ginger group opposed many {{of the actions of}} the ICAEW. The merger was shelved after the majority of the ICAEW members voted against it. The ginger group decided to keep fighting for democratic reforms and in June 1996, demanded that the executive of the ICAEW be elected directly by the 109,000 members of the body, instead of by the ICAEW's council of seventy members. A year later, Wooller demanded that members of the ICAEW be allowed to vote on Peter Gerrard's key constitutional reform proposals, and Wooller's motion failed by 1,400 votes, including proxies.|$|E

We use two measures of home <b>bias,</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>bias</b> (<b>the</b> degree of overinvestment in the home market), and <b>the</b> foreign <b>bias</b> (<b>the</b> degree of over-/under-investment in a foreign market). First, we find a strong relation between <b>the</b> domestic <b>bias</b> of investors and cross-listing decisions of firms. In particular, the level of cross-listing activity of firms from a particular market is negatively related to <b>the</b> domestic <b>bias</b> of <b>the</b> home market investors, while the level of cross-listing activity of firms towards a particular market is negatively related to <b>the</b> domestic <b>bias</b> of <b>the</b> host market investors. Second, we find a strong relation between <b>the</b> foreign <b>bias</b> and cross-listings. In particular, the level of cross-listing activity from one market to another is positively related to <b>the</b> foreign <b>bias</b> in investments allocation of the home market investors {{as well as of the}} host market investors. Overall, these results suggest that corporate managers, when making a cross-listing decision, may be prone to <b>the</b> same behavioral/familiarity <b>bias</b> as investors...|$|R
