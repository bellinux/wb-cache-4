25|$|Individual {{prayer is}} {{considered}} acceptable, but prayer with a quorum of ten adults—a minyan—is {{the most highly}} recommended form of prayer and is required for some prayers. An adult in this context means {{over the age of}} 12 or 13 (bat or bar mitzvah). Judaism had originally counted only men in the minyan for formal prayer, on the basis that one does not count someone who is not obligated to participate. The rabbis had exempted women from almost all <b>time-specific</b> positive mitzvot (commandments), including those parts of the prayer that cannot be recited without a quorum, due to women in the past being bound up in an endless cycle of pregnancy, birthing and nursing from a very early age. Orthodox Judaism still follows this reasoning and excludes women from the minyan. Since 1973, Conservative congregations have overwhelmingly become egalitarian and count women in the minyan. A very small number of congregations that identify themselves as Conservative have resisted these changes and continue to exclude women from the minyan. Those Reform and Reconstructionist congregations that consider a minyan mandatory for communal prayer, count both men and women for a minyan. All denominations of Judaism except for Orthodox Judaism ordain female rabbis and cantors. In Orthodox Judaism, according to some authorities, women can count in the minyan for certain specific prayers, such as the Birchot HaGomel blessing, which both men and women are obligated to say publicly.|$|E

50|$|P1 is a {{temperate}} bacteriophage that infects Escherichia coli {{and some}} other bacteria. When undergoing a lysogenic cycle the phage genome exists as a plasmid in the bacterium unlike other phages (e.g. the lambda phage) that integrate into the host DNA. P1 has an icosahedral head containing the DNA attached to a contractile tail with six tail fibers.The P1 phage has gained research interest {{because it can be}} used to transfer DNA from one bacterial cell to another in a process known as transduction. As it replicates during its lytic cycle it captures fragments of the host chromosome. If the resulting viral particles are used to infect a different host the captured DNA fragments can be integrated into the new host's genome. This method of in vivo genetic engineering was widely used for many years and is still used today, though to a lesser extent. P1 can also be used to create the P1-derived artificial chromosome cloning vector which can carry relatively large fragments of DNA. P1 encodes a site-specific recombinase, Cre, that is widely used to carry out cell-specific or <b>time-specific</b> DNA recombination by flanking the target DNA with loxP sites (see Cre-Lox recombination).|$|E

Drug safety advisories can provide new information regarding the relative safety or effectiveness of a drug product which might increase selective prescribing. In particular, when reported adverse effects vary among drugs within a therapeutic class, clinicians may channel patients toward or away from a drug based on the patient's underlying risk for an adverse outcome. If channeling is not identified and appropriately managed it might lead to confounding in observational comparative effectiveness studies. To demonstrate channeling among new users of second generation antipsychotics following a Food and Drug Administration safety advisory and to evaluate the impact of channeling on cardiovascular risk estimates over time. Florida Medicaid data from 2001 - 2006. Retrospective cohort of adults initiating second generation antipsychotics.

40|$|Background: Appropriate {{statistical}} analysis {{is required to}} measure the impact of early detection and treatment of cancer. The current practice of using cumulative mortality ignores both (1) the delay between early treatment and the time that any averted deaths would have otherwise occurred, and (2) cessation of these delayed benefits some time after screening is discontinued. Methods: We use <b>time-specific</b> mortality density ratios to estimate the mortality ratio in the “window of influence. ” We then use <b>time-specific</b> incidence density ratios to assess {{the extent to which}} the removal of polyps and other possibly precancerous lesions detected by fecal occult blood screening reduces the incidence of colorectal cancer. Results: Applied to a theoretical example, the current practice of using cumulative mortality substantially underestimates the reduction in mortality achievable by early treatment. If there is sufficient time for the full impact to emerge, <b>time-specific</b> mortality patterns provide a more accurate measure. In a previous analysis of the screening study, the reduction in cumulative incidence in the screened groups was just under 20 %. In our reanalysis, yearly incidence density ratios indicate that had screening not been interrupted, there might have been a 40 % reduction in incidence. Conclusions: <b>Time-specific</b> mortality ratios provide a more sensitive measure of the effects of early detection and treatment. Measures based on cumulative mortality are diluted by inclusion of deaths that occur soon after the initiation of screening as well as deaths that occur too long after the cessation of screening...|$|E
