25|$|Tesla's patents {{state that}} the device was {{intended}} {{for the use of}} fluids as motive agents, as distinguished from the application of the same for the propulsion or compression of fluids (though the device can be used for those purposes as well). As of 2016, the Tesla turbine has not seen widespread commercial use since its invention. The <b>Tesla</b> <b>pump,</b> however, has been commercially available since 1982 and is used to pump fluids that are abrasive, viscous, shear sensitive, contain solids, or are otherwise difficult to handle with other pumps. Tesla himself did not procure a large contract for production. The main drawback in his time, as mentioned, was the poor knowledge of materials characteristics and behaviors at high temperatures. The best metallurgy of the day could not prevent the turbine disks from moving and warping unacceptably during operation.|$|E
40|$|Tesla turbine and its {{applications}} {{in power generation}} and fluid flow were demonstrated by Nicholas Tesla in 1913. However, its real-world implementations were limited by the difficulty to maintain laminar flow between rotor disks, transient efficiencies during rotor acceleration, {{and the lack of}} other applications that fully utilize the continuous flow outputs. All of the aforementioned limits of Tesla turbines can be addressed by scaling to the microfluidic flow regime. Demonstrated here is a microscale <b>Tesla</b> <b>pump</b> designed and fabricated using a Digital Light Processing (DLP) based 3 D printer with 43 µm lateral and 30 µm thickness resolutions. The miniaturized pump is characterized by low Reynolds number of 1000 and a flow rate of up to 12. 6 mL/min at 1200 rpm, unloaded. It is capable of driving a mixer network to generate microfluidic gradient. The continuous, laminar flow from Tesla turbines is well-suited to the needs of flow-sensitive microfluidics, where the integrated pump will enable numerous compact lab-on-a-chip applications...|$|E
40|$|The need of circulatory {{support systems}} in the {{treatment}} of chronic heart failure is increasing constantly, as 20 % of the patients on the waiting list die every year. Despite the great need for mechanical heart support systems, the use of available systems is limited by its expensiveness. In addition, there is no one system that is 100 % responsible to all medical and technical requirements and that would be completely safe for patient. Therefore, further research in the field of circulatory support systems considering health and technical requirements is relevant. One of the new directions in the study are disc pumps of viscous friction for liquid transporting, based on the <b>Tesla</b> <b>pump</b> principle. The operation principle of such pumps is based on the phenomenon of the boundary layer which is formed on the disk rotating in a fluid. There are experimental studies of models with different variants of the rotor suspension, various forms and numbers of the disks, forms of the pump housing. However, none of the above samples was brought to clinical trials. Furthermore, despite the potential of that model there have been no pumps of similar type used so far in circulatory support systems. Published data provide a basis for further development and testing of the pump model and allow hoping for leveling a number of significant shortcomings of modern left ventricular bypass systems.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of the use of}} circulatory support systems for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) has increased over the recent years. Up to 20 % of the patients from the waiting list for a donor heart die each year before they could get one. In our country, there is a huge need for mechanical heart support systems. However, the acquisition of foreign systems is associated with the excessive fi nancial costs. In addition, nowadays, there is no system that would meet all medical and technical requirements in full, and at the same time, would be of high safety for the patient. Therefore, research {{on the development of the}} systems of auxiliary circulation is highly relevant and is in demand in our country. One of the promising directions in this fi eld is disk pumps of viscous friction, which are based on the operation principle of <b>Tesla</b> disk <b>pump.</b> This article describes the creation and operation of the current model of the disk pump. The results of the bench tests confirmed that the expendable pressure characteristics of our disk pump are capable of providing the necessary parameters of blood circulation. The findings confi rm the perspective of the selected research area and provide the basis for further development and testing of this model of pump. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Conventionalturbines {{are mostly}} {{reaction}} and impulse type or both. Often technical challenge faced by conventional turbines in Himalaya is erosion by sediment. Financial feasibility of power plants is depended upon innovations to prevent erosion of mechanical equipments or alternatives which better handle these conditions. Tesla turbine is an unconventional turbine that uses fluid properties such as boundary layer and adhesion of fluid on series of smooth disks keyed to a shaft. It has been garnering interest as Pico turbine where local communities could manage such stations in low capital. It provides a simple design {{which can be}} produced locally and maintained at low cost. It {{can be useful in}} plants for pumping of water and other viscous fluids. <b>Tesla</b> Turbine <b>pump</b> {{has been used as a}} blood pump. Due to its uniqueness it has its own cliché uses giving importance to identify the scope of use of Tesla Turbine in Nepal. This paper is presented in context of research project at Kathmandu University to understand working of Tesla Turbine. For this design and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of 1 kW tesla turbine was carried out. Themodels thus created were used for computational analysis. The efficiency from analytical and computational analysis was compared. The proposed uses of Tesla Turbine in Nepal have been suggested.

5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams <b>pumped</b> <b>Tesla</b> for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{published}} work on pumps designed to assist a failing biological heart has been made and discusses {{the different types of}} pump presently on the market with the characteristics of each. The materials used to make these pumps are also discussed, together with some of the methods of output control. The application to the patient is described together with the advantages and disadvantages. A <b>Tesla</b> type <b>pump</b> appeared to offer an alternative solution to those problems listed above. This is not a new design but appeared to offer advantages if applied to the application of pumping blood from outside the body. One of these was that at a constant speed, the pump supplied constant fluid pressure irrespective of the delivery. It also appears that the pump can give fluid shear stress levels that are less than the amount that will seriously damage blood components. A prototype pump has been built and tested. The pump achieved the performance target delivery of 10 I/min at a differential pressure of 200 mm Hg. This was considered to be greater than the average performance produced by existing blood pumps but the maximum performance that could be produced by the human heart under extreme conditions. The pump reached a maximum speed of about 4000 rev/min with a maximum power consumption of about 120 Watts. The results indicate that this type of pump is a potential blood pump in terms of the delivery and pressures achieved. The characteristic performance figures are within the envelope of published theoretical results. The pump tested here needs further development to improve the hydraulic performance. Recommendations are made for the direction of future work to improve the pump efficiency and flow patterns, biocompatibility and methods of production. Controls and power supply also need improvement...|$|R
