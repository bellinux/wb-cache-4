25|$|In Australia, a {{study of}} 16 deaths {{associated}} with toxic concentrations of benzodiazepines {{during the period of}} 5 years leading up to July 1994 found preexisting natural disease as a feature of 11 cases; 14 cases were suicides. Cases where other drugs, including ethanol, had contributed to the death were excluded. In the remaining five cases, death was caused solely by benzodiazepines. Nitrazepam and temazepam were the most prevalent drugs detected, followed by oxazepam and flunitrazepam. A review of self poisonings of 12 months 1976 - 1977 in Auckland, New Zealand, found benzodiazepines implicated in 40% of the cases. A 1993 British study found flurazepam and temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal <b>toxicity</b> <b>index</b> of any benzodiazepine (15.0) followed by Temazepam (11.9), versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol.|$|E
25|$|The various benzodiazepines {{differ in}} their {{toxicity}} since they produce varying levels of sedation in overdose. A 1993 British study of deaths during the 1980s found flurazepam and temazepam more frequently involved in drug-related deaths, causing more deaths per million prescriptions than other benzodiazepines. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal <b>toxicity</b> <b>index</b> of any benzodiazepine (15.0), followed by temazepam (11.9), versus benzodiazepines overall (5.9), taken with or without alcohol. An Australian (1995) study found oxazepam less toxic and less sedative, and temazepam more toxic and more sedative, than most benzodiazepines in overdose. An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, {{which happens to be}} the most prescribed benzodiazepine in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than diazepam and other benzodiazepines. They also cited a review of the Annual Reports of the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Data Collection System, which showed alprazolam was involved in 34 fatal deliberate self-poisonings over 10 years (1992–2001), compared with 30 fatal deliberate self-poisonings involving diazepam. In a New Zealand study (2003) of 200 deaths, Zopiclone, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, had similar overdose potential as benzodiazepines.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} an energetic, exergoeconomic, environmental, and toxicity {{analysis of the}} simple gas turbine M 501 F 3 based on a parametric analysis of energetic (thermal efficiency, fuel and air flow rates, and specific work output), exergoeconomic (exergetic efficiency and exergoeconomic operation costs), environmental (global warming, smog formation, acid rain <b>indexes),</b> and human <b>toxicity</b> <b>indexes,</b> by taking the compressor pressure ratio and the turbine inlet temperature as the operating parameters. The aim {{of this paper is}} to provide an integral, systematic, and powerful diagnostic tool to establish possible operation and maintenance actions to improve the gas turbine’s exergoeconomic, environmental, and human <b>toxicity</b> <b>indexes.</b> Despite the continuous changes in the price of natural gas, the compressor, combustion chamber, and turbine always contribute 18. 96 %, 53. 02 %, and 28 %, respectively, to the gas turbine’s exergoeconomic operation costs.

This study evaluated cadmium (Cd) phytoavailability, accumulation and toxicity to three commonly cultivated crops: Telfairia occidentalis, Vigna unguiculata and Zea mays L., in a screen house experiment, using potted dumpsite soils at different Cd concentrations. Cd concentration in plant and soil was determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer after acid digestion. <b>Toxicity</b> <b>indices</b> were determined using standard procedures. Relationships between Cd in plant tissues, <b>toxicity</b> <b>indices</b> and soil factors were also examined. Results gave differential Cd uptake, distribution within tissues, tolerance and toxicities for the three crops. Cd phytotoxicity was shown by growth retardation, reduction in nutrient values and photosynthetic pigments. Cd phytoaccumulation and phytotoxicity related not only to soil Cd concentration but were modulated by soil factors, plant type and plant part. Study showed that utilization of lands previously utilized as waste dumpsites without prior reclamation procedure, poses hazard to plant health and is a potential avenue for the introduction of Cd in the human food chain...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess the}} {{sedative}} effects in overdose of temazepam and oxazepam {{compared with other}} benzodiazepines to determine if this explains reported differences in fatal toxicity. DESIGN [...] Cohort study of patients admitted with benzodiazepine poisoning. SETTING [...] Newcastle, Australia. SUBJECTS [...] 303 patients who had ingested benzodiazepine alone or in combination with alcohol and presented to a general hospital which served a well defined geographical area. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Degree of sedation: Glasgow coma score, McCarron Score, and whether patients were stuporose or comatose. RESULTS [...] Oxazepam produced less and temazepam more sedation than other benzodiazepines. Unadjusted odds ratios for coma with oxazepam and temazepam compared with other benzodiazepines were 0. 0 (95 % confidence interval 0. 0 to 0. 85) and 1. 86 (0. 68 to 4. 77) respectively, chi 2 = 7. 08, 2 df, P = 0. 03. After adjustment for potentially confounding effects of age, dose ingested, and coingestion of alcohol, the odds ratios were 0. 22 (0. 0 to 1. 43) for oxazepam and 1. 94 (0. 57 to 6. 23) for temazepam.

This last QSAR model, statistically validated for its predictive power, could be proposed as a preliminary evaluative method for screening/prioritising esters according to their integrated aquatic toxicity, just starting from their molecular structure...|$|E
40|$|Adding clay to marine oil {{pollution}} represents a promising approach to enhance bacterial hydrocarbon degradation in nutrient poor waters. In this study, {{three types of}} regionally available clays (Ca-bentonite, Fuller's Earth and kaolin) were tested to stimulate the biodegradation of source and weathered oil collected from the Deepwater Horizon spill. The weathered oil showed little biodegradation prior to experimentation and was extensively degraded by bacteria in the laboratory {{in a similar way}} as the alkane-rich source oil. For both oils, the addition of natural clay-flakes showed minor enhancement of oil biodegradation compared to the non-clay bearing control, but the clay-oil films did limit evaporation. Only alkanes of a molecular weight (MW) > 420 showed significant reduction by enhanced biodegradation following natural clay treatment. In contrast, all fertilized clay flakes showed major bacterial degradation of the oil, with a 6 – 10 times reduction in alkane content, and an up to 8 fold increase in the rate of O 2 consumption. Compared to the control, such treatment showed particular reduction of longer chained alkanes (MW > 226). The application of natural and fertilized clay flakes also showed selective reduction of PAHs, mainly in the MW range of 200 – 300, but without significant change in the <b>toxicity</b> <b>indices</b> measured. These results imply that a large variety of clays may be used to boost oil biodegradation by aiding attachment of fertilizing nutrients to the oil...|$|R

The evaluation of metal’s toxicity in freshwater {{is one of the}} imperative areas of research and there is an emergent concern on the development of techniques for detecting toxic effects in aquatic animals. Oxidative stress biomarkers are very useful in assessing the health of aquatic life and more in depth studies are necessary to establish an exact cause effect relationship. Therefore, to study the effectiveness of this approach, a laboratory study was conducted in the fish Labeo rohita as a function of hexavalent chromium and the <b>toxicity</b> <b>indices</b> using a battery of oxidative stress biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione reductase (GR) in the liver, muscle, gills, and brain have been studied along with biometric parameters, behavioral changes, and Cr bioaccumulation. A significant increased HSI was observed in contrast to CF which reduced significantly. SOD, CAT, and GR activity increased significantly in all the tissues of treated fishes. The bioaccumulation of Cr was highest in liver followed by gills, muscle, and brain. This study highlights the significance of using a set of integrated biomarker and advocate to include these parameters in National Water Quality Monitoring Program in areas potentially polluted with metals to assess the health of the ecosystem. 1...|$|R

The resulting Rheumatology Common <b>Toxicity</b> Criteria <b>Index</b> encompassed the following organ systems: allergic/immunologic, cardiac, ENT, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, ophthalmologic, pulmonary and skin/integument. Before this tool is widely accepted, its validity, consistency, and feasibility need to be assessed in clinical trials...|$|R
