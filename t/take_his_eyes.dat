5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way to the space port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the doors to the space port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E
25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle. No man wants to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from it until that time comes when he makes up his mind to run away. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle is in itself hard work. To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
500|$|Another [...] "major {{recurring}} role" [...] debuts in this episode: Eric Bruskotter {{joins the}} cast as Cooter Menkins, [...] "a football recruiter who comes scouting for talent at McKinley, but finds he can’t <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the team’s gruff but big-hearted coach." [...] Other recurring guest stars {{that appear in}} the episode include football coach Shannon Beiste (Jones), the focus of Cooter's eyes, former prom king Dave Karofsky (Adler), exchange student and new glee club member Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), and Mike's parents Julia Chang and Mike Chang, Sr. (Tamlyn Tomita and Sim).|$|E
60|$|The two men shook hands. Kendricks as yet had {{scarcely}} <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off Herr Freudenberg's face.|$|R
60|$|He <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off {{the road}} and glanced down at her curiously. His smile was self-confident, exultant.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he glanced}} round, and {{perceived}} that the figures he had, as he believed, scarcely <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> off were missing.|$|R
500|$|Sutcliffe {{was fascinated}} by the trio, but {{especially}} Kirchherr, and thought they looked like [...] "real bohemians". Bill Harry later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the whole room. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off her and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool. (Note: Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung , although it is now called the University of Applied Sciences).|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." [...] Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left.|$|E
500|$|When not {{travelling}} overseas on cricket tours, Harvey {{played baseball}} in the winter for the Fitzroy Baseball Club. He was twice named in the Australian baseball team but the team was named only for the distinction accorded on the players. That is, they never competed. Harvey's fielding abilities were regarded by Wisden as the [...] "finest outfielder in the world" [...] during his career. As a baseball infielder Harvey developed a half round arm throw; its speed and accuracy caused many batsmen to be run out while attempting a run. Ray Robinson said that Harvey's throw was [...] "arrow-like" [...] in accuracy and that [...] "as a versatile fieldsman, this ball-hawk...takes top place". His baseball training also influenced his habit of catching the ball above head height, with which he rarely dropped catches. This {{was based on the}} theory that the fielder need never <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the ball and, if it were to bounce out of his hands, he would have time to attempt to grab the rebound. Harvey also covered ground quickly and possessed and efficient method of picking up and returning the ball. From late 1958 when Norm O'Neill made his Test debut until Harvey's retirement in 1963, the duo formed a formidable pairing in the covers, helping to restrict opposition batsmen from scoring in the region.|$|E
60|$|The robber never <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from hers, {{nor did she}} from his, but at {{mention of}} the bell she noticed that <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were puzzled for the moment.|$|R
6000|$|Pan did {{not answer}} to the suggestion. [...] "Mac, {{what do you say}} to that?" [...] he queried, sharply, but he never <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off Purcell.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Archibald {{leaned back}} in his garden-chair and slowly puffed his cigar, and as he puffed he <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from the sunset sky and watched his wife and Margery.|$|R
500|$|At {{the same}} time, McAleer proved a strong performer. A later {{newspaper}} account {{described him as}} an outstanding outfielder who was [...] "blessed with excellent speed". The article noted that McAleer's skills as a sprinter helped him steal 51 bases in one year and 41 in another. According to some accounts, he was [...] "the first centerfielder to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off a fly ball, run {{to the spot where}} it fell to earth, and catch it". Less proficient as a hitter, McAleer accumulated a lifetime batting average of [...]253. During his career, the league's batting (pitchers removed) average for players with the same home field was [...]284. On April 24, 1894, he assisted in Cleveland's 1–0 victory over Cincinnati with a single in the ninth that drove home Buck Ewing, who had doubled. Along with teammates Cy Young, Jesse Burkett, John Clarkson, and Charles Zimmer, McAleer also participated in the Spiders' victory over the Baltimore Orioles in the 1895 Temple Cup, a post-season series between first and second-place teams of the National League. The Spiders placed second to the Orioles at the close of both the 1895 and 1896 seasons. McAleer's performance came in spite of a serious injury he received during a game held in Philadelphia on August 24, 1895, when he collided with a fence. Furthermore, he balanced his achievements in sports with a foray into politics in his hometown of Youngstown. During the summer of 1895, McAleer was promoted in the local media as a mayoral candidate, first as a Republican, and then as an independent. Further research is required to determine the depth of his involvement in politics.|$|E
60|$|They touched glasses. He {{could not}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> away from her.|$|E
60|$|Alec did not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off George. Walker {{saw what}} was coming {{and looked down at}} the ground.|$|E
60|$|Presently Ghek <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{from the}} eyes of O-Tar and the jeddak shook himself as one who would be rid of a bad dream and {{straightened}} up, half dazed still.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{but that}} was neither here nor there. The little green man orated like a--like Cicero. He made us out to be {{magnificent}} fellows. Maximus never <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off our faces.|$|R
60|$|Scarce had he <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{from the}} path ahead than his foot fell upon a glass skylight, and with a loud crash he plunged through amid a shower of broken glass.|$|R
60|$|Arthur seemed fascinated. He {{could not}} <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the loathsome thing. He watched it slowly heave with even motion.|$|E
60|$|Arthur's face did {{not move}} a muscle, nor did he once <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from the {{drooping}} lids of his companion.|$|E
6000|$|... "You--you're {{very like}} her," [...] stammered Tom, unable to <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> from her face. [...] "Even now I--I can't believe I'm mistaken." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{could hardly}} have been as he supposed, for {{although}} he had not <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off <b>his</b> companion, and had not seen him move, he sat reclining in his corner as before.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Langely <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{from the}} glass, {{and gave me}} a very {{significant}} look, whereby I saw that he had very much the same notion concerning the stranger that I myself entertained.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Miss Harvey," [...] said Mellot, who {{had never}} <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off her face, [...] "I want to turn schoolmaster, and give your {{children}} a drawing lesson. Get your slates, all of you!" ...|$|R
60|$|These were Auld Lichts, {{and when}} {{they found that the}} {{minister}} would not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off them, they obeyed, all save Rob Dow.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do now," [...] said Cynthia, {{looking at}} him rather timidly through her lashes. Her face was hot, and she had been, very uncomfortable during Mr. Merrill's remarks. Furthermore, Bob had not <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off her.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off me, {{as if he}} had {{suddenly}} seen the meaning behind my words, and was now quite sure of everything he wanted to know. He walked up and down the room, thinking; then he said to me,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Lingard spun {{round with}} {{aggressive}} mien {{to the light}} touch on his shoulder, {{but as soon as}} he <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off Mr. Travers, his anger fell, seemed to sink without a sound at his feet like a rejected garment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said Mr. Kennedy. Then {{he turned}} to his newspaper, and did not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off it as long as his wife {{remained}} with him.|$|E
60|$|Breakfast was ordered, {{to which}} the boys did full justice; but Colonel Tempe was still getting on but slowly, for he could not <b>take</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off Ralph's face.|$|E

60|$|There {{was no need}} to cry out to Syme, who {{had never}} <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off it. He saw the great {{luminous}} globe suddenly stagger in the sky, right itself, and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun.|$|R
50|$|During the off-season, Andolsek {{was working}} in the yard of his Thibodaux home when a {{semi-trailer}} truck ran off the highway {{in front of his house}} and struck and killed him. An investigation found the driver had <b>taken</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> off the road.|$|R
50|$|Shahryar’s {{interest}} {{and love for}} the arts does not stop with music.
