5|$|Lucas {{stated that}} he {{conceived}} the Star Wars saga's story {{in the form of}} a plot outline in 1973. However, he later clarified that, at the time of the saga's conception, he had not fully realized the details—only major plot points. He began working on Episode III even before the previous film, , was released, proposing <b>to</b> <b>concept</b> artists that the film would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Michael Kaminski, in The Secret History of Star Wars, surmises that Lucas found flaws with Anakin's fall to the dark side and radically re-organized the plot. For instance, instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin, ending the film's first act with his killing of Count Dooku, an action that signals his descent to the dark side.|$|E

These programs range from animal motivation and conditioning processes to decision making in human social groups, from neurophysiological mechanisms controlling basic drives to attributional processes in judging other individuals, from the sensory and perceptual roots of human cognition <b>to</b> <b>concept</b> formation and problem solving behavior in the child and adult, from the mathematical and computer techniques employed in research to the mechanisms of attitude formation and change.|$|E
25|$|Simon was {{interested}} in how humans learn and, with Edward Feigenbaum, he developed the EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) theory, {{one of the first}} theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program. EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning. Later versions of the model were applied <b>to</b> <b>concept</b> formation and the acquisition of expertise. With Fernand Gobet, he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model. The theory explains how simple chunks of information form the building blocks of schemata, which are more complex structures. CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{distinctive}} look of Shivering Isles is credited <b>to</b> <b>concept</b> artist Adam Adamowicz (1968-2012). [...] The {{landscape of the}} Isles {{is divided into two}} main areas: Mania and Dementia. [...] The land of Mania is characterized by vivid colour and fantastical flora, while Dementia is filled with bogs and agonistically twisted trees and roots. [...] Adamowicz had a major influence on the style of other Bethesda Softworks game titles such as Fallout 3 and [...] The portal to the Shivering Isles was also designed by Adamowicz, and bears his signature style.|$|E

The {{company has}} owned other Portland establishments such as Bar 71, Barracuda Nightclub, Dixie Tavern, Grand Central Bowl, the Lotus Cardroom and Cafe, Quest, and the Thirsty Lion. According to Willamette Week, the restaurant had an [...] "odd" [...] influence on local alcohol policies. In 1994, city commissioner Charlie Hales and mayor Vera Katz sought {{to close the}} Gypsy due to repeated reports of assaults, public intoxication, and noise complaints. However, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) refused. In 2013, when Hales was the mayor of Portland, he unsuccessfully requested that the OLCC enforce a 10 pm curfew for bar patios within the Portland city limits.|$|E

500|$|Mother was {{developed}} by Ape and published by Nintendo. While visiting Nintendo for other work, copywriter Shigesato Itoi pitched his idea for a role-playing game set in contemporary times to the company's Shigeru Miyamoto. He thought the setting would be unique for its incongruence with role-playing genre norms, as daily life lacked the pretense for magic powers and they could not simply give the child characters firearms as weapons. Itoi's project proposal suggested how the natural limitations could be circumvented. Miyamoto met with him and praised the idea, though {{he was not sure}} whether Itoi [...] "could pull it off". As an advertiser, Itoi was used <b>to</b> <b>concept</b> proposals preceding the staffing process, but Miyamoto explained that video game concepts needed people who signed on to [...] "make" [...] the product. Itoi was overcome with [...] "powerlessness".|$|E
2500|$|Kindred also {{challenges}} the fixity of [...] "race" [...] through the interracial relationships that form its emotional core. Dana’s kinship to Rufus disproves America’s erroneous concepts of racial purity. It also represents the [...] "inseparability" [...] of {{whites and blacks}} in America. The negative reactions of characters {{in the past and}} the present to Dana and Kevin’s integrated relationship highlight the continuing hostility of both white and black communities to interracial mixing. At the same time, the relationship of Dana and Kevin extends <b>to</b> <b>concept</b> of [...] "community" [...] from [...] people related by ethnicity to people related by shared experience. In these new communities whites and blacks may acknowledge their common racist past and learn to live together.|$|E
2500|$|Although details, {{such as the}} superlaser's location, shifted between {{different}} concept models during production of Star Wars, {{the notion of the}} Death Star being a large, spherical space station over 100 kilometers in diameter was consistent in all of them. George Lucas gave the original task of designing a [...] "Death Star" [...] <b>to</b> <b>concept</b> artist and spaceship modeler Colin Cantwell, who had collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on the 1968 film [...] In a 2016 interview, Cantwell related that [...] "I didn't originally plan for the Death Star to have a trench, but when I was working with the mold, I noticed the two halves had shrunk at the point where they met across the middle." [...] As it [...] "would have taken a week of work just to fill and sand and refill this depression," [...] Cantwell suggested a trench to Lucas to save the labor. Lucas liked the idea, and the Death Star model was created by John Stears. The buzzing sound counting down to the Death Star firing its superlaser comes from the Flash Gordon serials. Portraying an incomplete yet powerful space station posed a problem for Industrial Light & Magic's modelmakers for Return of the Jedi. Only the front side of the 137-centimeter model was completed, and the image was flipped horizontally for the final film. Both Death Stars were depicted by a combination of complete and sectional models and matte paintings.|$|E
