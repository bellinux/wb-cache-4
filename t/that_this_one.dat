25|$|There {{are three}} main claims to unwind {{substantive}} transactions that could unjustly enrich some creditors' {{at the expense}} of others. First, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 127 declare every transaction void which is entered after the presentation of a winding up petition, unless approved by a court. In Re Gray’s Inn Construction Co Ltd Buckley LJ held that courts would habitually approve all contracts that were plainly beneficial to a company entered into in good faith in the ordinary course of business. The predominant purpose of the provision is to ensure unsecured creditors are not prejudiced, and the company's assets are not unduly depleted. However, in Re Gray's Inn because a host of transactions honoured by the company's bank, in an overdrawn account, between the presentation and the winding up petition were being granted, this meant unprofitable trading. So, the deals were declared void. In Hollicourt (Contracts) Ltd v Bank of Ireland, the Court of Appeal held that a bank itself which allows overpayments will not be liable to secondarily creditors if transactions are subsequently declared void. It took the view that a bank is not unjustly enriched, despite any fees for its services the bank may receive. Second, under IA 1986 section 238, transactions at an undervalue may be avoided regardless of their purpose, but only up to two years before the onset of insolvency. For example, in Phillips v Brewin Dolphin Bell Lawrie Ltd the liquidators of an insolvent company, AJ Bekhor Ltd, claimed rescind the transfer of assets to a subsidiary, whose shares were then purchased by the investment management house Brewin Dolphin for £1. The only other consideration given by Brewin Dolphin was the promise to carry out a lease agreement for computers, which itself was likely to be unwound and therefore worthless. The House of Lords held that the total package of connected transactions could be taken into account to decide whether a transaction was undervalued or not, and held <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> was.|$|E

Whereas the original has got a three-dimensional quality to it, it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an excitement to it, and a way of involving the viewer <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> lacks." [...] Gibbons has parodied Lichtenstein's derivation of the Novick work.|$|E

[...] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard.

[...] Davies himself laments <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> of the pitfalls of writing a bisexual character, commenting [...] "The trap you fall into with bisexual men is only having them sleep with men." [...] Commenting on the show's postmodern attitude towards bisexuality, or in what Russell T Davies calls [...] "omnisexuality", they continue to remark that [...] "His character brushes against definitions of queer sexuality in that he resists any sort of classification based on sexual orientation." [...] They also comment on the subtexts of particular episodes, such as gay time-travel romance episode [...] "Captain Jack Harkness", and within that the relevance of time-travelling Jack Harkness to tackle the question of forbidden gay attraction in what is post-Brokeback television. In Understanding TV Texts by Phil Wickham, Wickham opines that Captain Jack explicitly [...] "brings to the fore" [...] with his [...] "brazen bisexuality", [...] "something we have to come to expect [...] as viewers of his work". Fans expressed fear that an Americanized fourth series of the show would mean the show would no longer portray Jack's bisexuality, but Davies assured interviewers that Jack's interests in both men and women would be honoured.|$|E
500|$|Barry Walters from Rolling Stone gave a mixed review, {{saying that}} Living Proof [...] "endeavors to make {{lightning}} strike {{twice in the}} same place. [...] Unlike house music or modern R, Cher's twenty-first-century disco is built on fully fleshed songs and detailed arrangements, and the studio wizardry is even grander than before", but also felt that it [...] "lacks its predecessor's unexpected impact". AllMusic's Kerry L.

Josh Regan from Dotmusic gave the album four out of ten stars, stating that Cher's voice was [...] "as strong and distinctive as ever" [...] on the album, but [...] "the uptempo easy listening production courtesy of the likes of Chicane and Stargate means <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> is strictly for the mums and dads". The Dallas Morning News gave the album a C grade, saying Living Proof set itself up for failure by [...] "shamelessly" [...] copying and then overdoing the formula that made its predecessor artistically and commercially contagious. The review finished saying that it was [...] "Believe II sans the imagination, the free-spirited pizzazz that made the former work so well". The album earned Cher a nomination on the Best Dance Recording category for [...] "Love One Another" [...] on the 46th Grammy Awards.

[...] He enjoyed all the storylines in the episode, writing they were interesting and funny enough, and complimented the way they all tied together with such ease. Canning enjoyed Tracy's actions writing that they fit perfectly for the Tracy character, and gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10 rating. [...] "Holy normalsauce, did I ever love this episode", wrote Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons. Her only complaint about this episode was Scott Adsit's absence. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was grateful that the episode focused on NBC, TGS, {{and the work of}} the staff. Sassone wrote that despite [...] "The Funcooker" [...] not being [...] "the most laugh-out-loud episode" [...] he believed it was still funny. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised Jackie Hoffman's performance, noting that her monologue in court was brilliant. He enjoyed all of the episode's storylines, except for Tracy's, which he opined fell flat. In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode a B+ rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall wrote that an episode like [...] "The Funcooker" [...] is [...] "really instructive about why a lot of other shows... haven't quite worked. Even when they have lots of funny things in them, they never really build to a climax in the way <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> did, as everything went wrong at once."

500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{summarized}} the episode as follows: [...] "When all {{was said and}} done, it was another tribute episode, something that can't be uttered by a Glee fan without a sigh and an eye roll." [...] Bell noted that tribute episodes usually mean that [...] "all sense of plot continuity" [...] is forgone, but <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> ranked [...] "at the top {{of all of the}} other Glee tribute episodes because even though it was absurd at times, at least there was a plot—and it kind of made sense". Futterman was more complimentary and described it as the [...] "most effortless tribute episode yet", and Canning wrote that [...] "with songs we know and love and storylines that actually connected and delivered some meaningful and moving moments" [...] it was [...] "more than just a theme episode". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post, however, thought that it was very much like previous tributes in that it also [...] "featured scattered plot lines engineered to include as many songs by said artists as possible" [...] and also [...] "glorified their respective pop stars’ images to an absurd degree". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff also noted the glorification of Jackson, and noted [...] "every time the show turns into an episode about Michael Jackson, it stops dead in its tracks entirely". He stated that what was [...] "weird" [...] about the episode was that [...] "what didn’t work was the spectacle, while what did work were the smaller, character-based stories" [...] which [...] "provided a spine some of the other spectacle-oriented episodes have lacked". Futterman was one of many reviewers who took note of a new feature of this tribute episode when she commented on the [...] "initial whiff of product placement and forced timing" [...] related to the [...] "Immortal World Tour" [...] dialogue. Rae Votta of Billboard thought the inclusion a [...] "brilliant bit of marketing synergy", but TVLine Michael Slezak called it [...] "ridiculously unsubtle product-placement".|$|E
500|$|Rabbi Joseph Schwarz (1850) who {{had lived}} in Palestine for 16 years, {{identified}} the village of Abulnita, 'about 2 English miles east of Shechem', as the site 'where Joseph lies buried'. Western travellers to Palestine in the 19th century described their impressions of the site in travelogues. John Ross Browne (1853) writes: 'We also visited the reputed site of Joseph's Tomb. A rude stone building covers the pretended sepulcher; but the best authorities deny that there was any evidence that Joseph was buried here.' Howard Crosby also visited the site during 1851. He designated it, 'the so-called tomb of Joseph,' describing it as 'a plain white Santon's tomb, or Wely, such as is everywhere seen in Mohammedan countries, excepting <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> is roofless, and consequently lacks the usual white dome. In the interior, a vine grows from a corner, and spreads upon a trellis over the tomb, forming a pleasant bower.' Louis Félicien Joseph Caignart de Saulcy and Edouard de Warren (1853) describe it as 'a small Mussulman oualy (weli, i.e. chapel) [...] said to be the tomb of Joseph,' noting it was just to the east of what the Arabs called Bir-Yakub, Jacob's Well. Hackett noted in 1857 that the tomb is placed diagonally to the walls, instead of parallel, and found 'the walls of the interior covered with the names of pilgrims, representing almost every land and language; though the Hebrew character was the most prominent one.' [...] Thomson noted in 1883 that 'the entire building is fast crumbling to ruin, presenting a most melancholy spectacle.' Being exposed to the weather, 'it has no pall or votive offering of any kind, nor any marks of respect such as are seen at the sepulchres of the most insignificant Muslim saints.' During the late 19th century, sources report the Jewish custom of burning small articles such as gold lace, shawls or handkerchiefs, in the two low pillars {{at either end of the}} tomb. This was done in [...] "memory of the patriarch who sleeps beneath".|$|E
