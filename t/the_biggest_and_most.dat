While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.|$|E

5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share would depend on what they had to offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>and</b> <b>most</b> complex British test series.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>and</b> <b>most</b> ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E
