LeMond's cycling talent—his overall strength, climbing ability, ability to ride a fast time trial and his capacity to recover quickly—all suggested LeMond would be an excellent prospect for <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> Grand Tours.|$|E
5|$|This type of {{profile is}} common for dives at sites {{where there is a}} flat sea-bed or where the diver remains at the same place {{throughout}} the dive to work. It is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> profile for decompression for a given maximum depth and time because inert gas absorption continues at maximum rate for most of the dive. Decompression tables are drawn up {{based on the assumption that}} the diver may follow a square profile.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment is considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> of any entry {{test in the}} Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected {{for their ability to}} work in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection is open to all serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E

Originally, UPIITA was meant to hold a larger number of students, but since 75% of students quit before the 3rd semester, (because of the high level knowledge needed) most classrooms were turned into technology labs.|$|R

25|$|Artist Arnold Friberg was {{commissioned}} by Chevrolet to paint a series commemorating the 100th anniversary of American intercollegiate football in 1969.

These paintings were used during the 1969 Chevrolet advertising campaign and were among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> and exciting pieces Mr. Friberg had done. These paintings were such a success that they were taken on tour and shown at universities throughout the country.|$|E

25|$|Construction between Rena and Støren {{commenced}} {{during the}} fall of 1872, and by the following summer of 1873 there were 900 people working on the line. <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> part was through Ålen where {{a large amount of}} blasting was needed. A challenge was that {{during the fall}} harvest many people returned to the farms, with only half the men left for construction work. By March 1874 the workforce peaked at 2,100 men. That year there was a short strike, following demands for higher wages, which had been set at 1.75 kroner per day. Construction problems were the most severe in Gauldalen and Drøyliene; at the latter the Tamlaget Tunnel had to be built. Another challenge was the reliable sourcing of lumber; forest owners were often not willing to sign contracts and the railway often had to cut its own timber.|$|E
25|$|First Year Orientation Period, (FYOP) is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>demanding</b> {{challenge}} many cadets {{will face}} during their {{time at the}} college.

Prior to the 2015-2016 academic year, cadets would attend 2 week program called recruit camp in which cadets would undergo some basic military training before entering the college. With newly hired cadets completing half of their BMOQ before attending RMC, recruit camp is no longer necessary. FYOP is like Frosh week at civilian universities, except it lasts four weeks and cadets are placed under extreme stress for nearly the entire duration. FYOP begins with the Arch parade where the entire First Year class is marched onto College grounds by their FYOP staff consisting of Third and Fourth Years.|$|E

Contemporary cinematographer Anil Mehta has noted the mastery of Irani's cinematic techniques in shooting the film, including his [...] "intricate tracks and pans, the detailed mise en scène patterns Irani conceived, even for brief shots—in the studios {{as well as on}} location". The film took about three years to make, from early organisation, planning, and scripting to completion of filming.
