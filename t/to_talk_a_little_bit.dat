5000|$|The one-hour show is {{hosted by}} comedian Mo Mandel (from Comedy Central Presents). He travels across the United States and pits two bar owners {{against each other}} {{to see who can}} turn the most profit. But the twist is they have to run each other's bars for a night. How the show works is Mandel {{introduces}} each bar owner. Each owner then gets <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about what their bar offers and how they run things. Then the owners travel to each other's bars to spend a week there and meet the staff. In repeated interviews, the owners talk about how they feel about how the other bar is run and what types of changes they would make if they were the owner. Later on during the week, the owners [...] "take over" [...] the establishment and implement their rules and TV viewers observe how the staff reacts to these changes. Many times, there is friction between the staff and the owners at this stage in the competition. One major stipulation of the show is that the new owner cannot fire any staff members for breaking any of the new rules, but can discipline them in other ways. Finally, there is the [...] "relaunch" [...] night where the owner has complete control of the bar. This is the night that counts towards the profit totals which will determine who wins the competition. The winner receives a $10,000 grand prize.|$|E
40|$|I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> {{about the}} future of {{campaign}} finance reform and the future of campaign finance scholarship in the wake of Citizens United. Here I am going to draw upon my own work and the work of some of the folks in this room, including Richard Briffault and Rick Hasen, so please imagine a properly footnoted law review article scrolling behind me. I want to make three points. First, I will argue that Citizens United has cut off most of the traditional pathways for campaign finance reform. Second, I {{want to talk about the}} new directions in which this development will push us; I will talk very briefly about future reform proposals in the campaign finance context, some of which we have already talked about today. Finally, I will talk about where I think campaign finance should go. Here I 2 ̆ 7 ll argue that, just as brown is the new black, lobbying is the new campaign finance. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about why I think these two areas are going to be tied closely together in practice and in theory. I 2 ̆ 7 ll even kick in new a policy proposal at the end by way of a party favor: a public finance analog for lobbying reform...|$|E

It 2 ̆ 7 s become conventional that we 2 ̆ 7 re {{in the middle of a}} copyright war. 2 ̆ 7 I tried to track down who started calling it that, and what I can tell you is that about ten years ago, about the time that copyright lawyers everywhere were arguing about the White House Information Infrastructure Task Force 2 ̆ 2 White Paper 2 ̆ 2 Report, we started seeing the phrase 2 ̆ 2 copyright war 2 ̆ 2 used as a figure of speech to express some of the passion and vitriol that characterized those arguments. It popped up more and more often until, by a couple of years ago, all the irony had leached out of the phrase and people were matter-of-factly referring to what 2 ̆ 7 s going on as the 2 ̆ 2 copyright war 2 ̆ 2 in news accounts, law review articles, and weblogs. So, by 2003, the usage had become standard. That year, by the way, was the year we saw the district court decision in Grokster, the Supreme Court decision in Eldred, and the first lawsuits filed against individual consumers for using peer-to-peer file sharing networks...|$|E

40|$|First, I {{would like}} to thank the {{organizers}} for inviting me to discuss this very interesting work by Markus and Yuliy. As a preface to my discussion, when the organizers asked me to discuss this paper, they said that they believed I had some different perspectives on deleveraging and balance sheet issues, and they wanted me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about my own research in that regard. Because, as we all know, academics need encouragement to promote their own research. Let me start with what is my main take-away from Markus ’ and Yuliy’s exciting research agenda: heterogeneity is paramount in macroeconomic models. When faced with large aggregate shocks, representative agent based macroeconomic models are insufficient. As Markus and Yuliy put it, “any model that studies financial instability and the role of financial frictions must depart from the representative agent analysis. ” This important point has been developed in a series of their studies (Brunnermeier and Sannikov 2012 a, 2012 b, 2012 c) ...|$|E
40|$|Today {{we would}} like to discuss some {{problems}} involving Long-range reverberation in shallow water. Fig. 1 The title of the talk is "Nonreciprocity of Long-range Reverberation in Wedged Continental Shelf". The talk is divided into four parts. First {{we would like}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about the background of current research on long-range reverberation in shallow water. The problem seems to fall into a "dilemma " (endless loop) with no way out. Second, we introduced an averaged angular power spectrum method for long-range reverberation in the Pekeris model to show how we could bypass such 'dilemma'. Based on a resulted transformation relation between arbitrary angle dependence of bottom scattering and the range dependence of reverberation in shallow water, some experimental data on bottom scattering at small grazing angles and low frequencies will be given in the third part. In the last part, using the WKB approximation to the adiabatic normal mode theory, we 3 xtend the problem into wedged homogeneous shallow water. The result shows that the monostatic reverberation intensities, obtaine...|$|E

40|$|If {{we want to}} {{say what}} “fundamentality” means, we have to start by {{approaching}} what we generally see at the empty place of the predicate “____ is fundamental”. We generally talk about fundamental entities and fundamental theories. At this article, I tried to make a metaphysical approach of what is for something to be fundamental, and I also tried <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of fundamental incomplete and complete theories. To do that, I start stating the notion of “entity” and looking at the difference at perceived entities. The difference led us to talk about the entities’ structures and their powers, and about the supervenience between these last two. The supervenience talk made us to see the fight between emergentism and reductionism as the difference between the irreducibility of laws and the reducibility of powers and structures to lower-order domains. Then, we conclude that “fundamentality” is a mereological relation – a relation that a whole structure has to a certain combination of its structural parts or that a power has to a certain combination of its constituent powers – of to be identical and to exist in virtue of them...|$|E
30|$|In the {{teaching}} of The Tao (Way) and its Te (Virtue), there are two key concepts: Tao and Te. I discussed the Tao previously and now I’d like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about Te. Te, usually translated as “Virtue”, is conformity to principles. Te is, in a sense, manifestation of the Tao, the revelation of {{the true nature of}} the Tao. Occasionally Te is employed to signify the quality of natural goodness, which is the result of enlightenment and of the manifestation and function of the Tao in man and all that exists in the universe. The word “Te” in Taoist literature indicates power or strength. It means that all things contain an inherent power or strength that comes from their own essential being or true inner nature. This power derives from the fact that our true self is an expression of the Tao, because it is intrinsically connected with the power of the universe. However, the idea of Virtue (Te) is that of power exercised without the use of force and without inappropriate interference in the existing order of things. Virtue is an inward quality and state. To do right is to obey the laws of nature, of virtue, and to live in conformity and harmony with them. Failure to do so brings automatic and equally natural retribution, disharmony, disruption, and consequent misery.|$|E

40|$|I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about Loving v. Virginia, {{a little}} bit about some other issues, but mostly, I want to talk about marriage. I stand before you as a married man. I have been married for sixteen years and change. Marriage is a sacred {{institution}} for me as a Christian and a vitally important institution for the construction of society. Every society we know of either has had marriage in some form or has left us ambiguous evidence. There are some ancient societies about which we are not sure. But what anthropologists tell us today {{is that there is no}} society of which it can confidently be said, 2 ̆ 2 These folks did not, in fact, get married. 2 ̆ 2 Marriage seems to be natural to the human species. Now, of course, in today 2 ̆ 7 s terms, when we think about marriage, we think not just about Loving v. Virginia, about which I 2 ̆ 7 ll say more in a bit, but also about the question of same-sex marriage, about which I 2 ̆ 7 ll say more in a bit as well. One of the great virtues of a conference like this one is precisely, I think, the desire to celebrate marriage itself and take from that celebration lessons for other issues that may divide us. The issue of same-sex marriage is, of course, a tremendously divisive one in the nation and among scholars. Probably today 2 ̆ 7 s conference would have been more fruitful if there had been more people here who have a firm position in favor of it, as a way of generating some interesting conversation. But then I hear that last night you had some of that conversation anyway...|$|E
40|$|This report, "Archives in the European Union", was {{published}} and is generally {{referred to as}} the `Black Book' [...] you may have your Doomsday Book, but we have our Black Book, that's our European Archives Book - and in June 1994 the Council of Ministers again took note of the experts' report and called for action. And there I would like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about a number of priority areas that were defined that led to concrete actions. Firstly training. A whole series of training programmes have been set up and there are perhaps three activities in the field of training worth particular attention.

Then there was the trans-national Darmstadt Training Seminar for Archivists, which took place in September 1996 and was co-funded by the European Union's Leonardo Programme, and organised by German, Austrian and Dutch Archives Associations and brought together specialists from more than 20 European countries. And then again we are bringing together more and more people from Eastern Central Europe as well, {{which is one of the}} aims of our co-operation. The role of the professional archivist associations and their contribution to professional training in the European Union member states and in the applicant member states were particularly highlighted in Darmstadt.
