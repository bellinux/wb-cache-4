5|$|In Mogadishu, Hawiye {{residents}} {{resented the}} Islamic Courts Union's defeat. They distrusted the TFG, {{which was at}} the time dominated by individuals from the Darod clan, believing that it was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> Darod interests in lieu of the Hawiye. Additionally, they feared reprisals for massacres committed in 1991 in Mogadishu by Hawiye militants against Darod civilians, and were dismayed by Ethiopian involvement. Critics of the TFG likewise charged that its federalist platform was part of a plot by the Ethiopian government to keep Somalia weak and divided. During its first few months in the capital, the TFG was initially restricted to key strategic points, with the large northwestern and western suburbs controlled by Hawiye rebels. In March 2007, President Ahmed announced plans to forcibly disarm militias in the city. According to the ISA, a coalition of local insurgents led by Al-Shabaab subsequently launched a wave of attacks against the TFG and Ethiopian troops. The allied forces in return mounted a heavy-handed response.|$|E
