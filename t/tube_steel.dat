500|$|The current {{terminal}} building {{was designed by}} the Charlotte based architectural firm of Odell Associates and was built {{to serve as a}} replacement for the 1953 terminal, later demolished in 2005. Construction of the terminal commenced in 1987, and it opened in October 1989 at a final cost of $25 million. The Y-shaped building features a front of blue-tinted, reflecting glass with exposed white triangular <b>tube</b> <b>steel</b> trusses. The lobby interior includes an arched brick wall leading out into a central plaza and front courtyard at the main entrance. The terminal was constructed to handle passengers expected through the year 2010, with a design that allows for expansion when warranted. Outside the terminal is an abstract, steel sculpture by New York artist Albert Paley entitled Aurora. Installed in October 1990, the sculpture is [...] feet in height.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was a pine framed, plywood covered hexagonal box, {{with the}} straight edged fin an integral part. The rudder was rounded and horn balanced. [...] Though the rudder was wood framed and covered, the tailplane, mounted {{just above the}} fuselage and externally braced from below, had a <b>tube</b> <b>steel</b> structure and was fabric covered. The elevators were balanced by an elastic rope to the control column.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{in three}} sections. Behind the engine compartment {{there was a}} simple duraluminum section containing the open, tandem cockpits, the forward one being below mid-chord. The rear fuselage was a fabric covered <b>tube</b> <b>steel</b> structure, with the wood and fabric in-flight adjustable strut braced tailplane mounted on top. The fin, of similar construction, [...] was broad and round edged, carrying the rudder which extended between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. Production machines had a new, triangular fin. The undercarriage was fixed and wide track (2.60m or 8ft6in), with near vertical main legs mounted on the forward lift struts. The tops of the legs were further braced to the upper fuselage. [...] Split axles were fixed at the bottoms of the forward lift struts; single wheels were fitted with balloon tyres and had differential brakes for ground steering. [...] The first prototype had a steerable tailskid, replaced by a tailwheel in later aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The flat sided {{fuselage}} of the A-4 {{was built}} around four <b>tube</b> <b>steel</b> longerons with internal tube bracing {{and covered with}} a mixture of fabric and plywood. A [...] M-26 (KIM) 7-cylinder radial engine was mounted in the nose, cowled in a Townend ring and with its output shaft pointing downwards at an angle of 4.5°. Its small, low wings were rectangular plan, wooden structures, each built around a pair of spars and braced from above by a pair of parallel struts, one from each spar to the upper fuselage longeron. They had 5° of dihedral but their semicircular tips were inclined upwards by a further 35°. Conventional ailerons occupying almost 30% of the overall wing area provided roll control. [...] There were two open cockpits in tandem, the forward, passenger seat ahead of the wing trailing edge and close to the rotor axis. Dual control was fitted. At the rear the fin was long, rounded at the front but with a flat top. It mounted an unbalanced rudder, roughly rectangular though rounded at the rear corners, which extended to the keel. [...] Small like the wing, the tailplane was braced from below and had swept leading edges; its elevators were more generous, with rounded tips and a large cut-out for rudder movement.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC) is a {{new kind}} of {{building}} material with high strength and other good performance. The combination of RPC and <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> will compensate the brittleness of RPC and enhance the stability of <b>steel</b> <b>tube,</b> and the loading capacity of the RPC filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> will be improved. Five RPC filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns are designed and tested to obtain the ultimate load bearing capacity, the deformation and the strain information. During the loading process, the concrete and the <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> of the RPC filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns are loaded simultaneously. The loading results show that the deformation of the RPC filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns are mainly in elastic phase before the loading capacity is up to the ultimate value. The test load decreases to be 80 %~ 90 % of the ultimate loading value and then it changes to be smooth. The failure mode of the RPC filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns is ductile. The test loading capacity is compared with the formula from the reference. The tested ultimate load bearing capacity of the steam cured RPC filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns is higher than the calculated value. The calculated value is safe for the engineering application. The study is useful for the research and application of RPC filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> column...|$|R

40|$|Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) jackets {{have been}} widely used to confine {{concrete}} columns to enhance their load-carrying capacity and ductility. More recently, the use of FRP jackets to improve the performance of hollow <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> and concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> has also been explored. This paper presents the results of a recent experimental study in which the behaviour of FRP-confined circular concrete-filled thin <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> under axial compression was examined. The experimental study included three series of tests and was focussed on the effects of the diameter-to-thickness ratio of the <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> and the confinement stiffness of the FRP jacket. The test results revealed that the FRP jacket either substantially delayed or completely suppressed the local buckling failure mode of the <b>steel</b> <b>tube.</b> As a result, the compressive behaviour of the concrete-filled thin <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> as well as the concrete is significantly improved in terms of both strength and ductility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract：FRP-confined {{concrete}} filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> may fully use {{the character}} of FRP-confined concrete and concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube.</b> Based on the analysis of existing experimental data, the formula of ultimate bearing capacity of FRP-confined concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> is proposed. The mechanical behavior of FRP-confined concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> is mainly related to the equivalent confinement effect coefficient before the rupture of FRP. Based on the static equilibrium condition, the equivalent conversion section is adopted; taking efξ as main parameter, the simplified stress-strain model of FRP-confined concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> is established. The predictions of the model agree well with test data...|$|R

40|$|Circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> {{filled with}} steel-reinforced {{high-strength}} concrete {{is a new}} model of composite column design. The fire resistance of this composite column was investigated experimentally. One circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> column filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete and one circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> column filled with high- strength concrete were tested under axial load and fire. The test results show that the axial deformations of both kinds of the composite columns under the same load level have experienced three stages variation:the initial expansion deformation stage,the compression deformation gradual growth stage and the damage stage with the dramatic increasing in compression deformation. The second compression stable development stage of the circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete is much longer than that of the circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> column filled with high-strength concrete. Thus the fire endurance of the circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete reaches 166 minutes while the fire endurance of the circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> column filled with high-strength concrete only reaches 46 minutes. Thus encasig section steel can remarkably improve the fire endurance of the circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> filled with high-strength concrete. The research results can provide beneficial reference for the fire design of circular <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> composite columns filled with steel-reinforced concrete...|$|R
