25|$|I will {{no longer}} {{participate}} in this transparent ploy to gather media attention for Finkelstein and his publisher. I answer all of his charges fully in Chapter 16 of my forthcoming book The Case For Peace, {{to be published by}} Wiley in August. My book deals with important and current issues, such as the prospects for peace in the immediate future. Finkelstein's deals with the irrelevant past that both Israelis and Palestinians are trying to put behind them. Let the marketplace judge our books. As far as I'm concerned, the public controversy is over and I will comment no further on the false charges leveled by Finkelstein and the UCP. Let them henceforth pay for their own publicity, instead of trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the cheap by launching phony attacks against me.|$|E

John could only play upright pianos. The railways rang and said they could not get the upright around the passageway corners of the train so it would be impossible <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> board. Tom Greer demanded it be put on the train somehow even if it meant dismantling the piano and putting it back together - [...] "key by key". In desperation, engineers arrived and took {{off the side of the}} carriage, loaded the piano on with a forklift, before replacing the carriage wall. The train was christened Spirit of 96.|$|E
