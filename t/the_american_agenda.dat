Its plan was based upon selection, or precision attack by USAAF forces in daylight, supported by the area bombing methods of Bomber Command at night. Harris, however, was reluctant to divert forces for precision attacks, as Bomber Command had not been trained in precision bombing, nor would the equipment in the bombers allow for a precision ability until 1944. In theory, the British bomber attack assumed a precision ability, but nothing had been done to ensure such practice. Instead, Harris favoured area bombing against industrial cities. Bomber Command's success during the Battle of the Ruhr and the Battle of Hamburg, and the failures of the USAAF to make an impact in 1943 also seemed to vindicate Harris' policy. Heavy losses among unescorted bombers for little return would ensure a suspension of deep penetration raids in October 1943. It was not until the introduction of a long-range fighter that could escort bombers deep into Germany and back, that a daylight strategy became possible.|$|E

Although the health status of Americans has changed significantly for the better during this century, further improvements are necessary, especially among high risk subgroups within the population who have not been effectively reached by traditional health promotion strategies. Past efforts, aimed at individuals modifying their risk factors, have neglected to address environmental factors that contribute to disease risk. This points to the need for an integrated approach where problems are addressed as properties of the systems in which individuals behave. This paper reviews selected health trends in the United States, discusses limitations of the current approach to health promotion, presents a comprehensive definition of prevention, and provides principles for planning that may facilitate improved health status in this country. health promotion risk factors environmental public policy...|$|E

Introduces a cognitive flow chart for post-Cold War decision making which depicts naval arms control as a FIFTH ORDER question, which awaits consensus answers for higher political decisions. A "snapshot" of US participation in naval arms control is presented which highlights the fact that the US Navy does not receive enough credit for vast amounts of naval arms control already underway. Recommends that future naval arms control not be undertaken by negotiated treaty.

40|$|Indiaâ€™s {{foreign policy}} has had an {{anomalous}} quality since the time Jawaharlal Nehru resolutely attempted {{to steer clear of}} Cold War alliances. This continues to be so given Indiaâ€™s unique situation of establishing â€œstrategic relationsâ€ with both Israel and Iran, as part of its Greater Middle East policy. A study of this paradox assumes significance for various reasons. One, it offers a glimpse into the way India is reordering its foreign policy in the post Cold War, as part of its clamour for Great Power status, thus presenting a westward complement to its familiar â€˜Look East policyâ€™ which seeks to engage regions beyond South Asia. It also provides a view of the complexities involved in endorsing <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>agenda</b> in a geopolitical neighbourhood, transformed by the September 11 attacks, and yet, one that affects Indiaâ€™s security because of its energy reserves and Islamist ferment. To this end, this study analyses Indiaâ€™s foreign policy toward the Middle East and Central Asia since the late 1990 s, with a specific focus on its relations with Israel, Iran and Iraq that reviews the way it reconciles immediate security needs with competing realities of economic interdependence and political sensitivities. The paper also evaluates the challenges India faces in strengthening links with Afghanistan and Central Asia.

40|$|This thesis {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point {{the fact that}} this period witnessed easily the highest and most consistent levels of indigenous feature film production in the history of Scottish film culture. By the end of the 1990 s, many observers proposed that it was for the first time possible to talk about the existence of a 'Scottish cinema' and/or a 'Scottish film industry', where before only occasional Scottish films and/or Scottish filmmakers could be discerned. This thesis argues that the most important precipitant of Scottish cinema's unprecedented 1990 s industrial expansion involved local filmmakers' pre-mediated, industrially aspirant adaptation of American cinematic precedents and working practices. The nature of this 'adaptation' was two-fold. On one hand, it was institutional, relating to the reformation and creation of the kind of financial, training and plant infrastructures which make feature production possible. On the other, it was creative, relating to the generic and aesthetic influences and reference points preferred by many 1990 s Scottish filmmakers. This thesis presents the trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>agenda</b> which dominated 1990 s Scottish cinema within a ??Rise and Fall' paradigm. It proposes that {{the first half of the}} decade witnessed predominantly progressive local engagements, both industrially and ideologically speaking, with American film industrial and cultural practices. The latter part of the 1990 s, however, was characterised by regressive misinterpretations of earlier, beneficial transatlantic appropriations. By the end of the decade, two things were clear about Scottish cinema's 1990 s American agenda. Firstly, that agenda had either created or consolidated many previously lacking material conditions necessary for a sustainable national cinema. Secondly, that agenda had largely exhausted itself as a convincing blueprint for the further development of Scottish cinema...|$|E

An examination of classical music culture in West Berlin reveals how the American Military Government used classical music {{as a tool for}} re-education and re-orientation. Between the years 1945 and 1949, <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>agenda</b> evolved from combating Nazism to containing Communism, as alterations in music control policies reflected the incipient Cold War. An analysis of concert repertoires, interviews, musical scores, photographs, program notes, radio broadcasts, and governmental correspondence, exposes how American authorities altered the performance context of German classical music The early postwar experience of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, under American cultural officer John Bitter’s guidance, exemplifies the irony of encouraging greater artistic freedom through increased censorship and control, providing an illuminating case study with regard to American cultural re-education efforts. As the primary ensemble residing in the American sector, the Philharmonic would be complicit in its own symbolic domination, to borrow Pierre Bourdieu’s term, by acquiescing to certain American Military Government requirements in order to resume concertizing, such as performing for American troops and agreeing to certain alterations in personnel. By the end of 1947, as tensions increased between American and Soviet forces, Berlin’s cultural life became a new battleground as each occupier vied for the support of German artists and audiences. The evolving role of American occupying forces within Berlin’s political culture was paralleled by their treatment of German arts organizations, as the agenda shifted from a punitive position to one of patronage in the span of a few short years. Although much scholarship on postwar Berlin has rendered its ruins simply as allegories for the moral depravity of a nation, I believe we can instead locate a productive tension within the city’s destruction. Berlin’s cultural Wiederaufbau occurred not over but rather within the ruins of the cityscape, transforming the ruin from a passive space to a site of negotiation, renegotiation, and even transgression...|$|E
40|$|Is Australia {{enhancing}} {{its economic}} and geo-political interests by negotiating free trade agreements (FTAs) {{or is it}} simply mindlessly engaging in world trade policy? While many commentators believe the latter to be true, Australia’s approach is more thoughtful and calculating than it is given credit for in popular media and the academic community. Australia is engaged in several bilateral and regional negotiations. The most notable are the mega-regional processes led by the US and China – the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), respectively. This is the most desirable way forward both economically and politically. Australia would not {{be better served by}} focusing its trade policy on the region or adopting a Sino-focused policy. The choice of TPP or Asia and the US or China is a false dichotomy; the implications of “choosing” are too complicated to predict with any certainty. The choice is rather how and on what terms to participate in the different fora. Australia and its place in the world As a starting point, it must be remembered that Australia’s choices are limited. Australia is not the prize, nor is it in a position of power in any forum. It is a middle power increasingly dependent on world trade and investment, especially exports of agricultural products. Recent events such as the global financial crisis (and its ongoing effects) and the high value of the dollar have challenged Australia’s economy and significantly increased the importance of securing stable export markets. Australia is in no position to dictate trade terms. Instead, this nation must seek gains within the framework established by the larger players. Of course, the optimal solution would be for Australia to seek these market opportunities through the World Trade Organisation (WTO). But Jagdish Bhagwati’s call to eliminate the “termites (FTAs) in the trading system” is long outdated. Focusing exclusively on the multilateral negotiations would be to ignore reality to the detriment of Australia. The Doha Round is all but technically dead. FTAs are steadily eroding the state of equal opportunity for Australian exporters. Like it or not, the real game is being played outside the WTO. While a return to multilateralism is likely {{at some point in the}} future, the timing is uncertain and the outcomes will be based on the templates established in recent FTAs. If Australia wishes to influence the future of the WTO it must participate in the FTAs of today. A multi-pronged trade strategy Most modern FTAs not only focus on tariffs but also on eliminating other forms of barriers to trade. The mega-regional providing the most innovations and rule-making - not only in terms of trade barriers but also “fair” trade - is the TPP. To the US, the value of the TPP will be in its ability to expand the coverage, scope and depth of FTAs to include rules on a variety of areas including state-owned enterprises, environment and regulatory coherence of standards. I propose the ultimate aim is to garner consensus in order to make it easier to bring these innovations and rules into the multilateral system. It is in Australia’s interests to play a role in developing such norms. Until Japan joined the negotiations in 2013, the potential economic gains to the US from the TPP were miniscule. The US already has FTAs in place with most negotiating partners and the economics of the TPP were quite simply unimportant. The economic insignificance of the agreement to the US can be contrasted to the potential gains to Australia. The TPP could offer Australia incremental but increased access to the US and Canadian agricultural markets. Australia will also likely see increased export opportunities to Japan. Even though Australia did not gain much market access for agricultural products in its recent FTA with Japan – which has attracted considerable criticism – Australian exporters should temper their disappointment with the knowledge that further gains should come from the TPP. The Australia-Japan FTA must be viewed not as a standalone agreement but as a mere entrée providing initial morsels in anticipation of the main course to follow. In this regard, Australia will gain when Japan and the US offer reciprocal concessions. The strategy, therefore, appears to be to wait for the US to pay for more substantial gains. We can do more than one deal at once It is important to note that while China was initially sceptical of (if not hostile to) the TPP, it has softened its views. There is no evidence to suggest it is seeking to punish TPP members. In fact, Australia-China FTA negotiations have pushed on throughout the TPP negotiations and Australia is included in the RCEP negotiations. Australia does not have to choose China or Asia over any other negotiating partner. New Zealand, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam and Singapore are similarly negotiating both the TPP and RCEP. Turning to the RCEP, there is little reason to believe this agreement will offer any innovations on rule-making. it is also doubtful that it will produce significant market access opportunities. What the RCEP does offer is strategic engagement and geopolitical value in the region most important to Australia’s trading and diplomatic future. Australia is not solely focusing on mega-regional trade agreements. Of late, Australia’s bilateral focus is squarely on the near-abroad - recent FTAs include ASEAN-NZ (2009), Malaysia (2012), Korea and Japan (both 2014). Negotiations with China remain ongoing but may conclude soon, while talks with India and Indonesia are at an embryonic stage. All of these countries are negotiating multiple agreements with several countries. In the process, they have been or continue to erode Australia’s position and export market. Australian FTAs are for the most part not about rules formation – they are standard agreements with market access at the core. The end game Australia has behaved reasonably and thoughtfully in formulating and executing its trade strategy. Its main aim is clearly to secure market access. Deeper regional economic engagement is not just desirable but necessary for Australia to maintain (and potentially increase) its export markets. Australia’s recent negotiations are in line with this objective. To date, Australia has secured preferential access to three of its biggest trading partners – the US, Japan and Korea. Upon completion of the Australia–China FTA all its significant export markets will be covered. These agreements provide Australia with significant preferences over competitor countries to all important export markets. No other country, with the exception of Canada, will have better or more complete coverage of its important markets. At the same time, Australia has to understand the potential significance of being involved in regional negotiations of geo-political interests as well as the importance of innovations and rule-making being negotiated into the TPP. This is not to say that Australia agrees with or would advocate for <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>agenda</b> on innovations and rules. However, being involved will at a minimum allow Australia’s position to be considered, debated and potentially be included in the final form. Australia must continue to stake out its best position now and into the future in order to protect export opportunities and influence future WTO negotiations. The only way of achieving this is to engage in all forms of arrangements. It could be that Australia is simply pursuing “mindless engagement” without a clear sense of the key economic objectives, but the evidence does not point in that direction. Australia is benefiting strategically and economically by engaging in all types of trade negotiations.
