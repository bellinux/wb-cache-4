25|$|Of this {{head and}} two other pieces of {{sculpture}} exhibited by Brâncuși in July, 1913, at the Allied Artists' Exhibition in London, Roger Fry said in The Nation, August 2: Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures have not, I think, been seen before in England. His three heads are the most remarkable works of sculpture at the Albert Hall. Two are in brass and one in stone. They show a technical skill which is almost disquieting, a skill which might lead him, in default of any overpowering imaginative purpose, to become a brilliant pasticheur. But it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was evidence of passionate conviction; that the simplification of forms was no mere exercise in plastic design, but a real interpretation of the rhythm of life. These abstract vivid forms into which he compresses his heads give a vivid presentment of character; they are not empty abstractions, but filled with a content which has been clearly, and passionately apprehended.|$|E
500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best thing that happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E
500|$|Romantic friendships {{were also}} {{popular in the}} U.S. Enigmatic poet Emily Dickinson wrote over 300 letters and poems to Susan Gilbert, who later became her sister-in-law, and engaged in another romantic {{correspondence}} with Kate Scott Anthon. Anthon broke off their relationship the same month Dickinson entered self-imposed lifelong seclusion. Nearby in Hartford, Connecticut, African American freeborn women Addie Brown and Rebecca Primus left evidence of their passion in letters: [...] "No kisses is like youres". In Georgia, Alice Baldy wrote to Josie Varner in 1870, [...] "Do {{you know that if}} you touch me, or speak <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> is not a nerve of fibre in my body that does not respond with a thrill of delight?" ...|$|E

500|$|Also, {{promptly}} {{after the}} war started, she attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals {{to the war effort}} but the French National Bank refused to accept them. [...] She did buy war bonds, using her Nobel Prize money. She said:I am going to give up the little gold I possess. [...] I shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> is something else: by sheer laziness I had allowed the money for my second Nobel Prize to remain in Stockholm in Swedish crowns. This is the chief part of what we possess. I should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. The state needs it. Only, I have no illusions: this money will probably be lost. She was also an active member in committees of Polonia in France dedicated to the Polish cause. After the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, Radiology in War (1919).|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{prepared}} {{his famous}} epigram on his own. In a post-flight press conference, {{he said that}} he decided on the words [...] "just prior to leaving the LM [...]" [...] In a 1983 interview in Esquire Magazine, Armstrong explained to George Plimpton: [...] "I always knew there was a good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the chances of a successful touchdown on the moon surface were about even money—fifty–fifty... Most people don't realize how difficult the mission was. So it didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was much point in thinking of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." [...] In 2012, brother Dean Armstrong claimed that Neil had shown him a note with a draft of the line months before the launch, although historian Andrew Chaikin, who had interviewed the astronaut in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that he had ever claimed coming up with the line spontaneously during the mission.|$|E
500|$|Neither Carter nor Duchovny were {{contracted}} {{to work on}} the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of season in order to bring the two on board for an eighth season. After the airing of [...] "Requiem", Duchovny expressed his intentions to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> was not much else to do in terms of the character. So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer, director, and actor." [...] Rumors began spreading—and were eventually confirmed—that, since Duchovny had not expressed an interest to appear as a main character in the eighth season, that another character would take Mulder's place. Many fans on the internet believed that Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, would take the role; Pileggi later called this guess [...] "ridiculous." ...|$|E

500|$|Because {{there was}} still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show's last, the {{character}} of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in [...] "Requiem" [...] to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series. He explained, [...] "I was kind of a free agent after season seven, and <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> was not much else to do in terms of the character. So it was really about me wanting to pursue other parts of my career as a writer, director, and actor."

500|$|M.I.A. {{extended}} her middle {{finger to the}} camera {{near the end of}} her verse in [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin instead of singing the word [...] "shit", and the media compared the incident to Janet Jackson's 2004 wardrobe malfunction. According to People, [...] "Call it a finger malfunction? Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna expressed her disappointment in an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She said that it was a [...] "teenager ... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. to do, and was [...] "out of place" [...] in the show: [...] "I was really surprised. I didn't know anything about it. I wasn't happy about it. I understand it's punk rock and everything, but <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was such a feeling of love and good energy and positivity; it seemed negative." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{disagreed}} with Fox News' Chris Wallace in 2006 when Wallace {{asked why the}} American people were beginning to lose confidence in President Bush, saying, [...] "Well, I don't think they are. And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{a letter}} filed with the UK Registrar of Companies, the {{auditors}} to Gyrus resigned [...] "partly because of its client's accounting for the securities". KPMG qualified Gyrus' accounts {{because they could not}} ascertain that Axam was not a related party. The auditors also took issue with the accounting treatment of the preference shares. In its audit letter to Gyrus Group dated 26 April 2010, KPMG considered that there were [...] "circumstances connected with our ceasing to hold office that should be {{brought to the attention of}} the company's members or creditors." [...] Ernst & Young, the firm that succeeded KPMG, also expressed reservations about the 2010 Gyrus accounts for uncertainty, due to the lack of information about Axam. Bloomberg noted that both Gyrus annual reports were filed late: instead of filing within the nine-month statutory limit, the accounts were filed more than a year from the company's year end. In late November 2011 Michael Andrew, KPMG International global chairman, said his firm had complied with its legal obligations to pass on information related to Olympus's 2008 acquisition of Gyrus, and were removed as auditors for so doing. Andrew said: [...] "It's pretty evident <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was very, very significant fraud and that a number of parties had been complicit." [...] However, the while the Japanese firm forced a ¥71 billion restatement of dubious valuation of certain acquired assets, the firm signed off on the financial statements in the same year that contained questionable figures other members of its global network in UK and elsewhere had apparently expressed grave reservations over.|$|E
2500|$|Bisbee {{was asked}} the same question, but {{preferred}} {{to focus on the}} facts of his case. He stressed that [...] "hat was reported to them was basically a headline: 'Things were bad in OB and the administration was responsible.'" [...] Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked about the Pickering test: [...] "Do you think that even protected speech could also serve to demonstrate sufficient disruption to the employer's operation that a firing could be justified?" [...] Bisbee conceded that it could, but [...] "it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> has got to be some reasonable basis for thinking that the speech was doing that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among Steiner's {{non-traditional}} views, in {{his autobiography}} titled Errata from 1997, Steiner relates his sympathetic stance towards {{the use of public}} houses since his college years at the University of Chicago. As Steiner states, [...] "My virginity offended Alfie (his college room-mate). He found it ostentatious and vaguely corrupt in a nineteen-year-old... He sniffed the fear in me with disdain. And marched me off to Cicero, Illinois, a town justly ill famed but, by virtue of its name, reassuring <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> he organized, with casual authority, an initiation as thorough as it was gentle. It is this unlikely gentleness, the caring under circumstances so outwardly crass, that blesses me still." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 2001, Elizabeth Filkin cleared Vaz {{of failing}} to {{register}} payments to his wife's law firm by the Hinduja brothers, but {{said that he had}} colluded with his wife to conceal the payments. Filkin's report said that the payments had been given to his wife for legal advice on immigration issues and concluded that Vaz had gained no direct personal benefit, and that Commons rules did not require him to disclose payments made to his wife. She did, however, criticise him for his secrecy, saying, [...] "It is clear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> has been deliberate collusion over many months between Mr Vaz and his wife to conceal this fact and to prevent me from obtaining accurate information about his possible financial relationship with the Hinduja family".|$|E
2500|$|He {{added that}} the medical program at Michigan was very good, and their {{laboratories}} [...] "especially fine." [...] While at Michigan, he was elected into the fraternity of Psi Upsilon. [...] With respect to fraternity life, Ward wrote: [...] "The boys were very good <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> and among other things elected me {{a member of the}} Psi Upsilon fraternity. [...] There was a nice set of boys in the chapter and I used to have my room at the chapter house. [...] It made life at Ann Arbor much more pleasant than it would have been, and I enjoyed the fraternity life, though I still rejoice that we don't indulge at Princeton." [...] In another article, Ward wrote, [...] "One year in the West was enough for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous <b>to</b> <b>me</b> ... <b>There</b> was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He told me once that he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, and he thought he knew what was good for him." ...|$|E

Music World has a Gospel division and I'm the first artist to come out on Music World and in the Gospel division. I'd love to do more and more Gspel projects". She also discussed her Christian upbringing, saying, [...] "I grew up in Rockford, Illinois. St. Paul Church Of God In Christ was and still is my home church". Furthermore, she explained, [...] "I sang my first solo at the age of seven. I directed the choir, I was an usher. I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it. I thought {{that it would be a}} perfect time. Choosing to do this at the height of my career rather than doing it when Destiny's Child is at a downfall, you know? Most people do that.
