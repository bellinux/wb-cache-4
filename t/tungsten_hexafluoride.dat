Radiochemical tracer experiments in twin filament lamps have shown that tungsten is transferred from a cold (non-running) filament to a hot (running) filament {{in the presence of a}} suitable fluoride. The distribution of the transferred tungsten has been measured and compared with transfer in the presence of a bromide. The hypothesis that the presence of fluorine in a lamp leads to the setting up of a regenerative cycle which minimizes the rate of formation of "hot spots" and hence extends filament life is supported.

In {{this paper}} a {{thermodynamic}} and kinetic {{study of the}} new deposition process of tungsten on silicon (100) from <b>tungsten</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> (WFg) and germane (GeQ) is presented. Thermodynamic calculations as well as experiments show, that the reaction occurring during deposition is: WF 6 + 3 GeHd+W+ 3 GeF 2 + 6 H 2 The growth rate {{as a function of}} process parameters is obtained for selective depositions in the temperature range from 600 to 800 K, and a total pressure range from 150 to 1000 mTorr. Experiments show that the germane reduction of <b>tungsten</b> <b>hexafluoride</b> is 0. 9 order in WFg,- 0. 2 order in G e Q and zero order in Hz. The activation energy is 34 Wmol. These kinetic data of the G e m 6 process differ markedly from the kinetics of the recently much studied SiH 4 /WF 6 process. A fascinating observation is that the deposition rate does not change when S a is added to the G e H W g mixture, while, on the contrary, a small amount of GeQ reduces the growth rate from a Si- 6 mixture considerably.
