5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed <b>to</b> <b>inflation.</b> While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E

First, beginning in approximately 1975, the responsiveness of core <b>inflation</b> <b>to</b> changes in energy prices in the United States fell rapidly and remains muted. Second, this decline in the passthrough of energy <b>inflation</b> <b>to</b> core prices has been sustained through a recent period of markedly higher volatility of shocks <b>to</b> energy <b>inflation.</b> Finally, reduced energy inflation passthrough has persisted {{in the face of}} monetary policy which quickly became less responsive <b>to</b> energy <b>inflation</b> starting around 1985. ...|$|R

5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost <b>to</b> <b>inflation.</b> In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E

5|$|Nichols {{left the}} Atomic Energy Commission in 1955 {{and opened a}} {{consulting}} firm on K Street, specializing in commercial atomic energy research and development. His clients included Alcoa, Gulf Oil, Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station. Nichols was involved {{with the construction of}} the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station, the first privately owned pressurized-water plant, and the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, which commenced operation in 1961 and 1968 respectively. They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, but later became more so due <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> and large increases in coal and oil prices. He was critical of over-regulation and protracted hearings, which meant that by the 1980s similar boiling-water or pressurized-water plants took almost twice as long to build in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's {{other main}} {{economic}} arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, {{partly because the}} Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines {{at the behest of}} British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune <b>to</b> <b>inflation</b> because they grew their own crops. While these conclusions were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour. There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make much of an impact. One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.|$|E

40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} (IT) {{had originally}} been introduced as a device <b>to</b> bring <b>inflation</b> down and stabilize it at low levels. Given the current environment of persistently weak inflation in many advanced economies, IT central banks must now bring <b>inflation</b> up <b>to</b> target. In this paper, the author tests <b>to</b> what extent <b>inflation</b> expectations are anchored in such circumstances, by comparing (i) IT and non-IT countries, and (ii) across periods when inflation is at normal levels, (persistently) high, or (persistently) weak. He finds that under low and persistently low inflation, some disanchoring can occur - inflation expectations are more dependent on lagged inflation; forecasters tend to disagree more; and inflation expectations get revised down in response <b>to</b> lower-than-expected <b>inflation,</b> but do not respond <b>to</b> higher-than-expected <b>inflation.</b> Since inflation expectations in IT countries are substantially better anchored {{than those in the}} control group, policy rates in IT countries need to react less <b>to</b> changes in <b>inflation,</b> making IT central banks considerably less likely to hit the zero lower bound...|$|R
