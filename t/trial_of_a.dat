5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E

5|$|When Doctor Who {{was put on}} hiatus in February 1985, several {{completed}} scripts {{were already}} being prepared for the 1986 series (which would retain the format of thirteen 45 minute episodes). Others tales {{were still in the}} story-outline stage. All of these scripts were later abandoned to make way for The <b>Trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Time Lord, when the series resumed in September 1986.|$|E
5|$|According to {{his book}} Doctor Who: The Companions (published {{at about the}} time The <b>Trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Time Lord was broadcast), series {{producer}} John Nathan-Turner intended to chronicle the Doctor's first meeting with Melanie Bush in a later episode. The subsequent dismissal of Colin Baker from {{the role of the}} Doctor rendered this potential storyline moot, although the later novel Business Unusual by Gary Russell, that was published in September 1997, would attempt to fill in this gap in the show's continuity.|$|E

5|$|The {{first series}} of Doctor Who {{featured}} eight scripts by Davies, the remainder being allocated to experienced drama writers and previous writers for the show's ancillary releases: Steven Moffat penned a two-episode story, while Mark Gatiss, Robert Shearman, and Paul Cornell each wrote one script. Davies also approached {{his old friend}} Paul Abbott and Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling to write for the series, but both declined due to existing commitments. Shortly after securing writers for the show, Davies stated {{that he had no}} intention to approach writers for the old series; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Robert Holmes, who died in May 1986, halfway through writing his contribution to The <b>Trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Time Lord.|$|E

5|$|The {{whole season}} is titled as The <b>Trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Time Lord, and is split into four {{segments}}. The segments are {{commonly referred to}} by their working titles (listed below) but the season was broadcast as one fourteen-part story and the working titles did not appear on screen. Episode length returned to 25 minutes, but with only fourteen episodes in the season, making the total running time of this season (and subsequent seasons) just {{over half of the}} previous seasons, going back to season 7.|$|E
5|$|Written by Nabil Shaban (better {{known as}} Sil from the Colin Baker Doctor Who stories Vengeance on Varos and The <b>Trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Time Lord) {{who was a}} {{longtime}} fan of Doctor Who and had previously suggested himself to replace the late Roger Delgado as the Master. In offering this script to the production office in 1980, Shaban also put himself forward as a potential successor to Tom Baker as the Doctor. Nothing came of Invasion of the Veridians. Nabil Shaban had only written the first episode, it was written around the early 1970s, and was very much influenced by the Troughton/Pertwee era. Nabil believes that the only copy has now been lost in time, as he no longer has it.|$|E
5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook Touch series has touch screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook Touch series includes the UX31A which is the same as the Zenbook Prime, but with a touch enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A with a touch enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ is thicker than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the ultra-low voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically pushing it out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the touch screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E

5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} a <b>trial</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a}} great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E
