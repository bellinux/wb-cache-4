The most {{important}} problems to overcome in reaching the Treaty of Accession were those associated with the integration of Greek agriculture into the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The importance of the farm sector for the Greek economy as a whole, the structural problems it faces, and the political weight of the Greek farmers led to an agreement on {{the necessity of a}} five <b>year</b> <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> during which Greece will have to adjust progressively to fully adopting the CAP. The major concern {{of this study is to}} examine the impact of the changes which are required for the reorientation of the Greek agricultural policy on Greece's agriculture and particularly on its feedgrain-livestock subsector. The specific objectives of the paper are: 1) to provide an overview of the organizational structure of the Greek feedgrain-livestock subsector; 2) to examine the agricultural policy in Greece and the adjustments associated with the accession to the EEC; 3) to analyze production, consumption, and trade of livestock and feedstuffs trends during the last 15 years and to project them in 1985 and 1990; and 4) to draw conclusions regarding the changes that EEC membership is going to impose on the development of the Greek feedgrain-livestock subsector.

40|$|Bulgaria’s European Union {{accession}} in 2007 {{turned the}} country’s citizens from third-country na-tionals with restricted mobility rights into EU citizens with rights to free movement within the EU. Economic rights were restricted for seven <b>years</b> by <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> {{in the free}} movement of work-ers. This article explores changes in the Bulgarian migration pattern to Germany after 2007 {{in the specific context}} of free movement with restricted freedom to work, and analyses the extent to which those changes can be related to that particular regime. Starting from this point, Bulgarian migration patterns to Germany are overviewed and a periodisation of migration since the World War II is sug-gested. Changes in the dynamics, forms and composition of migration after EU accession in 2007 are analysed, based on administrative data and a small-scale survey among Bulgarian migrants in Ham-burg. Both the administrative data and the survey results provide empirical grounding for a plausible relation between EU accession and migration patterns. The scale of migration has increased and more temporary migration has taken place. However, the rise of migration can be attributed not only to new migration from Bulgaria but also, to a large extent, to a redirection of migration flows from other destination countries and the legalisation of irregular migrants. Circular migration has lost to a great extent relevance which could be plausibly explained by changed migration strategies under a regime of free movement. Despite <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> in the free movement of workers, labour mi-gration has become a predominant form of mobility. <b>Transitional</b> <b>periods</b> did not prevent migrants from moving to Germany but, given the reduced labour market opportunities, may have hampered their successful labour market integration...|$|R

He was elected for <b>three</b> <b>years.</b> Besides his function {{as the president of}} the thing, his duties were restricted to counselling and to reciting the law. It was the sole government office of the mediaeval Icelandic Commonwealth. The lawspeaker was elected for a term of <b>three</b> <b>years</b> and was supposed to declaim the law at the Althing, a third of it each summer. In fact, Grímr Svertingsson's term was cut short, not because of incompetence or illness, but because his voice was too weak for the job. Apart from his function as a lawsayer and chairman of the court, the lǫgsǫgumaðr had no formal power, but he would often be appointed as an arbitrator in the frequently arising disputes. The office lingered on for a few <b>years</b> in the <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> after 1262, after which it was replaced with a lǫgmaðr. The traditional date for the founding of the Althing is 930 with Úlfljótr appearing as a founding figure and the original author of the laws. After the union with Norway in 1264, two royal lawspeakers were appointed who had an important influence on the legal processes at the thing.

The retreat from the colonies and the acceptance of its independence terms which would create newly independent communist states in 1975 (most notably the People's Republic of Angola and the People's Republic of Mozambique) prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique), creating over a million destitute Portuguese refugees — the retornados.
