5|$|During the Bronze Age (about 1500 BC) tribes {{sometimes}} called <b>the</b> <b>Urn</b> {{people started to}} settle in the area.

50|$|Controversy {{about the}} {{renovation}} erupted in January 2011, however, when original decorative <b>urns</b> from <b>the</b> 1995-1996 renovation {{turned up at}} auction. The two 9 ft tall urns, sculpted by Ulysses Ricci, formerly stood {{on either side of}} the stage in the amphitheater. By 1995, they had significantly weathered and many details had softened so much as to be unrecognizable. Omni Construction, one of Clark Construction's subcontractors, was assigned to dispose of <b>the</b> <b>urns.</b> Omni turned <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> over to Pagliaro Brothers Stone of Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Pagliaro Brothers Stone said they did not have records about the urns' ultimate fate, but in 1997 <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> ended up in the hands of an unidentified antiques dealer. The dealer sold them to DHS Designs, an antique shop in Queenstown, Maryland. <b>The</b> <b>urns</b> (priced at $125,000) never sold, and in 2010 the owner of DHS Designs closed his store and put <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> up for auction. Potomack Company, the Alexandria, Virginia, auction house assigned to handle <b>the</b> <b>urns,</b> advertised them in December 2010—which brought <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> to <b>the</b> attention of preservationists in the D.C. area. According to unnamed preservationist experts interviewed by The Washington Post, <b>the</b> historic <b>urns</b> should have been restored or placed in a museum—not donated to private owners for sale. The U.S. Army, which manages Arlington National Cemetery, said it could not find the 1995 renovation contract and was unable to say what provisions for the urns' disposal had been made nor whether federal property and preservation agencies had been consulted before <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> were replaced.|$|R
50|$|On January 24, 2011, DHS Designs {{returned}} <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> {{at no cost}} to Arlington National Cemetery. The Army did not {{say whether}} it would display <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> at <b>the</b> cemetery or move them to another Army museum.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>urns</b> reside on <b>the</b> {{south side}} of the district, between Jackson Place and Madison Place. They each stand at 5 feet tall by 4 feet wide, and are made of bronze with granite bases. The sides of <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> are {{decorated}} with classical female figures. <b>The</b> <b>urns</b> were part of the original park plan as designed by Andrew Jackson Downing in 1852. They may have been designed by Downing, or his assistant Calvert Vaux. <b>The</b> <b>urns</b> were cast in a New York foundry at the orders of George M. Robeson, who was Secretary of the United States Navy at <b>the</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>urns</b> were originally placed on granite bases in the center of two small flower beds to the east and west sides of the Andrew Jackson statue. In 1879, they were fitted with metal pans which allowed them to be used as flower pots. The park was redesigned in 1936, and <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> were moved to their current location.|$|R
5|$|Mr. Hughes {{used his}} {{strength}} advantage {{to control the}} early stages of the following match against Mr. Perfect. After he missed a leg drop, Perfect used the opportunity to perform a neckbreaker on Hughes. Hughes picked up <b>the</b> <b>urn</b> that he had stolen from The Undertaker and hit Perfect with it. As a result, Hughes was disqualified and Mr. Perfect advanced to the next round.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{parallels}} with Christian scripture in the novel.

5|$|At {{an archaeological}} dig in the Ecuadorian highlands, two archaeologists, Dr. Bilac and Dr. Roosevelt, {{get into an}} {{argument}} over the removal of a burial urn that contains an Amaru, or a female shaman. Roosevelt argues that <b>the</b> <b>urn</b> must be taken from the site and preserved in a museum, much {{to the chagrin of}} Bilac and the tribespeople present. Later, a native shaman distributes Yaje to the local villagers and Bilac. During this ritual, a jaguar spirit kills Roosevelt in his tent.|$|E
5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. <b>The</b> <b>urn</b> with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E

5|$|The buildup for {{the match}} between Giant Gonzalez and The Undertaker after the Undertaker had {{defeated}} Kamala in a Coffin match at Survivor Series 1992. Kamala's manager Harvey Wippleman vowed revenge and introduced Gonzalez at Royal Rumble 1993, with Gonzalez attacking and eliminating the Undertaker. Gonzalez and the Undertaker wrestled at WrestleMania IX, and Gonzalez knocked the Undertaker unconscious with a chloroform-soaked rag. The feud intensified when Wippleman, Gonzalez and Mr. Hughes attacked the Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer.

50|$|The most {{characteristic}} feature {{was the use}} of burial <b>urns</b> with faces. <b>The</b> <b>urns</b> {{were often}} contained in stone cists. The face-urns have lids in the form of hats, often miniature ear-rings of real bronze are added. The faces are sometimes modelled very naturalistically, and no two <b>urns</b> show <b>the</b> same face. Incised drawings on <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> show hunting scenes, chariot races or riders. Brooches of Certoza-type and necklaces of multiple bronze rings are typical examples of metal work.|$|R
5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in <b>the</b> <b>urns.</b> <b>The</b> sides of <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the eyes and mouth of <b>the</b> deceased. <b>The</b> <b>urns</b> were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of <b>the</b> deceased in <b>urns</b> was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to <b>the</b> city. Funerary <b>urns</b> have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|R

We show that <b>the</b> <b>urns</b> synchronize almost surely and that the fraction of balls of each colour converges to the deterministic limit of one-half, which matches with the limit known for a single Friedman urn. Furthermore, we use the notion of stable convergence to obtain limit theorems for fluctuations around the synchronization limit...|$|R
5|$|The coffin match, {{in which}} The Undertaker faced Kamala, came next. Kamala began the match by running in fear from The Undertaker. He gained the early advantage, however, by {{suddenly}} {{turning around and}} attacking The Undertaker. Kamala bodyslammed The Undertaker three times and performed three splashes. In an attempt to revive The Undertaker, Paul Bearer, his manager, held up an urn that {{was said to be}} the source of The Undertaker's power. Kim Chee, one of Kamala's handler's attacked Bearer. The Undertaker picked up <b>the</b> <b>urn,</b> which had rolled into the ring, and hit Kamala with it. The Undertaker pinned Kamala to win the match, placed him in a coffin, and nailed the lid shut.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of the}} Black Dragons (David Carradine, {{credited}} as Grand Master), pays a {{visit to}} Guam to take the matter into his own hands.

Max and Grand Master reach an agreement that Max will fight Arnold Chon's character to death. If Max wins, Max and the Goody sisters can go free. Max almost deals a deadly blow to the enforcer's head, but stops himself at the last moment, sparing his life, yet winning the fight.

5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to remember how Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in <b>the</b> <b>urn</b> they originally found Elsa in.|$|E

50|$|These six urns {{would cause}} some commotion because Etruscan art was hardly known outside Italy at that point. Reuvens judged {{three of them}} to be fake, and had serious doubts about one.
