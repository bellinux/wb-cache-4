5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion,</b> and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} league match of 1998, Overmars scored twice to earn Arsenal a win against Leeds United. A week later the team drew 2–2 at Coventry City, losing more {{ground at the}} top of the table. January came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> with a 3–0 victory over Southampton, with all three goals scored in the space of seven minutes. A further two wins in February, at home to Chelsea and Crystal Palace, moved Arsenal into second place, nine points behind Manchester United, albeit having played two games less.|$|E

5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, animals or people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E

5|$|A week later, the Australians {{followed}} up with attacks on Japanese positions around Weston on the north-eastern part of Brunei Bay. The 1st Armoured Regiment and Armoured Squadron (Special Equipment) operating Matilda II tanks were attached to the Australian 7th Division and {{took part in the}} Battle of Balikpapan which was the concluding stage of the Operation Oboe. The landings took place on 1 July 1945 and had been preceded by heavy bombing and shelling by Australian and US air and naval forces. Landing with the infantry, the tanks—including Matilda tank dozers, newly modified Matilda Frog flamethrower tanks, and a Coventanter bridge-layer—mainly operated in small detachments in close support of the troops, even though the terrain offered the opportunity for more mobile tactics to be employed. Although the Australians were ultimately successful, casualties among the infantry were heavy and during this time the regiment was involved in some hard fighting, with the Japanese able to make effective use of strong natural defences in conjunction with minefields and anti-tank ditches to compensate for their lack of anti-tank guns. With the fighting coming <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> however, tank operations ceased on 24 July.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{came back}} for another PBL season with the Saint John Mill Rats in 2011. The team had changed {{locations}} from Manchester, New Hampshire to Saint John, New Brunswick in Canada {{prior to the start}} of the season. Anderson debuted on January 2, 2011in a loss against the Quebec Kebs, in which he recorded a team-high 20 points, 6 assists, and 4 steals. He had another notable scoring performance on January 21, when he poured 24 points on the Rochester RazorSharks. In the next two contests, Anderson recorded season-highs of 9 assists and 7 rebounds vs. the Halifax Rainmen and tied his season-bests of 24 points and 9 assists in a rematch against the Quebec Kebs. The three games led to him being named PBL Player of the Week on February 10, 2011. On March 17, Anderson scored a season-high 32 points with 12-of-24 shooting and 5 three-pointers vs. the Halifax Rainmen. He also contributed 6 assists and 4 rebounds. As the season came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion,</b> he was named second-team All-PBL.|$|E
5|$|Attendances {{continued}} to increase during {{the remainder of the}} 1900s, as 121,452 saw the 1908 Scotland v England match. The two Old Firm matches played for the 1909 Scottish Cup Final attracted a total of 131,000. After the second match there was a riot because there was confusion over what would happen next when the second match also ended in a draw. The fans believed that the replay would be played <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> and demanded that a period of extra time be played. The Scottish Cup trophy was withheld as Hampden was not in a fit condition to host a second replay. In response to the riot, the Scottish Football Association decided not to use Hampden as the Scottish Cup Final venue until after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate {{among the}} rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were shot or blown to pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of {{dividing}} his forces and sending a portion to launch an amphibious attack on southern Portugal. The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion,</b> his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña IsabelII, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to IsabelII and defeated both MiguelI and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.|$|E

5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the landing at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off. The Australian high command decided to refocus their efforts upon the drive towards Buin in the south and as a result the effort in the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further {{resources}} were transferred out of the sector. Following the withdrawal, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion continued fighting along the Ratsua front before being relieved on 28 June by the 8th Infantry Battalion and withdrawing to Torokina, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war. The 23rd Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts took over control of the sector, and for a period of four weeks along the Ratsua front the 8th and 27th Infantry Battalions carried out patrolling operations before the Australians decided to withdraw to the Buoi Plantation in mid-July, by which time the Japanese forces in the area, boosted by their victory at Porton, had begun to seize the initiative through the use of harassment tactics. Following this several small-scale actions continued along the front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 August 1945 as the war came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 1997, Carl Doyle and {{his wife}} Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in Ballintubber, Co Roscommon by Mark Nash, a 25-year-old {{resident}} of Drumcondra in North Dublin. During his interview with the gardaí, he said that about three months prior to his arrest, as he was walking to Stoneybatter, he broke into a house through the back, and had stabbed two women in their sleep. In his statement, {{there were at least}} two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time. Nash later retracted his confession. Nash's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí, as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial. Two camps emerged within the gardaí, one which believed that Nash's confession threw doubt on Lyons' guilt, the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer. On 27 August 1997, the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence. He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997, and an interim report on 9 January 1998; while these reports did not come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> about Lyons' guilt, they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} {{suffering}} their second defeat of November, Nelson remained {{top of the}} league going into December. Their first fixture of the month was a home match against mid-table Darlington on 9 December. Nelson won a close match 3–2 thanks to another Braidwood strike, followed by Eddleston's 10th and 11th goals of the campaign. A hat-trick from inside-forward Wolstenholme gave Nelson a 3–0 victory against the same team on 23 December {{in front of a}} season-low attendance of 3,000 at Seedhill. Nelson started the Christmas period with an away game against Halifax Town. Braidwood and Wolstenholme both got on the scoresheet to help the team to a 2–2 draw in front of 18,000 supporters at The Shay. On 26 December, Nelson faced Hartlepools United, to whom they had conceded 10 goals in two matches in the previous season. Wolstenholme netted for the third game in succession as Nelson claimed their first ever win against the club. However, in the first match of 1923, Hartlepools United won the return fixture 5–1. Nelson achieved their first win of the new year on 13 January, a 3–0 triumph against Rochdale courtesy of an Eddleston hat-trick. Nelson lost 0–1 to Lincoln City the following week, the first time they had failed to score in a league fixture for over two months. January came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> with a 2–1 win over the same team, goals from Eddleston and McCulloch giving Nelson the victory.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's first {{tenure in}} the Senate came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> in March 1862 when Lincoln {{appointed}} him military governor of Tennessee. Much {{of the central}} and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power {{as commander in chief}} to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions. The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of brigadier general. In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital. Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate {{and in the absence of}} most Southern legislators, the Homestead Bill was finally enacted. Along with legislation for land-grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad, the Homestead Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August, however, Osuna and San German {{abandoned}} the town, and with 1,200 cavalry soldiers, broke {{the lines of}} circumvallation near the quarter of Santa Engracia, between two Portuguese redoubts, reaching Alburquerque shortly thereafter. San German was replaced in the command of Badajoz by Rodrigo de Múgica y Butrón, his Maestre de Campo General. The Spanish concentrated their efforts on the defense of a large ravelin in Pradaleras garrisoned by 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, against Portuguese artillery fire from Cerro del Viento and San Miguel. In late August, news {{of the formation of}} a relief army under Philip IV of Spain's favorite Luis de Haro reached the Portuguese camp, increasing the pressure upon Mendes de Vasconcelos to bring his siege <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion.</b> Unfortunately, the damage caused by the bombardment of the Spanish positions was minor, and heat and disease was decimating the Portuguese army.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Cage {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Kurt Angle and the {{challenger}} Samoa Joe. The added stipulation to this bout was if Joe lost, he {{would be forced to}} retire from professional wrestling forever. Frank Trigg provided commentary for this match. The match was primarily technical, with each combatant switching through various holds and submission maneuvers. One such submission was the Figure-Four Leglock, which Angle applied to Joe. Angle was forced to release the hold when Joe grabbed the bottom rope. Joe then applied a Boston Crab, before switching to an STF, which Angle countered into an Ankle Lock. Following the hold being broken, Angle performed his signature Olympic Slam maneuver on Joe for a near-fall. Later, Joe applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission on Angle, which was forced to be released when Angle grabbed the bottom rope. The match finally came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> when Joe lifted up Angle and slammed him to the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then covered for the pinfall at 17 minutes and 45 seconds to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{founding}} the Order of Canada began in early 1966 and came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion</b> on 17 April 1967, when {{the organization was}} instituted by Queen Elizabeth II, {{on the advice of}} the Canadian prime minister, Lester B. Pearson, who was assisted with the establishment of the order by John Matheson. The association was officially launched on 1 July 1967, the 100th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, with Governor General Roland Michener being the first inductee to the order—to the level of Companion—and on 7 July of the same year, 90 more people were appointed, including Vincent Massey, Louis St. Laurent, Hugh MacLennan, David Bauer, Gabrielle Roy, Donald Creighton, Thérèse Casgrain, Wilder Penfield, Arthur Lismer, M. J. Coldwell, Edwin Baker, Alex Colville, and Maurice Richard. During a visit to London, United Kingdom, later in 1970, Michener presented the Queen with her Sovereign's badge for the Order of Canada, which she first wore during a banquet in Yellowknife in July 1970.|$|E
5|$|With {{the victory}} of the Mexicans over the Spanish {{imperial}} army in 1821, the Viceroyalty of New Spain came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>conclusion.</b> The newly independent Mexican Congress still desired that King Ferdinand VII, or another member of the House of Bourbon, agree to be installed as Emperor of Mexico, thereby forming a type of personal union with Spain. The Spanish monarchy, however, refused to recognise the new state, and decreed that it would allow no other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. Thus, the Mexican Agustín de Iturbide was crowned as Augustine I on 19 May 1822, with an official decree of confirmation issued two days following. Only a few months later, Augustine dissolved a factious congress, thereby prompting an enraged Antonio López de Santa Anna to mount a coup, which led to the declaration of a republic on 1 December 1822. In order to end the unrest, Augustine abdicated on 19 March 1823 and left the country, and the Mexican monarchy was abolished. After hearing that the situation in Mexico had only grown worse since his abdication, Iturbide returned from England on 11 May 1824, but was detained upon setting foot in Mexico and, without trial, was executed.|$|E
