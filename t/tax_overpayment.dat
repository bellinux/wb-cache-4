25|$|Mullan did {{not just}} work on land claims. He acted as each state's agent {{on a wide}} variety of issues, {{including}} reimbursement for state expenditures during Indian wars, federal payments to volunteer soldiers during the Civil War, <b>tax</b> <b>overpayments,</b> and indemnities for state underpayments to the federal government. In time, he acted as a kind of lawyer-ambassador, drafting petitions to be presented to Congress and lobbying federal officials. Although Mullan managed to win small settlements for his clients, giving him a solid income, Mullan lived far beyond his means—getting credit and spending money in anticipation of the major payday which awaited him if he could secure the California public lands payment.|$|R

40|$|RESTful {{web service}} {{developers}} to easily deploy their web service through HTTP protocol. We propose two solutions {{to make easier}} tax adjustment; <b>tax</b> <b>overpayment</b> and tax return expectation. First, even though almost all WTO countries ‘ tax law explicitly states the tax incentive to subsidies for research and development, many companies often incorrectly classify the subsidies for research as a taxable income not as a non-taxable income, resulting in over payment of tax for taxpayers. Thus, we introduce a RESTful Open API for checking whether earned income year-end tax settlement is correct or not. This API automatically audits the tax settlement by some required numbers from the earned income withholding receipt. Second, If a taxpayer has wage & salary income only, he/she {{is not subject to}} final global income tax return because of the self-assessment. But, if he/she has other incomes, the tax return on those must be completed and submitted by the end of May of the next year. Second, we focus on tax return simulation by global income settlement. The reason why we are focusing onto this issues is because a large amount of the other income tax which was already deducted as withholding could b...|$|E

40|$|Article I {{courts are}} the other federal courts, {{infrequently}} studied despite their {{important role in the}} judiciary. This article focuses on the United States Tax Court, an Article I court that hears approximately 95 percent of litigated federal tax cases. The article argues that the Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s current tendency to apply equitable doctrines when necessary to avoid harsh outcomes dictated by statute lacks constitutional authority. First, the article examines the role of Article I courts in the federal judicial system and under the Constitution. Next, it considers the historical and modern meanings of equity and equitable powers {{in the context of the}} distinction between law and equity. The article then discusses the Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s use of equity, focusing on the doctrines of equitable recoupment, equitable estoppel, and equitable relief from joint and several tax liability for an innocent spouse. Finally, it examines possible sources of equitable power for the Tax Court, including applicable statutes, and the possible equity-like ancestry of <b>Tax</b> Court <b>overpayment</b> claims. The article concludes that Article I courts have limited sources of equitable power, and that for the Tax Court to apply equitable principles as it has been doing, Congress will need to take appropriate action - within constitutional limits - to broaden or redefine the jurisdiction of the court...|$|R
