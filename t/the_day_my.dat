500|$|The British beat group Unit 4 + 2 {{released}} {{a recording of}} [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" [...] as a single in 1968 but it suffered poor sales {{as a result of}} the version released by The Byrds and consequently it did not chart. Joan Baez included a gender-switched version of the song, in which she sings [...] "Tomorrow's <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>my</b> man's gonna come", on her 1968 album of Dylan covers, Any Day Now. Australian band The Flying Circus included this song on their self-titled debut album released in August 1969.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis was lyrically {{influenced}} by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs {{written for the}} album such as [...] "By the Way," [...] "I Could Die for You," [...] "Dosed," [...] "Warm Tape" [...] and non-album tracks [...] "Someone" [...] and [...] "Body of Water" [...] all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and [...] "Don't Forget Me" [...] expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>my</b> best friend died/I could not get my copper clean." [...] "Venice Queen" [...] was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: [...] "We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen." ...|$|E
