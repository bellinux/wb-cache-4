5|$|Born in {{the central}} Victorian town of Maldon, Woodfull was the third of four sons of Reverend Thomas Staines Brittingham Woodfull, a Methodist preacher. The Woodfulls moved to Melbourne when Thomas was given a {{transfer}} to Collingwood Methodist Mission, in an inner city suburb. The religious traditionalism stayed with the younger Woodfull throughout his life. He once refused to play an interstate match that was scheduled for Christmas Day. Woodfull's father installed a net in <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> <b>and</b> taught him the emphasis on defensive technique and patience that were to become his hallmark. Woodfull attended Melbourne High School and his early career was unremarkable. He made his district cricket debut in 1916 for Essendon, {{at the age of}} 19, but did not distinguish himself. He played no further cricket at the level before he gained his qualification as a schoolteacher in 1919. Because of a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood, Woodfull had stiff muscles and as a result was rejected when he tried to join the First Australian Imperial Force to fight in World War I. He was posted to Maryborough High School, and it was in the rural cricket competition that he began to gain attention. In 1920 and 1921, he accumulated 1,335 runs at average of 225.83 in the local competition.|$|E

500|$|Grohl's garage was {{equipped}} with microphones, sound baffles on the garage door and behind the drums to prevent sound leakings, and a carpet under the drum kit {{to make it sound}} less [...] "loud and bright". To reduce the cymbal bleed, the microphones were rearranged and the crash cymbal was traded for a [...] "shorter-decay Zildjian cymbal with holes drilled in it". A room next to the study was turned into an isolation booth to record the vocals. For the recording itself a makeshift control room was built inside a tent on <b>the</b> <b>backyard,</b> <b>and</b> a system of two cameras and a television provided the communication between the garage and the control room. The equipment was the same the band employed to record the albums There Is Nothing Left to Lose and One by One at Grohl's former house in Alexandria, Virginia.|$|E

500|$|Neighbor Patrick McQuaid {{said that}} he recalls, as a child, meeting Dugard through a fence in the Garridos' yard soon after the kidnapping. He {{said that she had}} {{identified}} herself by the name [...] "Jaycee" [...] and that when he asked her if she lived there or was just visiting, she answered that she lived there. At that point, Garrido came out and took her back indoors. He eventually built an eight-foot-tall fence around <b>the</b> <b>backyard</b> <b>and</b> set up a tent for Dugard, the first time that she was allowed to walk outside since her kidnapping. She coped with her continued captivity by planting flowers in a garden and home-schooling her daughters. At one point, Garrido informed Dugard that to pacify his wife, she and her daughters were to address Nancy as their mother, and that she was to teach her daughters that she was their older sister. When Dugard and her daughters were eventually allowed to come into contact with other people, they continued this fiction.|$|E
500|$|Many {{songs from}} Memory Almost Full {{were from a}} group of songs, which also {{included}} songs from Chaos and Creation in <b>the</b> <b>Backyard,</b> <b>and</b> some intended for the former nearly ended up on the latter. Any songs that were started, but not finished, for Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, McCartney didn't want to re-do for Memory Almost Full. As sessions for the album progressed McCartney wrote some more songs, something that McCartney used to do {{when he was in the}} Beatles. A song called [...] "Perfect Lover" [...] was recorded at either one of the three following studios: RAK Studios, AIR Studios or Ocean Way Studios; sometime between November 2003 and April 2005. [...] "Perfect Lover", in its original form was more folk-like, similar to Chaos and Creation in the Backyards [...] "Friends to Go". [...] "Perfect Lover" [...] went through a minor lyrical change, the bridge was changed, and an overhaul of its musical arrangement, before it finally became [...] "Ever Present Past". Two years after the 2003 session, sessions for the album started again. The book Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969-2013).

40|$|The {{riparian}} rural cutover lands <b>and</b> <b>backyards</b> {{represent a}} sustainable alternative {{for the production}} of food and medicinal drugs to the traditional communities from the Amazon, especially with regard to products diversity and income generation. Considering the ecological and social functions of these spaces, this paper aims at analyzing the agrobiodiversity of these environments in the Boca Moa community, in the town of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil.

The rural cutover lands present many species at the same area, and manioc is the main product cultivated. <b>The</b> <b>backyards</b> have spatial arrangements of food species, with emphasis on fruits and vegetables, besides medicinal plants. Thus, both <b>the</b> <b>backyards</b> <b>and</b> rural cutover lands participate in the subsistence and income of riparian families from this community...|$|R
