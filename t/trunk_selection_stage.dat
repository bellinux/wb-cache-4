30|$|In an ideally dichotomized {{situation}} in which both the certifiability of hiring requirements and the stages of a hiring process are clearly divided, a two-by-two theoretical distribution of job-person matching methods can be constructed. Four types of job-person matching scenarios are generated accordingly: certifiable qualifications are desired at both recruitment and <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> (type I), certifiable qualifications are required in recruitment with non-certifiable qualifications required in selection (type II), non-certifiable qualifications are preferred in recruitment with certifiable qualifications referred in selection (type III), and non-certifiable qualifications are desired at both the recruitment and <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> (type IV). Correspondingly, Fig. 1 presents the typology of individual job search behaviors in the abovementioned four types of job-person matching scenarios. The formal job search channel will mainly be observed in both recruitment and <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> in type I. The formal job search channel will dominate the recruitment stage with {{the dominance of the}} informal channel in the <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> in type II. The informal channel will be mainly used in recruitment with the formal channel mainly seen in selection in type III, and finally, the informal channel will be the major method in both the recruitment and <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> in type IV.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} semiattentive computations as {{the result}} of replacing the usual single <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> of visual attention by two consecutive <b>selection</b> <b>stages.</b> They are motivated by shortcomings of conventional attention models and correlate well to findings in human attention. The first <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> employs preattentive saliency computations for the complete available input, and selects a small number of discrete items. These are subject to the semiattentive processes of tracking and information accumulation. The second stage selects a single element from the result of the first <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> for the conventional focus of attention. The implementation and efficiency of this scheme is demonstrated in this paper. Its main advantage is the efficient selection and inhibition of objects in dynamic scenes. It allows the serialized accumulation of information for a changing environment and provides an up-to-date world model. The focus of this paper is {{on the quality of the}} computed world model and the object-related computations...|$|R

Firstly, a modeling approach is devised {{that can be used}} to model the supplier selection procedures of an enterprise. This modeling approach divides the supplier selection procedures broadly into three <b>stages,</b> the pre-selection, <b>selection,</b> and post-selection <b>stages.</b> Secondly, a methodology is presented for automating the supplier selection procedures. The methodology first divides the selection process into three stages, such as pre-selection, <b>selection,</b> and post-selection <b>stages.</b> Then the methodology identifies the steps within the <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> that can automated. Automating the steps within the pre-selection and the post-selection stages are not considered here. The methodology also proposes three modules for automating the <b>selection</b> <b>stage.</b> To assist automation, the <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> is further divided into three sub-stages, namely, bidder selection, partner selection and performance evaluation sub-stages. By this methodology, each sub-stage of the <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> employs a module for automation; the modules used for automation at these sub-stages are the data collection system, the inference engine and the performance evaluation engine. Thirdly, modeling, design and implementation of the three modules for automation are described. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} need {{to adapt}} to the dynamics of the environment requires employers from both public and private sectors to select qualified human resources. It is people who lead the organization towards performance, and selecting competent employees is critical for competitive success. The paper is focused on the job selection practices implemented by hiring organizations in a developing country. Due to the differences that exist regarding the employee selection policy between public and private organizations, the paper aims to understand the characteristics of the job selection process according to the ownership of the employer agent. Based on a quantitative survey applied on 64 companies, the results analyze the main <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> implemented in private vs. public sector employers in a developing country. While in private companies the most frequently used <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> are the job selection interview, CVs screening and trial period, in public institutions the hiring process is based on the job selection interview, written knowledge tests, and practical tests. Compared to private companies, in public institutions the written knowledge tests rank a higher position in the <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> hierarchy, but the private employers rely more on CVs screening stage than public institutions. Emphasis is laid on understanding the reasons leading to variations in job selection practices according to the ownership of the employing agent. The predictive validity of the job <b>selection</b> <b>stages</b> implemented by the companies is also discussed. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{challenge}} in the Simon effect is said to occur during the response <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> of judgment. This is due to two factors which eliminate the stimulus identification stage and the execution state. In the stimulus identification stage the participant only needs to be cognitively aware that a stimulus is present. An error would not occur at this stage unless he or she were visually impaired or {{had some sort of}} stimulus deficit. As well, an error or delay cannot occur during the execution state because an action has already been decided upon in the previous <b>stage</b> (the response <b>selection</b> <b>stage)</b> and no further decision making takes place (i.e. you cannot make a change to your response without going back to the second stage).|$|R
50|$|The first code {{selectors}} had {{levels for}} local exchange calls and {{calls to the}} local tandem exchange. An exchange with up to 23 outgoing routes would require a second code <b>selection</b> <b>stage</b> on some calls, and for more outgoing routes (up to 93) some third <b>selection</b> <b>stages.</b> But as a nearby business exchange might have 50 TU (traffic units) in the BH (busy hour), and more distant exchanges might have only 2 or 3 TUs, the busy routes {{should be on the}} first code selectors and the least busy routes only via a second and perhaps a third <b>selection</b> <b>stage.</b> Hence for a hypothetical example with 30 outgoing routes, three schemes are possible with (A) three second and no third code selector groups, (B) two second and one third code selector groups, and (C) one second and two third code selector groups. The number of switches for the hypothetical traffic distribution is 348, 302 and 315 switches, i.e. scheme B is the optimum; but each exchange must be calculated individually. The busy routes should also be allocated to the lower levels on the selectors to minimise setting-up time and also the number of operations of the mechanism and hence the wear on them.|$|R

They make use of secondary variables, easily measured in real time (e. g., pressures, temperatures, flow rates) and a mathematical model that correlates these parameters and the variables that must be monitored. This work shows the basic steps to develop a soft sensor based on the PLS technique, focusing mainly in the variable <b>selection</b> <b>stage.</b> It is presented {{a new approach to}} select the most important variables to compose the soft sensor. The methodology is tested in 3 cases and is compared to the classical random subset generation and three others algorithms for both PLS and Stepwise methods.

Emphasis {{is given to}} the feature extraction and feature <b>selection</b> <b>stages.</b> In the former, several document structure elements and spatial features, likely to convey useful information, are extracted. In the latter, evolutionary multiobjective feature selection is employed to identify combinations of features with simultaneous good performance in terms of text localization sensitivity and specificity. The selected features are applied to a range of classifiers. Performance results over document image sets from known databases are presented, employing the classifiers with or without feature selection. The results suggest that the hybrid techniques, which utilize the classifiers in combination with the customized pre-processing, feature extraction and feature <b>selection</b> <b>stages,</b> exhibit promising performance on a range of document images. 1...|$|R
