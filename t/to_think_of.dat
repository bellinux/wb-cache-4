Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|The actual term polar {{coordinates}} has {{been attributed to}} Gregorio Fontana and was used by 18th-century Italian writers. The term appeared in English in George Peacock's 1816 translation of Lacroix's Differential and Integral Calculus. Alexis Clairaut was the first <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{polar coordinates}} in three dimensions, and Leonhard Euler was the first to actually develop them.|$|E

5|$|The {{audiences that}} we built for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them.

5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations {{it is much easier}} to work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron and the creation of another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E
5|$|Dio {{maintains}} that one purpose for Caracalla issuing the edict was {{the desire to}} increase state revenue; at the time, Rome was in a difficult financial situation and needed {{to pay for the}} new pay raises and benefits that were being conferred on the military. The edict widened the obligation for public service and gave increased revenue through the inheritance and emancipation taxes that only had to be paid by Roman citizens. The provincials also benefited from this edict because they were now able <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> themselves as equal partners to the Romans in the empire. However, few of those that gained citizenship were wealthy, and {{while it is true that}} Rome was in a difficult financial situation, it is thought that this could not have been the sole purpose of the edict.|$|E

5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a supernatural {{spin on the}} pirate genre. Walt Disney Pictures had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the ride in 2001, {{which was based on}} a story created by the {{executives}} Brigham Taylor, Michael Haynes, and Josh Harmon. This story featured Will Turner as a prison guard who releases Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held for ransom money by Captain Blackheart.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the investigation}} of how enzymes bind substrates {{and turn them into}} products. The rate data used in kinetic analyses are commonly obtained from enzyme assays. In 1913 Leonor Michaelis and Maud Leonora Menten proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics, which is referred to as Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The major contribution of Michaelis and Menten was <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> enzyme reactions in two stages. In the first, the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme, forming the enzyme-substrate complex. This is sometimes called the Michaelis-Menten complex in their honor. The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product. This work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane, who derived kinetic equations that are still widely used today.|$|E

5|$|Harry K. Danziger succeeded Wax as rabbi in 1978. The {{son of a}} rabbi, Danziger was a {{graduate}} of the University of Cincinnati, and ordained by the HUC. He joined Temple Israel as assistant rabbi in 1964, but in 1969 moved to Monroe, Louisiana, to lead Congregation B'nai Israel. He was replaced first by Howard Schwartz, then by Richard Birnholz. Birnholz tendered his resignation in 1973, and Wax began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> retirement. Danziger, then at Baltimore's Temple Oheb Shalom, was approached as Wax's successor, and returned to Temple Israel that year as associate rabbi. Synagogue membership had been around 1,350 families from the mid-1960s, but increased after the move to East Massey Road. By Wax's retirement it had reached around 1,500, and over half Memphis's 10,000 Jews were members of Temple Israel.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen {{in a variety of}} other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the Daily Express to write a new prose Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt Quatermass II, which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the Daily Express from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, Rockefeller {{expanded}} into iron ore and ore transportation, forcing {{a collision with}} steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, and their competition became a major subject of the newspapers and cartoonists. He went on a massive buying spree acquiring leases for crude oil production in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia, as the original Pennsylvania oil fields began to play out. Amid the frenetic expansion, Rockefeller began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> retirement. The daily management of the trust {{was turned over to}} John Dustin Archbold and Rockefeller bought a new estate, Pocantico Hills, north of New York City, turning more time to leisure activities including the new sports of bicycling and golf.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) has {{returned}} to his old job as regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch and announces that Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Ryan (B. J.

Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a way to get their clients back.|$|E

After Patroklus is killed by Hector, his closest friend Akhilles again joins the fight to get his revenge. Hector {{and his younger brother}} Troilus are killed, to the grief of everyone in Troy. Akhilles kills Penthesilea in battle, and soon after Kassandra fires a fatally poisoned arrow at his unprotected heel.|$|E

5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E

Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E
