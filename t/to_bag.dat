25|$|On India's tour of South Africa, Ashwin had a {{difficult}} time with the ball. He picked only one wicket across three ODIs and went wicketless in his 42 overs in the first Test at Johannesburg, following which, he lost his spot in the team to Jadeja for the second Test. In early 2014, Ashwin's overseas struggles continued during the New Zealand tour where he managed <b>to</b> <b>bag</b> a solitary wicket in the five-match ODI series which India lost 4–0. However, in the third ODI, coming in to bat with India at 146/5 in pursuit of 315, he scored his maiden ODI fifty of 65 runs from 46 balls. He shared a 38-run partnership with Dhoni and an 85-run seventh wicket stands with Jadeja, as the match eventually ended in a tie.

25|$|On 18 December, Parma hosted Lecce in a {{match that}} was set {{to be the last}} before Christmas break, but the re-organised Matchday 1 game was now to be played during the week that followed. Jonathan Biabiany's 18th minute run into the box was halted unfairly by the Lecce defence, leading to a chance from the spot for Sergio Floccari who duly {{converted}} <b>to</b> <b>bag</b> his first goal for the club. Just before the hour mark, David Di Michele scored from short range to level the scores, before scoring a magnificent second with a spectacular bicycle kick {{from the edge of the}} penalty area three minutes later. Juan Cuadrado then scored Lecce's third with 13 minutes left in the game with a fine left-footed effort blasted past Antonio Mirante, who was making his 200th professional appearance, as Parma looked down the barrel at another game without a win. A goalkeeping error three minutes from full-time allowed Graziano Pellè to reduce the deficit, his first goal for the club. Deep into injury time, the ball fell to Daniele Galloppa following a poorly cleared corner and he rifled it him to salvage a third consecutive draw for the Ducali.|$|E

500|$|Running {{throughout}} McNeile's {{books is}} {{the metaphor of}} warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., he writes, [...] "To bag {{a man with a}} gun is one thing; there is sport—there is an element of one against one, like when the quality goes big game shooting. But <b>to</b> <b>bag</b> twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all, even if they are Germans". The motif was continued into the Drummond novels. McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports, or of boxing, poker or hunting. The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: The Third Round, The Final Count, Knock-Out and Challenge.|$|E
500|$|He {{promoted}} aggressive {{measures against}} the insurgents, {{and in so}} doing, he also sought to raise his own political profile. Clad in immaculately tailored battledress, he would fly by helicopter to a beleaguered army outpost; wearing dark glasses and sporting a swagger stick, deliver a rousing speech {{for the benefit of}} the troops and the TV cameras – then return to Salisbury in time for dinner. He drew heavily on Winston Churchill's oratory style for some of his inspiring speeches. As Minister of Defence, Van der Byl was known to join army counter-insurgency operations while armed with a hunting rifle (with the words [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>bag</b> one of these chaps ..."), and would regularly visit army positions and entertain the troops with his own generous supply of [...] "scotch whisky and fine wines." [...] Such behaviour endeared him to many in Rhodesia: he was far more popular with the troops than his predecessor as Minister of Defence, Jack Howman. However, this popularity did not extend to senior members of the South African and Rhodesian governments.|$|E

Patrick Farren of What Culture called her [...] "one of gaming's most irritating females", criticizing the way she [...] "contacts Sonic seemingly just <b>to</b> <b>bag</b> him." [...] Jem Roberts called Amy [...] "kind-hearted" [...] but [...] "intolerably whiny". The character's voice has been criticized since Cindy Robinson took over the role, with Rogers and Farren comparing it to Minnie Mouse's. Towell and Mean Machines expressed general displeasure at her introduction in Sonic CD. The developers' treatment of Amy as a female character and its implications for gender representation in video games have also been questioned; the Electronic Gaming Monthly staff found her pink coloring and tendency to run from danger to be stereotypical and common in Japanese-created female characters.|$|E

[...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Scherzinger has managed <b>to</b> <b>bag</b> herself a banger of an (ahem) debut single". He described the song's busy production as [...] "having a whiff of the Berline [...] "teknoklub" [...] that is a [...] "racket in the best possible way". Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song, awarding it five out of five stars. He gave [...] "Poison" [...] a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger's previous attempt, [...] "Baby Love" [...] (2007), which he only awarded three out of five stars, stating that it was the wrong single to launch the career of a world-class superstar.|$|E
