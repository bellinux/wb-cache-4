5|$|Meanwhile, the Lost Light, {{attempting}} {{to track down}} Jhiaxus, is pulled off-course by a summons from the badly-wounded Metroplex, via a severed portion of his thumb the ship had previously encountered. Finding the ancient Autobot, and his companions Windblade, Chromia and Nautica on the ocean planet Hydrophena, the crew defends him and themselves against an army of Shockwave's Ammonite minions and use their ship's engines to give him enough of a power boost to <b>teleport</b> them all back home to Cybertron. They return as the Necrotitan {{is in the middle}} of razing Iacon at Shockwave's command; Megatron, having fallen in with Bumblebee, uses his space bridge to <b>teleport</b> Metroplex's thumb — revealed to contain another of Shockwave's ores — from the Lost Light back into its owner's hand, giving him the energy to defeat the Necrotitan and heal the plague.|$|E
5|$|Sonic X {{follows a}} group of {{anthropomorphic}} animals who accidentally <b>teleport</b> from their home planet to Earth after attempting to save one of their friends from their enemy Doctor Eggman. Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends, including a human boy, Chris Thorndyke, scuffle with Eggman and his robots {{over control of the}} powerful Chaos Emeralds.|$|E
2500|$|... vSide {{has its own}} URI called vURL. It {{is mostly}} used for <b>teleporting</b> {{processes}} as <b>teleporting</b> to a user or <b>teleporting</b> to a certain spawn point in a public district or apartment, further for music. There is both for [...] and [...] a program called [...] "Location Switcher" [...] made by vSide users that {{has the ability to}} perform simple vURL <b>teleporting</b> actions.|$|R
50|$|This {{version of}} Nightcrawler {{demonstrated}} {{the ability to}} control how much of another person traveled with him when <b>teleporting,</b> allowing him to kill a man by <b>teleporting</b> only his head.|$|R
50|$|Digitize {{matter and}} {{transmit}} it through electronic systems as data transmissions, <b>teleporting</b> the matter, and attach additional files to the packages, <b>teleporting</b> {{a person and}} sedating them or paralyzing them on arrival.|$|R
5|$|Sonic and Shadow use the Emeralds to {{transform}} into their super forms, defeating the Finalhazard and using Chaos Control to <b>teleport</b> the ARK back into stable orbit. This depletes Shadow's energy and he plummets to Earth, content in fulfilling {{his promise to}} Maria. The people on Earth celebrate as the heroes return home and Sonic bids Shadow farewell.|$|E
5|$|With Max Capricorn dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} highest authority, the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a <b>teleport</b> bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the <b>teleport</b> bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, <b>teleport</b> to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth with a credit card preloaded with £1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Wraith: The Wraith is {{the third}} unlockable monster. The Wraith can warp towards a Hunter and unleash a blast, dealing damage to the Hunters. They can also launch a small arena within a map which grants them bonus armor and strength. The Wraith also {{has the ability to}} <b>teleport</b> between places and kidnap a Hunter whilst in a group.|$|E
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{pioneering}} protocol for <b>teleporting</b> an arbitrary single particle state and simultaneously performing a rotation operation on that particle. There are protocols for either only <b>teleporting</b> particles or only remotely controlling quantum particles. If {{one has to}} remotely control a <b>teleported</b> quantum, then he/she has to first do the quantum teleportation and then perform the remote control on the <b>teleported</b> quantum. Both operations were done separately on two sets of entanglements. However, this intuitive solution is inefficient because many resources are wasted. Therefore, the study attempts to complete both operations using only one Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state...|$|R
5000|$|After Nightcrawler <b>teleports,</b> {{he leaves}} behind smoke and a faint scent of burning brimstone; {{this is a}} small portion of the {{atmosphere}} of the dimension he travels through when he <b>teleports.</b> His teleportation power is due to a biophysical/biochemical reaction he consciously triggers within himself. A loud [...] "bamf" [...] noise is always present whenever he <b>teleports</b> (being the sound of air rushing to fill the space he was just occupying). His <b>teleporting</b> also causes a slight change in the atmosphere before he arrives, although only superhumans with heightened senses such as Daredevil can detect it.|$|R
5000|$|When Kennedy is <b>teleported</b> into Buffy's {{backyard}} {{she says}} to herself [...] "that {{was a hell of}} a thing," [...] a reference to Galaxy Quest, mimicking Tony Shalhoub's understated attitude to being <b>teleported</b> for the first time.|$|R
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can <b>teleport</b> through walls, but prefers to only <b>teleport</b> when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
5|$|After the {{explosion}} of the Citadel reactor from which Gordon was extracted by the G-Man and where Alyx Vance was left behind, time suddenly freezes. Several Vortigaunts appear and rescue Alyx from the blast. After she is rescued, the Vortigaunts appear before the G-Man and stand between him and Gordon. They <b>teleport</b> Gordon away from the scene, much to the G-Man's displeasure.|$|E
5|$|The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal, {{announced}} on September 2, 2002, and {{scheduled for a}} PC-only release, went gold on November 1 and was released, with little fanfare, on November 6. Tribunal puts the player in the self-contained, walled city of Mournhold, {{the capital of the}} province of Morrowind; the new city is not connected to Morrowinds land mass, Vvardenfell, and the player must <b>teleport</b> to it. The storyline continues the story of the Tribunal deities.|$|E
5000|$|The quantum {{states of}} single atoms have been <b>teleported.</b> An atom {{consists}} of several parts: the qubits {{in the electronic}} state or electron shells surrounding the atomic nucleus, the qubits in the nucleus itself, and, finally, the electrons, protons and neutrons making up the atom. Physicists have <b>teleported</b> the qubits encoded in the electronic state of atoms; they have not <b>teleported</b> the nuclear state, nor the nucleus itself. It is therefore false to say [...] "an atom has been teleported". It has not. The quantum state of an atom has. Thus, performing this kind of teleportation requires a stock of atoms at the receiving site, available for having qubits imprinted on them. The importance of <b>teleporting</b> nuclear state is unclear: nuclear state does affect the atom, e.g. in hyperfine splitting, but whether such state {{would need to be}} <b>teleported</b> in some futuristic [...] "practical" [...] application is debatable.|$|R
50|$|The comic {{ends with}} Blowout <b>teleporting</b> into a live {{broadcast}} by President Reagan (although he is left unnamed) and then <b>teleporting</b> away, essentially {{making it an}} assassination attempt. The President survives {{in part because he}} is secretly also a paranormal.|$|R
50|$|The teleporter origin or A process {{matter in}} {{energy of the}} body you want <b>teleported.</b> This energy travels through cable or medium air to the receiver, {{destination}} or B that transforms energy into matter again remaking what is <b>teleported</b> from the outset.|$|R
5|$|The Port Authority also {{participates in}} joint {{development}} ventures around the region, including the <b>Teleport</b> business park on Staten Island, Bathgate Industrial Park in the Bronx, the Industrial Park at Elizabeth, the Essex County Resource Recovery Facility, Newark Legal Center, Queens West in Long Island City, and the South Waterfront in Hoboken. However, by April 2015, {{the agency was}} considering divesting itself of the properties to raise run and return to core mission of supporting transportation infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire map is obscured until explored by the player. The map consists of a landlocked sea with several islands, wreckage, sea creatures, enemy ships, ports, and whirlpools. The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on the map to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools <b>teleport</b> the player's ship to a random location on the map.|$|E
5|$|Diary of a Camper occurs entirely {{within the}} Quake map DM6 ("The Dark Zone"). After {{exploring}} {{some of the}} area, the Rangers gather and decide to send two members, Sphinx and Pyoveli, to scout a room above. After they <b>teleport</b> into the room, a camper waiting there kills them both, as confirmed by in-game text messages that appear on the screen. The remaining three Rangers—ColdSun, ArchV, and an unidentified member—realize their comrades' fate and return fire from a distance, killing the camper. Examining the remains, they identify their foe as John Romero.|$|E
5000|$|A {{fundamental}} difference between HTS satellites {{is the fact that}} certain HTS are linked to ground infrastructure through a feeder link using a regional spot beam dictating the location of possible <b>teleports</b> while other HTS satellites allow the use of any spot beam for the location of the <b>teleports.</b> In the latter case, the <b>teleports</b> can be set up in a wider area as their spotbeams' footprints cover entire continents and regions like it is the case for traditional satellites [...]|$|R

40|$|<b>Teleporting</b> is {{the ability}} to {{redirect}} a windowing environment to dierent computer displays. This paper describes the implementation of a <b>teleporting</b> system developed at Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL). We outline two particular features of the system that make it powerful. First, it operates with existing applications, which will run without any modication. Second, it incorporates sophisticated techniques of personnel and equipment location which make it simple to use. <b>Teleporting</b> may represent a development in attempts to achieve a ubiquitous, personalised computing environment for all. ...|$|R
5|$|Five {{years into}} Superman's regime, the {{insurgency}} discovers a parallel universe where Joker's plan failed, and they <b>teleport</b> that world's Wonder Woman (Susan Eisenberg), Aquaman (Phil LaMarr), Green Arrow (Alan Tudyk), and Green Lantern (Adam Baldwin) into their universe. Batman and Joker are accidentally transported as well, but are separated after {{an encounter with}} the regime's military forces. While searching for somewhere to recharge his power ring, Green Lantern encounters Sinestro (Troy Baker) and his Yellow Lantern counterpart. Aquaman visits the archives of Atlantis, where he discovers how Superman descended into tyranny and that Atlantis has agreed to complete subjugation under Superman. He is then forced to fight his counterpart as well.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, <b>teleport,</b> and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Amy and {{the clerics}} find the Angels {{moving away from}} the primary control room. One cleric goes to investigate, and finds the crack has grown wider, but then is soon {{consumed}} by it. Amy remembers this cleric, but none of the others do, as he had been erased from time. The crack continues to grow, and soon the other clerics are similarly consumed. The Doctor directs Amy to keep her eyes closed and work her way to the secondary control room, hoping that the Angels will not recognise that her eyes are shut. Amy falters and trips, but as the Angels move in, River is able to <b>teleport</b> her to the secondary control room, rescuing her.|$|E

Powers include <b>teleporting</b> and {{controlling}} water, reverting into toxic water that can spawn holograms of himself, constricting seaweed called the Seaweed Squeeze, <b>teleporting</b> and size growth by water, a high pressure hose {{from the left}} arm, and summoning small waterspouts.|$|R
50|$|Spiral then <b>teleports</b> the Sisterhood back {{to their}} base where they split up with Chimera going with the Red Queen to Jean Grey's burial site. There she attacks Domino only to be beaten by Colossus. When the Red Queen is defeated, Spiral <b>teleports</b> the Sisterhood away.|$|R
50|$|Later {{the team}} is <b>teleported</b> to Hell and Red Leader then negotiates a {{contract}} with Mephisto that if Ghost Rider and Red Hulk defeat the current leader of Hell, Strong Guy, they will be <b>teleported</b> out and Mephisto will take control of Mercy, {{as well as other}} secret stipulations.|$|R
5|$|On February 27, Hardy {{announced}} that {{both he and}} Jeff had finally left TNA, following years of speculation, with their contracts expiring that week. Though the two sides were reportedly close to a contract agreement, talks began to break down and changes in management prompted their departure from the company. The TNA World Tag Team Championships were vacated due to the Hardys' departure and was explained on TNA television in a segment where The Hardys would <b>teleport</b> to their next Expedition of Gold destination, but a technicality resulted in them disappearing and the belts appearing {{in the arms of}} Decay.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun regains {{consciousness}} at {{the bottom}} of the shaft and begins to fight his way to the surface to escape. Emerging near Black Mesa's classification yards, Calhoun learns that Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues plan to escape the facility using teleportation technology. After freeing Rosenberg from the captivity of the US Marines detachment sent to silence the facility, Calhoun escorts him to a decommissioned prototype teleportation laboratory, where several Black Mesa employees have already gathered. Rosenberg then teleports Calhoun to the Xen border world to calibrate research equipment needed to pinpoint a <b>teleport</b> destination outside of Black Mesa. Upon his return, Rosenberg informs Calhoun that the teleporter's battery power has been exhausted, and contact has been lost with a team sent to acquire a new power cell.|$|E
5000|$|Pac-Man World 2 (2002): The {{flagship}} <b>teleports</b> Pac-Man to mazes. Its point value will be {{the same}} as the points earned for the maze it <b>teleported</b> him to (if he manages to complete it) - with an added bonus of 2000 points (its value from the original Pac-Man).|$|R
40|$|Instead of <b>teleporting</b> {{the state}} of a two-state system, the Caltech group <b>teleported</b> the quantum state of the {{oscillating}} electromagnetic fields in a light beam. Lev Vaidman of Tel-Aviv University formulated the essential idea for <b>teleporting</b> the quantum state of an oscillator. Braunstein and Jeff Kimble of Caltech elaborated Vaidman's idea into the practical form that was implemented at Caltech. The advantages of the Caltech scheme are that the entangled light beams are relatively easy to make and the entangled measurements can be performed by using standard optical elements and high-efficiency photodetection...|$|R
