First, surface chemistry during the high friction regime, {{at the beginning of}} the test, and at the low friction regime, after long test durations, is investigated. Second, the influence of temperature on the surface chemistry of the resulting wear scars was investigated. The results show that at the beginning of tribotests with MoDTC lubricant, iron oxides are formed at the <b>tribocontact</b> which results in high friction. At longer test durations, adsorbed MoDTC on the ferrous surface decomposes to form MoS 2 and low friction is observed. Surface chemistry at the <b>tribocontact</b> has been found to vary depending on the test temperature. At high temperatures, MoS 2 is formed which provides friction reduction while at low temperatures, molybdenum oxide species and amorphous sulphur-rich molybdenum (MoSx) species are formed which do not provide friction reduction. Furthermore, it has been shown that MoS 2 formed within the <b>tribocontact</b> at high temperatures has a slightly disordered crystal structure as a result of tribological processes...|$|E

Further investigations into the effect of oil composition on the charging nature have employed the oil droplet rig to investigate a range of base and formulated oils. Experimental results indicated that charging in base oils is controlled by levels of impurities, such as sulphur, and aromatic content. For formulated oils it has been determined that the additives are the major contributor to the charging nature and any effect that impurities and aromatics have is negligible.

The failure modes observed on the worn pin-on-disc tested surfares are explained and compared with those obtained by scratch testing. In spite of it not being possible to establish quantitative results for the wear resistance ofW-C-Co coatings from scratch testing, an estimation can be performed based on the observation ofthe failure modes in the scratch track.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{electrostatic}} charge signals {{can be used to}} detect the onset of wear in lubricated <b>tribocontacts.</b> Preliminary investigations have shown the viability of this system when tested on a laboratory-based pin-on-disc rig, a reciprocating laboratory wear rig [1 - 3] and in an FZG gear scuffing rig [4, 5]. These preliminary experiments have indicated several charging mechanisms could be involved within highly stressed lubricated contacts, namely tribocharging, exo-emissions, surface charge variations and debris generation [6, 7]. This paper details further studies looking at the levels of charge generated by lubricated hybrid (silicon nitride sliding on bearing steel) contacts. Correlation between the charge levels generated within hybrid contacts under fully lubricated conditions and the resulting wear rates is investigated. Results from the Pin-on-Disc tests for silicon nitride against various bearing steels contacts, lubricated by Mobil Jet II, are presented and compared to steel on steel contact performance.

In oscillating <b>tribocontacts,</b> we observe intensive formation of secondary structures of type I (Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4) and type II (FeO). Experimental and theoretical studies were conducted to determine the contact between a sphere and a plane, which is the most suitable system for simulating small-amplitude fretting (~ 0 – 3 microns). In a single point contact, we can observe all types of local surface damage in the radial direction depending on the relative slip amplitude (practically, from ~ 0), from absolutely elastic interaction in the central contact zone to the slip amplitude at the margin of the contact area in micrometers. It is very important to implement numerical and continuous integration of the stick-slip zones and calculate the contact stress and strain of the surface layer. Analyzing the influence of thermal fluctuation on the strength of materials, we can determine the parameters of activation of the surface damage at small-amplitude fretting...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the role}} of surface {{roughness}} and slide-roll ratio in the decomposition and friction performance of molybdenum dialkyldithiocarbamate (MoDTC) has been investigated. Tribotests were carried out in a MiniTraction Machine (MTM) using steel discs of varying roughness rubbing against smooth steel balls in a sliding/rolling contact. Tests were conducted at slide-roll ratio (SRR) values of SRR= 100 % and 200 %. Raman spectroscopy was used to perform chemical characterisation on the resulting wear scars. The friction performance of rough discs was not affected by the slide-roll ratio. On the other hand, increasing the slide-roll ratio from 100 % to 200 % in tests with smooth discs resulted in higher friction with large instabilities. Raman analysis showed significant differences in chemical composition of the wear scars generated after tests with smooth and rough discs. Wear scars generated using rough discs were mainly composed of MoS 2 indicating complete MoDTC decomposition while those generated using smooth discs were composed of a mixture of MoS 2, MoSx (x> 2) and FeMoO 4 indicating partial MoDTC decomposition. Numerical simulation of the contact revealed that under similar loading conditions rough surfaces have higher local pressures than smoother surfaces. It is proposed that higher local pressures in rough surfaces promoted complete MoDTC decomposition. The novel finding from results presented {{in this study is}} that at similar temperature and MoDTC concentration, the degradation of MoDTC within <b>tribocontacts</b> is highly dependent on the roughness of the tribopair. This is because surface roughness determines the local pressure at the asperity asperity contact...|$|R

More specifically, results on the fretting wear under gross slip conditions of different diamondlike carbon coatings are presented and compared with results on PVD TiN. Secondly, the tribological behavior of diamond coatings in contact with different materials has been investigated under gross and partial slip fretting regimes.

We have shown that alcohols and fatty acids can adsorb onto the DLC under static conditions. However, under dynamic <b>tribocontact</b> conditions, although alcohol and fatty acid molecules help to decrease the wear of the coatings, they are inefficient in reducing the friction.

Based on the measured friction and wear data, the relative ranking of the investigated fretting couples is established. The fretting wear of all investigated tribocouples was found to fall in the tribochemical wear regime. The extent of the tribochemical reaction was observed to be strongly dependent on the chemical solubility of TiB 2 and the binder phases in steel at the <b>tribocontacts</b> and was accompanied by tribo-oxidation. For the monolithic TiB 2 and TiB 2 -based cermet materials, however, abrasion and adhesive wear, {{in addition to the}} tribochemical reactions, are found to be the cause for the high volumetric wear loss of these tribosystems. On the other hand, mild abrasion coupled with reduced tribochemical reactions is observed {{to play a major role}} in the low wear loss of the ZrO 2 -TiB 2 /steel fretting couple. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the tribochemical layer formed in the monolithic TiB 2 /steel tribocouple revealed the formation of mixed oxides containing predominantly TiO 2 (anatase), B 2 O 3, and Fe 2 O 3.

40|$|The {{superior}} {{high temperature}} resistance of silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4) based ceramics makes them suitable for tribological applications above room temperature or in high speed unlubricated sliding. There are some published {{works on the}} wear behaviour of Si 3 N 4 /metal alloys. However, experimental data are shown {{in a form that}} is not of direct use for engineers involved in materials selection. In the present work, Si 3 N 4 pins were tested against tool steel and grey cast iron on a pin-on-disc tribometer. Ceramics were produced by hot-pressing and tested without lubrication at variable temperature and sliding speed. SEM/EDS and XRD analysis were used for chemical and microstructural characterisation of worn surfaces and wear debris. At low speeds (0. 05 - 0. 5 m s-I) and room temperature, Si 3 N 4 surfaces are polished-like due to a combination of humidity-assisted tribo-oxidation and abrasive action of very fine wear debris. At high sliding speeds (2 - 3. 5 m S-I), as well as for temperatures in the range 400 - 600 °C, an extensive coherent tribolayer mainly composed by iron oxides spreads over the ceramic surfaces. Polishing and protection by adherent tribolayers are the mechanisms responsible for observed severe and mild wear regimes, respectively.

This paper reports further studies that have been undertaken to quantify the levels of charge generated by lubricated hybrid (silicon nitride sliding on bearing steel) contacts as a function of ceramic ball volume loss. Tests were carried out on an unheated pin-on-disc tribometer with a silicon nitride ball loaded against a bearing steel disc lubricated by two advanced aircraft jet engine oils, Mobil Jet 2 and Mobil Jet 291, at a constant sliding speed of 7 m s- 1. A series of loads were applied (1. 9 GPa – 3. 0 GPa) and the amount of wear and the wear mechanisms were quantified and determined respectively. In addition, friction and disc surface temperature measurements were made along with electrostatic charge measurements from a sensor positioned over the wear track. These measurements were used to monitor the wear conditions in real time. A correlation between ceramic ball volume loss and the rms (root mean square) of the electrostatic signal under steady state was found. Transient electrostatic features were identified within these signals possibly relating to transient wear processes within the contacts. Hence, the average of the rms charge levels may be a useful parameter for monitoring the health of hybrid contacts. Wear debris generated under different loads were analysed by microscopy. Worn pin and disc surfaces were analysed using SEM and EDX to identify wear mechanisms and to check the chemical compositions of any oil additive film. Polishing by tribo-chemical wear processes was found to be the predominant silicon nitride wear mechanism.

40|$|Molybdenum DialkyldiThioCarbamate (MoDTC) is a {{friction}} modifier {{that has been}} used in automotive engines for many years. However, its exact decomposition mechanism within tribocontacts is not fully understood. In this study, an attempt has been made towards understanding the mechanism of MoDTC decomposition in steel/steel contacts by employing Raman spectroscopy. Results show that the main MoDTC decomposition products are MoS 2, FeMoO 4 and sulphur-rich molybdenum compounds, MoSx (x> 2), in contrast to the previously reported MoS 2 and MoO 3. Formation of these products is dependent on tribological parameters. Raman results from this study indicate that the Mo 6 + species previously observed in X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis are probably from FeMoO 4 and not MoO 3. This paper presents an alternative reaction pathway for MoDTC decomposition in steel/steel contacts with MoSx as an intermediate product and MoS 2 as the final product. FeMoO 4 is formed from a side reaction of iron oxides with molybdenum compounds at low temperatures and low MoDTC concentrations.

Refrigeration compressor oils have also been replaced {{in order to be}} miscible with the alternative refrigerants. These alternative refrigerants and oils have changed the tribological characteristics of compressor critical contacts, and in some cases have led to an increase in failure rates. Much research has been conducted on the compressor contacts with alternative refrigerants and oils to understand the tribological impacts. Polymers have seen very limited study related to compressor <b>tribocontacts</b> in the presence of refrigerants. Polymers have a self lubricating effect by transferring material to the metal counterface. This is an important group of materials for tribological applications, especially blended polymers, which often have enhanced mechanical and low friction properties. Most of the literature on polymer tribology is conducted at speeds and loads significantly lower than typical compressor conditions. At these low speeds and applied loads, varying degrees of polymer transfer films are reported on the metal counterfaces. It is postulated that coherent transfer films are necessary for reduced wear. The current study looks at the tribological response of polymer/metal contacts in the presence of refrigerant versus ambient air under conditions simulating refrigeration compressors. Ten different polymers are employed as potential compressor bearing materials; four unfilled polymers and six blended polymers. Friction coefficient, wear, and surface topography were evaluated at a 60 ??C system temperature, 25 psi R- 134 A atmosphere (or ambient air), 2. 4 m/s sliding velocity, and 45 or 225 N applied loads. Polymers were tested against cast iron disks of roughness 0. 3 to 0. 5 ??m Rq. Experiments conducted in R- 134 A show slightly favorable friction and wear characteristics to experiments conducted in ambient air. All blended polymers have good tribological characteristics. PEEK and polyimide in both unfilled and blended forms exhibit minimal wear and do not adversely affect the metal disks. These polymers show promise for compressor bearing materials. Representative testing in starved lubricant conditions shows decreased polymer friction and wear. This study also shows that although coherent, uniform films are not produced under compressor-like conditions, as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), the tested polymers still have favorable tribological properties.

40|$|In recent years, the {{air-conditioning}} {{industry has been}} focusing on alternative refrigerants for the replacement of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) due to environmental regulations. HFCs refrigerants {{have been widely used}} in the refrigeration industry since the early 1990 ’s as replacement to chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs) refrigerants that were non-flammable and non-toxic, but posses a high ozone depletion potential (ODP). Despite the fact that HFCs have zero ODP, they were found to have a high global warming potential (GWP) being considered one of the green house substances to be banned by the Kyoto agreement. The interest for long term solutions has been towards natural refrigerants. Among different natural refrigerants such as water, air, and ammonia, carbon dioxide (CO 2, R 744) is an attractive and possibly the most viable candidate. Although, CO 2 is a non-flammable and non toxic natural refrigerant (being not the case for Hydrocarbons and Ammonia), one of the main drawbacks related to its implementation as a refrigerant in air-conditioning compressors {{has to do with the}} high operating working pressures. These working pressures can be around 5 to 6 times higher compared to HFCs systems. One of the important aspects in the design of an air-conditioning compressor is the understanding of the miscibility and solubility of the lubricant and the refrigerant. The incomplete miscibility and solubility of CO 2 with commonly used lubricants in the vapor compression cycle affects the way the lubricant is transported out of the refrigeration circuit. Also, when miscibility and solubility is incomplete, the lubricant accumulates in the system causing pressure drops (especially in the evaporator). Appropriate lubrication of the critical components of the compressor becomes important as the demands for higher efficiency increases. Control of the wear of these components has to be ensured in order to guarantee appropriate operation of the compressor over a prolonged period of time. Scuffing is another important aspect to be addressed in the design of compressors. This is considered a severe adhesive type of failure that renders the <b>tribocontacts</b> non functional. Interaction of the lubricant, refrigerant, and materials, plays an important role on the scuffing performance since tribochemical reactions might improve or lower the wear resistance at the sliding interfaces. Studies on CO 2 as an alternative refrigerant for air-conditioning systems has been mainly focused on the thermodynamical aspects to ensure that the efficiency and cost will make it suitable as a replacement to HFCs. However, research on the tribological aspects of CO 2 with lubricants and engineering materials is scarce. The aforementioned drawbacks related to the circulation of lubricant and refrigerant in the refrigeration circuit has raised the possibility of design and development of oil-less compressors. In this direction, it is imperative to design advanced materials able to withstand aggressive sliding conditions in the absence of lubricant. This research focuses on the study of the friction and wear behavior of different materials and lubricants in the presence of CO 2 for air-conditioning and refrigeration compressors. Bare materials and soft polymeric type of coatings were studied in the presence of lubricants and environmentally friendly refrigerants to understand the role of tribochemistry by using a range of analytical tools that provide answers of the scientific aspects during the characterization of friction and wear...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTribological {{research}} concerning {{sliding contacts}} operating at elevated temperatures has received very limited attention so far, despite its importance for reliable, safe and efficient operation of many tribological systems. Typical examples {{can be found}} in aerospace, power generation and metal working industry. Considerable differences induced by higher temperatures, when compared to lower temperature applications, are the increased rate of desired (tribochemical, oxidative) and undesired (adhesive, corrosive) reactions and changes in mechanical properties. The control of friction at the tool-workpiece interface and minimisation of tool wear is crucial to ensure the quality of formed parts. This can be achieved by spraying solid lubricant onto the surface of heated tools. The efficiency of high temperature industrial processes is strongly linked with the structure and thickness of the formed layer of oxides or/and applied solid lubricant onto the tools. The objective {{of this study is to}} verify the reliability of well-designed High Temperature Disc-on-Disc-Tribometer (HT-RRV) tests for providing accelerated data for friction and wear characterisation of several solid lubricants under forming conditions. Performed laboratory tests show that this test methodology can be used to carry out parametric studies with the aim to understand the tool – solid lubricant – workpiece interactions in high temperatures applications. The application of solid lubricant greatly changes the tribological performance by reducing the coefficient of friction, and adhesive and abrasive wear phenomena. Due to the in-situ formation in the <b>tribocontact</b> of a sacrificial layer, which is constantly formed and removed, the surface of the tool remains mostly unaffected in terms of damage...|$|E
40|$|Lubrication {{properties}} of refrigeration lubricants were investigated in high pressure nonconforming contacts under different conditions of temperature, rolling speed, and refrigerant concentration. The program {{was based upon}} the recognition that the lubrication regime in refrigeration compressors is generally elastohydrodynamic or hydrodynamic, {{as determined by the}} operating conditions of the compressor and the {{properties of}} the lubricant. Depending on the compressor design, elastohydrodynamic lubrication conditions exist in many rolling and sliding elements of refrigeration compressors such as roller element bearings, gears, and rotors. The formation of an elastohydrodynamic film separating rubbing surfaces is important in preventing the wear and failure of compressor elements. It is, therefore, important to predict the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) performance of lubricants under realistic <b>tribocontact</b> renditions. This is, however, difficult as the lubricant properties that control film formation are critically dependent upon pressure and shear, and cannot be evaluated using conventional laboratory instruments. In this study, the elastohydrodynamic behavior of refrigeration lubricants with and without the presence of refrigerants was investigated using the ultrathin film EHD interferometry technique. This technique enables very thin films, down to less than 5 nm, to be measured accurately within an EHD contact under realistic conditions of temperature, shear, and pressure. The technique was adapted to the study of lubricant refrigerant mixtures. Film thickness measurements were obtained on refrigeration lubricants as a function of speed, temperature, and refrigerant concentration. The effects of lubricant viscosity, temperature, rolling speed, and refrigerant concentration on EHD film formation were investigated. From the film thickness measurements, effective pressure-viscosity coefficients were calculated. The lubricants studied in this project included two naphthenic mineral oils (NMO), four polyolesters (POE), and two polyvinyl ether (PVE) fluids. These fluids represented viscosity grades of ISO 32 and ISO 68 and are shown in a table. Refrigerants studied included R- 22, R- 134 a, and R- 410 A. Film thickness measurements were conducted at 23 C, 45 C, and 65 C with refrigerant concentrations ranging from zero to 60 % by weight...|$|E
40|$|In modern {{automotive}} engines, {{especially in}} diesel engines, consumer demand for ever increasing service intervals for vehicles {{has led to}} longer oil drain periods. Consequently this has increased contamination levels in lubricating oils that will in turn reduce engine efficiency and increase the possibility of system failure due to increases in viscosity and the potential of oil starvation leading to scuffing and catastrophic failure of the engine. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} investigate the effects of diesel engine oil contaminants on the tribological performance of tribocontacts and also the possible interaction between the contaminants. The thesis aims to investigate the influence of contaminants and their interactions on diesel engine oil using Electro sensing (ES) monitoring. ES monitoring suggest sensitivity to tribocharging, triboemission, surface charging, and wear debris generated in the <b>tribocontact.</b> However, ES monitoring is still in its initial stages of development but the relationships between the ES charge signal and corresponding wear mechanisms are established. Initial experiments showed the sensitivities between charge and wear to changes in additive chemistry, as well as contamination (specifically a soot stimulant). The results indicated some interesting findings which were difficult to elucidate but paved the way for a parametric study. The parametric matrix examined the effect of contaminants and it was observed that wear rate was mainly influenced by acid and soot additions. The best correlation of steady state charge with the other measured tribological parameters of wear rate, friction and temperature is seen for the series of oxidised oils. The multi-contaminated oil (L 4 × 4) shows remarkably little degradation in tribological performance with a reduced friction level compared with the uncontaminated oil and only a modest increase in wear rate, slight increase in charge levels. This clearly showed that there were interactions between the contaminants. The factorial matrix studied interactions between the diesel engine oil contaminants on various tribo-couple materials, including silicon nitride, using ES monitoring. For charge, pin material – sulphuric acid and oxidation –sulphuric acid, interactions were statistically identified as having significant influence on performance. For friction, both pin and disc materials were identified as main influences along with pin material – sulphuric acid interactions. For wear, the presence of soot and the influence of pin material were identified statistically as the main effects. To conclude, the ES monitoring was sensitive to the presence and levels of contaminants in diesel lubricating oil, particularly diesel soot. The change in charge levels indicated the concentration of soot level present in the contact, which was directly related to wear. ES monitoring also detected interactions between the contaminants through statistical analysis. ES monitoring has shown that monitoring lubricant performance and the effects of contamination are feasible under laboratory conditions.
