5|$|RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a {{specialized}} class of polymerases that copy {{the sequence of}} an RNA strand into DNA. They include reverse transcriptase, which is a viral enzyme involved in the infection of cells by retroviruses, and telomerase, which {{is required for the}} replication of telomeres. For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication. Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes telomeres at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{there is}} no title track for <b>the</b> <b>End</b> of <b>the</b> Century album, the album's title comes from a famous couplet in this song: [...] "It's <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> seventies/It's <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> century.".

5|$|In 1979, Bruce Cunningham and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} the first instance of a circularly permuted protein in nature. After determining the peptide sequence of the lectin protein favin, they noticed its similarity to a known protein– concanavalin A– except that <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> were circularly permuted. Later work confirmed the circular permutation between the pair and showed that concanavalin A is permuted post-translationally through cleavage and an unusual protein ligation.|$|E

5|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} non-coding RNAs {{are always}} polyadenylated {{at the end}} of transcription. There are small RNAs where the poly(A) tail is seen only in intermediary forms and not in the mature RNA as <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> are removed during processing, the notable ones being microRNAs. But, for many long noncoding RNAs– a seemingly large group of regulatory RNAs that, for example, includes the RNA Xist, which mediates X chromosome inactivation– a poly(A) tail is part of the mature RNA.|$|E

The introduction of a barbecue and new playground equipment to the reserve first came in the late 1990s. 2008–2009 has seen the introduction of a new barbecue area due west of the playground with more introductions to the reserve to come.|$|E
5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
50|$|Another view of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{times is}} preterism. It distinguishes {{the time of}} <b>the</b> <b>end</b> from <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of time.

5|$|The {{defensive}} line (DL) consists of defensive ends (DE) and defensive tackles (DT).
