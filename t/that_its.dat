5|$|A {{criticism}} of New Age often made by leftists is <b>that</b> <b>its</b> focus on individualism deflects participants {{from engaging in}} socio-political activism. This perspective regards New Age {{as a manifestation of}} consumerism which promotes elitism and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.|$|E
5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks to address these issues has been termed evidence-based medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues <b>that</b> <b>its</b> application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Edziza's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so <b>that</b> <b>its</b> future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions.|$|E

5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so <b>that</b> <b>its</b> future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions.

5|$|A {{preliminary}} {{examination of the}} imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is <b>that</b> <b>its</b> gravity is {{not strong enough to}} prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun.|$|E
5|$|A small insectivorous bird, it {{is subject}} to {{predation}} by mammals, such as cats and mustelids, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus Accipiter. Its large range and population mean <b>that</b> <b>its</b> status is secure, although one subspecies is probably extinct.|$|E

5|$|According to Anthony S. Cheke and Julian Hume, {{the anatomy}} of the Mascarene grey parakeet {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>its</b> habits were largely terrestrial. Like the extinct Mauritian duck and the Mascarene coot, {{it appears that the}} Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and Réunion. Both populations were said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>its</b> origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself {{out of the ground}} as a spring.|$|E
