5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E

25|$|Cultural {{racism is}} a term used to {{describe}} and explain new racial ideologies and practices <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> since World War II.

The program has successfully empowered women and raised rural wages, but has also attracted the ire of landowners who have to pay farm laborers more due to a higher prevailing wage.

25|$|According to Nawaz, {{nationalism}} hinders {{the fight}} against Islamist extremism, and democratic states must adopt a transnational outlook to combat this challenge.

Nawaz is also a critic of far-right movements <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> in Europe, and accuses them of harbouring disdain for ordinary Muslims. According to him, far-right xenophobes and Islamists agree upon one thing: the impossibility of Muslim and non-Muslim cohabitation in Europe.

25|$|Research on 'protective factors', {{which are}} {{characteristics}} of children or situations that particularly help {{children in the}} context of risk has helped developmental scientists to understand what matters most for resilient children. Two of these <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> repeatedly in studies of resilient children are good cognitive functioning (like cognitive self-regulation and IQ) and positive relationships (especially with competent adults, like parents). Children who have protective factors in their lives tend to do better in some risky contexts when compared to children without protective factors in the same contexts. However, this is not a justification to expose any child to risk. Children do better when not exposed to high levels of risk or adversity.|$|E

However, budgetary constraints imposed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis held many of the procurements.

In October 2000 the Defence Minister also announced a review of national defence and security policy {{to bring it up}} to date.

25|$|Besides the fixed-point theorems {{for more}} or less {{contracting}} functions, there are many <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> directly or indirectly from the result under discussion. A continuous map from a closed ball of Euclidean space to its boundary cannot be the identity on the boundary. Similarly, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem says that a continuous map from the n-dimensional sphere to Rn has a pair of antipodal points that are mapped to the same point. In the finite-dimensional case, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem provided from 1926 a method for counting fixed points. In 1930, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem was generalized to Banach spaces. This generalization is known as Schauder's fixed-point theorem, a result generalized further by S. Kakutani to multivalued functions. One also meets the theorem and its variants outside topology. It {{can be used to}} prove the Hartman-Grobman theorem, which describes the qualitative behaviour of certain differential equations near certain equilibria. Similarly, Brouwer's theorem is used for the proof of the Central Limit Theorem. The theorem can also be found in existence proofs for the solutions of certain partial differential equations.|$|E

Watching this escape with interest are Daniel and Marty, the observers of whom Duncan had been having visions. The story ends on a cliffhanger with several questions left unanswered regarding the merging of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, the fates of those on the escaped no-ship (including the role of Scytale, the development of Idaho and Teg, {{and the role of the}} Jews), the identity of the god-like characters in the book's final chapter and the ultimate mystery of what chased the Honored Matres back into the Old Empire.|$|E

I would follow what I believe was the original intention of the Fourteenth Amendment—to extend to all the people the complete protection of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what, if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written Constitution.|$|E
500|$|Blur's baggy-inspired {{debut album}} Leisure (1991) was a UK Top 10-charting record that, {{according}} to the NME, made the band the [...] "acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>emerged</b> since the whole Manchester thing started {{to run out of}} steam". However, as the baggy scene soon began to fade, Blur were—according to The Guardian—"wiftly exposed as bogus trend-hoppers, [...] they duly caught the wrath of the Madchester backlash". Further, following their fall from public favour, the group found that they were £60,000 in debt, mainly due to mismanagement. Blur hired new manager Chris Morrison and, to recoup losses, were sent by their record label Food to the United States as part of the Rollercoaster tour. To coincide with the start of the tour, Blur released the [...] "Popscene" [...] single; the new release showcased a significant change in musical direction, as Blur traded their shoegaze-derived sound for one influenced by 60s British guitar pop. However, the single failed to break into the UK top 30 which further diminished Blur's profile in the UK.|$|E
