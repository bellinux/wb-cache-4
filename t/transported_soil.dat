In New Zealand, increasing cow numbers {{has led to}} greater demand for forage crops to feed stock off-farm in winter. Expansion of dairying on flat land has pushed wintering systems on to rolling to steep land, particularly in the Southland and South Otago regions. While the impacts of forage crop grazing on soil compaction and overland flow of sediment and nutrients has been studied, {{there has been no}} previous work done on the direct influence of this farming practice on <b>soil</b> <b>transport.</b> This study used a novel technique to quantify the volume of <b>soil</b> <b>transported</b> downslope beneath the hooves of cows that were grazing kale over the 2015 winter period. Steel ball bearings were buried in the soil prior to grazing, and the distance they had moved was determined after winter, and used to infer <b>soil</b> <b>transport.</b> A linear relationship was found between <b>soil</b> <b>transport</b> flux and slope gradient of up to 0. 25 m m- 1, with stock track formation on steeper slopes causing greater spatial variability of <b>soil</b> <b>transport</b> rates and non systematic dependence of <b>soil</b> <b>transport</b> hillslope gradient; further research is required to describe this relationship. The steep slope of the relationship for gradients < 0. 25 indicates that rapid downslope transport occurs relative to gradient under forage crop grazing.

However, {{understanding of the}} sources of these compounds in caves is limited, particularly whether or not they should be considered as an in situ signal derived from microbial communities in the cave or vadose zone, a <b>transported</b> <b>soil</b> signal, or a mixture of the two. We have analysed speleothem samples and related soils from five cave sites and demonstrate that clear differences were apparent between soils and speleothems in GDGT distributions. Speleothems were primarily, but not uniformly, dominated by crenarchaeol, reflected in the branched and isoprenoid tetraether (BIT) index values, and had a lower relative abundance of the crenarchaeol regioisomer than soils. The most distinct differences were in the bacterially derived branched GDGTs, where no relationship was seen between speleothems and soils for the cyclisation of branched tetraethers (CBT) index, with speleothems in four out of five caves showing a greater degree of cyclisation in GDGT structures than could be explained by measured pH values. Differences in speleothem GDGT composition between sites were also seen. We suggest that the speleothem GDGT record is distinct from the GDGT distribution produced in soils, and is primarily derived from in situ microbial communities within the cave or vadose zone. Variation within these communities or in the cave microenvironment also acts to produce site-specific differences. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Wind erosion samplers, meteorological equipments and measurement procedure have been developed {{over the last two}} centuries to measure the particles moving across the field in modes of creep, saltation and suspension. In recent research as the first technical measurement in Iran, wind erosion was measured with these advanced procedures. Field data was collected from a small (1. 9 ha), square, fallow field with nonerodible boundaries. Wind erosion measurement equipment containing 14 clusters with samplers at 0. 05, 0. 10, 0. 25, and 0. 50 and 1. 0 m above the soil surface and a 4 × surface creep sampler (0 to 0. 02 m height by 0. 005 m wide) was arranged in a circular pattern.

The designed model takes into account the calculation of total N, P, and K content adsorbed on detached and <b>transported</b> <b>soil</b> particles, which consists of supplementing the soil loss calculation with a determination of the average nutrient content in topsoils. The dissolved forms of these elements are neglected in this model.

The distribution of chloride content values, ranges from 567 to 883  mg/L with the mean value of 689  mg/L. the concentration is exceeded the desirable limit [250  mg/L, as per the GCCS (1993 / 149) and SAS (1993 / 701) limit] due to weathering, derives from sedimentary rocks and <b>transported</b> <b>soil.</b> It also may be due to domestic waste discharge and effluents that may be coming out through the Wadies channel. The salts of sodium, potassium and calcium contribute chloride in water. The large contents of chloride in freshwater is an indicator of pollution (Venkatasubramani and Meenambal 2007). The high chloride concentration levels in water contribute to deteriorate on the domestic plumbing, water heaters and municipal water words equipment. Sulphate may enter natural waters through weathering of sulphide-bearing or by direct dissolution of evaporation deposits. Another significant source to water systems is airborne pollutants containing oxides of sulphur, which convert to sulphuric acid in precipitation. Sulphate is of great importance in public water supplies because of its cathartic effect upon humans when it is present in excessive amounts. Diarrhoea can be induced at sulphate levels greater than 500  mg/L but typically near 750  mg/L (Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) 2003). Figure  4 shows the spatial distribution of Sulphate concentration, it is showed that central part of lake area, ranges from 1411 to 1772  mg/L with the mean value of 1551  mg/L. The concentration highly exceeded the desirable limit (400  mg/L, as per the GCCS (1993 / 149) and SAS (1993 / 701) limit).

It concerns mainly shearing resistance properties and stiffness properties with special emphasis on the importance of stress and strain dependency. In this context some practical rules are presented for using parameters at two levels of design: routine and advanced levels. These practical rules concern <b>transported</b> <b>soils</b> (unaged and uncemented) are compared with those established in this paper for residual saprolitic soils from granite from different regions of Portugal. lt was noticed that the bonded structure and fabric of residual saprolitic soils from granite have a significant influence on their geomechanical behaviour. Consequently, the structural peculiarities of these residual soils influence the pattern of their non-linear constitutive behaviour. Deformability modulus derived from robust but relatively crude tests, such as SPT, CPT, DPT or even PMT, are compared with reference values taken from seismic survey (CH) and load tests, such as PLT. They can be situated on stress-strain levels defined from laboratory triaxial tests over high quality undisturbed samples.

Significant differences are apparent between those correlations and the ones established for <b>transported</b> <b>soils</b> with identical grading curves, which may be explained by the weak bonded structure, inherited from the parent rock...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{caused by}} tillage is {{proportional}} to the local slope curvature. The value of the coefficient of proportionality (tillage transport coefficient) depends on the interaction between tillage tool and soil. These interactions have been modeled as a three-phase motion: drag (depending only on tool characteristics), when the soil is in contact with the instrument; jump (not necessarily present for all tools), when the soil loses contact with the tool and is ejected; and rolling, when the clods roll and jump in relatively close contact with the soil surface. Three sets of equations have been proposed and assembled into a computer program (SETi, from Soil Erosion by Tillage). The model simulates the 3 D behavior of the <b>transported</b> <b>soil.</b> The performance of SETi is illustrated for the case of the moldboard plow. The simulated trends closely resemble those observed in experimental studies of tillage translocation. The major improvement with respect to previous models is that tool characteristics are explicitly taken into account. Tillage erosion {{is one of the major}} soil redistributing processes within the field border. Recent research has shown that that tillage erosion is often proportional to the local slope curvature (i. e., the rate at which slope gradient varies per unit of length). In present-day models, the proportionality coefficient is considered to be a black-box coefficient, depending on tillage tool and soil characteristics. To make the relationship between tillage translocation, soil, and tool characteristics more explicit the process of soil translocation must be better understood. We have found that there are three phases of motion, each described by its own set of equations, namely, drag, jump and rolling. Each phase depends on measurable characteristics of the tillage tools and of the soil. These equations have been implemented in the SETi computer model. At present, the model has been parameterized for a moldboard plow. The simulated soil transport reproduces the trends shown in the literature, indicating that the model behaves realistically. In its present form it can already be used for calculating the tillage transport coefficient needed by the existing tillage erosion models, as well as for designing less erosive tillage tools...|$|E

In 2007 the rainfall erosivity factor (EI 30) was 1628. 9 MJ·mm·ha- 1 ·h- 1 and turned out to be almost two times as much as it was for 2008 (667 MJ·mm·ha- 1 ·h- 1). In the summer half-year of 2007 hydrological year there were 13 slope wash events whereas in 2008 there were none. Runoff varied considerably in the summer half-year. Maximum values of runoff coefficient amounted to 39. 2 % for the potato, 34. 2 % for the fallow land, 16. 3 % for the winter wheat and 12. 0 % for the grassland.

A series of factorial experiments {{was carried out}} on 12 existing runoff plots. The study commenced in 1996 after a 5 -year natural fallow. Mound tillage was introduced in 1997 till 1999. The legumes - Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Mucuna pruriens and Pueraria phaseoloides - were intercropped with maize in 1996 and 1998 while yam was planted alone in 1997 and 1999. This paper covers 1997 - 1999. At the end of each year, residues were either burned or mulched on respective plots. Soil loss, runoff, variations in mound height, bulk density, soil water retention and sorptivity were measured. Cumulative runoff was similar among interactions of legume and residue management in 1997 (57 - 151 mm) and 1999 (206 - 397 mm). However, in 1998, cumulative runoff of 95 mm observed for Mucuna-burned residue was significantly greater than the 46 mm observed for cowpea-burned residue and the 39 - 51 mm observed for mulched residues of cowpea, Mucuna and Pueraria. Cumulative soil loss of 7. 6 Mg ha(- 1) observed for Mucuna-burned residue in 1997 was significantly greater than those for Pueraria-mulched (0. 9 Mg ha(- 1)) and Mucuna-mulched (1. 4 Mg ha(- 1)) residues whereas in 1999 it was similar to soil loss from cowpea treatments and Pueraria-burned residue (2. 3 - 5. 3 Mg ha(- 1)). There were no significant differences in soil loss in 1998 (1 - 3. 2 Mg ha(- 1)) whereas Mucuna-burned residue had a greater soil loss (28. 6 Mg ha(- 1)) than mulched cowpea (6. 9 Mg ha(- 1)) and Pueraria (5. 4 Ms ha(- 1)). Mound heights (23 cm average) decreased non-linearly with cumulative rainfall. A cumulative rainfall of 500 mm removed 0. 3 - 2. 3 cm of soil from mounds in 1997, 3. 5 - 6. 9 cm in 1998 and 2. 3 - 4. 6 cm in 1999, indicating that (detached but less <b>transported)</b> <b>soil</b> from mounds was far higher than observed soil loss in each year. Soil water retention was improved at potentials ranging from - 1 to - 1500 kPa by Mucuna-mulched residue compared to the various burned-residue treatments. Also, mound sorptivity at - 1 cm water head (14. 3 cm h(- 1 / 2)) was higher than furrow sorptivity (8. 5 cm h(- 1 / 2)), indicating differences in hydraulic characteristics between mound and furrow. Pueraria-mulched residues for mounds had the highest sorptivity of 17. 24 cm h(- 1 / 2), whereas the least value of 6. 96 cm h(- 1 / 2) was observed in furrow of Mucuna-burned residue.

A passageway constructed by an animal that becomes backfilled with soil is known as a [...] Invertebrates that burrow and mound soil tend to produce a biomantle topsoil (soil biomantle), and as such are primary agents of horizonation. Uprooted trees break up bedrock, <b>transport</b> <b>soil</b> downslope, increase the heterogeneity of soil respiration rates, and disrupt soil horizonation.|$|R
40|$|Solute <b>transport</b> through <b>soil</b> {{may affect}} {{groundwater}} and surface water quality. In recent years, significant {{attention has been}} given to prediction of solute <b>transport</b> in <b>soil</b> and groundwater. Solute transport processes are affected by soil pore water velocity distribution. Pore size distribution estimated from water characteristic curves can be used to infer pore water velocity distribution. The objectives of this study were to develop a simple model relating soil water characteristic curves with soil solute breakthrough curves and to evaluate model predictions through comparisons with measured values. Water characteristic and solute breakthrough data for four soil materials were used to evaluate the model predictions. The simple model developed contains two parameters, one relating to pore size distribution and the other to pore connectivity. The coefficient associated with pore connectivity may be set to a constant value for a variety of soil materials. Therefore, there is only one variable parameter in the model. The results of our comparisons indicate that the simple model is useful for relating characteristic curves and solute breakthrough curves. Predicted values are in good agreement with the measured values. This paper provides a simple, approximate method to predict <b>soil</b> solute <b>transport</b> from <b>soil</b> water characteristic curves...|$|R
40|$|Sea muds and saline polder soils {{frequently}} contain appreciable {{amounts of}} sulfur in various forms, and in polder <b>soils</b> and <b>transported</b> <b>soils</b> derived from sea muds acid condition sometimes develops through aeration of anaerobic soil. A description is given of practical rapid methods {{of determining the}} oxidizable sulfur and change of soil reaction of these soils. Recommended experimental procedures are as follows: A weighed quantity of soil (about 1 - 2 g) is mixed with 10 ml of 30 % H 2 O 2, adjusting the pH to 6. 0 - 6. 5 with N/ 10 NaOH and removing the sulfuric acid when contained with Ba (OH) 2, and heated for about 1 hour on water bath. After cooling, the contents are filled up to 100 ml and filtered. Soil pH value is determined in this soil suspension {{by means of the}} pH meter and glass electrode. Titrable acidity is determined by titrating 50 ml of this filtrate with N/ 10 NaOH and the result is given in terms of ml N/ 10 NaOH per 100 g soil. Active oxidizable sulfur is calculated from sulfuric acid equivalent to titrable acidity and given in terms of S mg per 100 g soil. Easily oxidizable sulfur is determined from the difference between the water soluble sulfate of the H 2 O 2 -treated soil and that of original soil and given in terms of S mg per 100 g soil. Sulfate is determined volumetrically by Benzidine sulfate method. The reliability of this method was examined with sea muds collected from sea bottom, saline pond <b>soils,</b> <b>transported</b> <b>soils</b> derived from sea muds and saline polder soils. The data obtained showed that saline pond soils and some of polder soils contained appreciable amounts of easily oxidizable sulfur and the pH values of these soils became extremely acid after oxidation with H 2 O 2 and easily oxidizable sulfur of fresh soils amounted to over 80 % of total sulfur determined from the difference between the sulfate content of the aqua regia extract and that of the water extract of the soils. (See Table 1 and 2) A considerable difference was frequently found between active oxidizable sulfur and easily oxidizable sulfur and it was shown that the relative amounts of oxidizable sulfur and easily soluble base compounds determine titrable acidity, active oxidizable sulfur and soil pH value of H 2 O 2 -treated soil. (See Table 3) The pH values of <b>transported</b> <b>soils</b> derived from sea muds were found to gradually approach in natural fields to the pH values determined by H 2 O 2 -treatment.

40|$|Work on forage legumes in Santa Cruz {{commenced}} in {{the period}} 1964 - 67 and was continued in 1976 - 79, in 3 ecological zones- in the central zone an area of <b>transported</b> <b>soils</b> of pH 6. 0 - 6. 5; in the Yapacani a wetter area of very acid <b>transported</b> <b>soils,</b> and on the oxisols and ultisols of the Precambrian Shield which extend into Brazil. In all the areas, native legumes are common but unproductive due to fires and over grazing. In the Central area, recommended species are Glycine wightii, which, in Panicum maximum var. trichoglume doubled animal production per ha (181 kg), when compared with the, grass alone (90 kg), in the 6 months of the dry season. Lablab purpureus forms an excellent association with maize and has provided 300 grazing days/ha with the maize straw after harvesting the grain, in the dry season. Complementary grazing of Leucaena leucocephala increased growth rates of steers from 0. 22 kg to 0. 70 kg per day in the dry season. In Yapacani, promising legume species were Pueraria phaseoliodes, Macrotyloma axillare and Stylosanthes guyanensis CIAT 136, in that order. In the Precambrian zone Macrotyloma and Stylo CIAT 136 increased animal production in the dry season. Less promising species are listed. Some implications of the results for local cattle ranchers are discussed. Key words: Forage legumes, range legume management, legume species.

40|$|Introduction: Soil erosion {{by water}} {{is one of the}} most {{widespread}} forms of land degradation and it has caused many undesirable consequences in last decades. On steep slopes, rill erosion is the most important type of erosion, which produces sediment and rill flow. It can be also considered as a vehicle for <b>transporting</b> <b>soil</b> particles detached from upland areas. Recent studies indicate that soil detachment rates are significantly influenced by land use. It is also known that there is a major difference between detachment rates of disturbed and natural soils (Zhang et al., 2003). Plowing rills especially in steep slopes increases sediment production. Sun et al. (2013) reported that the contribution of rill erosion in hill slope lands in china was more than 70...|$|R
50|$|Tectonic {{activity}} {{associated with}} the Cascadian Subduction Zone continued throughout the Quaternary, leaving evidence {{of a series of}} earthquakes and tsunamis in the past 60 thousand years. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, collapse of the ice dam surrounding Lake Missoula initiated a series of large-scale floods that inundated much of the state from 19-13 thousand years ago. Around 14 thousand years ago, the Bonneville Flood contributed more floodwaters to many of the same areas. These floods contributed to the modern fertility of the Willamette Valley by <b>transporting</b> <b>soils</b> from the east. Given the timing of these events, it is unlikely that they contributed to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna such as mammoths and ground sloths in Oregon.|$|R
