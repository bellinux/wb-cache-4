5|$|A popular {{approach}} {{to improve performance}} {{is to create a}} memory pool-based allocator. Instead of allocating memory every time an item is inserted or removed from a container, a large block of memory (<b>the</b> <b>memory</b> pool) is allocated beforehand, possibly at the startup of the program. The custom allocator will serve individual allocation requests by simply returning a pointer to memory from the pool. Actual deallocation of memory can be deferred until the lifetime of <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> pool ends. An example of memory pool-based allocators {{can be found in the}} Boost C++ Libraries.|$|E
5|$|At Rome {{indeed the}} works of art are legion; besides, one effaces another from <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> and, however {{beautiful}} they may be, we are distracted by the overpowering claims of duty and business; for to admire art we need leisure and profound stillness (XXXVI:26–72).|$|E
60|$|Let us omit {{from our}} consideration, for <b>the</b> present, <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> in which words replace images. These are always, I think, really habit-memories, <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> that use images being <b>the</b> typical true <b>memories.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{obtained}} {{information is}} transmitted to <b>the</b> shared <b>memory,</b> which {{is composed of}} <b>the</b> preemptive <b>memory</b> and <b>the</b> nonpreemptive <b>memory.</b> In <b>the</b> nonpreemptive <b>memory,</b> information on <b>the</b> spatial situation and the user’s demands are stored. <b>The</b> nonpreemptive <b>memory</b> is accessible by any MoMo at any given time. The MoMos obtain the latest information via <b>the</b> shared <b>memory,</b> and their current positions and destination are stored in <b>the</b> preemptive <b>memory.</b> MoMo 3 accesses <b>the</b> preemptive <b>memory</b> during path planning. Through the employment of <b>the</b> preemptive <b>memory</b> structure, MoMo 3 can avoid a deadlock situation and collision between MoMos.|$|R
50|$|These odd-shaped green devices {{can be used}} to {{not only}} read <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> of a living person, but to {{physically}} walk around inside <b>the</b> person's <b>memory</b> bubble and explore their mind. Memories usually appear like books, though the style varies greatly depending on the person. It is also shown that <b>the</b> room <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> are in stays the same regardless of who is in the body; changing the person using the body merely changes all <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> inside. <b>The</b> devices can also copy <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> from a living person and play them back later, as if the person was still there.|$|R
5|$|Behind {{the church}} is the Keith Memorial Terrace with its roses and fountain, {{designed}} by Thomas D.

5|$|During the investigation, Olivia {{finds that}} the {{memories}} she is gaining from Peter Bishop's (Joshua Jackson) original timeline are overriding her original memories. Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) becomes concerned and suggests that Olivia talk to Walter to help reverse <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> loss. During the case, in talking with the latest victim's wife, Olivia realizes that she is truly in love with Peter. After {{the conclusion of the}} case, she admits to Nina that she will let <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> alterations continue, even if this means she will forget the times she spent with Nina during her childhood.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Mary Shelley found comfort only in her writing. The {{birth of}} her fourth child, Percy Florence, on 12 November 1819, finally lifted her spirits, though she nursed <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of her lost {{children}} {{till the end of}} her life.|$|E

5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E

Schreiber describes in <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>the</b> daily life of his own family and other Jews living in Śrem, Jewish traditions, customs and festivals, but also the daily life of the Poles and Germans who lived in Śrem. <b>The</b> <b>memories</b> were translated into English.In 2008 <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> were also translated into Polish and published by Krzysztof Budzyń in the journal [...] "Śremski Notatnik Historyczny" [...] (Śrem’s Historical Notebook).|$|R

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} relies on <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of the would-be predator; {{a bird that}} has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed and agility. Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E

5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems.

A system that does not have this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.|$|E
