5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E
5|$|Ballhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, {{composed}} as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to {{at least}} partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background, to convey <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld camera during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few process shots were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are having their climactic conversation.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's book {{follows a}} venerable {{tradition}} of travel literature that blends <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's Utopia is {{cited as a}} forerunner, as is the account of Amerigo Vespucci. Godwin could fall back on an extensive body of work describing the voyages undertaken by his protagonist, including books by Hakluyt and Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, and the narratives deriving from the Jesuit mission in Beijing.|$|E

5|$|Helmuth Raithel (9 April 190712 September 1990) was a German {{officer who}} held the rank of SS-Standartenführer (colonel) in the Waffen-SS during World War II. While still at school, Raithel was swept up in <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> the Munich Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923 led by Adolf Hitler, and was {{subsequently}} awarded the coveted Blood Order, {{even though he was}} {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. He joined the Reichswehr (interwar German Army) in 1926. After World War II broke out he fought in the invasion of Greece in summer 1941, then against the Soviet Red Army in northern Finland before transferring to the Waffen-SS in 1943.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, was boring. He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> the trip, the {{stimulant}} benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with deicing equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E

60|$|The {{housekeeper}} soon entered, and Aggie, very sleepy after <b>the</b> <b>excitements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day, {{was taken}} off to bed. Her sleepiness, however, disappeared in her wonder {{at the size of}} the house, and at the vastness of her bedroom.|$|R
50|$|At {{around this}} time his {{recording}} sessions started becoming fewer - though a live session with Dexter Gordon, recreating <b>the</b> <b>excitements</b> <b>of</b> Central Avenue, and a studio session with Art Farmer and Hampton Hawes (both on 18), have fine examples of Wardell's playing.|$|R
5|$|Studio Ghibli's Yoshiyuki Momose {{served as}} the {{director}} of animation, drawing character designs and storyboards. Hino wished Dominion of the Dark Djinn and Wrath of the White Witch to have a heartwarming feel; the artwork and character movements was greatly inspired by Studio Ghibli's work, particularly due to their attention to detail, as well as their talent in creating storyboards and utilizing camera control. The development team constantly watched Studio Ghibli's films during development. The team wanted the theme of the game to resonate with children; they initially considered the idea of expressing adventure and dreams. They later explored the concept of a child's greatest influence, their mother, and the possibility of losing them. The game's main playable character, Oliver, is a 13-year-old boy. The team decided to make him a child as they wished to showcase a coming of age story. They wanted children to empathize with Oliver's development, and adults to relive <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> their adolescence.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its essential services or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E

25|$|A real {{benefit of}} air cushion {{vehicles}} in moving heavy loads over difficult terrain, such as swamps, was overlooked by <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> the British Government funding to develop high-speed hovercraft. It {{was not until the}} early 1970s that the technology was used for moving a modular marine barge with a dragline on board for use over soft reclaimed land.|$|E
25|$|Extraversion {{has been}} linked to higher {{sensitivity}} of the mesolimbic dopamine system to potentially rewarding stimuli. This in part explains the high levels of positive affect found in extraverts, since they will more intensely feel <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> a potential reward. One consequence of this is that extraverts can more easily learn the contingencies for positive reinforcement, since the reward itself is experienced as greater.|$|E

Though {{he would continue to}} freelance for Rolling Stone on and off over the years, he turned his attention to a book.|$|E
25|$|Associative {{learning}} in animal behaviour is any learning {{process in which}} a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus. The first studies of associative learning were made by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. Examples of associative {{learning in}}clude when a goldfish swims to the water surface when a human is going to feed it, or <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> a dog whenever it sees a leash as a prelude for a walk.|$|E
25|$|Camp Butler, {{seven miles}} (11km) {{northeast}} of Springfield, Illinois, opened in August 1861 as a training camp for Illinois soldiers, but {{also served as}} a camp for Confederate prisoners of war through 1865. In the beginning, Springfield residents visited the camp to experience <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> a military venture, but many reacted sympathetically to mortally wounded and ill prisoners. While the city's businesses prospered from camp traffic, drunken behavior and rowdiness {{on the part of the}} soldiers stationed there strained relations as neither civil nor military authorities proved able to control disorderly outbreaks.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} surfing {{was most likely}} started in New Guinea. It was a sport full of culture, fun, and adventure. Surfing was used to explore the oceans and to have fun {{becoming}} a part of nature. It spread from New Guinea to Hawaii. It is mostly known to be practiced in Hawaii and the surrounding islands, but it has spread {{to the rest of}} the continents. It was not widely accepted by Europeans because it took time away from working and labor, although they enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> seeing the action of surfing.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{about his}} {{activities}} in popularizing science, Sagan {{said that there}} were at least two reasons for scientists to share the purposes of science and its contemporary state. Simple self-interest was one: much of the funding for science came from the public, and the public therefore had the right to know how the money was being spent. If scientists increased public admiration for science, there was a good chance of having more public supporters. The other reason was <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> communicating one's own excitement about science to others.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged by Tom and {{his friend}} Mr Yates, the young people decide to put on an amateur {{performance}} of the play Lovers' Vows. Edmund objects, believing Sir Thomas would disapprove and feeling that {{the subject matter of}} the play is inappropriate for his sisters. Edmund reluctantly agrees to take on the role of Anhalt, the lover of the character played by Mary Crawford. The play provides a pretext for Henry and Maria to flirt in public. Fanny observes this, but again Aunt Norris, caught up in <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>of</b> staging a play, does not.|$|E
