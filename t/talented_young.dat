5|$|Sicilian {{raids on}} Italy continued, and {{prompted}} {{the intervention of}} the Western Emperor, Otto II in the peninsula in 982, where he was defeated at the Battle of Stilo.

A large force landed in Messina in 1025, but the expedition was called off when news came of the death of Emperor Basil II. A final effort was made in 1038, when the <b>talented</b> <b>young</b> general George Maniakes was dispatched to Sicily, taking advantage of internal conflicts between the Kalbids and the Zirids. Maniakes quickly recaptured the entire eastern coast, but the conquest was left incomplete when he was recalled to Constantinople by jealous rivals. The Kalbids soon recovered their losses, and Messina, the last Byzantine outpost, fell in 1042.|$|E
5|$|Tactically, Pirlo {{was capable}} of playing in several midfield positions, but was usually {{deployed}} by his club and national sides as a central midfielder, {{in the role of}} a deep-lying playmaker, due to his vision and passing accuracy.

He started his career in a more advanced role, as an offensive midfielder, and also played as a supporting striker on occasion. Although he was considered a <b>talented</b> <b>young</b> prospect, even drawing comparisons with former Italian footballer Gianni Rivera, Pirlo occasionally struggled in this role, due to his lack of pace, and competition from other talented and more dynamic players in his position.|$|E

At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed Ian Walsh to head the opener, before a great run by David Swindlehurst was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2–0 win.
