5|$|Since the Turtle’s {{emergence}} over <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>ago,</b> {{the international}} playing field has leveled. The monopoly over submersible technology once {{held by the}} United States was lost over time as other navies around the world modernized and adopted submarine warfare. From the innovations of John Holland {{in the early twentieth}} century to the German U-boat campaigns of the World Wars, and the nuclear-powered ICBM submarines of the Cold War, modern navies embraced the submarine, first, for missions of reconnaissance and commerce-raiding, but, increasingly, in offensive, attack roles. In the postwar era, the submarine has become a central component of modern navies. Submarine usage has gone far beyond Bushnell’s conception of lifting naval blockades designed to bleed a country dry of their imports to become an essential arm of offensive naval warfare and power projection.|$|E
5|$|The former Town Hall, {{adjoining}} the old marketplace, {{houses the}} Willis Museum (originally the Basingstoke Museum, until 1956). This was founded {{and directed by}} Alderman George W. Willis, a local clocksmith, who served as Mayor of Basingstoke in 1923-24. He established the museum in 1931 and with much public support was able to build it up into a major collection on local history, with a particularly extensive collection (largely made by him) of prehistoric implements and of antique clocks and watches. His association with the expanding museum continued for forty years. Its central location today is where, once upon a time, Jane Austen and her sister {{used to go to}} dances. Although ostensibly set in Hertford, Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, written in 1797, is thought to have been based on her view of Basingstoke society <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

2500|$|For a {{brief time}} in Europe, an unusual form of {{cannibalism}} occurred when thousands of Egyptian mummies preserved in bitumen were ground up and sold as medicine.

A more extreme view, that the whole geography of the Iliad and the Odyssey can be mapped on the coasts of the northern Atlantic, occasionally surfaces. According to this, Troy is in southern England, Telemachus's journey is in southern Spain, and Odysseus was wandering the Atlantic coast. Finally, a recent publication argues that Homeric geography is to be found in the sky, and that the Iliad and the Odyssey can be decoded as a star map.|$|E

40|$|Pride and Prejudice, {{has been}} {{on top of the}} reading lists of Jane Austen. In Austen’s artistic gallery, the {{portrayal}} of women is colorful and glittering. The panoramic view of female figures in man-dominated world, and the true description of inside-track examination of womankind, attracts eternal attention. In addition, the portraits of the men are no less noteworthy. These include the complexities of Darcy’s personality, the eccentric Mr. Bennet, the good natured, impressionable Mr. Bingley, the mediocre Mr. Collins, and the hypocritical Mr. Wickham. They are not some essential ornaments and their significant sense and position can’t acquire its deserved illumination in the artistic structures of Austen’s novel. In 19 th century, marriage was dominated by material base in English society. Social relationships and economic mode determined the rule of marriage. In Austen’s day, the only road for mid-class lady’s happy life was to marry well. The wrong choice of mate could spell social and financial disaster. Almost every woman’s ideal man was a millionaire or at least a single gentleman with a piece of estate and much money every year. However, Jane Austen brought us a fresh wind about happy marriage and her ideal man <b>two</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago.</b> From Austen’s viewpoint, her ideal man is a single man with extraordinary understanding, integrate personality, thick material base and social status...|$|R
40|$|For a long time, {{before we}} {{developed}} {{an appreciation of}} the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the brain, there was uncertainty as to the nature and source of the human mind. Philosophers linked the mind to mythical “humors” that controlled the human body, and others speculated that the mind was associated with “life-force” or soul. Few felt that there was a relation between the human mind and brain, but they had to wait for the Age of Enlightenment and scientific discovery in the 18 th and 19 th centuries to establish a clear association between the <b>two.</b> Three <b>centuries</b> <b>ago</b> Rene Descartes described the mind as an extracorporeal entity that was expressed through the pineal gland.

The manor of Cleobury Mortimer was alienated in the 16th century, leaving the crown only with the manor of Bewdley and Far Forest. Historical references to the Wyre Forest in this period seem to relate to this rather smaller area owned by the crown.

One series of leases related to the manor of Bewdley, but another concerned something called the 'Wyre Forest'. This may have related to Far Forest, {{but that is not}} clear.|$|R

Everything is three-cornered; the whole chapel, to begin with, and then the ark of the high altar in the middle of it, and each of the three side-altars. The clumsy baroque taste of the architecture is a German version of the impulse that was making Italy fantastic at the time; the carving is coarse, and the color harsh and unsoftened by years, though it is broken and obliterated in places.|$|R
60|$|We {{visited the}} {{principal}} church, also--a curious old structure, with a towerlike spire adorned {{with all sorts}} of grotesque images.

The head of the family sat in the foreground, and beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of sons; facing him sat his wife, and beyond her extended a low row of diminishing daughters. The family was usually large, but the perspective bad.|$|R
