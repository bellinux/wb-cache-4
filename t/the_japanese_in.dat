5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines.

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Sattelberg, Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese {{positions}} around Finschhafen. Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system {{to the brink of}} collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.|$|E

After the war, in February 1946, Spurr {{was part of the}} Commonwealth occupation force stationed in the Japanese naval base of Kure in southern Japan. There he noticed a huge drydock standing empty, and after querying what it had been used for, he learnt that it was where Yamato had been built. Spurr had been isolated in Burma for several years and had never heard of Yamato, but he became interested in her story and started collecting information about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{division}} was mobilised for war in December 1941 and initially undertook defensive duties in Australia before being deployed to New Guinea in 1943 where they {{took part in}} the Salamaua–Lae campaign against <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>in</b> 1943–44, before returning to Australia for rest and reorganisation.

Only four paratroopers and two Filipino guerrillas were killed in the raid.

5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by <b>the</b> <b>Japanese,</b> <b>in</b> {{an attempt to}} prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E
5|$|During the Wushe Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted {{against the}} Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Wushe Incident, since the Japanese had long played them off {{against each other}} and the Japanese used Toda and Truku (Taroko) {{collaborators}} to massacre the Tkdaya. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident. The Truku had resisted and fought the Japanese before in the 1914 Truku war 太魯閣戰爭 but had since been pacified and collaborated with <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> <b>in</b> the 1930 Wushe against the Tkdaya.|$|E
