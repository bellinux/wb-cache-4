As the dynamic model for describing vehicle motion mathematically, the equations of motion are derived. The stability derivatives in the equations of motion are determined by a simulation-based technique using computational fluid dynamics analysis.

Based {{on the study}} results of this behavior, the perception and neurology of flying insects, a novel bio-inspired guidance law is proposed for <b>the</b> terminal <b>guidance</b> for small aerial vehicle with charge-coupled device imaging seekers. The kinematics relationship between a small aerial vehicle and target is analyzed, and a two-dimensional guidance law model is established by using artificial neural networks. To compare with <b>the</b> proportional <b>guidance</b> law, <b>the</b> numerical simulations are {{carried out in the}} vertical plane and in the horizontal plane respectively. The simulation results show that the ballistic of the small aerial vehicle is straighter and the normal acceleration is smaller by using <b>the</b> bio-inspired <b>guidance</b> law than by using <b>the</b> proportional <b>guidance</b> law.

40|$|In this thesis, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) {{guidance}} {{scheme is}} discussed {{to improve the}} miss distance accuracy and the finite time stability problem in <b>the</b> Proportional Navigation <b>Guidance</b> (PNG). <b>The</b> primary goal {{of this study is}} to design <b>the</b> PID <b>guidance</b> that can accurately intercept the fast maneuvering target. <b>The</b> PID <b>guidance</b> is <b>the</b> extended version of the PNG with the integral and derivative terms in parallel. For the understanding of the conventional PNG model, the two-dimensional (2 -D) engagement model of the missile and target is analyzed. Two characteristics are found in the PNG model: (1) its? stability is kept in the finite time but becomes unstable at the vicinity of the interception and (2) the Line-of-sight angle rate (LOSR) increases as the target acceleration magnitude increases. To regulate the LOSR, <b>the</b> PID <b>guidance</b> is derived based on the servomechanism theory. <b>The</b> PID <b>guidance</b> model replaces <b>the</b> proportional gain of the conventional PNG model by the PID controller. A PID controller design using the numerical method through the iterative simulation is presented. For the various missile and target initial geometries, the capture region of <b>the</b> PID <b>guidance</b> is evaluated and compared with the conventional PNG model. In the end, <b>the</b> PID <b>guidance</b> model shows <b>the</b> improved miss distance accuracy, the extended stable time, and extended capture region when compared with the PNG model...|$|R
