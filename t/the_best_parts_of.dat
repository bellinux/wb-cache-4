5|$|George Smith {{established}} a second distillery during 1849, named the Cairngorm-Delnabo Distillery but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and {{were unable to}} meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed {{around the same time}} to build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery was transferred to the new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed {{at the same time and}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed.|$|E

500|$|...

The song was created over a period of three months by splicing syllables from previously recorded vocals by Chrisye. At the concert, spliced black-and-white footage of Chrisye was shown lip synching to the song while Erwin's orchestra performed the music. The song was well received: the audience gave it a rowdy ovation, while critics praised its lyrics and described it as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the concert.|$|E

Dan Rhodes said that Sasuke and Naruto's fight scenes in the movie are some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the film, predicting longtime fans would look forward to them.|$|E
500|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Nancy Drew {{was released on}} June 15, 2007 by Warner Bros. Pictures, with Emma Roberts as Nancy Drew, Max Thieriot as Ned Nickerson and Tate Donovan as Carson Drew. Andrew Fleming directed the film, while Jerry Weintraub produced. As with the earlier Drew films, reactions were mixed. Some see the film as updated version of the basic character: [...] "although it has been glammed up for the lucrative tween demographic, the movie retains <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the books, including, of course, their intelligent main character." [...] Others find the movie [...] "jolting" [...] because Nancy's [...] "new classmates prefer shopping to sleuthing, and Nancy's plaid skirt, penny loafers, and magnifying glass make her something of a dork, not the town hero {{she was in the}} Midwest." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Smith {{performed}} her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Directed by Judith Ivey, {{the play}} is about her mixed feelings over the success of The Simpsons, her parents, her relationships, and her struggles with bulimia. The New York Times critic Margo Jefferson called it an [...] "appealing if overlong show", adding that [...] "The career narrative needed shortening. This would involve some editing and revising but wouldn't taint <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> More. It is refreshing to hear a celebrity talk cleanly about being fame-driven and about not getting the degree or the kind of fame you craved. It's fun to watch a skilled actress use her craft to the full." [...] She would later perform the play for three weeks in Los Angeles the following year.|$|E
500|$|According to Hankinson, [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> {{the episode}} {{centered}} around Brittany and Santana, but I {{think all the}} principals—Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn too—did a great job portraying the tension and distrust pervading the team." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt the show was [...] "absurdly preachy" [...] {{on the matter of}} rumors, though he said the episode was [...] "decent". The scene in the motel room with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's brother and sister was called [...] "arguably the most affecting scene of the entire episode" [...] by Handlen, and Poniewozik wrote that [...] "Chord Overstreet sold Sam's feeling of loss". Canning felt otherwise: [...] "It may have had a better impact if we cared more about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had delivered more believable tears, but as things were, it was just some ordinary, blah drama." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne Lauenroth of the Anime News Network praised Lenalee's fight {{scenes in}} the anime's sequel D.Gray-man Hallow as she alone defeats {{multiple}} Akumas sent by the Noah Clan. Nevertheless, Lauenroth found Lenalee's inability to stop Allen from leaving the Order sad, but praised the direction of their farewell scene. Thanasis Karavasilis from Manga Tokyo agreed with the direction of Lenalee's actions in Hallow as she becomes one of Allen's last allies when he is being treated as a traitor by his comrades and how she jumps in at the climax of one episode to save him and prove Allen is a friend. Although Lenalee fails to rescue Allen in the end, Karavasilis felt their farewell [...] implied a romantic interaction between them, but joked {{he did not want}} that due to his obsession with her. In addition he liked Lenalee's action scenes calling her [...] "Bat-Lenalee". Karavasilis selected Lenalee as his favorite female character in the series as well as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Hallow. He also noted that although some fans were annoyed with Shizuka Itō being replaced by Ai Kakuma, he did not mind the change of voice actress for Lenalee.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the realm}} of the internet, the scene during which Jasmine kisses Jafar in order to {{distract}} him from Aladdin is oftentimes viewed as a point of contention among feminist writers and bloggers; Meredith Ancret of The Snark Who Hunts Back argued that both the Sultan and Genie are similarly enslaved by Jafar. Ancret continued to defend Jasmine for being of her own mind, bravely defying Jafar on numerous occasions, and praised her distraction of the villain for being instrumental to Aladdin's success. Also defending Jasmine's decision to kiss Jafar, feminist critic Mari Rogers explained to The Daily Dot that [...] "Jasmine was a strong character and I think in many ways the story's focus on Aladdin sort of makes us forget this", concluding, [...] "Even in her own movie, she was always the force behind her decisions. She went out seeking things". Awarding Aladdin a [...] "neutral" [...] grade in terms of feminism, Fanny Pack wrote that [...] "What stops Aladdin from being wholly negative ... is the sheer strength of Jasmine as a character" [...] who [...] "seems to take <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Ariel and Belle and build them into an even better, stronger, and sassier princess".|$|E

[...] Stewart also said that urban numbers such as [...] "Baby," [...] "survive their makeovers without a hitch." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave the album 2 and a half out of 5 stars saying that the album was [...] "an enticement." [...] Dan Savoie of Rockstar Weekly gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, {{saying that it is}} [...] "the perfect showcase for a talented young artist who's {{on his way to the}} Grammy Awards this year." [...] Although she commented that the [...] "acoustic" [...] labeling was a bit misleading, Monica Hererra of Billboard said that the album [...] "succeeds", calling songs like the live version of [...] "Favorite Girl" [...] the album's saving grace and [...] "truly acoustic." [...] On the former, Herrera said, [...] "It's the one moment where you can hear all of the young artist's strengths falling in line-raw talent, maturing vocals and, of course, an all-too-valuable connection with his fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stones Caryn Grant {{wrote that}} [...] "the album {{is at its}} strongest when Madonna shoves {{everyone}} {{to the side and}} just tells it to us straight. So it's fitting that she wraps up the deluxe edition with the title track [...] Deep down, she does have a rebel heart— and you can't fault her for reminding us that pop music is all the better for it". Of the leaked demo, Daniel Welsh from The Huffington Post, wrote that [...] "it’s taken <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> Avicii’s sound and blended them with Madonna, rather than giving us an ear-assaulting [...] "Avicii feat. Madonna" [...] number about 'putting your drinks up' and 'getting down on the floor'". Spin said it was the singer's [...] "sweetest melody since 'What It Feels Like for a Girl', with her register dropped an octave or two until it resembles the Liz Phair of 2005's (underrated) Somebody's Miracle". Q magazine called it a [...] "movingly autobiographical title track, where Madonna reflects at length on her career and her motivation. It makes you wonder what she thinks she has to prove in 2015 with a song like 'Bitch I'm Madonna' when she proved it all and we’ve been paying attention for years".|$|E
