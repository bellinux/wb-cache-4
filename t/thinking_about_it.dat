5|$|All six main {{cast members}} from the pilot {{returned}} for the series; James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale play Adam Williams and Rachel Bradley, a couple in a fledgling relationship; John Thomson and Fay Ripley play Pete and Jenny Gifford, a married couple whose first child is born in the first episode; Robert Bathurst and Hermione Norris play David and Karen Marsden, an upper-middle-class couple who are considering having a second child. Each had mixed feelings about whether {{there would be a}} series commission after the poor reception of the pilot; Ripley did not stop <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> in contrast to Bathurst, who viewed it as just another failed pilot he had done.|$|E
25|$|In the night, or in a ship without windows, it {{is helpful}} to simply close one's eyes, or if possible, take a nap. This {{resolves}} the input conflict between the eyes and the inner ear. Napping also helps prevent psychogenic effects (i.e. the effect of sickness being magnified by <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it).</b>|$|E
25|$|Another way of <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is {{that the}} problem is not about the chance that the other side is black, it's about the chance that you drew the all black card.

500|$|In the song, Bedingfield {{discusses}} a woman's {{fight to}} stop herself from rushing into relationships {{in an effort}} to find the right man to father her children. Bedingfield stated that she does not want to have children at this point in time, but that she is <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> According to her, [...] "the song is about pacing yourself and taking everything slowly." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that.

500|$|By and large, the Beatles {{had avoided}} {{publicly}} expressing their political views, with [...] "Taxman" [...] being their only overtly political track thus far.

500|$|Because Scheyer's {{talent was}} obvious {{by the time}} he was set to start high school, many people {{encouraged}} his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program. [...] The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents: [...] "We'll just do it here. We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." [...] His father said: [...] "I get chills <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] That wasn't my vision. [...] It wasn't Laury's.

500|$|Thompson {{initially}} {{hoped that}} Doran would cast sisters Natasha and Joely Richardson as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Lee and Columbia wanted Thompson herself, now a [...] "big-deal movie star" [...] after her critically successful {{role in the}} 1992 film Howards End, to play Elinor. The actress replied that {{at the age of}} thirty-five, she was too old for the nineteen-year-old character. Lee suggested Elinor's age be changed to twenty-seven, which would also have made the difficult reality of spinsterhood easier for modern audiences to understand. Thompson agreed, later stating that she was [...] "desperate to get into a corset and act it and stop <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as a script." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{emotional}} McCaw {{could not}} hide his disappointment at the after-match press conference: [...] "If I knew the answers {{we would have}} sorted it out. We will be <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for a long time". McCaw denied New Zealand's easy run into the quarter-finals {{played a part in}} the loss [...] "A lot of the guys have been through this before, they've played big test matches." [...] Graham Henry's policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was [...] criticised. McCaw also came under attack. He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field.|$|E
500|$|Confident that he {{will get}} the {{corporate}} job in New York City, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) sells his condo and names Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) his successor as Regional Manager. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) cheerfully withstands her colleagues' teasing over her speech from [...] "Beach Games," [...] and tells Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) {{that she is not}} sorry about what she said but regrets putting Karen in an awkward position. Meanwhile, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) whom he finds more attractive between Karen and Pam. Though Jim initially refuses to answer, he becomes intrigued when Kevin starts to compare the two women. He tells Kevin to keep <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in a joking way, but appears to be very interested in the results.|$|E
500|$|Brian Crecente, {{editor-in-chief}} of Kotaku, praised the general use of {{light as a}} gameplay-mechanic. He commented on the episodic structure, saying it made the player feel satisfied even after short gameplay sessions. He also praised the overall storyline, having played the final episode thrice in a row, saying: [...] "For {{the first time in}} my life, I have experienced something that plays like a game but has the impact of a movie... Alan Wake is a powerful ride, an experience bound to leave you <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and wanting more for days after its completion." [...] He criticised the game for not providing enough information about Wake and his wife, despite being [...] "packed with memorable people", but concluded that the game [...] "redefines interactive storytelling".|$|E

40|$|Metacognition {{is often}} defined as <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>thinking.</b> <b>It</b> is {{exemplified}} {{in all the}} activities through which one tries to predict and evaluate one's own mental dispositions, states and properties for their cognitive adequacy. This article discusses the view that metacognition has metarepresentational structure. Properties such as causal contiguity, epistemic transparency and procedural reflexivity are present in metacognition but missing in metarepresentation, while open-ended recursivity and inferential promiscuity only occur in metarepresentation. It is concluded that, although metarepresentations can redescribe metacognitive contents, metacognition and metarepresentation are functionally distinct...|$|R

500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film, and if I can get ‘em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of the single-player aspect varied. Yin-Poole {{wrote that}} while the cliffhanger ending of Halo 2 was disappointing, the {{campaign}} of Halo 3 was much more satisfying. Gerstmann, GameSpy's Gabe Graziani, and Goldstein maintained that the campaign was too short, especially on easier difficulty levels or with three additional players in co-op. Goldstein was {{highly critical of the}} eighth level, stating [...] "the penultimate chapter is so bad, just <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> puts a rotten taste in my mouth." [...] The New York Times Charles Herold said the game had a [...] "throwaway" [...] plot and Total Video Games judged the single-player aspect ultimately disappointing. Goldstein and Steve West of Cinema Blend thought a part of the game's story was lost by not having the Arbiter featuring as prominently as the character was in Halo 2.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E

500|$|On Tuesday, 27 July, Harrison and Shankar, {{accompanied}} by a pipe-smoking Allen Klein, {{held a press conference}} to promote the two shows; notoriously performance-shy, Harrison admitted: [...] "Just <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> makes me shake." [...] The [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] charity single was issued in America on 28 July, with a UK release following two days later. Ringo Starr arrived on the Thursday, and by Friday, 30 July, Russell was in town, interrupting his US tour. Russell's band members Claudia Linnear and Don Preston were added to Don Nix's choir of backing singers; Preston would switch to lead guitar for Russell's solo spot during the shows, just as bassist Carl Radle would replace Voormann temporarily. By this point, Clapton's participation was gravely in doubt, and Harrison had drafted in Jesse Ed Davis as a probable replacement. The ex-Taj Mahal guitarist received last-minute coaching from Voormann, who was more than familiar with Harrison's songs, as well as those by Billy Preston and Starr.|$|E

[...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – {{a lot of people around}} us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other."
