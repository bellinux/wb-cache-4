40|$|Dynamic {{wireless}} charging (DWC) of electric vehicles (EVs) is an emerging technology {{that could lead}} to the breakthrough of EVs. The technology is based on the inductive coupling between an electrified track deployed under the road surface and a pickup coil fitted in EV. This paper refers to a lumped track made of DD coils and is concerned with the design of the track layout, namely coil dimension in the motion direction and <b>track</b> <b>coil</b> distance for a given energy requirement. This paper starts by comparing the coupling characteristics of DD coils with different dimensions by a finite-element method (FEM) analysis. Afterward, an analytical procedure is developed to establish the <b>track</b> <b>coil</b> distance able to transfer to a moving EV the propulsion energy required per unit of traveled space. The procedure utilizes the DD-coil coupling characteristics to calculate the power and, from it, the energy transferred from the track coils to the pickup coil along the track. Instrumental in the calculation is the definition of a parameter, denoted as track flux coverage, which gives the ratio between the dimension of the track coils in the motion direction and the coil distance; such a parameter corresponds to the percentage of road populated with track coils so that it is a cost index of the DWC system implementation. Effects of a lateral displacement of the EV motion from the line joining the <b>track</b> <b>coil</b> centers are also analyzed.

A stack of twodimensional images is acquired by moving an internal surface coil along the structure of interest and using the images {{as the basis for}} creating the three-dimensional image [...] Spatial information about the individual two-dimensional images is required in order to t' correctly build the three-dimensional image: Specialised <b>tracking</b> <b>coils</b> for the colonoscope have been constructed to provide the location and orientation needed for each image acquired from an imaging coil that can be mounted on the colonoscope. The <b>tracking</b> <b>coils</b> are used for both acquiring positional information and for defining the location for scanning.

Images and tracking data were collected from experiments using an MRI scanner, cylindrical phantoms to mimic the colorectum, and a colonoscope coil mounted on a mock colonoscope that also housed the <b>tracking</b> <b>coils.</b> Image processing techniques were used to filter each image and to correct for the falloff of the signal as the distance increased from the imaging coil.

Hence, electric and hybrid vehicles have won the attention of many researchers and vehicles manufacturers.

40|$|The Inductrack {{magnetic}} levitation system, {{developed at the}} Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, is being studied for its possible use for launching rockets. Under NASA sponsorship, a small model system is being constructed at the Laboratory to pursue key technical aspects of this proposed application. The Inductrack is a passive {{magnetic levitation}} system employing special arrays of high-field permanent magnets (Halbach arrays) on the levitating carrier, moving above a "track" consisting of a close-packed array of shorted coils with which are interleaved with special drive coils. Halbach arrays produce a strong spatially periodic magnetic field on the front surface of the arrays, while canceling the field on their back surface. Relative motion between the Halbach arrays and the <b>track</b> <b>coils</b> induces currents in those coils. These currents levitate the carrier cart by interacting with the horizontal component of the magnetic field. Pulsed currents in the drive coils, synchronized with {{the motion of the}} carrier, interact with the vertical component of the magnetic field to provide acceleration forces. Motional stability, including resistance to both vertical and lateral aerodynamic forces, is provided by having Halbach arrays that interact with both the upper and the lower sides of the <b>track</b> <b>coils.</b> In its completed form the model system that is under construction will have a track approximately 100 meters in length along which the carrier cart will be propelled up to peak speeds of Mach 0. 4 to 0. 5 before being decelerated.

30|$|After all, as the {{difference}} between the technical accuracies of the OTS and EMTS was found to be marginal, the most suitable method of instrument tracking for surgical procedures can be chosen using criteria other than purely technical accuracy. The greatest difference between the tracking modalities involves the tracking of the instruments used. Compared with the OTS, the EMTS has unique advantages for special surgical procedures. The <b>tracked</b> <b>coils</b> are placed {{near the end of the}} tip of the EMTS guided instrument, while the reflecting spheres or active markers on the OTS need to be placed farther away to provide line-of-sight visibility (Verbakel et al. 2010). This significant difference between the tracking methods means that the EMTS instrument tip is tracked closer to the sensitive anatomical structures. Also, the OTS requires stable positioning and immobilization of the patient (Koivukangas 2012). Since the EMTS patient trackers are light and may be attached to the patient without for example skull clamps, rigid immobilization of the patient during procedures is not as critical. Furthermore, EMTS makes navigation possible even for infants as immobilization is not necessarily required as long as the patient tracker is securely attached to the patient. On the other hand, some EMTS instruments are quite flexible and if subjected to a bending force, the method may result in significant accuracy errors. Since EMTS navigation is based on <b>tracking</b> the <b>coils</b> of the instrument, the relationship between the coils must not be changed during the procedure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MR guided {{interstitial}} {{laser therapy}} {{can be used}} to monitor the extent of tumor tissue coagulation during thermal treatment based on a temperature map. In a non-stationary object that was influenced by respiratory motion, the temperature map may show errors due to incorrect spatial baseline images. Moreover, an unwanted phase shift due to object displacement contributes to errors in the temperature map, that must be suppressed. This paper describes a strategy which addresses the difficulties of MR guided interstitial laser therapy in the presence of respiratory motion. The multi-baseline images, supported by the displacement correction scheme, were used to improve the temporal resolution of a temperature map in the respiratory cycle. In the displacement correction scheme, the object coordinates that are provided by an active <b>tracking</b> <b>coil</b> were employed to support a matching strategy between the thermal and baseline images. To avoid errors in the temperature map due to the motion artifact, a detector of low quality images was proposed as part of the displacement correction scheme. ...|$|R

40|$|A linear {{synchronous}} motor (LSM) is an electric motor that can produce large controllable forces and is therefore suitable as a driving engine for a seismic vibrator. This motor consists of two independent elements, a magnet <b>track</b> and a <b>coil</b> <b>track,</b> allowing practically unlimited motor displacements. This makes the LSM very suitable for expanding the source frequency band to the lower frequencies in which larger strokes are needed. In contrast to hydraulic engines, the LSM performs equally well over the whole frequency range, making possible a smaller amount of signal distortion, especially at the low frequencies. To find the feasibility of an LSM-driven vibrator, we successfully designed and built a multi-LSM prototype vibrator of some 1200 kg. We addressed the synchronization between the individual motor tracks and the different motors. To lower the energy consumption, a spring mechanism was implemented that delivered the force needed to lift the vibrator mass to its neutral position.

It is also intended to confirm the possibility of applying the method of calculation of traction that occurs in the engine in the interaction of the permanent magnetic field of the excitation system of a vehicle with a <b>coil</b> <b>track</b> structure. Methodology. As for empirical theories the positive result of the experiment is not absolute proof of the truth, for an unambiguous conclusion about the adequacy of the developed model and the effectiveness of the developed methods need to be tested for falsification. In accordance with this criterion, it is necessary to conduct an experiment, the results of which will coincide with the calculation but you also need to avoid errors caused by random coincidences. For this purpose the experiments with varying parameters are conducted. Findings. In a critical experiment configuration changes of the excitation system were held so that the shape dependence of traction from displacement is differed significantly. The comparison of the results of the calculated and experimental values of traction for different configurations showed that the differences are minor and easily explained by measurement error and uneven gaps between the poles and excitation <b>coils</b> of the <b>track</b> structure.

The SSC’s orientation components measured by the SSC system {{are involved in the}} location-tracking algorithm as well. The suggested method differs from traditional ones where the eye location is computed indirectly, relative to the measured location and orientation of a transitional three-axial magnetic sensor attached to the subject’s head. The new method eliminates systematic errors caused by in-accurate situating the transitional sensor relative to the eye. It also eliminates systematic errors caused by imperfect orthogonality of the transitional sensor. It is found that an accurate location tracking with a single transmitter is possible only if orientation freedom of the eye is limited. To track the eye location with no orientation limitations, a triad of transmitters is employed. The resulting accuracy can be as good as 1 mm (in a 200 -Hz bandwidth) over a relatively large (0. 5 0. 5 0. 5 m) operating region {{in the center of a}} 1 1 1 m SSC system.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} which determines the forward/backward direction of nuclear re- <b>coil</b> <b>tracks</b> using the head-tail signature {{as measured by}} a novel elementary particle detector. The detector, constructed at UH by {{a team led by}} Dr. Sven Vahsen, can detect electrically neutral particles, such as neutrons and possibly dark matter particles, via their elastic scattering off gas nuclei. These nuclei recoil and leave millimeter-long ionization trails in the gas which are recorded by the detector. Theoretically the 3 -D distribution of ionization carries enough information to reconstruct both the direction of nuclear recoils and the species of the recoiling nuclei. The algorithm developed in this way removes the ambiguity in the forward/backward direction of the track by exploiting the asymmetric charge distribution {{along the length of the}} track. To improve the algorithm accuracy we selected for tracks which the algorithm handles best using the following variables: head-tail charge fraction, event energy, sum of time over threshold, number of charge deposits which make up the track, and track length. A bias towards horizontally angled recoils was observed in tracks with large head-tail asymmetry. A proposed mechanism is angled tracks will have one end drift further than the other, thus inducing a fake head-tail effect. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of the algorithm can be increased to 80 % by adding restrictions on these variables alone, an estimated 90 % after correcting for drift diffusion and suggest that an energy dependent algorithm be required to analyze particles with energy beyond the Bragg peak...|$|R

The aim of our study was to evaluate the accuracy of frameless stereotaxic coil positioning in a standard experimental setting. A parameter for accuracy is the reproducibility of LM coordinates. In order to test the stability of the referencing for stereotaxic positioning within a single TMS session (within-session stability), the coordinates of six predefined facial LM in nine subjects were recorded first after the initial registration and second after a 20 minutes TMS session. The two sets of coordinates were then compared. The reliability of the positioning coordinates between different TMS sessions (inter-session repeatability) was addressed by registering the subjects LM coordinates in two independent TMS sessions. The variance of the recorded coordinates was analyzed. Altogether, LM were registered 1728 times (192 measures per subject). Within-session stability: The mean Euclidean distance (MED) between the LM position coordinates before and after a TMS session was 1. 6 mm, when pooling over all LM. Inter-session repeatability: The MED between the LM positions recorded after the reference procedures of two different sessions showed an average deviation of 2. 5 mm. In conclusion, optically <b>tracked</b> frameless stereotaxic <b>coil</b> positioning is from the technical viewpoint of high stability and repeatability. It is therefore a precise method for TMS brain mapping studies or for repeated TMS treatments, with the need of topographically exact stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Gradient coil {{windings}} are typically constructed from either variable width copper tracks or fixed width wires. Excessive power dissipation within these windings during gradient coil operation limits the maximum drive current or duty {{cycle of the}} coil. It is common to design gradient coils {{in terms of a}} continuous minimum power current density and to perform a discretization to obtain the locations of the <b>coil</b> <b>tracks</b> or wires. However, the existence of finite gaps between these conductors and a maximum conductor width leads to an underestimation of coil resistance when calculated using the continuous current density. Put equivalently, the actual current density within the tracks or wires is higher than that used in the optimization and this departure results in suboptimal coil designs. In this work, a mapping to an effective current density is proposed to account for these effects and provide the correct contribution to the power dissipation. This enables the design of gradient coils that are genuinely optimal in terms of power minimization, post-discretization. The method was applied to the theoretical design of a variety of small x- and z-gradient coils for use in small animal imaging and coils for human head imaging. Computer-driven comparisons were made between coils designed with and without the current density mapping, in terms of simulated power dissipation. For coils to be built using variable width tracks, the method provides slight reductions in power dissipation in most cases and substantial gains only in cases where the minimum separation between track centre-lines is less than twice the gap size. However, for coils to be built using fixed width wires, very considerable reductions in dissipated power are consistently attainable (up to 60 %) when compared to standard approaches of coil optimization...|$|R
