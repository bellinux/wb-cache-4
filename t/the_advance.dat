5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop <b>the</b> <b>advance,</b> the scorer may rule that <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an advance but then elects not to throw, <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> is not due to defensive indifference.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> to the Hongorai, {{there was}} a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia.

5|$|The British moved three fresh brigades {{up to the}} Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April {{to support}} <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to {{leapfrog}} existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line. Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, the Blue Line, including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line, <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported advance via Farbus and directed {{at the rear of}} the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village.

5|$|When a baserunner is able {{to advance}} after a pitch is not caught or {{controlled}} by the catcher, the official scorer must determine whether <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> was due to a wild pitch or a passed ball. The pitch is never {{considered to be an}} error. If a pitch is thrown so high, wide, or low in relation to the strike zone that a catcher is not able to catch or control the ball with ordinary effort before a runner can advance, <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> is ruled to have occurred by a wild pitch. Any such pitch which strikes the ground before it reaches home plate is automatically considered to be a wild pitch. However, a pitch is not a wild pitch merely because it is off-target. If the official scorer determines that the catcher {{should have been able to}} control the pitch and prevent an advance with ordinary effort, then the catcher is charged with a passed ball on <b>the</b> <b>advance.</b>|$|E

5|$|After a {{few days}} out of the line, the {{battalion}} resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, {{a few days}} later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel. <b>The</b> <b>advance</b> continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading. Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the Po River with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the Adige River was traversed the next day, again with relative ease. The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over <b>the</b> <b>advance,</b> with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve. Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of Padua and Gorizia, before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.|$|E

In late December, the 20th Brigade rotated back into the lead, and the 2/15th took over from the 22nd Battalion around the Tunom River, where the battalion headquarters came under aerial attack. After a brief pause near the flood swollen Tunom, <b>the</b> <b>advance</b> continued throughout December and into January 1944 with minor skirmishes punctuating the battalion's advance.
