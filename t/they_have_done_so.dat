At the fall of the ninth wicket of the Indian's second innings Muralitharan still needed one wicket to reach the milestone. After 90 minutes of {{resistance}} Muralitharan was able to dismiss the last Indian batsman Pragyan Ojha on the last delivery of the final over of his Test career. By doing so he became the only bowler to reach 800 wickets in Test cricket. Sri Lanka won the match by 10 wickets, the seventh time <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> and the second time they have done it against India.|$|E

In several countries with majority Muslim populations, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so</b> on the same basis as Iran and Egyptthat since Islam does not recognize the Bahá'í Faith, neither should the government, and thus all manner of social services and identity are circumscribed. Banning orders have been made against Bahá'í activities in Algeria (1969), Iraq (1970 and versions since) and Indonesia (especially but not exclusively 1962-2000). During the late 1970s, the Bahá'í Faith was also banned {{in a number of}} countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Burundi, 1974; Mali 1976; Uganda 1977; Congo, 1978; and Niger, 1978).|$|E

25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so,</b> they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into sleep mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password.

25|$|Despite losing three {{starters}} {{from the}} previous era's squad, the Rebels started off strong once again for their 2009–10 campaign with their second consecutive 5–0 start, {{the first time since}} 1989–90 and 1990–91 that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b> Their victory over #16 Louisville was their first home victory against a ranked opponent since 2007 and the highest ranked opponent the Rebels have beaten since defeating the Wisconsin Badgers (ranked 6th in the final AP Poll) in 2007. On November 30, 2009, the Rebels were ranked 24th in the AP Polls and 21st in the USA Today/ESPN Polls, making it the first time the team was ranked since 2007. However, UNLV soon dropped out of the AP Top 25 with losses to Kansas State and USC. In early February, however, UNLV upset a No. 14 and Jimmer Fredette–lead BYU team. As a result, UNLV returned to the national rankings, but after losing their next three, they soon dropped out, though they recovered {{at the end of the}} season, and finished 11–5 in MWC play. On March 6, 2010, they ended their 2009–10 campaign with 74–56 win over Wyoming at home. They finished the season 23–7, their best win–loss season since 2007. Despite losing in the finals of the Mountain West tournament the following weekend, UNLV did manage to defeat BYU for the fifth time in six matchups. On March 14, 2010, the Runnin' Rebels returned to the NCAA Tournament after missing out in 2009. They finished the season with a 25–9 record, losing in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Northern Iowa 66–69, thanks to a 3–pointer with under 3 seconds to go by the Panthers.|$|E
500|$|Arens' primary {{hypothesis}} is that despite claims made by western explorers and anthropologists since the 15th century, there is no firm, substantiable evidence for the socially accepted practice of cannibalism anywhere in the world, {{at any time in}} history. Dismissing claims of cultural cannibalism made against the Carib and Aztec peoples by invading Spanish colonialists, he tackles 19th and 20th century claims regarding socially acceptable cannibalism in Sub-Saharan Africa and New Guinea. Turning to prehistory, he critiques archaeological claims to have discovered evidence for such practices in Europe and North America. In {{the second half of the}} work, Arens puts forward his argument that an erroneous belief in [...] "others" [...] who commit socially sanctioned cannibalism is a global phenomenon. He proceeds to chastise the anthropological community for perpetuating the [...] "Man-Eating Myth", suggesting reasons as to why <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

Carlock and Fey agreed to the idea that a song be included in the season finale, but that it be an anthem like the 1985 charity song, [...] "We Are the World", [...] as the cause is that the Milton Greene character is in need of a kidney donor. [...] "Basically, the parameters were if 'We Are the World' but they want to get a kidney. I think we had angles that everyone has two kidneys and you'll only need one kidney, and we thought 'Alright, we'll get some distance on that'", said Richmond. While working on the track, Fey suggested to Richmond that he incorporate Milton Greene's name in one part of the song, which he did, as this was sung by singers Cyndi Lauper and Robert Randolph.|$|E
