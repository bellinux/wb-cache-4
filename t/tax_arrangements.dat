Under Dutch tax law, bands are subject to low to non-existent tax rates. U2's manager, Paul McGuinness, stated that the arrangement is legal and customary and businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens. The move prompted criticisms in the Irish parliament. The band later responded by stating that approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, {{and that they were}} taxed globally because of this.

Mesolevel: taxation in the secondary and tertiary industries appeared with a U-path of influence on upgrading of the industrial structure. An increase of taxation in the secondary industry had a negative impact on rationalization of the industrial structure.

40|$|Sub-central {{government}} (SCG) funding <b>arrangements,</b> particularly <b>tax</b> sharing <b>arrangements</b> and intergovernmental grants, {{are often}} difficult to disentangle. Statistical databases, including Fiscal Network statistics, do not always provide coherent and comparable data on these arrangements. To overcome such data weaknesses, a test was applied on all tax sharing systems and intergovernmental grants. This test, using four criteria, helped to distinguish the various SCG revenue arrangements. Applying the four test criteria allowed drawing a coherent and comparable dividing line: between <b>tax</b> sharing <b>arrangements</b> and intergovernmental grants and, within <b>tax</b> sharing <b>arrangements,</b> between strict <b>tax</b> sharing and tax sharing. The {{study found that the}} dividing line between “tax sharing ” and “intergovernmental grants”, as shown by data bases such as National Accounts or Revenue Statistics, remains unchanged for most countries.

Dealing with tax conflict settlement, tax law has provided two law channels in solving tax conflict, which are: the problem that solved by conflict parties (between people as taxpayer and dirjen pajak as fiskus) themselves; and the solution in tax court. However those two channels give tax payer fewer guarantees in law protection. 	The result of this research shows that tax law in Indonesia has regulated the mechanism of tax conflict settlement. There are two main law shelters that arrange those mechanisms, which are : Acts Number 28 / 2007, about Perubahan Ketiga Terhadap Undang – Undang Nomor 6 Tahun 1983, tentang Ketentuan Umum Tata Cara Perpajakan; and also Acts Number 14 / 2002, about Pengadilan Pajak (Tax Court).
