5|$|During the University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice {{investigated the}} relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for NCAA rules violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It {{is one of the largest}} incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. It was described as one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four worst violations of NCAA bylaws in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.|$|E
5|$|Head also {{demonstrated}} that the teeth of Eolambia were broader and more asymmetrical than Kirkland had assumed; {{he also noted that}} subadults only possessed two teeth per tooth position, unlike hadrosaurids, although adult specimens in fact have <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> more tooth positions as originally demonstrated by Kirkland. Head further showed that Eolambia possessed seven sacral vertebrae, unlike eight or more in derived hadrosaurids, and that its antitrochanter was actually more poorly developed than those of Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. Examination of the OMNH specimens further demonstrated that that the postacetabular region of the ilium did not form a distinct process, and the articulations {{at the bottom of the}} femur are not very prominent, both of which separate Eolambia from more derived iguanodonts such as hadrosaurids. Thus, Head concluded that Eolambia was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, outside of the Hadrosauridae, a conclusion supported by a phylogenetic analysis finding it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid closely related to Probactrosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> {{four years}} after {{his visit to the}} papacy, {{agreements}} were made with the various institutions who were drawing income from Clement's diocese – namely Coupar Angus Abbey, Lindores Abbey, Cambuskenneth Abbey, Arbroath Abbey, the nunnery of North Berwick and the Hospital of Brackley, Northamptonshire. These agreements did not constitute complete success. Clement was able to recover some revenue, but in fixed payments liable to real decline by way of inflation. Moreover, he had to concede permanent canonries to several of the abbots, concessions which would give them a role in the election of his successors. Another partial set-back took place. Walter Comyn, Earl of Menteith, had decided to found a monastery in his earldom and take up the income of Menteith's churches to do it; the whole of Menteith constituted nearly half of the diocese. Despite the Pope's previously helpful behaviour towards Clement's cause, he granted the earl permission to found the new monastery. The earl established Inchmahome Priory in the Lake of Menteith in 1238. Walter and Clement came to conflict over the new priory's rights, but in the same year an agreement was drawn up in a meeting of churchmen at Perth. The agreement placed most of Menteith's churches {{under the control of the}} earl; however, Clement obtained several concessions, including the right to receive episcopal dues from the new priory. Overall, Clement's successes were considerable considering the opposition which he faced, but even after his death, only 12 of the 26 parish churches in the diocese were under the bishop's direct control.|$|E

25|$|In 1877, two prospectors, Hank Smith and William Curry, {{discovered}} {{silver in}} present-day Silverado Canyon. Several mines immediately sprang {{up in the}} area, the largest of which {{was known as the}} Blue Light Mine. During this period, the town of Silverado rose at the confluence of Silverado Creek and Santiago Creek and the boom continued for over three years. Although the height of the mining was in <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four years following the discovery of silver, smaller-scale mining continued for decades after the initial boom had ended. The last commercial operations at the Blue Light Mine ceased in the 1940s. The mine has continued to issue small amounts of toxic tailings, including arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury, remediation for which the Trabuco Ranger District of the Cleveland National Forest began toxic cleanup in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Butterfield also oversaw {{installation}} of the taping system which Nixon ordered for the White House. On February 10, 1971, Haldeman's assistant, Larry Higby, told Butterfield that president Nixon wanted a voice-activated audio taping system installed in the Oval Office and on White House telephones. The goal, Nixon said, {{was to create a}} more accurate record of events. Butterfield worked with the Secret Service to install five hidden microphones in Nixon's desk, two in lamps on the mantel over the fireplace, two in the cabinet room, and on all telephone lines in the Lincoln Sitting Room and the Oval Office. According to Butterfield, the system was highly secret, its existence known only to Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Higby, <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four Secret Service technical staffers who installed it, and him. In April 1971, Nixon ordered the taping system installed in his private office in the Executive Office Building.|$|E
25|$|Allied forces {{begin to}} take large numbers of Axis prisoners: The total number of prisoners taken on the Western Front in April 1945 by the Western Allies was 1,500,000. April also {{witnessed}} the capture of at least 120,000 German troops by the Western Allies in the last campaign {{of the war in}} Italy. In <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four months up to the end of April, over 800,000 German soldiers surrendered on the Eastern Front. In early April, the first Allied-governed Rheinwiesenlagers were established in western Germany to hold hundreds of thousands of captured or surrendered Axis Forces personnel. Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) reclassified all prisoners as Disarmed Enemy Forces, not POWs (prisoners of war). The legal fiction circumvented provisions under the Geneva Convention of 1929 on the treatment of former combatants. By October, thousands had died in the camps from starvation, exposure and disease.|$|E
25|$|Jacques Bellange (c. 1575–1616) was {{an artist}} and {{printmaker}} from the Duchy of Lorraine (then independent but now part of France) whose etchings and some drawings are his only securely identified works today. They {{are among the most}} striking Northern Mannerist old master prints, mostly on Catholic religious subjects, and with a highly individual style. He worked for fourteen years in the capital, Nancy as court painter to two Dukes of Lorraine, before dying at the age of about forty, and almost all his prints were produced in <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four years before his death. None of his paintings are known to have survived, but the prints have been known to collectors since shortly after his death, though they were out of critical favour for most of this period. In the 20th century they have been much more highly regarded, although Bellange is still not a well-known figure.|$|E

500|$|On 13 June 1957 {{he became}} {{chairman}} of a committee of Privy Counsellors holding an inquiry into the Home Secretary's use of telephone tapping. After twenty-nine meetings, Birkett drafted a report which he passed on to Parliament supporting the use of telephone taps and noting their effectiveness. On 9 December, a letter arrived from the Prime Minister offering him a peerage. He accepted, and his name appeared in the New Year Honours list, and was created Baron Birkett, of Ulverston in the County of Lancaster, and took his seat in the House of Lords on 20 February 1958. In the same year, he was awarded a LLD by the University of Cambridge, where the speaker said that Birkett was [...] "endowed with such a voice as Cicero declared to be first requisite of an orator" [...] and that [...] "in our own time {{there had been no}} one more skilled in swaying the mind of a jury." [...] In February 1959, he appeared on the first episode of the BBC television program Face to Face, where he was described as [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four greatest criminal lawyers of this century, and perhaps one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four greatest criminal lawyers of all time".

500|$|After {{his visit}} to Rome for Il trovatore in January 1853, Verdi worked on {{completing}} La traviata, but with little hope of its success, due to his {{lack of confidence in}} any of the singers engaged for the season. Furthermore, the management insisted that the opera be given a historical, not a contemporary setting. The premiere in March 1853 was indeed a failure: Verdi wrote: [...] "Was the fault mine or the singers'? Time will tell." [...] Subsequent productions (following some rewriting) throughout Europe over the following two years fully vindicated the composer; Roger Parker has written [...] "Il trovatore consistently remains one of <b>the</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> four most popular operas in the Verdian repertoire: but it has never pleased the critics".|$|E
