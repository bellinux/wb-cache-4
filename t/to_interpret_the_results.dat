25|$|Some of {{the roots}} of {{algebraic}} geometry {{date back to the}} work of the Hellenistic Greeks from the 5th century BC. The Delian problem, for instance, was to construct a length x so that the cube of side x contained the same volume as the rectangular box a2b for given sides a and b. Menaechmus (circa 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics aynbsp&=nbsp&x2 and xynbsp&=nbsp&ab. The later work, in the 3rd century BC, of Archimedes and Apollonius studied more systematically problems on conic sections, and also involved the use of coordinates. The Arab mathematicians were able to solve by purely algebraic means certain cubic equations, and then <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> geometrically. This was done, for instance, by Ibn al-Haytham in the 10th century AD. Subsequently, Persian mathematician Omar Khayyám (born 1048 A.D.) discovered a method for solving cubic equations by intersecting a parabola with a circle.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of sociodemographic and health-provider factors on women's {{understanding}} of abnormal results on measurement of nuchal translucency (NT) and maternal serum screening (MSS), 18 months after {{the implementation of a}} policy aimed at increasing women's awareness regarding MSS. METHODS: A representative sample of women (n = 734) who gave birth in Parisian maternity units in 1999 were asked about their understanding of an abnormal result on MSS and NT. We assessed {{the effects of}} sociodemographic and health-provider factors on the probability of women interpreting an abnormal result correctly, misinterpreting it as a definitive diagnosis, or declaring {{that they did not know}} how <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> <b>result.</b> Response rate was 92 % and the analyses included multinomial models. RESULTS: For both MSS and NT measurement, the majority of women interpreted an abnormal result correctly. However, there were substantial sociodemographic differences in the probability of women interpreting an abnormal result correctly, and more so in the probability of their declaring not to know how <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> <b>result.</b> <b>The</b> probability of correct interpretations was substantially higher, and that of declaring not to know how <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> substantially lower, for MSS than NT measurement. However, for several sociodemographic groups, the proportion of women who misinterpreted an abnormal result on screening as indicative of a definitive diagnosis was also higher for MSS as compared with NT measurement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need for additional efforts, along with alternative strategies, to inform women about the implications of prenatal screening, particularly in the case of measurement of NT...|$|R

5000|$|An {{experiment}} usually tests a hypothesis, {{which is}} an expectation about how a particular process or phenomenon works. However, an experiment may also aim to answer a [...] "what-if" [...] question, without a specific expectation about what the experiment reveals, or to confirm prior results. If an experiment is carefully conducted, the results usually either support or disprove the hypothesis. According to some philosophies of science, an experiment can never [...] "prove" [...] a hypothesis, it can only add support. On the other hand, an experiment that provides a counterexample can disprove a theory or hypothesis. An experiment must also control the possible confounding factors—any factors that would mar the accuracy or repeatability of the experiment or the ability <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>the</b> <b>results.</b> Confounding is commonly eliminated through scientific controls and/or, in randomized experiments, through random assignment.|$|E
