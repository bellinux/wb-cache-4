5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that are behind the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E
500|$|In {{a parody}} of Bram Stoker's Dracula, after a news story about several vampire attacks, Lisa begins to suspect that Mr. Burns is a vampire, {{but the rest of}} the family dismisses her concerns. The family is invited to Mr. Burns' castle in Pennsylvania, where Bart and Lisa {{discover}} a secret staircase descending to an eerie basement filled with coffins. As they investigate, vampires emerge from the coffins and encircle them. Lisa escapes, but Bart activates the [...] "Super Fun Happy Slide", causing him to be captured and get bitten by Mr. Burns. Bart returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Burns, who tells him to take a seat. Bart is very pale and is behaving oddly, but these factors get little attention by the family. Later that night, Lisa is awakened by a now undead Bart and his vampire friends. When Bart is about to bite Lisa, Homer and Marge interrupt and discover that Bart is a vampire. Lisa claims that the only way to restore him is to kill the head vampire, Mr. Burns. The family returns to Mr. Burns' mansion, where Homer drives a stake through Mr. Burns' heart. Unfortunately, despite Mr. Burns' death, Bart still remains a vampire. To make things worse, Lisa discovers that everyone in the Simpson family except for herself is a vampire, and that the true head vampire is inexplicably Marge, not Mr. Burns. With this revelation, the whole entire family swoops in on Lisa, only to stop and wish everyone a happy Halloween. Then, they all harmonize [...] "Hark the Herald Angels Sing", parodying A Charlie Brown Christmas.|$|E
