5|$|The Hôtel d'Alluye is a hôtel particulier in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, France. Built for Florimond Robertet {{when he was}} {{secretary}} and notary to Louis XII, the residence bears {{the name of his}} barony of Alluyes. On Rue Saint-Honoré near Blois Cathedral and the Château de Blois, it is now significantly smaller than it was originally as the north and west wings were destroyed between <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|The west wing's {{design is}} known only from archival records, {{since it was}} almost totally {{destroyed}} between <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries. The {{first part of the}} wing consisted of stables, a spiral staircase leading to the exterior façade, a corridor linking the courtyard to the street and a large pantry. During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Egyptian pagan {{culture was}} in decline after {{the rise of}} Christianity and later Islam, but {{interest}} in Egyptian antiquity continued {{in the writings of}} medieval scholars such as Dhul-Nun al-Misri and al-Maqrizi. In <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe. This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{phenomena}} {{have been}} studied since antiquity, though progress in theoretical understanding remained slow until <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries. Even then, practical applications for electricity were few, {{and it would not}} be until the late nineteenth century that electrical engineers were able to put it to industrial and residential use. The rapid expansion in electrical technology at this time transformed industry and society, becoming a driving force for the Second Industrial Revolution. Electricity's extraordinary versatility means it can be put to an almost limitless set of applications which include transport, heating, lighting, communications, and computation. Electrical power is now the backbone of modern industrial society.|$|E
5|$|In 1565, Karnataka and {{the rest}} of South India {{experienced}} a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota. The Bijapur Sultanate, which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Moghuls in the late 17th century. The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style. During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette, Goa, while during <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to North Canara and South Canara, especially from Bardes, Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese.|$|E

5|$|Scottish kinship in {{this period}} was agnatic, with descent judged through a common ancestor, helping to create the surname system in the Borders and the clans in the Highlands, with these systems {{beginning}} to break down in <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries respectively. There was considerable concern over the safety of children. The abolition of godparents in the Reformation meant that baptism became a mechanism for emphasising the role and responsibilities of fathers. Wet-nurses were used for young children, but in most families mothers took the primary role in bringing up children, while the Kirk emphasised {{the role of the}} father for older children. After the Reformation there was an increasing emphasis on education, resulting in the growth of a parish school system, but its effects were limited for the children of the poor and for girls. Most children left home for a period of life-cycle service, as domestic or agricultural servants or as apprentices before marriage.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance left {{a legacy}} across {{intellectual}} fields including poetry, historical writing and architecture, which continued into <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries. A {{growing number of}} Scottish scholars emerged who had an increasing confidence in their own literature. Part of the explanation for the sudden flowering of the Scottish Enlightenment, is that the country already {{had a history of}} achievements in philosophy, poetry, music, mathematics and architecture and was in close touch with intellectual trends in the rest of Europe. From this period Scotland would make major contributions in the fields of medicine, law, philosophy, geology and history. Among these ideas the limitation of royal sovereignty over the people remained present in Scottish intellectual life and resurfaced to contribute to the major debates of the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} Armenian to visit North America was Martin the Armenian from Iran. He was an Iranian Armenian tobacco grower who settled in Jamestown, Virginia in 1618. In 1653–54, two Armenians from Constantinople {{were invited to}} Virginia to raise silk worms. A few other Armenians are recorded as having come to the US in <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries, but most moved as individuals and did not establish communities. By the 1770s over 70 Armenians had settled in the colonies. The persecution of Christian minorities under the Ottoman Empire and American missionary activities resulted in a small wave of Armenian migration to the US in the 1830s from Cilicia and Western Armenia. Hatchik (Christopher) Oscanyan, a Constantinople American missionary school student, arrived in America in 1835 to pursue higher education. He later worked for the New York Herald Tribune and became the New York Press Club president. Many Armenians followed him {{and went to the}} US for education.|$|E

5|$|This {{section is}} crossed by King Street, which follows {{the course of}} a Roman road. Where it crosses the Maxey Cut, to the south of the {{original}} channels, there are a series of 14 arches which comprise Lolham Bridges. They are grouped into five structures to cross the channels in the area, and were funded by the County of Northamptonshire in <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries. The longest span is , and the cutwaters carry inscribed stones recording the County's involvement. To the north, an early nineteenth century stone rubble arched bridge carries the road over a drainage ditch near Lolham Mill, while an eighteenth-century bridge, probably rebuilt in the following century, crosses the mill stream. Another pair of early nineteenth-century bridges, built of coursed limestone with ashlar dressings, carry the road over the northernmost channel.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the late}} Medieval castles built in the borders were {{in the form of}} tower houses, smaller pele towers or simpler bastle houses. From the fifteenth century there was a phase of Renaissance palace building, which {{restructured}} them as castle-type palaces, beginning at Linlithgow. Elements of Medieval castles, royal palaces and tower houses were used in the construction of Scots baronial estate houses, which were built largely for comfort, but with a castle-like appearance. In <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries the military significance of castles declined, but they increasingly became tourist attractions. Elements of the Scots Baronial style would be revived from the late eighteenth century and the trend would be confirmed in popularity by the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle in the nineteenth century and its adoption as a retreat by Queen Victoria. In the twentieth century there were only isolated examples of new castle-influenced houses. Many tower houses were renovated, and many castles were taken over by the National Trust for Scotland or Historic Scotland and are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation {{has been seen}} as creating the Highland clan system, evident in records from the thirteenth century. Surnames were rare in the Highlands until <b>the</b> <b>seventeenth</b> <b>and</b> eighteenth centuries. In the Middle Ages all members of a clan did not share a name and most ordinary members were usually not related to its head. At the beginning of the era, the head of a clan was often the strongest male in the main sept or branch of the clan, but later, as primogeniture began to dominate, it was usually the eldest son of the last chief. The leading families of a clan formed the fine, often seen as equivalent in status to Lowland gentlemen, providing council to the chief in peace and leadership in war. Below them were the daoine usisle (in Gaelic) or tacksmen (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents. In the Isles and along the adjacent western seaboard, there were also buannachann, who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids and taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes act as soldiers. In the early modern era they would take the clan name as their surname, turning the clan into a massive, if often fictive, kin group.|$|E
