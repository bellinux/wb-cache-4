5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the second}} period 8 element, unbinilium is {{predicted}} to be an alkaline earth metal, below beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium. Each of these elements has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns2), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +2 oxidation state: thus the alkaline earth metals are rather reactive elements, {{with the exception of}} beryllium due to its small size. Unbinilium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s2. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> from the lighter alkaline earth metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> significantly from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal. Its metallic bonds should also be very weak, possibly making it extremely volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurus was a hadrosaurid (a duck-billed dinosaur), {{a member}} of a family of dinosaurs which to date are known only from the Late Cretaceous. It is {{classified}} within the Saurolophinae (alternately Hadrosaurinae), a clade of hadrosaurids which lacked hollow crests. Other members of the group include Brachylophosaurus, Gryposaurus, Lophorhothon, Maiasaura, Naashoibitosaurus, Prosaurolophus, and Saurolophus. It was either closely related to or includes the species Anatosaurus annectens (alternately Edmontosaurus annectens), a large hadrosaurid from various latest Cretaceous formations of western North America. The giant Chinese hadrosaurine Shantungosaurus giganteus is also anatomically similar to Edmontosaurus; M. K. Brett-Surman found the two <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> only in details related to the greater size of Shantungosaurus, based on what had been described of the latter genus.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high ergosterol content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation.

In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> by no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E

5|$|The Trait du Nord {{proved a}} {{successful}} breed for the farmers that developed it, and quickly {{spread throughout the}} Netherlands, Belgium and northern France. It was given different names depending on the country, and was often confused with and crossbred with draft breeds from the Netherlands, Brabants and the Ardennes. Breed associations began to organize in the late 19th century, {{and at this point}} blood from the Boulonnais was introduced to bring more elegance to the breed. The Trait du Nord gradually began <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> from the Ardennes as they gained size and volume and improved their gaits, and the breed became popular in the north and east of France. In 1855, even before the breed had been differentiated from the Ardennes, veterinarians described the heavy horses bred near Hainaut as superior to Flemish breeds.|$|E
5|$|The most ideal {{food was}} that which most closely matched the humour of human beings, i.e. {{moderately}} warm and moist. Food should preferably also be finely chopped, ground, pounded and strained {{to achieve a}} true mixture of all the ingredients. White wine {{was believed to be}} cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar. Milk was moderately warm and moist, but the milk of different animals was often believed <b>to</b> <b>differ.</b> Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist. Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine. Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare, there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the dust bands is less problematic. The dust has a very short lifetime, 100–1000 years, and should be {{continuously}} replenished by collisions between larger ring particles, moonlets and meteoroids from outside the Uranian system. The belts of the parent moonlets and particles are themselves invisible due to their low optical depth, while the dust reveals itself in forward-scattered light. The narrow main rings and the moonlet belts that create dust bands are expected <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> in particle size distribution. The main rings have more centimeter to meter-sized bodies. Such a distribution increases the surface area of the material in the rings, leading to high optical density in back-scattered light. In contrast, the dust bands have relatively few large particles, which results in low optical depth.|$|E

5|$|The {{position}} of unbiunium in {{the periodic table}} suggests {{that it would have}} similar properties to its lighter congeners, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbiunium is expected to have a s2p valence electron configuration instead of the s2d of its lighter congeners in group 3, but this is not expected to significantly affect its chemistry, which is predicted to be that of a normal group 3 element; it would on the other hand significantly lower its first ionisation energy beyond what would be expected from periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E
5|$|E. Budin {{collected}} the first specimen {{of the species}} on August 21, 1917, in Jujuy Province, northwestern Argentina, {{and the next year}} Oldfield Thomas used the animal as the holotype of a new subspecies of Akodon puer, a Bolivian species. He described the new subspecies Akodon puer cænosus as darker and duller in color than the Bolivian form, but otherwise identical. In 1920, Thomas recognized additional differences between the two after examining more specimens and classified the Argentine form as a separate species, Akodon cænosus. Most subsequent authors followed this arrangement, but since the 1980s some have placed the form (now spelled caenosus) in A.puer again. In 1990, Philip Myers and others reviewed the Akodon boliviensis group, which includes A.puer and A.caenosus, and again considered caenosus as a subspecies of puer. They retained caenosus as a separate subspecific name for the Argentine populations of puer because of its small size, dark fur, and distinctive karyotype. Myers and colleagues had included the name lutescens J.A. Allen, 1901, as a subspecies of Akodon puer Thomas, 1902, and in 1997 Sydney Anderson noted that the older name lutescens should instead be used for the species because of the Principle of Priority; therefore, he utilized the combination Akodon lutescens caenosus for the Argentine subspecies. Through the 1990s and 2000s, authors continued <b>to</b> <b>differ</b> on the classification of caenosus as either a full species or a subspecies or puer (=lutescens).|$|E
