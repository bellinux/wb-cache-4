500|$|According to Jean, the episode's table read went [...] "great" [...] {{until the}} third act. The Simpsons writers found the third act [...] "pretty challenging" [...] to write, because by having Homer's jaws wired shut, they [...] "took [...] funniest character" [...] and [...] "remove comedy." [...] In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Selman {{described it as}} [...] "It's the comedy of saying: 'Oh, he [...] can't do all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> want him to do'." [...] It was also hard to [...] "keep the story moving" [...] back to normal, since they kept having to [...] "re-use the premise". The episode features American comedian John Kassir {{as one of the}} dogs in the gay pride parade {{in the beginning of the}} episode. Barbara Walters and Star Jones, the hosts of The View, were portrayed by American voice-actor Tress MacNeille. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jean stated that MacNeille is [...] "very versatile". Lisa Ling and Joy Behar were portrayed by voice-actor Pamela Hayden.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, 50 Cent announced that {{he is looking for}} new artists, [...] "You'll see new faces, because I'm looking for new artists now. I'll sign new artists and take them with me and kinda groom them. Some of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> can't teach a person; they gotta have it". While he was on tour, recently made affiliate Beanie Sigel confirmed after a long awaited wait, that he would be finished signing to G-Unit when 50 got back from tour.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 January 2001, John Redwood MP accused Prime Minister Tony Blair [...] of prejudicing the {{independent}} {{inquiry into the}} Hinduja passport affair, after Blair declared that the Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz had not done [...] "anything wrong". [...] On the same day, Vaz told reporters that they would [...] "regret" [...] their behaviour once {{the facts of the}} case were revealed. [...] "Some of you are going to look very foolish when this report comes out. Some of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> said about Peter, and about others and me, you'll regret very much when the facts come out", he said. When asked why the passport application of one of the Hinduja brothers had been processed more quickly than normal, being processed and sanctioned in six months when the process can take up to two years, he replied, [...] "It is not unusual." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 30, 2003, Zuckerberg told Cameron Winklevoss in {{an email}} {{that he did}} not expect {{completion}} of the project to be difficult. Zuckerberg writes: [...] "I read over all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> sent and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about that after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night." [...] The next day, on December 1, 2003, Zuckerberg sent another email to the HarvardConnection team. [...] "I put together one of the two registration pages so I have everything working on my system now. I'll keep you posted as I patch stuff up and it starts to become completely functional." [...] On December 4, 2003, Zuckerberg writes: [...] "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set." [...] On December 10, 2003: [...] "The week has been pretty busy thus far, so I haven't gotten a chance to do much work on the site or even think about it really, so I think it's probably best to postpone meeting until we have more to discuss. I'm also really busy tomorrow so I don't think I'd be able to meet then anyway." [...] A week later: [...] "Sorry I have not been reachable for the past few days. I've basically been in the lab the whole time working on a cs problem set which I'm still not finished with." [...] On December 17, 2003, Zuckerberg met with the Winklevosses and Narendra in his dorm room, allegedly confirming his interest and assuring them that the site was almost complete. On the whiteboard in his room, Zuckerberg allegedly had scrawled multiple lines of code under the heading “Harvard Connection,” however, this would be the only time they saw any of his work. On January 8, 2004, Zuckerberg emailed to say he was [...] "completely swamped with work [...] week" [...] but had [...] "made some of the changes ... and they seem to be working great" [...] on his computer. He said he could discuss the site starting the following Tuesday, on January 13, 2004. On January 11, 2004, Zuckerberg registered the domain name thefacebook.com. On January 12, 2004, Zuckerberg e-mailed Eduardo Saverin, saying that the Facebook site [...] was almost complete and that they should discuss marketing strategies. Two days later, on January 14, 2004, Zuckerberg met again with the HarvardConnection team; however, he allegedly failed to disclose registering the domain name thefacebook.com or developing a competing social networking website. Rather, he allegedly reported progress on HarvardConnection, told the team he would continue to work on it, and would email the group later in the week. On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, a social network for Harvard students, designed to expand to other schools around the country.|$|E

[...] "In such a case you may get big prices, but if you average them out over the years of working and waiting, you'll find you have earned them, and that, after all, <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>you</b> sell is mighty cheap." ...|$|E
