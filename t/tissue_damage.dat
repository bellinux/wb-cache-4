Inflammation is a general marker of <b>tissue</b> <b>damage</b> in any disease, and may be either secondary to <b>tissue</b> <b>damage</b> in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E

5|$|Cancers can {{be induced}} in animals at many sites. At {{sufficiently}} high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with <b>tissue</b> <b>damage,</b> and it is often viewed now as secondary to <b>tissue</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{ultrasound}} (US)-based {{drug delivery}} strategies have received attention to improve {{enhanced permeation and retention}} (EPR) effect-based passive targeting efficiency of nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo conditions. Among the US treatment techniques, pulsed-high intensity focused ultrasound (pHIFU) have specialized for improving tissue penetration of various macromolecules and nanoparticles without irreversible <b>tissue</b> <b>damages.</b> In this study, we {{have demonstrated that}} pHIFU could be utilized to improve tissue penetration of fluorescent dye-labeled glycol chitosan nanoparticles (FCNPs) in femoral tissue of mice. pHIFU could improve blood flow of the targeted-blood vessel in femoral tissue. In addition, tissue penetration of FCNPs was specifically increased 5.7 -, 8 - and 9.3 -folds than that of non-treated (0  W pHIFU) femoral tissue, when the femoral tissue was treated with 10, 20 and 50  W of pHIFU, respectively. However, tissue penetration of FCNPs was significantly reduced after 3  h post-pHIFU treatment (50  W). Because overdose (50  W) of pHIFU led to irreversible <b>tissue</b> <b>damages,</b> including the edema and chapped red blood cells. These overall results support that pHIFU treatment can enhance the extravasation and tissue penetration of FCNPs as well as induce irreversible <b>tissue</b> <b>damages.</b> We expect that our results can provide advantages to optimize pHIFU-mediated delivery strategy of nanoparticles for further clinical applications.|$|R

5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact with skin can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing <b>tissue</b> <b>damage</b> if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E

5|$|Prion {{aggregates}} {{are extremely}} stable and accumulate in infected tissue, causing <b>tissue</b> <b>damage</b> and cell death. This structural stability means that prions {{are resistant to}} denaturation by chemical and physical agents, making disposal and containment of these particles difficult.

Many other medications and dietary factors can interact with warfarin, either increasing or decreasing its effectiveness. The effects of warfarin may be reversed with phytonadione (vitamin K1), fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrate.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting <b>tissue</b> <b>damage</b> is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause <b>tissue</b> <b>damage.</b> Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E

Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive <b>tissue</b> <b>damage</b> behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
50|$|In essence, the {{important}} output parameter when treating hair (and other skin conditions) is power density - {{this is a}} combination of energy, spot diameter and pulse duration. These three parameters determine what actually happens when the light energy is absorbed by the tissue chromophore be it melanin, hemoglobin or water, with the amount of <b>tissue</b> <b>damaged</b> being determined by the temperature/time combination.|$|R

5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, <b>tissue</b> <b>damage,</b> or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} H. pylori {{a person is}} exposed to may {{influence}} {{the risk of developing}} gastric cancer. Strains of H. pylori that produce high levels of two proteins, vacuolating toxin A (VacA) and the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), appear to cause greater <b>tissue</b> <b>damage</b> than those that produce lower levels or that lack those genes completely. These proteins are directly toxic to cells lining the stomach and signal strongly to the immune system that an invasion is under way. As a result of the bacterial presence, neutrophils and macrophages set up residence in the tissue to fight the bacteria assault.|$|E
5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and <b>tissue</b> <b>damage.</b> In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.|$|E
