50|$|UFU is {{the only}} private {{university}} in the world which, while located outside of Ukraine, offers graduate programs of study {{in the social sciences}} and the humanities, primarily in Ukrainian language. In fact, {{in order to be able}} to matriculate at UFU one must demonstrate fluency in Ukrainian. Masters programs require two to three semesters of course work, an MA thesis and an oral thesis defense. Doctoral programs stipulate three semesters of course work, a doctoral dissertation, philosophy commprehensives and an oral thesis defense.Dissertations are normally written in Ukrainian. In exceptional cases permission may be granted to write in another language. Winter Semester <b>teaching</b> <b>period</b> runs from early November to mid December and from the end of January until early March.

50|$|The {{nature of}} what he taught is {{generally}} disputed.

50|$|In {{recent years}} Taiwan has {{increased}} its needs for TEFL and Certified Teachers in public schools. Qualifications and salaries for public school positions are based on certifications and experience. Also, benefits and salaries are more extensive than cram schools. The general job description would consist of: Teachers work 8 hours a day (8:00am-5:00pm), 5 days a week (Monday to Friday).Maximum teaching hours is 22 teaching periods per week. (Each <b>teaching</b> <b>period</b> is 40 to 45 minutes.) About 20 periods of preparation time per week.

40|$|Examinations are {{commonly}} used {{at the end of}} <b>teaching</b> <b>periods</b> as major components of assessment for external engineering students because they are the only assessment mechanism which examiners can be reasonably sure are completed by students acting alone. However the literature suggests that examinations are flawed instruments of assessment for many reasons, not least because they encourage poor approaches to learning but also because they no not allow useful feedback to students. This paper reports on a trial of assignment-based assessment, details of which are sufficiently complex and diverse that they encourage individual work by students, both in course content and in other graduate attributes...|$|R
50|$|All classes {{except those}} which require other {{resources}} {{take place in}} large open plan areas called 'Learning Commons'. These spaces enable flexibility when planning and delivering classes, including the ability to combine two classes into one for some activities, combining similar curriculum areas, such as physics and mathematics and easy access to technology. Students can utilize mobile devices such as laptops and cellphones to edit Google Docs in real-time together. Students are able to use Gchat in class to ask and answer questions, and students are permitted to perform searches on Google to answer teachers' questions.

Statistical summaries and novel data visualisation tools provide subtle and powerful insights into online student peer networks. Analysis of data collected shows that network visualisation can be an important curation tool for educators interested in cultivating student engagement...|$|R
5000|$|The cost {{of tuition}} {{increases}} yearly at the University of Maryland, {{as it has}} in the majority of State-funded Universities. However, according to Pease, a major matter of concern isn't only the rising cost of tuition, but the increasingly prohibitive hidden costs of the textbooks and course materials for class. Often newer editions of textbooks that are not fundamentally different from past editions are pressed upon the faculty for use in the next <b>teaching</b> <b>period.</b> In an article to the Washington Post newspaper, Pease has commented that, [...] "Once they've published a textbook and there's a zillion of them out there -- that's it for their profit until they {{can come up with a}} new edition or some sort of technique to sell more books." [...] The Post continues, [...] "One of the techniques Pease and others cite is the 'bundling' of books with other materials, such as study guides, Web site access, test questions, CD-ROMs and more. These add-ons are helping to drive up the cost of books.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most 'heroic' vampires in fiction, who reject their blood-drinking {{instincts}} {{and try to}} avoid drinking from humans, Henry is comfortable with who and what he is, but he maintains a regular policy of never killing his victims (he has killed on a few occasions, but attributes this to vampire instinct and {{has been shown to}} turn at least one victim when he took too much) and only drinking from the 'willing', with his primary food source being his lovers, who he feeds from during their liaisons, taking just enough to sustain himself without them noticing the loss. Henry's 'breed' of vampire possess a strong territorial instinct that prevents them from interacting with others of their kind on a regular basis after the <b>teaching</b> <b>period</b> of the first year of vampiric life has passed, with the result that vampires generally part ways after the older vampire has taught the new vampire how to survive undetected in humanity to avoid the conflict that would be inspired if they remained together; while this urge can be resisted, the effort required makes a long-term relationship impractical. Aside from this, Henry retains the traditional vampire powers of superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and healing, with a vulnerability to sunlight and stakes, although garlic and holy relics have no effect on him and his reflection can still be seen in mirrors.|$|E
5000|$|Thesis is {{also used}} to {{describe}} a cumulative project for a bachelor's degree, and is more common at selective colleges and universities, or for those seeking admittance to graduate school or to obtain an honors academic designation. These are called [...] "senior projects" [...] or [...] "senior theses;" [...] they are generally done in the senior year near graduation after having completed other courses, the independent study period, and the internship or student <b>teaching</b> <b>period</b> (the completion of most of the requirements before the writing of the paper ensures adequate knowledge and aptitude for the challenge). Unlike a dissertation or master's thesis, they are not as long, they do not require a novel contribution to knowledge, or even a very narrow focus on a set subtopic. Like them, they can be lengthy and require months of work, they require supervision by at least one professor adviser, they must be focused on a certain area of knowledge, and they must use an appreciable amount of scholarly citations. They {{may or may not be}} defended before a committee, but usually are not; there is generally no preceding examination before the writing of the paper, except for at very few colleges. Because of the nature of the graduate thesis or dissertation having to be more narrow and more novel, the result of original research, these usually have a smaller proportion of the work that is cited from other sources, though the fact that they are lengthier may mean they still have total citations.|$|E
30|$|After {{learning}} from academics {{involved in the}} IaH course, two {{other members of the}} Learning Circle decided to use the Alliance Building and Cultural Mapping tools in a third year intercultural management course in two modalities – on-campus and online - in subsequent <b>teaching</b> <b>periods.</b> Alliance Building activities were built into the first tutorial (on-campus) and in the first online module. Students were taught to apply the Cultural Mapping tool in intercultural case studies where communication breakdown was evident. For example, maps were developed to address how to give feedback to an employee whose behaviour was culturally inappropriate. Adaptation of the tools and evaluation of their impact on students’ learning in this third year course is the focus of ongoing analysis.|$|R
