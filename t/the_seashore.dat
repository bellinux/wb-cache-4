5|$|In Washington, sea otters {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river otters, which are commonly seen along <b>the</b> <b>seashore.</b> However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near <b>the</b> <b>seashore</b> living among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea when these dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E

50|$|The National Park Service allows {{off-road}} vehicles with permits in certain areas. Car camping sites {{are available in}} both <b>the</b> National <b>Seashore</b> and Assateague State Park by reservation. Backcountry sites are also available from <b>the</b> National <b>Seashore.</b> There is no camping available from the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge.

Kayak touring is a popular way to see the wildlife, especially on the calmer bay side. The best times to backcountry camp are in the spring and fall. Summer months are known for heavy mosquito populations, particularly on the bay side. Assateague State Park comprises almost 800 acre and lies in Maryland within <b>the</b> National <b>Seashore.</b> <b>The</b> state park is the most developed area on the island with 350 campsites. Most of the water around the island is within the boundaries of <b>the</b> national <b>seashore.</b> <b>The</b> island has a land area of 24.4 sq mi and has no resident population in either Maryland or Virginia, though a few retained property rights until 2006.

5000|$|The {{town was}} named after the [...] "hagunoy" [...] (Chromolaena odorata), a {{medicinal}} plant {{that used to be}} abundant in its river banks and along <b>the</b> <b>seashores.</b> <b>The</b> original populace used its leaves as their herbal remedy of choice for common illnesses and as food ingredients.

5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore one where <b>the</b> <b>seashore</b> alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib {{members of the}} Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E
5|$|Historical records {{indicate}} river otters were once populous throughout most major drainages {{in the continental}} United States and Canada prior to European settlement. North America’s largest otter populations were found in areas with an abundance and diversity of aquatic habitats, such as coastal marshes, the Great Lakes region, and glaciated areas of New England. In addition, riverine habitats in interior regions supported smaller, but practical, otter populations. The otter existed on {{all parts of the}} Pacific Coast, including <b>the</b> <b>seashore</b> and inland streams and lakes. However, large populations never occurred in areas of Southern California such as the chaparral and oak woodlands and Mojave Desert seasonal waterway regions, or in the xeric shrubland regions in New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, and Colorado. In Mexico, the otters lived in the Rio Grande and Colorado River Deltas.|$|E
5|$|Marko, age 300, {{rode the}} 160-year-old Šarac by <b>the</b> <b>seashore</b> towards Mount Urvina when a vila {{told him that}} he was going to die. Marko then leaned over a well and saw no {{reflection}} of his face on the water; hydromancy confirmed the vilas words. He killed Šarac so the Turks would not use him for menial labor, and gave his beloved companion an elaborate burial. Marko broke his sword and spear, throwing his mace far out to sea before lying down to die. His body was found seven days later by Abbot Vaso and his deacon, Isaija. Vaso took Marko to Mount Athos and buried him at the Hilandar Monastery in an unmarked grave.|$|E

5|$|Millipedes {{occur on}} all continents except Antarctica, and occupy almost all {{terrestrial}} habitats, ranging {{as far north}} as the Arctic Circle in Iceland, Norway, and Central Russia, and as far south as Santa Cruz Province, Argentina. Typically forest floor dwellers, they live in leaf litter, dead wood, or soil, with a preference for humid conditions. In temperate zones, millipedes are most abundant in moist deciduous forests, and may reach densities of over 1,000 individuals per square metre. Other habitats include coniferous forests, deserts, caves, and alpine ecosystems. Some species can survive freshwater floods and live submerged underwater for up to 11 months. A few species occur near <b>the</b> <b>seashore</b> and can survive in somewhat salty conditions.|$|E
5|$|One famous {{demonstration}} of Dunstan's charismatic style and media savvy came in January 1976. A psychic predicted that, due to Dunstan and the state's social liberalisation—which {{he saw as}} sinful—God would destroy Adelaide with a tsunami caused by an earthquake. This was publicised by the media, prompting a not insignificant number of residents to sell their property and leave; some businesses had clearance sales while many who decided to stay indulged in doomsday parties. Dunstan promised to stand on <b>the</b> <b>seashore</b> at Glenelg {{and wait for the}} imminent destruction. He did so on 20 January, the day of the predicted storm, and nothing happened, although he made newspaper headlines in the United Kingdom for his defiance.|$|E
5|$|Having {{taken as}} much Serbian land as he could, King Tvrtko turned his {{attention}} to the coast. The rapid economic growth of Bosnia, having begun during the reign of Tvrtko's uncle, continued unabated even during the political upheavels that followed Tvrtko's accession. The export of metal ores and metalwork (mainly silver, copper and lead) formed the backbone of the Bosnian economy. These goods were transported over the Dinaric Alps to <b>the</b> <b>seashore,</b> where they were bought chiefly by the Republics of Ragusa and Venice. The maritime cities of Ragusa and Kotor also depended on Tvrtko's realm for food, a dependency the king leveraged to increase the initially low and, for the Bosnians, disadvantageous prices. Yet, Bosnia could not make economic use of its share of the Adriatic coast, from the river Neretva to the Bay of Kotor, which lacked any major settlements. The three major cities in the area were all controlled by Hungary: Drijeva (which Tvrtko was forced to cede to Louis in 1357), Ragusa, and Kotor.|$|E

5|$|In May 1948, {{while he}} was holding church {{meetings}} throughout Navajo and Apache communities in Arizona, Kimball suffered severe chest pain from a myocardial infarction, {{also known as a}} heart attack, after he had spent an afternoon struggling to lift an automobile out of deep sand. Kimball was physically sluggish {{throughout the rest of the}} trip, and after he had returned to Salt Lake City and undergone an electrocardiogram, his physician prescribed one month of rest from his church duties. Kimball was only 53 and had considered himself to be generally healthy and fit; he persuaded his physician not to tell the other apostles or the First Presidency. However, on his next assignment, in Rigby, Idaho, Kimball again experienced chest pains, which escalated into another heart attack several days after his return. During the early episodes, Kimball passed the time by discussing his wishes regarding the family's finances and investments with his wife in case he did not survive the infarctions. After receiving a priesthood blessing from church president George Albert Smith, Kimball spent two months on bed rest followed by two weeks resting on the Navajo Nation. At his physician's urging, he spent several additional weeks recuperating with his wife near <b>the</b> <b>seashore</b> in Long Beach, California. A cardiologist that Kimball consulted in California believed that his heart had been weakened by an undiagnosed case of rheumatic fever during childhood and instructed Kimball to avoid overwork and gaining unnecessary weight.|$|E
