40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to the current debate on aid effectiveness and suitability by examining a specific aspect of the problem: the theoretical and empirical relationship between <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> and trade flows. In the first part, we evaluate the theoretical implications of the use of <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> as a hidden trade policy. The possibility that aid flows directly benefit the donor country (especially its exporters) can make aid more viable from the domestic point of view, but since it also might affect foreign competitors, international conflicts can arise. These issues are examined in a framework adapted from the well-known strategic trade policy literature, showing that <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> cannot be considered equivalent to an export subsidy. The second part of the paper is empirical and tests some propositions suggested by the theory. We estimate the impact of <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> on total imports of recipient countries in order to examine whether the distortionary impact of <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> overcomes the trade generating effect. We also look at the consequences of <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> on the donor's market share in the recipient country in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} this policy in supporting domestic exporters. The (preliminary) evidence shows that <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> does not necessarily generate trade flows and that the donor's export shares are not correlated to the degree of <b>tying.</b> Tied <b>aid,</b> trade, trade policy,...|$|R

40|$|Tied aid' {{refers to}} aid granted by one country or {{countries}} to another {{on condition that}} the goods or services acquired are purchased from the donor(s). Despite the fact that <b>tying</b> <b>aid</b> seems contrary to the World Trade Organization's (WTO) basic principles of free trade and {{is an important issue}} for developing countries, it has received little attention from scholars or practitioners, even during the current 'development round' of negotiations. This article fills a gap in the literature by elaborating the way in which <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> in relation to goods is affected by WTO rules. The analysis reveals that the WTO Agreements give little specific attention to the issue and that practices relating to <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> are either outside the WTO rules or covered only in a limited or uncertain way such that the rules have little practical impact. Given the importance of <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> for trade and for the WTO's development agenda, the analysis thus indicates that <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> is an area requiring future consideration in the WTO. The analysis also serves to elucidate the complex legal architecture of the WTO Agreements as they relate to <b>tied</b> <b>aid,</b> which is important for any future efforts to address this subject.

In some African regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, China has even replaced the US {{as the most important}} trading partner today. But China holds not a single FTA on the African continent, while other major trading partners of African economies rely on an extensive framework of different trade agreements. What is, thus, the legal basis of the recent increase of Sino-African trade? Interestingly, Sino-African trade {{has seen a}} particularly strong increase in countries that have entered into <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> agreements with China. These agreements are commonly known under the term ‘Angola-Model’ and consist of a multifaceted network of barter-trading-systems, aspects of <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> and concessions for oil and other commodities linked with a state loan.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} by Charlotte Sieber-Gasser at the African IEL Network Conference, 5 th- 6 th of May 2011, The Mandela Institute, Johannesburg (South Africa) Sino-African trade {{has seen a}} fifty-fold increase in the years 1999 to 2008. China became {{the second most important}} trading partner for the African economy and already overtook the US as the most important trading partner in some African regions. However, all of this trade is taking place independent from legal regulation by a preferential or other trade agreement. Interestingly, Sino-African trade has seen particular increase in countries that have agreed to <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> arrangements with China.

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{arguments}} in favour of untied <b>aid</b> is that <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> can create important distortions in the market by {{limiting the number of}} countries where the recipient can make purchases.

It is estimated that goods and services purchased with <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> cost 15-30% more than comparable goods and services acquired with untied <b>aid.</b> Furthermore, <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> often favours capital-intensive goods and advising primarily in the donor country’s area of expertise.

40|$|This study tests two {{opposing}} hypotheses {{about the impact}} of aid fragmentation on the practice of <b>aid</b> <b>tying.</b> In one, when a small number of donors dominate the aid market in a country, they may exploit their monopoly power by <b>tying</b> more <b>aid</b> to purchases from contractors based in their own countries. Alternatively, when donors have a larger share of the aid market, they may have stronger incentives to maximize the development impact of their <b>aid</b> by <b>tying</b> less of it. Empirical tests strongly and consistently support the latter hypothesis. The key finding [...] that higher donor aid shares are associated with less <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> [...] is robust to recipient controls, donor fixed effects and instrumental variables estimation. When recipient countries are grouped by their scores on corruption perception indexes, higher shares of aid are significantly related to lower <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> only in the less-corrupt sub-sample. This finding is consistent with the argument that <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> can be an efficient response by donors when losses from corruption may rival or exceed losses from <b>tying</b> <b>aid.</b> When <b>aid</b> <b>tying</b> is more costly, as proxied by donor country size and income, it is less prevalent. <b>Aid</b> <b>tying</b> is lower in the Least Developed Countries, consistent with the OECD Development Assistance Committee's recommendation to its members.

First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> credit, even if the ODA part is untied <b>aid.</b> Second, <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness".

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the welfare implications of quotas for {{an economy that}} is small in terms of traditionally traded goods and has monopoly power over the trade of goods consumed by tourists. Inbound tourism converts local nontraded goods into tradable goods, creating a tourism terms-of-trade effect for the tourist-receiving economy. Through this effect, quotas result in a spillover to the nontraded sector. Hence, in the presence of tourism, the traditional free-trade prescription for the small open economy is no longer valid. This lends support to the setting of import quotas. Using the optimal quota as a benchmark, we further examine the welfare effect of <b>tied</b> <b>aid.</b> If <b>tied</b> <b>aid</b> brings about an excessive supply of importable goods, then the transfer paradox of the immiserization of the tourist-receiving economy may occur.

40|$|The {{method used}} by Development Assistance Committee {{countries}} {{for measuring the}} concessionality of aid loans has remained unchanged for nearly 20 years.

Furthermore, it does not consider the implications of <b>tying</b> of <b>aid</b> or of policy conditionality.
