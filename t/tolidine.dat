40|$|Flow {{injection}} {{determination of}} residual chlorine in solution {{has been carried}} out spectrophotometrically by methyl orange decolorisation and by formation of a yellow complex with -tolidine. The carrier streams are 0. 180 m methyl orange in pH 2 buffer solution or 0. 01 hydrochloric acid, and 3. 0 m-tolidinium dichloride (in 2 hydrochloric acid), respectively. A sampling rate of 288 samples per hour has been obtained with the latter reagent and the detection limit is 0. 08 p. p. m. of chlorine. Influence of flow parameters such as flow-rate, tube length and diameter and the effect of interferents on the determination have been investigated. A study of the hyprochlorite-ammonium [...] <b>tolidine</b> reaction system has been performed and a method for the simultaneous determination of NH and OCl is described...|$|E
40|$|A {{sequential}} injection (SI) method {{was developed for}} the spectrophotometric determination of chlorine based on the reaction between tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and free chlorine. The advantages resulting {{from the use of}} TMB are considerable: TMB is highly selective for chlorine, it enables a fairly low quantification limit and represents a less toxic alternative to reagents such as <b>tolidine.</b> The use of this reaction in SI adds other advantages as it enhances the degree of automation, minimisation of reagent consumption (6. 8 g TMB/assay) and low effluent production (2. 5 mL/determination). The developed method allowed a quantification limit of 90 g/L with a working range of 0. 09 – 1. 30 mg OCl−/L and a determination rate of 60 det. /h. Based on these features, the system was applied to tap-water and surface water samples with no previous treatment required. The results obtained with the developed system were compared to the reference method, diethyl-p-phenylelediamine (DPD) colorimetric method, and proved not to be statistically different...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for the {{sampling and analysis}} of o-tolidine (119937), based on a method successfully used for benzidine (92875). Air is drawn through a two stage sampler consisting of a high efficiency fiber filter and a silica gel bed which collects o- <b>tolidine</b> and its salts. The filter and sorbent sections of the sampler are transferred to stoppered tubes and the o-tolidine is desorbed. A triethylamine/methyl-alcohol solution is injected into a high pressure liquid chromatograph. Peak readings are obtained and compared with a standard calibration curve. This method can detect 0. 15 to 6. 5 micrograms of benzidine per sample (3 to 130 micrograms per cubic meter for a 50 liter air sample) using 0. 5 milliliters of desorbing solution and a 10 microliter injection into the liquid chromatograph. The authors suggest that the range of detection for o-tolidine should be similar to that for benzidine. The limit of detection for o-tolidine is predicted to be about 0. 05 micrograms per sample.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{literature}} demonstrating an important role of mast cells in adaptive and innate immunity. The distribution of mast cells in the skin varies {{in different parts of the}} body. It is well known that mast cells are important for effector functions of classic IgE-associated allergic disorders as well as in host defense against infective agents and influence the manifestation of autoimmune diseases. We aimed to quantify mast cells in five common dermatoses and compare them statistically with respect to the immunostains. We retrieved paraffin-embedded tissue sections from the archives of the Pathology Department at the UF, Jacksonville, for five cases with each of the above diagnosis from the last three years. We performed CD- 117 and <b>tolidine</b> blue stains on each one of them. The presence or absence of mast cells was evaluated and quantified. We observed that, in the skin, mast cells are mainly located close to the vessels, smooth muscle cells, hair follicles, and nerve ending. Our study showed that the mast cell distribution pattern is different across the two methods of staining for the five aforesaid dermatoses. The other important observation was the dendritic morphology of the mast cells...|$|E
40|$|Calotropis procera is a {{medicinal}} plant whose pharmacological properties {{are associated with}} its latex. Here, the Calotropis procera latex fractions were investigated {{in an attempt to}} trace its phytochemical profile and measure its anti-inflammatory and toxicity activity. The crude latex was partitioned, yielding five fractions (49. 4 % hexane, 5. 2 % dichloromethane, 2. 0 % ethyl acetate, 2. 1 % n-butanol, and 41. 1 % aqueous). Phytochemical screening and spectroscopy analysis revealed that dichloromethane is the most chemically diverse fraction. Triterpenes were detected in both the hexane and dichloromethane fractions, while flavonoids were detected in the dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions. These fractions were cytotoxic to cancer cell lines (LD 50 0. 05 to 3. 9 [*]μg/mL) and lethal to brine shrimp (LD 50 10. 9 to 65. 7 [*]μg/mL). Reduced neutrophil migration in rats was observed in carrageenan-induced peritonitis for the dichloromethane (67 %), ethyl acetate (56 %), and aqueous (72 %) fractions. A positive reaction with <b>tolidine</b> and ninhydrin suggested that cyclopeptides are in the ethyl acetate fraction. It is therefore concluded that Calotropis procera latex dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions exhibit both in vitro and in vivo activities as well as anti-inflammatory properties. Cyclopeptide detection is especially interesting because previous attempts to investigate these low-molecular cyclic amino acid sequences in C. procera have failed...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{from these}} {{laboratories}} (1, 2) {{deal with the}} accumulation of radioactive di-brom dyes in abscesses and tumors. The radio-dyes are also useful for studies of capillary permeability {{in so far as}} their permeation from blood into lymph, too slight to be detected visually in the normal animal, may be quantitatively measured on samples of lymph (3). Dyes of this group make a bond with plasma protein (4), becoming preferentially associated with albumin, and they therefore constitute a radioactive "tracer " for protein under certain experimental conditions. In view of the interest attaching to such matters, as well as the fact that a large group of chemically related but biologically highly varying compounds-the di-azo dyes-may be made radioactive by this technique, the present paper will describe the method used in rendering the molecule radioactive. Chemical and biological properties of the brominated dyes will also be discussed. The molecule is made radioactive by the incorporation of two atoms of radioactive bromine in the di-phenyl portion of the molecule (Figure 1). Bromine atoms, so incorporated into an aromatic ring, do not ionize or dissociate. Thus in using the radio-dye for "tracer " experiments, measurements for radio-bromine constitute measurements for the dye molecule as a whole. The steps involved in this synthesis are as follows: 1. The production of radioactive bromide. 2. Oxidation to radioactive bromine. 3. Bromination of ortho-tolidine. 4. Coupling of this radioactive di-brom <b>tolidine</b> with an amino-naphthol-sulfonic acid to make the finished dye...|$|E
