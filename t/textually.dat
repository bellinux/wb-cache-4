5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. <b>Textually,</b> she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
5|$|The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment {{applies only}} against the states, {{but it is}} {{otherwise}} <b>textually</b> identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.|$|E

25|$|<b>Textually</b> codex 69 is very remarkable; {{it belongs}} to Family 13, as very {{important}} member of this group—according to some scholars even the most important. The Greek text of the Gospels of this codex {{is representative of the}} Caesarean text-type. Aland placed it in Category III. It was confirmed by the Claremont Profile Method.|$|E

25|$|The nine odes of the kanon were {{dissimilar}} {{by their}} metrum. Consequently, an entire heirmos comprises nine independent melodies (eight, because the second ode was usually omitted outside Lenten period), which are united musically {{by the same}} echos and its melos, and sometimes even <b>textually</b> by references to the general theme of the liturgical occasion—especially in acrosticha composed over a given heirmos, but dedicated to a particular day of the menaion.|$|E

It is a papyrus manuscript of the Epistle to the Ephesians, surviving in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript has been palaeographically assigned to the 3rd century. It was probably {{a part of the}} same manuscript as Papyrus 65. It came from Egypt and was purchased for the Yale University Library. <b>Textually</b> it is close to the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus.

500|$|Johann Albrecht Bengel used several {{extracts}} from the codex, and Wettstein {{was the first}} who thoroughly examined it. According to him, in the Gospels its text agrees with the most ancient codices and patristic quotations; therefore, he called it number one. In 1751 he changed his high opinion (Novum Testamentum Græcum), dating the codex to the 10th century. Wettstein collated this manuscript twice, with many errors; according to Samuel Prideaux Tregelles, his collation was incorrect in more than 1,200 readings. Leonard Hug supported Wettstein's last opinion that the codex was Latinisated. Tregelles and Roth again collated the text of this codex, and Tregelles noticed that this codex is <b>textually</b> close to minuscule 118. Dean Burgon noticed that codices 131 and 209 are also <b>textually</b> similar. This entire group was examined by Kirsopp Lake in 1902, and it was called [...] "the Lake Group" [...] (or Family 1). The text of the family was established {{on the basis of}} minuscule 1 (collates codex 1 with Minuscules 118, 131, and 209).|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Dragon Ball Kai in Japan, four new guidebooks were released: the two-volume [...] in 2009, {{covering}} the manga, and two-volume [...] in 2010, covering the anime series. Despite the TV series airing during this time being Kai, the Extreme Battle Collection books reference the earlier Z series in content and episode numbers. These books also include new question-and-answer sessions with Akira Toriyama, revealing a few new details about the world and characters of the series. 2010 also saw {{the release of}} a new artbook, a sort of anime-counterpart to the manga-oriented Complete Illustrations, it showcases anime-original illustrations and includes interviews with the three principal character designers for the anime. Each of the Japanese [...] "Dragon Box" [...] DVD releases of the series and movies, which were released from 2003 to 2006, as well as the Blu-ray boxed sets of Dragon Ball Kai, released 2009 to 2011, come with a Dragon Book guide that contains details about the content therein.

500|$|The {{ownership}} of Hemingway's manuscripts is complicated. [...] Two {{books have been}} published from the African book manuscript: True at First Light, edited by Patrick Hemingway, and Under Kilimanjaro, edited by scholars Robert Lewis and Robert Fleming. [...] In 1965 Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation, and in the 1970s she donated her husband's papers to the John F. Kennedy Library. A group of Hemingway scholars met in 1980 to assess the donated papers when they formed the Hemingway Society, [...] "committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship". After Mary Hemingway's 1986 death, Hemingway's sons John and Patrick asked the Hemingway Society {{to take on the}} duties of the Hemingway Foundation; in 1997 the Hemingway Estate and the Hemingway Society/Foundation agreed [...] to a two-part publishing plan for the African book. [...] An abridged trade publication of True at First Light was to be published in 1999, to be edited by Patrick Hemingway; [...] the Hemingway Foundation would then [...] oversee the reworking of the entire text, [...] to be published as Under Kilimanjaro. [...] Of Under Kilimanjaro, the editors claim [...] "this book deserves as complete and faithful a publication as possible without editorial distortion, speculation, or <b>textually</b> unsupported attempts at improvement".|$|E
500|$|Whether any {{of these}} women could confirm their {{addresses}} for publication in Harris's List is something that author Sophie Carter doubts. [...] She views the annual as [...] "primarily a work of erotica", calling it [...] "nothing {{so much as a}} shopping list... <b>textually</b> arrayed for the delectation of the male consumer", continuing [...] "they [...] await his intervention to institute an exchange", epitomising the traditional male role in pornography. [...] Elizabeth Denlinger includes a similar sentiment in her essay, [...] "The Garment and the Man": [...] "This varied display of women to satisfy the 'great itch'... is a fundamental aspect of the sphere to which Harris's List offered British men a carte d'entrée". [...] Rubenhold writes that the variability in the descriptions of prostitutes over the years the list was published defy [...] "all attempts to categorise it as either exclusively up-market or simply middle of the road." [...] She suggests that the annual's purpose was to [...] "conduct the desirous to the embrace of a prostitute", and that its prose was designed for [...] "solitary sexual enjoyment" [...] (H. Ranger also sold back-issues of Harris's List). [...] Sold to a London public which was mostly patriarchal, its listings reflect the prejudices of the men who authored them. [...] They were therefore not representative of women generally, and as she concludes, [...] "it is likely that their stories would have differed quite significantly from those recounted by their customers {{for the benefit of the}} List's publishers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Article 4 {{implies that}} the High Court may void a piece of {{legislation}} to the extent of its inconsistency with the Constitution. At present, it is unclear how the Court will apply this requirement. If, say, an entire piece of criminal legislation or one of its provisions is found to be void, a person alleged to have committed an offence created by the impugned legislation may be able to escape liability. To circumvent this, a test of severability, also known as the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test, has been established in the UK. If the unconstitutional parts of the legislation are severable from the constitutional parts, the latter are preserved and remain valid and enforceable. In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hutchinson (1988), the House of Lords held that two forms of severability must be established for a law to be held partially valid– textual severability and substantial severability. A provision is <b>textually</b> severable if it remains grammatical and correct after severance. It is substantially severable if its substance after severance remains true to its [...] "legislative purpose, operation and effect". However, the court also recognized that a rigid adherence to the test of textual severability may result in unreasonable consequences. It may defeat legislation with a substantial purpose clearly within the lawmaker's power but, by oversight, which was written in a way that exceeded that scope of power. Hence, the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test may still apply to rescue a provision that is not <b>textually</b> severable {{as long as it does}} not alter the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned provision.|$|E

2500|$|Modern academic-historical {{study of}} Jewish mysticism {{reserves}} the term [...] "kabbalah" [...] to designate the particular, distinctive doctrines that <b>textually</b> emerged fully {{expressed in the}} Middle Ages, as distinct from the earlier Merkabah mystical concepts and methods.

Wells readily agreed and was paid £100 (equal to about £ today) on its publication by Heinemann in 1895, which first published the story in serial form in the January to May numbers of The New Review (newly under the nominal editorship of W. E. Henley). Henry Holt and Company published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript) on 7 May 1895; Heinemann published an English edition on 29 May.

The Court rejected this argument, on the grounds that many of the enumerated powers of Congress under the Constitution would be useless if only those laws deemed essential to a power's execution could be passed. Marshall also noted that the Necessary and Proper Clause is listed within the powers of Congress, not the limitations.|$|E
