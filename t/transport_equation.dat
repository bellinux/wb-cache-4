In particular, a system of generalized <b>transport</b> <b>equations</b> is presented that can be applied to widely different plasma flow conditions. The generalized <b>transport</b> <b>equations</b> can describe subsonic and supersonic flows, collision-dominated and collisionless flows, plasma flows in rapidly changing magnetic field configurations, multicomponent plasma flows with large temperature differences between the interacting species and plasma flows that contain anisotropic temperature distributions.

[...] PDF methods can also be used to describe chemical reactions, and are particularly useful for simulating chemically reacting flows because the chemical source term is closed and does not require a model. [...] The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a Langevin equation for subfilter particle evolution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{details of}} an automatic matrix decomposition approach for a reaction-based stream water quality model. The method yields {{a set of}} equilibrium equations, a set of kinetic-variable <b>transport</b> <b>equations</b> involving kinetic reactions only, {{and a set of}} component <b>transport</b> <b>equations</b> involving no reactions. Partial decomposition of the system of water quality constituent <b>transport</b> <b>equations</b> is performed via Gauss-Jordan column reduction of the reaction network by pivoting on equilibrium reactions to decouple equilibrium and kinetic reactions. This approach minimizes the number of partial differential advective-dispersive <b>transport</b> <b>equations</b> and enables robust numerical integration.
