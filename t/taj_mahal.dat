5|$|The façade, though {{built in}} the style of the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal,</b> lacks {{symmetry}} as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb.|$|E

5|$|Because {{they serve}} {{alcoholic}} beverages, casino nightclubs {{are prohibited from}} offering full nudity. In 2013, Trump <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> opened the nation's first casino strip club, featuring scantily clad dancers. New Jersey's casinos initially had closing times like most ABC-licensed establishments, but were allowed to stay open 24 hours per day, 7 days a week starting in 1992 It is legal for a minor {{to go to a}} casino, insofar as they do not gamble, consume alcoholic beverages in public areas of the casino, or remain on the gambling floor. Because Atlantic City has ordinances prohibiting underage drinking on private property, it is illegal for a person underage 21 to drink in a casino hotel room unless a family member is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided {{for the lack of}} proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the “colour of potted meat”. Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “rather florid”. Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> or the Humayun Tomb, as, {{at the time it was}} built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “thread bare”.|$|E
5|$|Dani, {{an ethnic}} Kashmiri, {{was born on}} 20 June 1920 in Basna, Central Provinces, India. He {{graduated}} in 1944, with an MA degree, {{to become the first}} Muslim graduate of Banaras Hindu University. He scored highest marks in the exams which earned him a Gold Medal. This also qualified him for a teaching fellowship from the same university. Although he was provided with the grant, he was not allowed to teach due to his religious beliefs. He stayed there for six months. In 1945, he started working as a trainee in archaeology under the guidance of Mortimer Wheeler. At this time, he participated in excavations at Taxila and Mohenjo-daro. He was subsequently posted at the Department of Archaeology of British India at <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal,</b> Agra. He received his PhD from the Institute of Archaeology, University College London.|$|E
500|$|The Gyanvapi Mosque {{was built}} by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 CE, after {{destroying}} a Hindu temple. Gyan Vapi (Sanskrit: [...] "the well of knowledge"), {{the name of the}} mosque, is derived from a well of the same name located within the precincts of the mosque. The remains of an erstwhile temple {{can be seen in the}} foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque [...] The façade of the mosque is modelled partially on the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal's</b> entrance. The mosque is administered by the Anjuman Inthazamiya Masajid (AIM).|$|R
50|$|The Charminar masjid is {{a square}} {{structure}} with each side 20 meters (approximately 66 feet) long, with four grand arches each facing a fundamental point that open into four streets. At each corner stands an exquisitely shaped minaret, 56 meters (approximately 184 feet) high, {{with a double}} balcony. Each minaret is crowned by a bulbous dome with dainty petal-like designs at the base. Unlike the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal's,</b> Charminar's four fluted minarets are built into the main structure. There are 149 winding steps to reach the upper floor. The structure is also known for its profusion of stucco decorations and the arrangement of its balustrades and balconies.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} {{planting of}} the garden {{is one of the}} <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal's</b> remaining mysteries. The contemporary accounts mostly deal just with the architecture and only mention 'various kinds of fruit-bearing trees and rare aromatic herbs' in relation to the garden. Cypress trees are almost certainly to have been planted being popular similes in Persian poetry for the slender elegant stature of the beloved. By the end of the 18th century, Thomas Twining noted orange trees and a large plan of the complex suggests beds of various other fruits such as pineapples, pomegranates, bananas, limes and apples. The British, {{at the end of the}} 19th century thinned out a lot of the increasingly forested trees, replanted the cypresses and laid the gardens to lawns in their own taste.|$|R
5|$|Jali are pierced stone screens with {{regularly}} repeating patterns. They {{are characteristic}} of Indo-Islamic architecture, for example in the Mughal dynasty buildings at Fatehpur Sikri and the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal.</b> The geometric designs combine polygons such as octagons and pentagons with other shapes such as 5- and 8-pointed stars. The patterns emphasized symmetries and suggested infinity by repetition. Jali functioned as windows or room dividers, providing privacy but allowing in air and light. Jali forms a prominent element of the architecture of India. The use of perforated walls has declined with modern building standards {{and the need for}} security. Modern, simplified jali walls, for example made with pre-moulded clay or cement blocks, have been popularised by the architect Laurie Baker. Pierced windows in girih style are sometimes found elsewhere in the Islamic world, such as in windows of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a spoiled, materialistic princess, the writers eventually re-wrote Jasmine into a stronger and more prominent heroine following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, while borrowing story elements from the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953). Several months after securing the role, Larkin was nearly fired from the project because Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that her voice was not suitable for a princess, but Clements and Musker managed to convince him otherwise. Discovered by casting director Albert Tavares, Salonga was cast as Jasmine's singing voice based on her performance in the musical Miss Saigon; this unprecedented casting decision made Jasmine the first Disney character to have her speaking and singing voices provided by two different actors. Animated by Mark Henn, Jasmine's design is an eclectic combination of unique sources, including an anonymous theme park guest, Henn's own sister, and actress Jennifer Connelly, while elements of the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> were incorporated into the character's hair, clothing and physique.|$|E
5|$|Riya first {{appeared}} as a child artist in the film Vishkanya in 1991, where she {{played the role of}} the young Pooja Bedi. At the age of 19, she did National Film Awards winning director Bharathiraja's Tamil film, <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal</b> (2000), which did not achieve commercial success. She was scheduled to make her Bollywood film debut in Love You Hamesha, opposite actor Akshaye Khanna; however, the film was stalled, and she finally made her debut in N. Chandra's Style in 2001. This low-budget sex comedy was the first commercial success in over a decade for the director. A launch pad for Riya, cast in the female lead along with fellow-newcomers, Sharman Joshi, Sahil Khan and Shilpi Mudgal, the film pioneered a trend of commercial success for small budget films in India. Riya and the second female lead of the film were replaced by aspirant actresses Sonali Joshi and Jaya Seal in Xcuse Me'.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, blues-rock guitarist Duane Allman (1946-1971) of The Allman Brothers Band began using an empty glass Coricidin bottle as a guitar slide, finding {{it to be}} just the right size and shape for this purpose. Allman learned to play slide guitar when he {{received}} two birthday gifts from his brother, Gregg: a copy of <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal's</b> debut album, with its version of [...] "Statesboro Blues", {{and a bottle of}} Coricidin pills (as Duane had a cold that day). Other prominent slide guitarists, such as Derek Trucks (also of the Allman Brothers Band), Ray Wylie Hubbard, Rory Gallagher, J. D. Simo and Gary Rossington also adopted the Coricidin bottle as a slide. Bottles of the type they used were not produced after the early 1980s, but replicas have been produced since 1985.|$|R

5|$|The Lahore Fort {{was built}} in 1566 {{under the rule of}} Mughal emperor Akbar the Great on the {{location}} of an earlier mud-fort. The solid brick masonry complex was later extended and modified by subsequent emperors. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan was a romantic man who constrcuted <b>Taj</b> <b>mahal</b> in agra and after that this master piece in Lahore {{was built in}} 1633 as a small summer house costing around 900,000 rupees - an exorbitant amount at the time. Naulakha Pavilion is among the buildings that were erected or reconstructed between 1628 and 1634 under Shah Jahan's rule. Due to his personal interest in the design and construction, Shah Jahan's architectural traditions manifest distinctive symmetry and hierarchical accents. Naulakha Pavilion is part of the Shah Burj block in the northwest section of the fort that was actually built by his predecessor Jahangir.|$|E

25|$|Humayun's tomb {{commissioned}} in 1562 AD, {{was one of}} {{the most}} direct influences on the <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal's</b> design and was a response to the Gur-e Amir, borrowing a central dome, geometric symmetrical planning and iwan entrances, but incorporating the more specifically Indian Mughal devices of chhatris, red sandstone face work, and a 'Paradise garden' (Charbagh). Akbar's tomb c.1600 at Sikandra, Agra, retains many of the elements of Humayan's tomb but possesses no dome and reverts to a cenotaph open to the sky. A theme which was carried forward in the Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb also at Agra, built between 1622 and 1628, commissioned by his daughter Nur Jahan. The Tomb of Jahangir at Shahdara (Lahore), begun in 1628 AD (1037 AH), only 4 years before the construction of the Taj and again without a dome, takes the form of a simple plinth with a minaret at each corner.|$|R
40|$|A {{common mistake}} when {{considering}} how film reflects social practice and {{process is to}} disconnect it from its contexts of inspiration, inception and production. I {{argue that it is}} wrong to consider Slumdog Millionaire (2008, dirs Danny Boyle and Loveen Tandan) a ‘love story’, along the lines of its global marketing. Based on an adaptation of diplomat Vikas Swarup’s Q&A, the film’s ‘text’ (screenwriter Simon Beaufoy), provides a narrative of Mumbai’s fast-track urbanisation-as-modernisation, which is built on the obliteration of its external (immigrants) and internal (slumdwellers) strangers on ethno-religious grounds. Mumbai’s-India’s negotiation of liminal figures, such as the film’s Muslim ‘slumdog’ hero, Jamal Malik from Juhu (slum), is achieved in two stages: first, by failed extermination and later through successful redirection of their (ethno-cultural) difference into consumption circuits. Taking on board Boyle and his associates’ real engagement with the politics of slum poverty (context), I consider Slumdog Millionaire as a critique of urban modernity’s fundamentalist face in India. In India’s multicultural polity strangers used to be managed by physical obliteration and citizens validated through processing by systems of governmentality (Foucault 1997). This management of mentality by the state, eventually internalised by its citizens (Hindus who murder Muslims in the name of ethno-religious purity), is based on religion in the film’s clip, which incidentally incited real protests in India. In later scenes (already implied in the selected one), we learn that today’s global financial-cultural articulations, strangeness is managed through governmobility (Bærenholdt 2013) : systems (such as those of tourism and media/technology) that enable the international mobility of things and humans-as-products. My presentation draws on the first of three key moments from the film to explore this transition: the Hindu riots and massacres of Muslim slumdwellers (inspired by actual incidents) that young Jamal and his brother narrowly escape (The other two involve Jamal and Salim’s precarious insertion into India’s lucrative tourist industry as <b>Taj</b> <b>Mahal’s</b> cunning self-taught tour guides; and Jamal’s initiation into Mumbai’s telecommunication and media industries as chai wallah-come-telephonic operator and finally quiz millionaire). Jamal appears as Mumbai’s ‘living’ example of governmobile material, which bears witness to India’s success at joining the ‘civilised’ community of modernised nations. During this process, the very idea of ‘borders’ and its connection to strangerhood and vagabondage, are being replaced by the fast mobilities of technology and fleeting privileged tourisms...|$|R
