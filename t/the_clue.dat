5|$|Having {{left the}} others, Xavier {{returns to the}} safe room and finds a colored number {{on the back of}} Gus's neck. After realizing the answer to <b>the</b> <b>clue,</b> he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the nerve agent after finding <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clue</b> Crew has {{traveled}} to 280 cities worldwide, spanning all 50 of the United States and 44 other countries. In addition to appearing in Jeopardy! clue videos, the team's members also {{travel to meet}} fans of the show and future contestants. Occasionally, they visit schools to showcase the educational game Classroom Jeopardy! Miyahara also serves as announcer for the Sports Jeopardy! spin-off series.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the initial}} {{announcement}} of auditions for the team, over 5,000 people applied for Clue Crew posts. The original Clue Crew members were Cheryl Farrell, Jimmy McGuire, Sofia Lidskog, and Sarah Whitcomb. Lidskog departed <b>the</b> <b>Clue</b> Crew in 2004 {{to become an}} anchor {{on the high school}} news program Channel One News, and a search was held to replace her in early 2005. The winners were Jon Cannon and Kelly Miyahara, who formally joined the crew starting in season 22, which premiered on September 12, 2005. Farrell continued to record clues for episodes aired as late as October 2008, and Cannon continued to appear until July 2009.|$|E

50|$|Barles is {{best known}} for <b>the</b> <b>Clues</b> de Barles (Barles Water gaps), two short very {{constricted}} canyons located on the road below the village. There are similar formations upstream at <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> de Verdaches.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{three rounds}} were played {{between the two}} contestants - Connect <b>the</b> <b>Clues,</b> Find <b>the</b> Figure and then a second Connect <b>the</b> <b>Clues</b> round. After these rounds have been played, the winner would play a solo bonus game.|$|R
5|$|Contestants who finish Double Jeopardy! with $0 or a {{negative}} score are automatically {{eliminated from the}} game at that point and awarded the third place prize. On at least one episode hosted by Art Fleming, all three contestants finished Double Jeopardy! with $0 or less, and as a result, no Final Jeopardy! round was played. This rule is still in-place for the Trebek version, although staff has suggested {{that it is not}} set in stone and that executive producer Harry Friedman may decide to display <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> for home viewers' play if such a situation were ever to occur. During Celebrity Jeopardy! games, contestants with a $0 or negative score are given $1,000 for the Final Jeopardy! round.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the games created by Her Interactive, a game for the Nintendo DS was released in September 2007 by Majesco Entertainment. In the game, developed by Gorilla Systems Co and called Nancy Drew: Deadly Secret of Olde World Park, players help Nancy solve the mystery of a missing billionaire. Majesco has also released two other Nancy Drew games for the DS, titled Nancy Drew: The Mystery of <b>the</b> <b>Clue</b> Bender Society (released July 2008) and Nancy Drew: The Hidden Staircase, based on the second book in the original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series (released September 2008). Nancy Drew: The Hidden Staircase and Nancy Drew: The Model Mysteries, both by THQ, are also available on the Nintendo DS system.|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} decryption of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
5000|$|Using {{any part}} of the answer in giving a <b>clue</b> {{resulting}} in <b>the</b> item being disqualified with a [...] "honk" [...] sound effect. The celebrity gave <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> in <b>the</b> first round and the contestant gave <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> in <b>the</b> second round. The teams alternated choosing subjects in the first two rounds. If the game hadn't been won yet the teams then chose which member would give <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> in <b>the</b> third round with the lower scoring team going first.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> first <b>clue</b> {{may also}} be preceded by some other <b>clues,</b> if all <b>the</b> <b>clues</b> are already bound {{to the left of}} the forcing space.|$|R
50|$|Treasure Hunter {{involves}} two contestants and the host, {{all sitting}} in the studio, who attempt to solve five cryptic <b>clues.</b> <b>The</b> <b>clues</b> are hidden in locations around Newcastle and the Hunter Region. The contestants direct a team of ABC employees in a car to the locations suggested in each clue {{in order to find}} <b>the</b> subsequent <b>clue.</b> <b>The</b> contestants may take suggestions from listeners to assist them in finding <b>the</b> <b>clues.</b> <b>The</b> game ends when all five clues are found, or on the stroke of midday, whichever comes first.|$|R
5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on one side and <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E
5|$|ABC aired another series {{featuring}} the Hardy Boys, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, from 1977 to 1979. The prime time series starred Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy as Frank and Joe Hardy; Pamela Sue Martin and later Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew. During the first season, the series alternated between episodes {{featuring the}} Hardy Boys one week and Nancy Drew the next. The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen respectively {{during the filming}} of the first episodes) {{to appeal to a}} prime time television audience. The series featured original plots as well as ones based on Hardy Boys books, among them <b>The</b> <b>Clue</b> of the Screeching Owl, The Disappearing Floor and The Flickering Torch Mystery. The series received an Emmy nomination and featured a number of guest stars, including Kim Cattrall, Ray Milland, Howard Duff, and Ricky Nelson. During the second season, the series format changed to focus more on the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew appearing mostly in crossover episodes with the brothers; midway through production of the second season, Martin quit and was replaced by Johnson. The series returned for a third season, dropping the Nancy Drew character completely and shortening its title to The Hardy Boys.|$|E
5|$|During 1929, most of {{the major}} European filmmaking {{countries}} began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound. Many of the trend-setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages. One of Europe's first two feature-length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking: The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich Zelnik's Efzet-Film company and British Sound Film Productions (BSFP). In 1928, the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany, where it was shot; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by BSFP's corporate parent. It was given a British trade screening in March 1929, as was a part-talking film made entirely in the UK: <b>The</b> <b>Clue</b> of the New Pin, a British Lion production using the sound-on-disc British Photophone system. In May, Black Waters, a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all-talker, received its initial trade screening; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound-on-film system. None of these pictures made much impact.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> fifth <b>clue,</b> <b>the</b> country's {{name was}} revealed, and both {{contestant}}s scored for every right guess as many points as <b>the</b> <b>clue's</b> level indicated. After the fourth country, the contestant with more points got to round four.|$|R

5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E
25|$|When teams start a leg, {{arrive at}} Route Markers, or {{complete}} certain tasks, they normally receive a letter-sized tear-away envelope that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> folder. After retrieving <b>the</b> <b>clue,</b> teams open {{the envelope and}} read aloud the instructions given on <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> sheet and then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect each clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> box should they lose their first one, otherwise they are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it or trying to learn from other teams of where to go next.|$|E

25|$|During season five, {{teams were}} not aware of the {{upcoming}} Yield. In subsequent seasons, clues have alerted teams that a Yield would be present at the next Route Marker via wording on <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> sending them there. Yields were present in every leg except the last of season five, while only three were present in seasons six through eight, and two in seasons nine through eleven. Yields have not been present in the U.S. Race since season eleven after a revised format of <b>the</b> <b>clue,</b> the U-Turn. Yields are still present within the foreign editions.|$|E

25|$|In cryptic crosswords, {{the clues}} are puzzles in themselves. A typical clue {{contains}} both a definition {{at the beginning}} or end of <b>the</b> <b>clue</b> and wordplay, which provides a way to manufacture the word indicated by the definition, and which may not parse logically. Cryptics usually give the length of their answers in parentheses after <b>the</b> <b>clue,</b> which is especially useful with multi-word answers. Certain signs indicate different forms of wordplay. Cryptics have a steeper learning curve than standard crosswords, as learning to interpret {{the different types of}} cryptic clues can take some practice. In Great Britain and throughout much of the Commonwealth, cryptics of varying degrees of difficulty are featured in many newspapers.|$|E
