5|$|The Historic period {{begins in}} the late 18th century with the {{exploration}} of southern Utah by Padres Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near {{what is now the}} Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> of European descent known to visit the area. In 1825, trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very little}} {{evidence}} of prehistoric activity in the area, especially pre-Iron Age; however, Celtic names {{in the area around}} Wigan—such as Bryn, Makerfield and Ince—indicate that the Celtic people of Britain were active in the area in the Iron Age. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> believed to have settled in the Wigan area were the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe who controlled most of northern Britain.|$|E

5|$|There was {{historically}} {{a village}} of the Delaware tribe {{near the mouth of}} Mahoning Creek. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> of European descent arrived in the area in the 1760s and 1770s. Various mills were constructed on it in the 1700s and 1800s. Numerous bridges have also been constructed across the creek. Part of the creek is in the Montour Ridge Landscape Corridor.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of France, Clouzot and several other {{directors}} were tried in court for collaborating with the Germans. For his sentence, Clouzot was forbidden from going on set of any film or from using a film camera {{for the rest of}} his life. Clouzot received letters of support from filmmakers and artists Jean Cocteau, René Clair, Marcel Carné and Jean-Paul Sartre, who were against the ruling. Clouzot's sentence was later shortened from life to two years. There is no official document making note of any apology or appeal. During his two-year banishment from filming, Clouzot worked with one of his supporters, Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> to defend Le Corbeau.|$|E
5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, as {{he did not have}} one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played.|$|E

5|$|In 1847, Mormon {{farmers from}} the Salt Lake area became <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> of European descent {{to settle the}} Virgin River region. In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City, Utah areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses. They prospected for mineral deposits, and {{diverted}} Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area Kolob—in Mormon scripture, the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism {{industry}} offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging {{devices and}} security hardware. Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs, using the former King Constantine II of Greece as his principal salesman. Ex-King Constantine—who {{at the time}} was exiled in Britain—provided contacts to several royal families for Mardas, and had close contact with the deposed Shah of Iran, who had moved to Mexico. The Shah was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> interested in the customised bullet-proof cars that Mardas was offering, and was believed to have financially assisted Mardas’ companies.|$|E

5|$|The Hohokam were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> {{known to}} have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde ore body for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of the ore body was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> are {{estimated}} to have arrived in Virginia over 12,000years ago. By 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 AD. By 1500, the Algonquian peoples had founded towns such as Werowocomoco in the Tidewater region, which they referred to as Tsenacommacah. The other major language groups in the area were the Siouan to the west, and the Iroquoians, who included the Nottoway and Meherrin, {{to the north and}} south. After 1570, the Algonquians consolidated under Chief Powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network. Powhatan controlled more than 30smaller tribes and over 150settlements, who shared a common Virginia Algonquian language. In 1607, the native Tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000.|$|E

Archaeological evidence of human presence dates back to approximately 1350 AD. The area's inhabitants were semi-nomadic, travelling from Stewart Island/Rakiura in the south and inland to Central Otago. They generally dwelt near river mouths for easy access to the best food resources. In legend, the Catlins forests further inland were inhabited by Maeroero (wild giants).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> {{to rush to}} the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>people</b> {{to use a}} romanized {{script to}} write Southern Min were Spanish missionaries in Manila in the 16th century. However, it was used mainly as a {{teaching}} aid for Spanish learners of Southern Min, and {{seems not to have}} had any influence on the development of pe̍h-ōe-jī. In the early 19th century, China was closed to Christian missionaries, who instead proselytized to overseas Chinese communities in South East Asia. The earliest origins of the system are found in a small vocabulary first printed in 1820 by Walter Henry Medhurst, who went on to publish the Dictionary of the Hok-këèn Dialect of the Chinese Language, According to the Reading and Colloquial Idioms in 1832.|$|E
