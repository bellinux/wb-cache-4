40|$|New York City {{contains}} {{ninety-five percent}} of the cooperative housing units in the United States. While there are historical and social factors for this statistic, a specific factor is the New York State Legislature 2 ̆ 7 s support of conversion of residential real estate from rental to cooperative ownership. Specifically, the 2 ̆ 2 Goodman-Grannis 2 ̆ 2 bill provides a method whereby developers may convert residential rental housing in New York City to cooperative housing without obtaining an agreement to purchase a cooperative apartment {{from any of the}} existing tenants. Under this method, tenants who do not desire to purchase their apartments as cooperatives may remain in the targeted building indefinitely. In order to initiate this 2 ̆ 2 noneviction 2 ̆ 2 plan, a developer must be able to show that potential purchasers, either tenant or non-tenant, will purchase at least fifteen percent of the apartment units in a targeted building. As a result, the developer can reach this number by recruiting non-tenants only, thereby <b>taking</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> without the consent of a single tenant resident. Therefore, this Note recommends that adequate protection of New York City residents should require landlord-developers to meet fifteen percent requirement solely from existing tenants...|$|E

Using a unique data set from 3, 489 individuals in 34 countries, cross-level analysis supports our hypotheses regarding the effects of individualism and uncertainty avoidance. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice...|$|R
