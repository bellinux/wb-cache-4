In December 1925 he quickly wrote [...] The Torrents of Spring—a satirical novella attacking Sherwood Anderson—and sent it to his publishers Boni & Liveright. His three-book contract with them included a <b>termination</b> <b>clause</b> should they reject a [...] single submission. Unamused by the satire against {{one of their most}} saleable authors, [...] Boni & Liveright immediately rejected it and terminated the contract. [...] Within weeks Hemingway signed a contract with Scribner's, who agreed to publish The Torrents of Spring and all of his subsequent work.|$|E

2500|$|Deterrence approach. [...] Often the <b>termination</b> <b>clause</b> in {{deadlock}} provisions {{provides a}} punitive element {{for the party}} initiating the deadlock procedure. [...] In those clauses, a deadlock is only said to arise when one party serves a notice on the other indicating that a deadlock has arisen (instead of a failure to resolve on a key matter at {{a certain number of}} meetings). [...] The provisions will then provide for the determination of the [...] "fair market value" [...] of a half share in the business, usually by having it valued by an expert or auditor (or sometimes both in consultation). [...] Once the valuation is made, the party who served the notice must either (a) buy all the other party's share in the business at 125% of the fair price, or (b) sell its share to the other party at 75% of the fair price. [...] The downside to such clauses is that deadlocks rarely get resolved, and can lead to the business being paralysed by indecision.|$|E

5000|$|No {{person may}} {{terminate}} or amend — or claim an accelerated payment or forfeiture {{of the term}} under — any agreement, including a security agreement, with a bankrupt individual by reason only of the individual’s bankruptcy or insolvency. Similar provision is made with respect to any insolvent person upon filing a notice of intention or a proposal, {{as well as for}} any debtor company subject to the CCAA by reason only that proceedings commenced under the CCA or that the company is insolvent. Because of these restrictions on what are called [...] "ipso facto" [...] clauses, creditors must be careful in specifying appropriate trigger events in their contracts' <b>termination</b> <b>clauses.</b> The Canadian courts have extended this further through application of the common law principle of fraud upon the bankruptcy law, declaring that <b>termination</b> <b>clauses</b> that are triggered where non-payment of obligations is indirectly caused by the debtor’s insolvency should be deemed to have been caused by the insolvency.|$|R
40|$|In {{construction}} projects, disputes occurrence {{can have}} serious impacts; as a client, {{it is expected}} to avoid any disputes occurrence during the work; however, it is seemingly inevitable. On such conditions, ideally, it is expected that the express terms and conditions under standard forms of contracts would fairly distribute the risks between the contracting parties. But in reality, some of these clauses, which are set out to prevent or solve those disputes in reasonable time did not perform as expected. For instance, in Iran, General Terms of Contract (GTC) is provided in order to organize procurement systems; however, it could not perform reasonably in some cases in order to prevent or solve the probable destructive impacts of construction disputes. For instance, some of the construction projects under GTC of Iran are abandoned and the contracts are terminated in which the employers will take advantages of the uncertainty of some clauses in GTC of Iran especially <b>termination</b> <b>clauses</b> (clause 46 and 47 of GTC of Iran). But despite GTC of Iran, seemingly this problem, which leads to termination of contract in benefits of employers is less observed in standard form of contract in Malaysia since more details relevant to termination of contract by the parties are clarified in Malaysian standard forms of contracts. For instance, in PWD 203 A of Malaysia, termination of contract is explained in rights of both employer and contractor, which include default, procedure and effects (clause 51 – 58). On this basis the issue arises as: what are the most frequent reasons that have caused thetermination of contract in benefits of employer in the actual construction industry? Hence, this study aims to prepare more comprehensive and legally correct conditions and procedure for <b>termination</b> <b>clauses</b> in GTC of Iran in its construction contract by analyzing the most frequent disputes associated with the termination of contract by employer in Malaysian and Iranian construction projects. To achieve this aim, comparative analysis between <b>termination</b> <b>clauses</b> in PWD 203 A of Malaysia and GTC of Iran is done with reviewing relevant cases which have been under these standard forms and due to dispute occurrence and termination event referred to the court in Iran and Malaya...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} when {{designing}} a partnership agreement partner firms may {{prefer not to}} specify how to allocate the commonly owned assets should there be an early termination of the contract. By not including such a clause, firms induce litigation before a Court with positive probability.

The absence of an asset allocation clause works as a "discipline device" that mitigates the hold-up problem within the partnership.

In the meantime, there will be practical implications, including more precision in contract drafting, greater care in the exercise of contractual rights, and more diligent communication between parties. The Court did not address the existence of a duty to negotiate in good faith, but the existence of a duty of honest contractual performance will certainly influence the conduct of future negotiations. There has also been debate as to how this will reconcile with the doctrine of utmost good faith, especially with respect to the manner in which <b>termination</b> <b>clauses</b> operate in the area of insurance contracts.|$|R

Well known examples of these stopping rights include the early exercise right in American options, the callable right in callable securities and the prepayment right in mortgage loans. In this paper, we show how to model the mortgagor’s prepayment in mortgage loans and the issuer’s call in the American warrant as an event risk using the intensity based approach, where the propensity of prepayment or calling is modeled by the intensity of a Poisson process. We illustrate that the corresponding pricing formulation resembles the penalty approximation approach commonly used in {{the solution of the}} linear complementarity formulation of an optimal stopping problem. We obtain several theoretical results on the prepayment strategies of mortgage loans and calling polices of American warrants. We also propose robust second order accurate numerical schemes for solving the penalty formulation of an optimal stopping problem...|$|R

An analysis of termination fee provisions and merger outcomes This paper provides large-sample evidence pertaining to the use of and wealth effects associated with provisions for termination fees in merger agreements between 1989 and 1998. The evidence suggests that target <b>termination</b> fee <b>clauses</b> are an efficient contracting device through which target managers compensate bidders for the costs associated with bid negotiation and the potential for information expropriation by third parties. While target fees truncate a normal bidding process, target shareholders gain from higher completion rates and greater negotiated takeover premiums in deals that include target <b>termination</b> fee <b>clauses.</b> Our findings regarding bidder fee provisions indicate that these clauses are used to lock-in a portion of target wealth gains in deals with higher negotiating costs and greater costs associated with bid failure. Compensation for bidder fee provisions appears to take the form of concomitant target fee provisions, and lower bid premium...|$|R
