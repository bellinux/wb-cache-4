2500|$|Greater income {{inequality}} {{can increase the}} poverty rate, as more income shifts away from lower income brackets to upper income brackets. Jared Bernstein wrote: [...] "If less of the economy's market-generated growth – i.e., before taxes and transfers kick in – {{ends up in the}} lower reaches of the income scale, either there will be more poverty for any given level of GDP growth, or <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a lot more transfers to offset inequality's poverty-inducing impact." [...] The Economic Policy Institute estimated that greater {{income inequality}} would have added 5.5% to the poverty rate between 1979 and 2007, other factors equal. Income inequality was the largest driver of the change in the poverty rate, with economic growth, family structure, education and race other important factors. An estimated 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2012, versus 26% in 1967.|$|E

60|$|On the {{principle}} {{that there should be}} a name for every thing which we have frequent occasion to make assertions about, there ought evidently to be a name for every Kind; for as it is the very meaning of a Kind that the individuals composing it have an indefinite multitude of properties in common, it follows that, if not with our present knowledge, yet with that which we may hereafter acquire, the Kind is a subject to which <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied many predicates.

60|$|During {{these last}} few years of worry and bluster across the North Sea {{we have a little}} {{forgotten}} India in our calculations. As Germany faces round eastward again, as she must do before very long, we shall find India resuming its former central position in our ideas of international politics. With India we may pursue one of two policies: we may keep her divided and inefficient for war, as she is at present, and hold her and own her and defend her as a prize, or we may arm her and assist her development into a group of quasi-independent English-speaking States--in which case she will become our partner and possibly at last even our senior partner. But that is by the way. What I am pointing out now is that whether we fight Germany or not, a time is drawing near when Germany will cease to be our war objective and we shall cease to be Germany's war objective, and when <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a complete revision of our military and naval equipment in relation to those remoter, vaster Asiatic possibilities.|$|E

60|$|If {{the peace}} of the world is ever to become secure, I believe <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> along with other changes, a {{development}} of the idea which inspires the project of a League of Nations. As time goes on, the destructiveness of war grows greater and its profits grow less: the rational argument against war acquires more and more force as the increasing productivity of labor makes it possible to devote a greater and greater proportion of the population to the work of mutual slaughter. In quiet times, or when a great war has just ended, men's moods are amenable to the rational grounds in favor of peace, and it is possible to inaugurate schemes designed to make wars less frequent. Probably no civilized nation would embark upon an aggressive war if it were fairly certain in advance that the aggressor must be defeated. This could be achieved if most great nations came to regard {{the peace of}} the world as of such importance that they would side against an aggressor even in a quarrel in which they had no direct interest. It is on this hope that the League of Nations is based.|$|E

That is generally our way--it was so at Mysore, it has been so in a dozen other places. When we have done all the work, and have got them at our mercy, we give them comparatively easy terms. As soon as they recover from the effects of their defeat, they set to work again to prepare for another tussle; and then we have all the expense and loss of life to incur, again, and then end by annexing their territory, which we might just as well have done in the first place. It may be all very well to be lenient, when one is dealing with a European enemy; but magnanimity does not pay when you have to do with Orientals, who don't care a rap for treaty engagements, and who always regard concessions as being simply a proof of weakness.|$|E
60|$|Distribution, however, is {{only the}} {{beginning}} of the problem. There is the more difficult issue of getting books and papers printed and published. And here we come to an intricate puzzle in reconciling the indisputable need for untrammelled individual expression on the one hand with public ownership on the other, and also with the difficult riddle how authors may be supported under Socialist conditions. It is not within the design of this book to do more than indicate a possible solution. These are problems the Socialist has still to work out. At present authors with business shrewdness and the ability to be interesting get an income from the sale of their books, and it seems possible that they might continue to be paid in that way under Socialism. It is difficult outside the field of specialist work (which under any social system has to be endowed in relation to colleges and universities) to find any other just way of discriminating between the author who ought to get a living from writing, and the author who has no reasonable claim to do so. But under Socialism, in addition to the private publisher or altogether replacing him, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> some sort of public publisher.|$|E

Practically, as you see, {{there is}} not a soldier here fit to carry arms, nor a horse fit for work, and I should say {{that it will be a}} month before General Buller can reckon upon any {{assistance}} from the garrison. As to his own army, I expect he will keep the main portion round Chieveley. No doubt he will bring the greater part if not all the garrison of Ladysmith back to Frere and Estcourt, both to get them out of the pestilential air here and for convenience of feeding them. The civilian population will leave, of course, as soon as they possibly can. I should think that Buller will leave in garrison here an infantry brigade, part of the cavalry, and two or three batteries, and this with the sick who cannot be moved, will be about as much as our transport will be able to manage until the railway bridge is repaired and the line put in running order. Till that is done there is no possibility of a general advance; and indeed <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a great accumulation of stores here, as this will then become our base instead of Chieveley.|$|E
60|$|In the {{unfolding}} record of behaviour {{it is the}} stewardesses and bandsmen and engineers--persons of the trade-union class--who shine as brightly as any.

No untried man dare say {{that he would have}} behaved better in his place. He escaped. He thought it natural to escape. His class thinks it was right and proper that he did escape. It is not the man I would criticise, but the manifest absence of any such sense of the supreme dignity of his position as would have sustained him in that crisis. He was a rich man and a ruling man, but in the test he was not a proud man. In the common man's realisation that such is indeed the case with most of those who dominate our world, lies the true cause and danger of our social indiscipline. And the remedy in the first place lies not in social legislation and so forth, but in the consciences of the wealthy. Heroism and a generous devotion to the common good are the only effective answer to distrust. If such dominating people cannot produce these qualities <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an end to them, and the world must turn to some entirely different method of direction.|$|E
60|$|Kropotkin, who {{believes}} that manual and intellectual work should be combined, holds that authors themselves should be compositors, bookbinders, etc. He even {{seems to suggest that}} the whole of the manual work involved in producing books should be done by authors.

That, however, does not touch our present point, which is the question how the MSS. to be printed will be selected. In Kropotkin's plan there will presumably be an Author's Guild, with a Committee of Management, if Anarchism allows such things. This Committee of Management will decide which of the books submitted to it are worthy to be printed. Among these will be included those by the Committee and their friends, but not those by their enemies. Authors of rejected MSS. will hardly have the patience to spend their time setting up the works of successful rivals, and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an elaborate system of log-rolling if any books are to be printed at all.
