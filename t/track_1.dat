5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on <b>Track</b> <b>1,</b> which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that encase the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, <b>Track</b> <b>1</b> had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on <b>Track</b> <b>1.</b>|$|E

5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on <b>Track</b> <b>1</b> was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} shuttle tracks, only three are in use, {{with the former}} {{southbound}} express track space being used for platform space at each terminal. The former southbound local track is now Shuttle <b>Track</b> <b>1.</b> Track 2 no longer exists, but the trackbed of Track 2 can be seen inside the tunnel from passing trains on Tracks 1 and 3. At the two terminals, the trackway for Track 2 is occupied by platforms that provide access to Track 3, which was the former northbound express track. The former northbound local track is Track 4. Track 2 was removed between the two stations in 1975.|$|E
