500|$|For example, the {{original}} window system, called 8½, exploited these possibilities as follows. Plan 9 represents the user interface on a terminal {{by means of}} three pseudo-files: , which can be read by a program to get notification of mouse movements and button clicks, , {{which can be used}} to perform textual input/output, and , writing to which enacts graphics operations (see bit blit). The window system multiplexes these devices: when creating a new window to run some program in, it first sets up a new namespace in which , [...] and [...] are connected to itself, hiding the actual device files to which it itself has access. The window system thus receives all input and output commands from the program and handles these appropriately, by sending output to the actual screen device and giving the currently focused program the keyboard and mouse input. The program does not need <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is communicating directly with the operating system's device drivers, or with the window system; it only has to assume that its namespace is set up so that these special files provide the kind of input and accept the kind of messages that it expects.|$|E

The production of such a large quantity would require the purchase of additional equipment. ICI's hydrofluoric acid plant was out of commission and would require repairs. The bill for that amount of uranium hexafluoride would therefore come to around £3,000, a sum that he could not spend from research funds. He would require permission from senior ICI management, who would want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would assist the war effort and whether 3 kg was all that would be required, or if further orders could be expected. Chadwick then revealed that this was part of a secret project, codenamed Tube Alloys, the object of which was to build an atomic bomb.

This paper explores the counsellor-training and counselling-skill development needs of the Employee Assistance Programme Agencies and compares them with the Workplace Counsellor training currently available in the UK Higher Education Sector Results of my research so far, indicate that investigating new theoretical modelling, together with pursuing research-led/practice-based developments and innovations, could greatly benefit/improve the training of Workplace Counselling Practitioners.

2500|$|In September 1864, an {{engraver}} named J. Baumgarten from Baltimore, Maryland {{made and}} sent Lincoln an unsolicited seal, marked with [...] "A Lincoln" [...] on its side, meant for personal use. [...] Baumgarten also {{claimed to have}} made seals of the [...] "same plan" [...] for both Presidents Fillmore and Buchanan. [...] This was just prior to Nevada becoming the 36th state, but as the design of this seal is not described, and no reply from Lincoln is known and no payment is recorded, {{it is not possible}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was the aforementioned 36-star seal, something similar to the simple F seal used by Fillmore, an entirely different seal, or if it was used at all. [...] Baumgarten may well have been related to Selig Baumgarten, an engraver who emigrated to Baltimore from Hanover with eight children in 1852. [...] One of Selig's sons, Herman Baumgarten, later engraved the 1877 version of the Great Seal.|$|E

He sparked a controversy in early 2008 for his comments on the contentious Sydney Test Match: [...] "Millions of Indians want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> [...] was a 'white man' taking the 'white man's' word against that of the 'brown man'. Quite simply, if there was no audio evidence, nor did the officials hear anything, then the charge did not stand." [...] Despite the fact that Gavaskar's comment referenced Mike Procter and not the ICC, Australian writer Gideon Haigh said that, if Gavaskar genuinely believed this, [...] "then he should almost certainly resign, for if the ICC is a bastion of 'white man's justice', Gavaskar bears some of the blame for having failed to change it.He has recently been selected as the interim president of BCCI replacing N. Srinivasan" ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the mid-twentieth century, some theologians {{have taught}} {{that a person}} who lives by a {{constant}} attitude of charity is unlikely to fall in and out of God's graces without being profoundly aware of the change. The term [...] "fundamental option" [...] arose and is used in a variety of senses. Pope John Paul II reaffirmed traditional teaching going back to the Council of Trent in his encyclical Veritatis Splendor, as does the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which states: [...] "The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell, 'eternal fire'." [...] The Catechism then adds: [...] "The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs." [...] However, the Catechism does not by name say a specific person is in Hell, but it does say that [...] "...our freedom has the power to make choices for ever, with no turning back." [...] Most significantly, the Catechism also proclaims that [...] "There are no limits to the mercy of God..." [...] and that [...] "although we can judge that an act is in itself a grave offence, we must entrust judgment of persons to the justice and mercy of God." [...] We cannot see into their mind <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was deliberate or committed in full knowledge. Also, like the father in the Parable of the Prodigal Son, God forgives those who repent sincerely. Vatican II, in its Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium, reflects the traditional teaching of the Church.|$|E

[...] Leading up to the film's premiere, Jorgensen said Robertson's American wife and two children had volunteered to participate in DNA testing but withdrew their intent.
