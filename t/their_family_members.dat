5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has a story to tell, though Germans kept quiet about their experiences and {{felt a sense of}} communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E

This prompted Kübler-Ross to connect Chappell with Dougy and his family, and Chappell to create support groups for grieving children. Since its establishment, more than 20,000 children and <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> have received support from the organization.|$|E
5|$|Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an {{indication}} of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps {{to allow them to}} remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear {{to be able to keep}} track of the current location of <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{day before}} bookings {{for the film}} opened, a {{reported}} crowd of 100,000 gathered outside the Maratha Mandir to buy tickets. The tickets, the most expensive for a Bollywood film at that time, were dockets containing text, photographs and trivia about the film, and are now considered collector's items. They sold for 100 (valued at about US$21 in 1960), compared to the usual price of 1.5 (US$0.31). Bookings experienced major chaos, {{to the extent that}} police intervention was required. It was reported that people would wait in queues for four to five days, and would be supplied food from home through <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Subsequently, the Maratha Mandir closed bookings for three weeks.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} stroke {{knowledge}} and expectations for recovery among the <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of stroke patients in an acute rehabilitation hospital. Design: Survey study of 50 <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of stroke patients under going inpatient rehabilitation {{at a single}} urban rehabilitation hospital. Results: Sixty percent of participants {{were able to identify}} whether <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> had sustained a cerebral hemorrhage or infarct; 48 % were able to identify at least one treatment provided to <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> for his or her stroke. The average length of stay predicted byparticipants closely matched the average patient length of stay. Participants tended to overestimate the functional abilities of <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> with a stroke, both on initial assessment and discharge. This overestimation was more substantial for discharge functional ability than for initial assessment. Participants were able to predict discharge location with substantial accuracy (82 % agreement, kappa. 41). Conclusions: The knowledge of stroke etiology and functional outcome of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of individuals undergoing rehabilitation after stroke shows significant limitations. Participants’ ability to predict functional outcome on discharge was worse than their knowledge of current functional status. Participant predictions of length of stay and discharge disposition were areas of relative strength. Further efforts are needed to enhance the knowledge level of <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of patients undergoing rehabilitation after stroke...|$|R

5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> and stop the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Stojanović was {{contracted}} to the Prijedor {{branch of the}} state railway company to provide healthcare for its employees. In 1936, he was {{contracted to}} an iron ore mining company in Ljubija, a town near Prijedor, and would visit the mining company clinic twice a week. He also taught hygiene at the gymnasium in Prijedor. Together with other intellectuals from the town, he gave lectures to the miners at their club in Ljubija. His lectures were usually about medical issues, but he also described {{the economic and social}} position of workers in more advanced countries. He socialised with the miners and treated <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> for free. He was very active socially, and also participated in sports. In 1932, he founded the tennis club of Prijedor, which continues to bear his name. Stojanović once bought new kit for all members of the Rudar Ljubija football club. His contracts with the railway company and the mining company were both terminated in 1939. The railway employees protested in Prijedor, and Stojanović's contract with that company was subsequently renewed.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This article {{reports on}} an {{evaluation}} of four family support programmes in Ireland for families of people with a physical or an intellectual disability or autism. The focus of the evaluation, which took place {{within a year of}} the programmes' completion, was on establishing whether the programmes had an impact on families' capacity to effectively support <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>member.</b> METHOD: A mixed-method design was used, which included a survey (n = 38) and interviews (n = 19) with participating <b>family</b> <b>members.</b> Ethical approval for the study was given by the relevant university ethics committee. RESULTS: Findings suggest that participation in the programmes enhanced knowledge, attitudes, and competencies of families and also impacted their ability to advocate for <b>their</b> <b>family</b> <b>member</b> and to connect with the community. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Whilst outcomes were overwhelmingly positive, further follow-up would be required to ascertain if sustained capacity building took place.
