5|$|The goal of {{increasing}} commercial and business activity on Jaffa Road never materialized. Several {{attempts were made}} to bring a pedestrian presence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> such as the construction of the Windows residential tower next door, but to date nothing has been successful and the project has been deemed a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|The name Whitehall {{was used}} for several {{buildings}} in the Tudor period. It either referred to a building made of light stone, or as a general term for any festival building. This included the Royal Palace of Whitehall, which in turn gave its name <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
50|$|Takin' It <b>To</b> <b>The</b> <b>Streets</b> is <b>the</b> third studio album {{released}} by British hard rock band FM. Takin' It <b>To</b> <b>The</b> <b>Streets</b> {{was released in}} 1991 on the Music For Nations record label.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of two side platforms, {{each of which has}} exits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Schichauweg and Barnetstrasse. Additional northern entrances were opened from both platforms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Miethepfad and Kettinger Straße on 25 November 1991.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{flagship}} “Daily Times” has returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> since December 2014, further {{efforts have been}} injected towards {{the return of the}} rest viable titles, especially the Sunday Times, the Weekend Times and <b>the</b> Lagos Weekend <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} over the sub-surface platforms, the station buildings were remodelled internally to share a single entrance and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> is now used for retail purposes. During the 2000s, the deep-level parts of the station underwent refurbishment with areas of damaged wall tiles being replaced. The dark green and cream tiled walls of the Piccadilly line's lower level passages and platforms were restored, with damaged tiles being replaced by reproductions to match the original designs.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was refurbished by Metronet during 2005 and 2006. Works included provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the visually impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. The station does not have step free access from the platforms <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bow Street had {{a number}} of notable {{residents}} in the 17th and 18th centuries. Oliver Cromwell moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in 1645. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford was born there in 1661. Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset lived here around 1685. The woodcarver Grinling Gibbons had premises on Bow Street between 1678 and 1721, while the physician John Radcliffe stayed on the street in the 1680s. Author and scribe John Ayres stayed at Bow street during the late 17th century, as did the playwright William Wycherley. The actor-manager David Garrick lived at No.6 between 1742–4 while Charles Macklin stayed in the street between 1743–8.|$|E

5|$|During {{a school}} check for mobile phones, Tom is caught with a pornographic VCD. As his teacher confiscates it, Chengcai makes a cheeky remark that provokes the teacher into {{slapping}} him, {{leading to an}} exchange that escalates into a massive scuffle. The principal decides to expel Chengcai, while Tom receives a public caning {{for his part in}} the scuffle. Tom and Chengcai later join a local street gang; as their initiation, they are forced to shoplift an iPod. However, they are caught by two conmen with connections <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> gang posing as police detectives, who demand that they pay the fine $2000 within two days or be arrested.|$|E
5|$|Elliott Drive, the Iowa City {{street on}} which Carver-Hawkeye Arena is located, is named in his honor. The {{sculpture}} of the 12' stainless steel hawk, Strike Force, {{is located in}} a small park just south of Carver-Hawkeye arena. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in his name and the sculpture, a scholarship in Elliott's name were all spearheaded by his good friend Earle Murphy to honor Bump and future Iowa athletes.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an {{advertising}} sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a bus shelter. It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although it is meant to symbolise man's harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E

5|$|Jenna {{mentions}} that she met Jayden 20 years ago. The scene then flashes back to Jenna getting dissed {{by a young}} Jayden. The costume she is wearing {{is essentially the same}} costume that Jane Krakowski wore 20 years previously in the Broadway musical Starlight Express. In addition, Jayden is dressed similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> urchin Gavroche in Les Misérables because the young boy playing that role on Broadway was also providing the voice of Control in Starlight.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police down the stairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Cromwell moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in 1647, {{taking up}} {{residence}} in Wallingford House. Two years later, Charles I was carried through Whitehall {{on the way to}} his trial at Westminster Hall. Whitehall itself was a wide street and had sufficient space for a scaffold to be erected for the King's execution at Banqueting House. He made a brief speech there before being beheaded. Cromwell died at the Palace of Whitehall in 1658.|$|E

5|$|Several of Chicago's most {{important}} historical figures have {{lived on the}} street. This {{is especially true of}} the period of recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 when many of the {{most important}} families in the city moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the political history, the architecture, the culture, the economy, as well as the law and government of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the demographics of Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} {{opened to}} Jay Street on February 1, 1933, but the High Street station remained closed {{for an additional}} five months. The trains ran through the station without stopping, because the escalators <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> had not been completed {{due to lack of}} funding. That month, the contract for four escalators in the station was awarded to Otis Elevator Company. The station opened on June 24, 1933.|$|E
5|$|The large {{triangular}} plaza on {{the west}} side of One World Trade Center, facing the Hudson River, was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> However, the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design. The terrace can be accessed through a staircase on Vesey Street. The terrace is paved in granite, and has 12 sweetgum trees, in addition to a block-long planter/bench.|$|E

5|$|The west wing's {{design is}} known only from archival records, {{since it was}} almost totally {{destroyed}} between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The {{first part of the}} wing consisted of stables, a spiral staircase leading to the exterior façade, a corridor linking the courtyard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and a large pantry. During the seventeenth century, the second part held an indoor jeu de paume court and a chapel; its first floor had three large bedrooms.|$|E
5|$|Turf Moor {{is located}} {{to the east}} of Burnley town centre. The stadium has two car parks of its own, and there are also a number of parking {{facilities}} in the surrounding area. The railway station with the shortest walk to Turf Moor is Burnley Manchester Road. The stadium is also accessible from Burnley Central station on the East Lancashire Line which, although it is physically closer to the ground, is a slightly further walk due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> layout and the intervening river. There are also a number of bus services in the area, and Turf Moor is very close to Burnley Bus Station.|$|E
5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
