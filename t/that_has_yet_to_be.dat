25|$|Pakistan {{does not}} have its own {{equivalent}} to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. There is also no federal ministry that looks after veteran affairs. Most of Pakistan's infantry come from lower income, poor families, mainly from the rural areas of the country.

Because there is no network of support that goes out to veterans, some believe that Pakistan's veterans are facing similar issues like those faced by Vietnam veterans. Politicians hardly ever mention the veterans in speeches or statements. This is because civil society hardly ever inquires or hears about the physical and mental challenges facing Pakistan's veterans.

500|$|Planescape: Torment {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} upon its release, but only {{made a small}} profit. GameSpot's reviewer stated [...] "It's clearly the best traditional computer role-playing game of the year", a comment which the website would later expand to [...] "one of the greatest ever". Allen Rausch, writing for GameSpy's 2004 retrospective [...] "A History of D Video Games", commented that Black Isle Studios [...] "went way over the top for this one, crafting an utterly unique experience <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equaled by any RPG since". The gameplay was often compared to Baldur's Gate, another Interplay game that used the same engine as Planescape: Torment. Robert Mayer of Computer Games Magazine commented that [...] "this is one dark and interesting game. There's lots of macabre humor, some rather deviant sexual references, and enough weirdness to send the devotees of Tolkienesque fantasy running for their copies of The Hobbit." [...] Kieron Gillen of PC Gamer UK commented that [...] "Planescape: Torment is attempting to be iconoclastic in the most stereotyped of genres. We’re cheering it on." ...|$|E

The album includes three cover version of her father's songs; [...] "Caroling, Caroling", [...] "The First Noel", and [...] "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)" [...] done in tribute to him. Waldron said the album was [...] "keeping the holiday spirit in the family". Cole would later re-record [...] "The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)" [...] as a posthumous duet with her father on her 1999 Christmas album The Magic of Christmas.
