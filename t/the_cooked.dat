5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. <b>The</b> <b>cooked</b> stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} add it to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with <b>the</b> <b>cooked,</b> minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E

25|$|Pasta {{exhibits}} a random molecular order {{rather than a}} crystalline structure. The moisture content of dried pasta is typically around 12%, indicating that dried pasta will remain a brittle solid until it is cooked and becomes malleable. <b>The</b> <b>cooked</b> product is, as a result, softer, more flexible, and chewy.|$|E
25|$|Rice may be soaked to {{decrease}} cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness.

25|$|In Mexico, {{particularly}} in the towns and cities, corn tortillas are often made nowadays by machine and are very thin and uniform, but in many places in the country, they are still made by hand, even when the nixtamal is ground into masa by machine. In Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, they are still often made by hand and are thicker. Corn tortillas are customarily served and eaten warm; when cool, they often become rubbery or grainy as <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> starches stale.

25|$|Gui are grilled dishes, {{which most}} {{commonly}} have meat or fish {{as their primary}} ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked {{at the center of}} the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice bowls. <b>The</b> <b>cooked</b> meat is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly sliced garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings. The suffix gui is often omitted in the names of meat-based gui such as galbi, the name of which was originally galbi gui.|$|E
25|$|During {{cooking and}} soaking, {{a number of}} {{chemical}} changes {{take place in the}} grains of maize. Because plant cell wall components, including hemicellulose and pectin, are highly soluble in alkaline solutions, the kernels soften and their pericarps (hulls) loosen. The grain hydrates and absorbs calcium or potassium (depending on the alkali used) from the cooking solution. Starches swell and gelatinize, and some starches disperse into the liquid. Certain chemicals from the germ are released that allow <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> grains to be ground more easily, yet make dough made from the grains less likely to tear and break down. Cooking changes the grain's protein matrix, which makes proteins and nutrients from the endosperm of the kernel more available to the human body.|$|E

25|$|In Arab cuisine, rice is an {{ingredient}} of many soups and dishes with fish, poultry, {{and other types}} of meat. It is also used to stuff vegetables or is wrapped in grape leaves (dolma). When combined with milk, sugar, and honey, it is used to make desserts. In some regions, such as Tabaristan, bread is made using rice flour. Medieval Islamic texts spoke of medical uses for the plant. Rice may also be made into congee (also called rice porridge or rice gruel) by adding more water than usual, so that <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> rice is saturated with water, usually {{to the point that it}} disintegrates. Rice porridge is commonly eaten as a breakfast food, and is also a traditional food for the sick.|$|E
25|$|The {{storage of}} pasta {{depends on how}} far along it is processed. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the {{cupboard}} for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored {{in the refrigerator for}} a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. If <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> pasta is not used in the five days it may be frozen for up to two or three months. The pasta will start to dry after a period of time, but it varies with the type of pasta. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{is cooked}} by boiling or steaming, and absorbs water during cooking. With the {{absorption}} method, rice may be cooked in {{a volume of}} water similar to the volume of rice. With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, {{as much of the}} enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric rice cookers, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example saffron rice or risotto); this makes <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called pilaf in Iran and Afghanistan or biryani (Dam-pukhtak) in India and Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|Gourmets {{generally}} prefer {{white wine}} to red to accompany cheese as its acidity agrees {{well with the}} fat in dairy products. Dry wines with mineral aromas such as chardonnay or sauvignon blanc bring out the milky taste of goat cheese. Aromatic wines, such as Gewurztraminer and some sparkling wines support the strong taste of Washed-rind cheeses (Maroilles, Epoisses, Munster, etc.). Neutral white wines (Castilla-La Mancha, Italian Trebbiano) are well suited to sheep cheese {{and there are also}} Manchego and pecorino romano for a little spicy. <b>The</b> <b>cooked</b> pressed cheeses require a bold wine, woodland. There is perfect agreement between the Comté cheese and the yellow wine of the Jura. Fortified wines are recommended with veined cheeses (Blue or Roquefort). In this case, the cheese mould (Penicillium roqueforti) and the wine (noble rot) form a harmonious whole.|$|E
25|$|The function, is the {{gathering}} of neighbors, family and friends for a ritualized meal that includes invited guests of the principal who took on a promise to the Holy Spirit. The meal consists of the Holy Spirit Soup, a meat broth that is applied to buttered bread and tempered with mint leaves, either accompanied with <b>the</b> <b>cooked</b> meat used in its preparation, Portuguese sweet bread and sweet rice puree sprinkled with cinnamon. There are many variations on the meat broth recipe that includes the methods of preparing the soup, the availability of side dishes or {{the consistency of the}} soup. On the island of Terceira, for example, the Holy Spirit Soup is accompanied by an alcatra, a plate of meat cooked in red wine in an earthen pot.

25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef tripe and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef tripe and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef tripe has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef tripe broth, cleaned beef tripe, onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. <b>The</b> <b>cooked</b> brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef tripe and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E
