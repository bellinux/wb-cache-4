50|$|A torque {{multiplier}} {{is a tool}} used {{to provide}} a mechanical advantage in applying torque to <b>turn</b> <b>bolts,</b> nuts or other items designed to be actuated by application of torque, such as the actuation of valves, particularly where there are relatively high torque requirements.|$|R
50|$|Adaptations {{used in the}} {{construction}} of the Innisfail court house however, include the use of steel bolts to anchor the roof to the walls, and the walls to the floor beams, which were in <b>turn</b> <b>bolted</b> to the stumps. Diagonal crossbeams of hardwood timber were used to brace the walls of the building. These elements are thought to be early adaptations of construction methods to cyclonic conditions.|$|R
40|$|Fail-safe tele/autonomous {{robotic system}} makes it {{unnecessary}} for human technicians to enter nuclear-fuel-reprocessing facilities and other high-radiation or otherwise hazardous industrial environments. Used {{to carry out}} experiments as exchanging equipment modules, <b>turning</b> <b>bolts,</b> cleaning surfaces, and grappling turning objects by use of mixture of autonomous actions and teleoperation with either single arm or two cooperating arms. System capable of fully autonomous operation, teleoperation or shared control...|$|R
50|$|A long-bolt or {{through-bolt}} {{engine is}} an internal combustion piston engine where, following usual practice, the cylinder head is held down by bolts or studs. Conventionally the cylinder head is {{bolted to the}} cylinder block and the crankshaft main bearings are in <b>turn</b> <b>bolted</b> to the crankcase by separate bolts. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the cylinder head right through to the crankshaft bearing caps.|$|R
5000|$|The LRS 2 and Tactical 2 rifles are straight-pull bolt-action {{take down}} sniper rifles. The straight-pull action design was {{introduced}} in the Blaser R93 hunting rifle line. These actions allows for faster follow-up shots compared to traditional <b>turn</b> <b>bolt</b> actions. The rifles are designed to fire small groups (sub 0.25 MOA) with factory match ammunition.The LRS 2 (Long Range Sporter 2) version, comes chambered in [...]223 Remington, 6mm Norma BR, 6.5×55mm, [...]308 Winchester and [...]300 Winchester Magnum.|$|R

5000|$|This {{transformation}} {{was noted}} by historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan in the novel, More Work for Mother: The Ironies of Household Technology from the Open Hearth to the Microwave, {{in which she}} compared {{the work of the}} times. [...] "A woman who is placing a frozen prepared dinner into a microwave oven is involved in a work process that is as different from her grandmother's methods of cooking as building a carriage from scratch differs from <b>turning</b> <b>bolts</b> on an automobile assembly line." ...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory chamber {{for growing}} plants {{used to measure}} {{photosynthesis}} and respiration in simulated microgravity. Holds plant specimens while rotated on clinostat, see article, "Clinostat Delivers Power To Plant-Growth Cabinets" (KSC- 11537). Provides way of comparing gas-exchange rates of plants rotated horizontally on clinostat with those of stationary or vertically rotated plants. Gas extracted for analysis without stopping clinostat. Chamber includes potlike base and cylindrical cover, both made of transparent acrylic pipe. Gasket forms seal between cover and bottom plate of base.

5000|$|Rather than a {{traditional}} wooden or polymer rifle stock, the AW {{is based on}} an aluminium chassis which extends {{the entire length of the}} stock. This chassis system is marketed as the Accuracy International Chassis System (AICS) and can be used for all Accuracy International rifles. All other components, including the receiver, are bolted directly to this chassis. Two hollow polymer [...] "half thumb-hole stock panels", usually coloured green, dark earth or black, are in <b>turn</b> <b>bolted</b> to the chassis, creating a rugged, yet for its sturdiness comparatively light, weapon.|$|R
50|$|In the final, Adam Gemili {{seemed to}} get the best start, but flanked by the Jamaican uniforms, he was quickly {{swallowed}} up. Mid way into the <b>turn,</b> Usain <b>Bolt</b> had a clear lead. Coming off the <b>turn,</b> <b>Bolt</b> had several meters on the field. The winner determined, Bolt eased off and cruised across the finish in what would be a great time for any other human being, just a slow 200 for Bolt in 19.66.Coming off the turn about even with Gemili and Nickel Ashmeade, Warren Weir out in lane 7 separated from those two and gained significantly on the slowing Bolt, setting a personal best of 19.79.Taking a lesson from American teammate Wallace Spearmon who was vanquished in the semis, Curtis Mitchell spotted the field several meters then closed from dead last {{at the end of the}} turn to take the bronze. Gemili took a full dive at the finish to try to beat Ashmeade but still finished in fifth.|$|R
40|$|A motion {{primitive}} {{for use in}} compliant motion robot task execution is described. The primitive has a rich {{input parameter}} set to provide for execution {{of a variety of}} specific tasks such as door opening, crank <b>turning,</b> <b>bolt</b> seating and <b>turning,</b> pushing, sliding, pin insertion/removal, and leveling, as well as termination conditions which specify conditions for ending the motion, such as allowable position and force error bounds. A split rate force control technique is used for force control. Force and torque data from a six-axis force sensor are read, and gravity compensation using load mass properties is done to determine contact forces...|$|R
50|$|A belt trailer or self {{unloading}} belt trailer is a semi-trailer {{that uses}} either a chain and flap assembly or a continuous belt that runs lengthwise {{on the bottom}} of the trailer. The belt is bolted to bars that in <b>turn</b> <b>bolt</b> to a chain that runs the length of the trailer. This belt is usually composed of rubber that allows the belt to grip the product and various widths are available depending on manufacturer generally ranging from 25 inches to 61 inches wide. A planetary, which is powered by a PTO pump, electric, or gas motor, cycles the belt.|$|R
50|$|The final {{started with}} the 100 meter {{specialist}} Gatlin blasting out of the blocks, but Bolt to his far outside was not far behind him relative to the staggered start.It was clearly a two-man race. Coming off the <b>turn,</b> <b>Bolt</b> may have been slightly ahead but it was almost even, with Femi Ogunode next on the far inside. Behind them Jobodwana separated from the pack while Ogunode disappeared. Edward, the 2009 silver medalist and Jobodwana recorded the same finishing time (a national record for Jobodwana) but Jobodwana won the bronze medal by 2 thousandths of a second.|$|R
5000|$|The shotgun has a {{relatively}} small number of component parts, incorporating a simple operating principle. The main features of the mechanism are the <b>turning</b> block <b>bolt</b> locking system and the cartridge feeding system (cut off).|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} Ogden for an instant, as if {{undecided}} {{whether to take}} the liberty of addressing him too, and then, his heart apparently failing him, <b>turned</b> and <b>bolted.</b> From down the corridor came the clatter of a dropped stick.|$|R
60|$|Things {{were looking}} very bad. Scarce one had escaped without a wound, and the {{sergeant}} had dropped, bleeding profusely; when, to their delight, a volley burst from within fifty yards of them and, in an instant, their assailants <b>turned</b> and <b>bolted.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A swing bridge, {{its main}} -span could swivel on its axis {{and open to}} allow river traffic to pass. This is {{accomplished}} by using a turn key placed into the <b>turning</b> <b>bolt</b> and rotating the bolt. Six people would rotate the key using a [...] long wood rod that combined resemble a corkscrew. This would turn the [...] wide gear that had 300 teeth along its circumference and the span would spin along 42 rollers constructed of steel. The operators could use two gears, one opened the span in 150 revolutions, while the other completed the job in 50 revolutions. When opened it provided [...] of clearance {{on either side of}} the bridge.|$|R
60|$|But the Jersey cow {{appeared}} to see {{no good reason}} for being hustled out of her luscious browsing ground. No sooner had the two breathless girls got near her than she <b>turned</b> and <b>bolted</b> squarely for the opposite corner of the field.|$|R
40|$|Low cost {{approaches}} to the design and fabrication of blades for a two-bladed 200 kW wind turbine were identified and {{the applicability of the}} techniques to larger and smaller blades was assessed. Blade tooling was designed and fabricated. Two complete blades and a partial blade for tool tryout were built. The patented TFT process was used to wind the entire blade. This process allows rapid winding of an axially oriented composite onto a tapered mandrel, with tapered wall thickness. The blade consists of a TFT glass-epoxy airfoil structure filament wound onto a steel root end fitting. The fitting is, in <b>turn,</b> <b>bolted</b> to a conical steel adapter section to provide for mounting attachment to the hub. Structural analysis, blade properties, and cost and weight analysis are described...|$|R
50|$|The {{track laying}} began on 2 September 2009 along a wide, grassy forest track. The track {{consisted}} of circular steel pipe of about 6mm wall thickness, welded to steel cross members {{which were in}} <b>turn</b> <b>bolted</b> to wooden sleepers. One side was fitted with a steel spike to engage with the next section. Thus, it fitted together {{very much like a}} toy railway, using preassembled track sections which are either straight or of fixed curvature. The track laying operation looked a bit like a child’s train set on a large scale. The rails, with sleepers ready attached, came in sections - straight or curved to suit their position. The tube and pin joints fitted together exactly as do the rail sections of the toy set.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{pleasure}} is just this then, Winchester. We must <b>turn</b> <b>Bolt</b> to duty. If the fellow {{is really an}} American, {{it would be a}} wretched business even to flog him for desertion; and as to treason, you know, there can be none without allegiance. Nelson gives me a discretion, and so we'll act on the safe side, and just turn him over to duty again. When there comes an opportunity, I'll inquire into the facts of his case, and if he can make out that he is not an Englishman, why, he must be discharged. The ship will be going home in a year or two, when everything can be settled fairly and deliberately. I dare say Bolt will not object to the terms." ...|$|R
50|$|Paul's first {{invention}} was {{a cannon}} and its ammunition. His {{ability to produce}} both the gun and the ammunition for it was followed during his entire career and made him unique in this ability. Following {{the success of the}} Dreyse needle gun Paul turned his energies to improving on that design and producing a new one. Paul and Wilhelm had separated due to differences during this time. After Paul developed a new <b>turning</b> <b>bolt</b> design Wilhelm was impressed enough to rejoin the business and succeeded in obtaining the financing to purchase machinery and continue development. While the original needle gun used a pin that pierced the base of the cartridge to ignite the primer in the middle Mauser soon developed a needle that ignited the charge at the base, a superior design.|$|R
5000|$|Mannlicher's {{successful}} designs {{during his}} lifetime were his bolt-action rifles, both military and sporting, in both <b>turn</b> <b>bolt</b> and straight-pull actions. Mannlicher also developed several innovative semi-automatic handgun designs {{in the last decade}} of the 19th century. A measure of how far ahead of his time he was can be seen by looking at his experimental designs of semiautomatic rifles, developed at a time when ammunition was not suitable to function properly in such a weapon. Mannlicher began development in 1883 of an automatic rifle firing the 11mm Austrian Werndl, a black powder cartridge. [...] According to WHB Smith in [...] "Mauser, Walther and Mannlicher Firearms" [...] the Mannlicher 1885 became the inspiration for the M1 Garand and the Mannlicher 1900 with the 'short-stroke piston' became the inspiration for the M1 Carbine.|$|R
50|$|The shotgun has a {{relatively}} small number of component parts, incorporating a simple operating principle. The main features of the mechanism are the <b>turning</b> block <b>bolt</b> locking system and the cartridge feeding system (cut off). These serve to make the Raffaello CrioComfort reliable and practical, easy to strip and maintain.|$|R
60|$|Brother Burge <b>turned,</b> and <b>bolting</b> {{into his}} room clapped the door to and locked it. The {{jeweller}} stood dumbfounded on the landing; then he heard the window go up {{and the voice of}} Brother Burge, much strengthened by the religious exercises of the past six months, bellowing lustily for the police.|$|R
60|$|But just as Sheen {{arrived and}} {{the ranks of}} the {{expedition}} were beginning to give way before the strenuous onslaught of the Judies, the latter, almost with one accord, <b>turned</b> and <b>bolted</b> into their playground again. Looking round, Tomlin, that first of generals, saw the reason, and uttered a warning.|$|R
60|$|Scarce a shot missed. Ten of the negroes fell, {{and those}} attacking {{from the right}} <b>turned</b> and <b>bolted</b> among the trees. The negroes on the left, however, {{inspired}} by the roaring of the horns and the shrieking yells of the Obi man, came on with greater determination and dashed across the path.|$|R
50|$|A keyhole {{race is a}} speed event {{commonly}} seen at equestrian {{events and}} gymkhanas, in which the horse and rider team with the fastest time in completing the event wins. Horses running this event must have speed, but also the agility to stop quickly in full stride, <b>turn,</b> and <b>bolt</b> directly back into a run.|$|R
60|$|It {{was long}} past midnight when Captain Byrne {{was rewarded with}} success--the {{tumblers}} clicked into position, {{the handle of the}} safe door <b>turned</b> and the <b>bolts</b> slipped back.|$|R
50|$|Usually, the {{truss rod}} of a brand-new {{instrument}} is adjusted {{by the manufacturer}} before sale. Normally, turning the truss rod's adjustment bolt clockwise tightens it, counteracting the tension of the strings and straightening the neck or creating a backward bow. <b>Turning</b> the <b>bolt</b> counter-clockwise loosens it, allowing string tension {{to act on the}} neck and creating a forward bow (higher string action).|$|R
5000|$|Universal joints are two {{articulated}} socket joints (about 1" [...] long) combined at a right angle, {{that allow}} {{a bend in}} the turning axis of the wrench and socket. They are used with extensions and ratchets for <b>turning</b> a <b>bolt</b> or nut at a difficult to access location. Wobble extensions may be substituted for some universal joint applications and have the advantage of not wobbling so much.|$|R
60|$|All {{being found}} right, {{the key was}} <b>turned,</b> the <b>bolts</b> were drawn, and the chain unhooked, so as to permit {{entrance}} to the constable, the prisoner, and the assistants; and the door was then a suddenly shut against the witnesses, who, as less trustworthy persons, were requested (through the wicket) {{to remain in the}} yard, until they should be called in their respective turns.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I {{tell you}} it is all in vain," [...] replied the Dame. [...] "When I saw your cap and rod lying in the hall, I did but say, 'There he is again,' and she ran up the stairs like a young deer; and I heard key <b>turned,</b> and <b>bolt</b> shot, ere I could say a single word to stop her--I marvel you heard her not." ...|$|R
5000|$|Streamline the {{remaining}} internal activities, by simplifying them (D). Focus on fixings - Shigeo Shingo observed that it's {{only the last}} <b>turn</b> of a <b>bolt</b> that tightens it - the rest is just movement.|$|R
