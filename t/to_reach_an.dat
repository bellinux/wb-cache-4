5|$|Since Gaddafi {{had kept}} mostly aloof {{in the months}} prior to the fall of N'Djamena, Habré hoped <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>an</b> {{understanding}} with Libya, possibly through an accord with Acyl, who appeared receptive to dialogue. But Acyl died on 19 July, replaced by Acheikh ibn Oumar, and the CDR was antagonized by Habré's eagerness to unify the country, which led him to overrun the CDR's domains.|$|E

5|$|By 1895 Venezuela had had {{a dispute}} with the United Kingdom about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, for over half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by Venezuela after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries. Over {{the course of the}} nineteenth century the British and Venezuelans had proved no more able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>an</b> agreement, until matters came to a head in 1895, after seven years of severed diplomatic relations.|$|E
5|$|Carey's {{actions were}} given mixed reception, with critics and {{executives}} both commending her bold actions towards a song she felt {{needed to be}} heard, while others criticized her for publicizing the scandal further. Soon after, Sony involved themselves further, stripping Carey's webpage of any messages and began trying <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>an</b> agreement with her. Fearing to lose their label's highest seller, and the best-selling artist of the decade, Sony chose to release the song. Carey, initially content with the agreement, soon {{found out that the}} song had only been allowed a very limited and low-promotion release, not allowing the song to chart on the official US chart, and making international charting extremely difficult and unlikely.|$|E

Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that {{the asteroid belt}} has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the London trip, Jinnah was in no hurry <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>an</b> agreement, {{considering}} that time would allow him to gain the undivided provinces of Bengal and Punjab for Pakistan, but these wealthy, populous provinces had sizeable non-Muslim minorities, complicating a settlement. The Attlee ministry desired a rapid British departure from the subcontinent, but had little confidence in Wavell to achieve that end. Beginning in December 1946, British officials began looking for a viceregal successor to Wavell, and soon fixed on Admiral Lord Mountbatten of Burma, a war leader popular among Conservatives as the great-grandson of Queen Victoria and among Labour for his political views.|$|E
5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} able <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>an</b> agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings {{based upon their}} ideas for a battlecruiser, {{in return for a}} guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E

5|$|Gibraltar's {{relationship}} with Spain {{continued to be}} a sensitive subject. By 2002, Britain and Spain had proposed an agreement to share sovereignty over Gibraltar. However, it was opposed by the government of Gibraltar, which put it to a referendum in November 2002. The agreement was rejected by 17,000 votes to 187– a majority of 98.97%. Although both governments dismissed the outcome as having no legal weight, the outcome of the referendum caused the talks to stall and the British government accepted that it would be unrealistic to try <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>an</b> agreement without the support of the people of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, New York {{animator}} Ralph Bakshi {{came across}} a copy of R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat and suggested to producer Steve Krantz that it would work as a film. After meeting with Bakshi, Crumb loaned him one of his sketchbooks as a reference, but was unsure of the film's production and refused to sign the contract. Bakshi and Crumb were unable <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>an</b> agreement {{after two weeks of}} negotiations but Krantz secured the film rights from Crumb's wife, Dana, who had a power of attorney. Crumb received $50,000, distributed over the course of production and ten percent of Krantz's proceeds.|$|E
