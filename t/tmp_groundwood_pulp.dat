50|$|There are {{two major}} {{mechanical}} pulps: thermomechanical <b>pulp</b> (<b>TMP)</b> and <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> (GW). In the TMP process, wood is chipped and then fed into steam heated refiners, where the chips are squeezed and converted to fibres between two steel discs. In the groundwood process, debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres. Mechanical pulping does not remove the lignin, so the yield is very high, >95%, however it causes the paper thus produced to turn yellow and become brittle over time. Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres, thus producing weak paper. Although large amounts of electrical energy are required to produce mechanical pulp, it costs less than the chemical kind.|$|R

50|$|Another {{operation}} {{that is no}} longer performed relates to storing groundwood. In 1934, a large concrete pad was constructed for storing “lapped <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp.</b> Because of the water-driven groundwood mill, at time of high water availability, excess groundwood was manufactured for use when the water flow was low. Separation of frozen laps was difficult during cold Minnesota winters. When separation was not possible with crowbars, dynamite was used. The lapped <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> was then brought into the mill and placed into beaters for repulping and use.|$|R
40|$|The way {{in which}} the washing of pulp is {{affected}} by the type of pulp used was investigated in this work by using a new measurement technique. The experimental equipment developed was a test piston press equipped with a γ-radiation source and a scintillation detector that was used to measure concentrations within the pulp bed during the washing process. Three types of pulps were used: sulphite, kraft and mechanical (<b>groundwood)</b> <b>pulp.</b> It was shown that the washing of mechanical pulp differs greatly from the washing of chemical pulp. The dispersion coefficient was found to be a factor 10 larger for mechanical pulp than for chemical pulp. The difference was explained by the difference in fibre properties: the shorter fibres and the large amount of fibres present in <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> facilitate well-formed beds in which little channelling is present. It was also concluded from the local measurements that the dispersion effect {{at the top of the}} bed of the mechanical pulps was mostly attributed to inlet mixing. The influence of inlet mixing on the overall dispersion coefficient was however small. This result illustrates the usefulness of the new measurement technique since it could not have been obtained using traditional measurement techniques...|$|R
500|$|The company traces {{its history}} to a <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> mill {{established}} in 1865. Car tyre production began in 1932 by Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd). A three-company merger formed the Nokia Corporation in 1967; Nokian Tyres Limited {{was established in}} 1988 as a joint venture company split from the conglomerate as Nokia Corporation started focusing entirely on the mobile communications business. Nokian is [...] "Nokia" [...] in the genitive, thus Nokian renkaat meaning [...] "Tyres of Nokia".

500|$|Early {{corporate}} predecessors of Nokian Tyres are the Nokia Aktiebolag (Nokia Company) and Suomen Kumitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd.). In 1865, {{mining engineer}} Fredrik Idestam established a <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> mill {{on the banks}} of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland. In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, [...] west of Tampere by the Nokianvirta River, which had better resources for hydroelectric production. In 1871, with the help of his close friend, the statesman Leo Mechelin, Idestam renamed and transformed his mills into a share company, founding the Nokia Company.|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of aluminum nitrate (up to 100 ppm A 1 on pulp) to a two-stage, acidalkali, hydrogen peroxide bleach of Eucalyptus regnans stone <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> enhanced the brightness gain of the pulp, over {{a range of}} consistencies. It is proposed {{that the presence of}} aluminum ions modifies the catalytic behaviour of the transition metal ions present in the pulp, especially manganese, reducing peroxide consumption while increasing the brightness of the pulp.

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{a widely}} used bleaching chemical for mechanical pulps and is particularly useful when high brightness levels are required. The objective of this work was to study fines as a limiting factor for reaching higher brightness levels in high consistency hydrogen peroxide bleaching of Norway spruce (Picea abies) thermomechanical (<b>TMP)</b> and stone <b>groundwood</b> (SGW) <b>pulps.</b> The hydrogen peroxide bleaching efficiency (i. e. light absorption coefficient reduction) was studied {{as a function of}} temperature, alkali charge and fines content using an experimental design based on MODDE software (Umetrics AB). It is known that all types of fines contain more lignin, hemicelluloses, pectins, metals and less cellulose than long fibres. The light absorption coefficient was greater for unbleached TMP than for unbleached SGW pulp and an increased quantity of fines increased the light absorption coefficient for both pulp types. The increase was, however, most pronounced for the TMP. Furthermore, the data suggests that both the fibre fraction and the fines fraction are more coloured in the thermomechanical pulp. In most cases, increased amounts of fines in the pulp had a negative impact on the bleached pulp brightness in spite of the improved light scattering ability accompanying the addition of fines. A level of fines exceeding 50 % was especially detrimental resulting in lower pulp brightness due to a higher light absorption coefficient. Increasing the bleaching temperature did not improve the bleaching efficiency. The optimal bleaching temperature at a hydrogen peroxide charge of 4. 5 % was found to be 70 °C within the tested interval of 70 - 110 °C. For a fines content of 25 %, the stone <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> displayed a brightness of 83 % whereas the thermomechanical pulp achieved a brightness of 79 %...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{performance}} of anionic polyacrilamide (APAM) being an effective flocculant in fines retention {{and its effects on}} drainage time of pulp suspension and papers properties were investigated.

Handsheets were prepared and tested for physical properties. In addition, economic calculations were done to estimate the production costs of different bleached pulps in Finland. It {{was found that the}} addition of unrefined and refined sawdust kraft pulp improved drainability of the mechanical pulps. Tear strength of PGW furnishes was increased when either unrefined or refined sawdust pulp was added. Tear strength of TMP furnishes was not influenced when different sawdust kraft pulps were added. Up to 30 % of unrefined sawdust kraft pulp could be added and no significant negative effect was observed in TMP and PGW furnishes. On the other hand, when refined sawdust kraft pulp was added into the mechanical pulp furnishes, a clear improvement in the tensile strength was observed. According to the economic calculation the production cost of bleached sawdust kraft pulp is almost as low as the production cost of bleached mechanical pulp. We suggest that economically viable sawdust kraft pulp {{can be used as a}} substituent for expensive long fibre reinforcement kraft pulp in the production of mechanical pulp based papers...|$|R

Producing pulp by means of these processes is a prerequisite for paper (such as printing paper and paperboard) grades requiring high printability and stiffness. However, mechanical pulping processes consume a great amount of electricity, which may account for up to 40 % of the total pulp production cost. In mechanical pulping mills, wood (biomass) residues are commonly utilized for electricity production through an associated combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This techno-economic evaluation deals with the possibility of utilizing a biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plant in place of the CHP plant. Implementing BIGCC in a mechanical pulp production line might greatly improve the overall energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially when more biomass from forest (such as branches and tree tops) is available. When the fibre material that negatively affects pulp properties is utilized as a bioenergy resource, the overall efficiency will be further improved. A TMP+BIGCC mathematical model is developed with ASPEN Plus. By means of modeling, three cases are studied: 1) adding more forest biomass logging residues in the gasifier, 2) adding the reject fibres in the gasifier, and 3) decreasing the TMP-specific electricity consumption (SEC) by up to 50 %.

40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} three parts: Existing {{methods for}} characterisation of fibre crosssections have been improved, and new {{methods have been}} developed. These methods have then been applied to {{study the effects of}} wood characteristics and the pulping process on mechanical pulp fibres. Links have been established between fibre structure and paper properties such as surface smoothness and light scattering coefficient. New methods, based on SEM-images and image analysis, are described for providing cross-sectional fibre dimensions for large fibre populations, for wood tracheids (app. 60 000 tracheids in a wood trunk) and for processed pulp fibres (app. 1000 fibres per sample). The methods are suited e. g. for evaluation of changes in the fibre cross-sections from wood to the finished paper, or for mapping of fibre parameters within and between growth rings in a wood trunk. The treatment of data is discussed, showing how one may examine the changes in different groups of fibres (earlywood fibres, latewood fibres, split fibres) throughout a process. It is known from the literature that groundwood-based paper is superior to TMP-based paper with respect to printability. Fibres from SGW and PGW-pulp were found to be much more split in the longitudinal direction than TMP-fibres at comparable freeness. Intact groundwood fibres had thicker walls than intact TMP-fibres, but nevertheless super calendered hand sheets made from groundwood fibres were less roughened by moistening than were TMP-based sheets. Both for <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulps</b> and for TMPpulps, it was shown that reduced fibre wall thickness and increased fibre splitting was beneficial for improved surface smoothness and opacity. Latewood defibrate easier than earlywood during refining. In the case of grinding, there was no particular preference for earlywood or latewood to be defibrated. Reject refining of groundwood reject was, however, found to be very important for defibration of latewood-containing shives. Pulps made from a raw material with more compact fibres (high wall area to lumen area ratio) were found to defibrate easier, and contain less shives. It was found that refining tends to reduce wall thickness most on thickwalled parts of the fibre, thus causing a reduction of the wall thickness variation around the perimeter. Earlywood fibres were found to be preferentially split during refining. Most fibre splitting occurs during the primary stage, while the fibres are firmly attached to chips or fibre bundles. Latewood fibre wall thickness decreases considerably more than earlywood fibre wall thickness during refining. It seems that choosing an appropriate raw material is more effective than using excessive energy on reducing the wall thickness of thickwalled fibres. Earlywood fibres became more flattened during refining compared to latewood fibres, possibly due to repeated compressions and relaxations in the refiner. The energy consumption to a given freeness was found to be considerably larger for Scots Pine than for Norway Spruce. However, the fibre transverse dimensions did not differ much between Norway Spruce and Scots Pine. Pine pulps were far less developed than spruce pulps at similar energy level. A possible explanation for the large energy consumption may be that redistribution of extractives at the fibre surface could reduce friction in the refiner. This hypothesis should be further explored. The results in this study improve the knowledge of which fibre parameters that matter for surface smoothness and opacity of wood-containing publication paper. Further, this study elucidates how important fibre parameters such as wall thickness and fibre splitting are altered during a refining process. The results may be utilized to identify possible ways of modifying the TMP-process in order to produce paper with improved surface smoothness and opacity. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to improve the understanding on how thermal treatments of mechanical pulps containing iron influence the unbleached brightness and hydrogen peroxide bleachability at high brightness levels. An unbleached Norway spruce stone <b>groundwood</b> (SGW) <b>pulp</b> was subjected to heat and iron (Fe 3 +) treatments followed by a chelating stage and a high consistency hydrogen peroxide bleaching stage. The hydrogen peroxide bleachability was studied on pulps {{as a function of}} pre-treatment at elevated temperatures and strongly bound iron content prior to bleaching and the alkali charge during bleaching. The evaluation was done using an experimental design based on the MODDE software (Umetrics AB). Heat treatment of the unbleached SGW pulp at 110 or 140 degrees C did not induce a significant increase in light absorption coefficient. Increasing the heat treatment temperature to 170 degrees C did, however, result in an increased light absorption coefficient corresponding to a brightness loss of 3. 5 % ISO. The light scattering coefficient was found to be essentially unchanged regardless of the heat-treatment conditions applied. The brightness loss resulting from the heat treatment could only partly be regained by hydrogen peroxide bleaching. An increased amount of strongly bound iron in the unbleached SGW pulp increased the light absorption coefficient. This increase was slightly higher when heat pre-treatment was performed at 140 and 170 degrees C compared to when heating at 110 degrees C.  Hydrogen peroxide bleaching was found to reduce the iron content of the pulps and thus regain some of the brightness that was lost. This effect was most pronounced at the higher alkali charge levels. It is thus important to minimise the processing temperature, the time at high temperature and the iron content of the pulp in order to improve the unbleached brightness and bleachability of mechanical pulps...|$|R
40|$|The modern {{concept of}} "biorefinery" is dominantly based on {{chemical}} pulp mills {{to create more}} value than cellulose pulp fibres, and energy from the dissolved lignins and hemicelluloses. This concept {{is characterized by the}} conversion of biomass into various biobased products. It includes thermochemical processes such as gasification and fast pyrolysis. In mechanical pulp mills, the feedstock available to the gasification-based biorefinery is significant, including logging residues, bark, fibre material rejects, biosludges and other available fuels such as peat, recycled wood, and paper products. This work is to study co-production of bio-automotive fuels, biopower, and steam via gasification {{in the context of the}} mechanical pulp industry.   Biomass gasification with steam in a dual-fluidized bed gasifier (DFBG) was simulated with ASPEN Plus. From the model, the yield and composition of the syngas and the contents of tar and char can be calculated. The model has been evaluated against the experimental results measured on a 150 KWth Mid Sweden University (MIUN) DFBG. The model predicts that the content of char transferred from the gasifier to the combustor decreases from 22. 5 wt. % of the dry and ash-free biomass at gasification temperature 750 ℃ to 11. 5 wt. % at 950 ℃, but is insensitive to the mass ratio of steam to biomass (S/B). The H 2 concentration is higher than that of CO under normal DFBG operating conditions, but they will change positions when the gasification temperature is too high above about 950 ℃, or the S/B ratio is too far below about 0. 15. The biomass moisture content is a key parameter for a DFBG to be operated and maintained at a high gasification temperature. The model suggests that it is difficult to keep the gasification temperature above 850 ℃ when the biomass moisture content is higher than 15. 0 wt. %. Thus, a certain amount of biomass needs to be added in the combustor to provide sufficient heat for biomass devolatilization and steam reforming. Tar content in the syngas can also be predicted from the model, which shows a decreasing trend of the tar with the gasification temperature and the S/B ratio. The tar content in the syngas decreases significantly with gasification residence time which is a key parameter.   Mechanical pulping processes, as Thermomechanical <b>pulp</b> (<b>TMP),</b> <b>Groundwood</b> (SGW and PGW), and Chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) processes have very high wood-to-pulp yields. Producing pulp products by means of these processes is a prerequisite for the production of printing paper and paperboard products due especially to their important functional properties such as printability and stiffness. However, mechanical pulping processes consume a great amount of electricity, which may account for up to 40 % of the total pulp production cost. In mechanical pulping mills, wood (biomass) residues are commonly utilized for electricity production through an associated combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This techno-economic evaluation deals with the possibility of utilizing a biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plant in place of the CHP plant. Integration of a BIGCC plant into a mechanical pulp production line might greatly improve the overall energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially when the flow of biomass (such as branches and tree tops) from the forest is increased. When the fibre material that negatively affects pulp properties is utilized as a bioenergy resource, the overall efficiency of the system is further improved. A TMP+BIGCC mathematic model is developed based on ASPEN Plus. By means of this model, three cases are studied:   1) adding more forest biomass logging residues in the gasifier, 2) adding a reject fraction of low quality pulp fibers to the gasifier, and 3) decreasing the TMP-specific electricity consumption (SEC) by up to 50 %.   For the TMP+BIGCC mill, the energy supply and consumption are analyzed in comparison with a TMP+CHP mill. The production profit and the internal rate of return (IRR) are calculated. The results quantify the economic benefit from the TMP+BIGCC mill.   Bio-ethanol has received considerable attention as a basic chemical and fuel additive. It is currently produced from sugar/starch materials, but can also be produced from lignocellulosic biomass via a hydrolysis [...] fermentation or thermo-chemical route. In terms of the thermo-chemical route, a few pilot plants ranging from 0. 3 to 67 MW have been built and operated for alcohols synthesis. However, commercial success has not been achieved. In order to realize cost-competitive commercial ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass through a thermo-chemical pathway, a techno-economic analysis needs to be done.   In this work, a thermo-chemical process is designed, simulated, and optimized mainly with ASPEN Plus. The techno-economic assessment is made in terms of ethanol yield, synthesis selectivity, carbon and CO conversion efficiencies, and ethanol production cost.   Calculated results show that major contributions to the production cost are from biomass feedstock and syngas cleaning. A biomass-to-ethanol plant should be built at around 200 MW.

40|$|A major {{environmental}} concern {{with respect to}} hydrocarbon emissions is the formation of phytotoxic photooxidants. The work reported in this thesis focusses on the poorly studied anthropogenic terpene emissions from the industrial use of softwood. The advanced analytical determinations were made by adsorption sampling followed by thermal desorption and gas chromatography in the laboratory. Monoterpenes from forestry were analyzed for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Near to a harvester, the total monoterpene concentrations reached ~ 1000 mg/m 3, whereas the background level was ~ 1 mg/m 3. Prominent monoterpenes were a-pinene, b-pinene, 3 -carene, camphene, limonene, b-phellandrene, myrcene and terpinolene. Local formation of phytotoxic photooxidants may occur because of the short lifetimes of terpenes in air. Terpenes in process emissions and plumes from kraft pulp industries {{were found to have}} a uniform composition similar to that of pulpwood and of recovered sulphate turpentine. Predominant monoterpenes were a-pinene and 3 -carene from Scots pine. The emitted terpenes give rise to photooxidants and to oxidation of co-emitted sulphur and nitrogen oxides. The monoterpenes in emissions from industries producing stone <b>groundwood</b> and thermomechanical <b>pulp</b> were similar in composition to that of the processed pulpwood from Norway spruce. The major monoterpenes were a-pinene (> 50 %) and b-pinene (~ 25 %). The process emissions from a sulphite mill consisted mainly of p-cymene, formed from spruce monoterpenes by acid rearrangements. The terpene emissions from the barking of timber and pulpwood differed somewhat in composition from that of the wood. Increased proportions of b-phellandrene and myrcene were observed for Norway spruce. Oxidative decomposition and acid rearrangements of monoterpenes in the sampling cartridges were studied as major analytical difficulties. Pretreatment with thiosulphate and hydrogencarbonate prevented unwanted reactions of the terpenes...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical pulps {{are used}} in paper {{products}} such as magazine or news grade printing papers or paperboard. Mechanical pulping gives a high yield; nearly everything in the tree except the bark {{is used in the}} paper. This means that mechanical pulping consumes much less wood than chemical pulping, especially to produce a unit area of printing surface. A drawback of mechanical pulp production is the high amounts of electrical energy needed to separate and refine the fibers to a given fiber quality. Mechanical pulps are often produced from slow growing spruce trees of forests in the northern hemisphere resulting in long, slender fibers that are well suited for mechanical pulp products. These fibers have large varieties in geometry, mainly wall thickness and width, depending on seasonal variations and growth conditions. Earlywood fibers typically have thin walls and latewood fibers thick. The background to this study was that a more detailed fiber characterization involving evaluations of distributions of fiber characteristics, may give improved possibilities to optimize the mechanical pulping process and thereby reduce the total electric energy needed to reach a given quality of the pulp and final product. This would result in improved competitiveness as well as less environmental impact. This study evaluated the relation between fiber characteristics in three types of mechanical pulps made from Norway spruce (Picea abies), thermomechanical pulp(TMP), stone <b>groundwood</b> <b>pulp</b> (SGW) and chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). In addition, the influence of fibers from these pulp types on sheet characteristics, mainly tensile index, was studied. A comparatively rapid method was presented on how to evaluate the propensity of each fiber to form sheets of high tensile index, by the use of raw data from a commercially available fiber analyzer (FiberLabTM). The developed method gives novel opportunities of evaluating the effect on the fibers of each stage in the mechanical pulping process and has a potential to be applied also on‐line to steer the refining and pulping process by the characteristics of the final pulp {{and the quality of the}} final paper. The long fiber fraction is important for the properties of the whole pulp. It was found that fiber wall thickness and external fibrillation were the fibercharacteristics that contributed the most to tensile index of the long fiber fractions in five mechanical pulps (three TMPs, one SGW, one CTMP). The tensile index of handsheets of the long fiber fractions could be predicted by linear regressions using a combination of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation. The predicted tensile index was denoted BIN, short for Bonding ability INfluence. This resulted in the same linear correlation between BIN and tensile index for 52 samples of the five mechanical pulps studied, each fractionated into five streams(plus feed) in full size hydrocyclones. The Bauer McNett P 16 /R 30 (passed 16 meshwire, retained on a 30 mesh wire) and P 30 /R 50 fractions of each stream were used for the evaluation. The fibers of the SGW had thicker walls and a higher degree of external fibrillation than the TMPs and CTMP, which resulted in a correlation between BIN and tensile index on a different level for the P 30 /R 50 fraction of SGW than the other pulp samples. A BIN model based on averages weighted by each fiber´s wall volume instead of arithmetic averages, took the fiber wall thickness of the SGW into account, and gave one uniform correlation between BIN and tensile index for all pulp samples (12 samples for constructing the model, 46 for validatingit). If the BIN model is used for predicting averages of the tensile index of a sheet, a model based on wall volume weighted data is recommended. To be able to produce BIN distributions where the influence of the length or wall volume of each fiber is taken into account, the BIN model is currently based on arithmetic averages of fiber wall thickness and fibrillation. Fiber width used as a single factor reduced the accuracy of the BIN model. Wall volume weighted averages of fiber width also resulted in a completely changed ranking of the five hydrocyclone streams compared to arithmetic, for two of thefive pulps. This was not seen when fiber width was combined with fiber wallthickness into the factor “collapse resistance index”. In order to avoid too high influence of fiber wall thickness and until the influence of fiber width on BIN and the measurement of fiber width is further evaluated, it is recommended to use length weighted or arithmetic distributions of BIN and other fiber characteristics. A comparably fast method to evaluate the distribution of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation with high resolution showed that the fiber wallthickness of the latewood fibers was reduced by increasing the refining energy in adouble disc refiner operated at four levels of specific energy input in a commercial TMP production line. This was expected but could not be seen by the use of average values, it was concluded that fiber characteristics in many cases should be evaluated as distributions and not only as averages. BIN distributions of various types of mechanical pulps from Norway spruce showed results that were expected based on knowledge of the particular pulps and processes. Measurements of mixtures of a news‐ and a SC (super calendered) gradeTMP, showed a gradual increase in high‐BIN fibers with higher amounts of SCgrade TMP. The BIN distributions also revealed differences between the pulps that were not seen from average fiber values, for example that the shape of the BINdistributions was similar for two pulps that originated from conical disc refiners, a news grade TMP and the board grade CTMP, although the distributions were on different BIN levels. The SC grade TMP and the SC grade SGW had similar levels of tensile index, but the SGW contained some fibers of very low BIN values which may influence the characteristics of the final paper, for example strength, surface and structure. This shows that the BIN model has the potential of being applied on either the whole or parts of a papermaking process based on mechanical or chemimechanical pulping; the evaluation of distributions of fiber characteristics can contribute to increased knowledge about the process and opportunities to optimize it...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical pulping is {{a process}} for {{production}} of wood pulp in papermaking. Thermomechanical <b>Pulp</b> (<b>TMP)</b> and <b>Groundwood</b> (GW) are historically the two production methods used for mechanical pulping. Because of high electrical prices and increasing requirements in pulp quality it is of interest to improve the mechanical pulping process. The Advanced Thermomechanical Pulp (ATMP) process is a development of the TMP process developed to reduce the electrical energy consumption in production of mechanical pulp. ATMP also has better strength properties and optical properties compared to TMP. Andritz, Paper and Fibre Research Institute (PFI) and Norske Skog together have developed this production method throughout several pilot plant trials with excellent results. Mechanical pre-treatment of wood chips with a screw press and chemical addition in a high intensity primary refining stage are {{the features of the}} ATMP process. This process has recently been described (Hill et al. 2009, Hill et al. 2010, Gorski et al. 2011 and Johansson et al. 2011). Improvements in the electrical energy efficiency in refining of up to 0, 65 MWh/odt or 34 % as well as higher brightness and lower shive contents compared to reference TMP pulp were shown for spruce raw material (Gorski et al. 2011). To further understand what happens with the pulp in ATMP process compared to the TMP process different investigations were carried out. Methylene blue sorption were evaluated and used to measure the total amount of anionic groups on both ATMP and TMP produced pulps. ATMP produced pulps achieved a higher number of acidic groups compared to pulps without addition of chemicals for not only the whole pulp but also for three different fractions of each pulp. Additional tests are now carried out with conductometric titration to further verify the results from these tests. Laboratory sheets were produced from different fibre fractions of these pulps. Optical properties, strength properties, Ambertec formation and charge decay properties were measured on these sheets. The brightness and light absorption were significantly better for all fractions of ATMP pulps compared to pulps without addition of chemicals. Pulps added bisulphite achieved the highest light absorption and lowest light scattering in these trials. The results from light scattering showed that pulps produced without addition of chemicals achieved significantly poorer result for the long fraction compared to the other pulps. However, for the middle and fines fraction the ATMP produced pulps achieved high light scattering but not necessary the highest light scattering. TMP achieved high light scattering for both the middle and fines fraction. It is however difficult to compare the different ATMP pulps without an optimization of the addition of chemicals. Both strain and tensile index were measured to calculate the Tensile Energy Absorption (TEA). These results showed that to produce pulp with high intensity in the primary refining stage it is preferable to have a mechanical pre-treatment prior to this refining stage. TMP was produced with low intensity in the primary refining stage resulting in poor tensile index and TEA for the long fraction. The measurements of tensile strength in the z-direction showed that ATMP (Bisulphite) gave significantly higher z-strength compared to the other pulps for all fractions. Measurements of Ambertec formation were also carried out. The long fraction of TMP had significantly poorer ambertec formation compared to the long fraction of the other pulps. For the middle and fines fraction there were difficult to conclude with anything, the reason is probably {{because of the lack of}} agitation prior to the production of sheets from these fractions. Evaluation of charge decay properties were difficult to perform since the results varied from day to day. The variation in these results was probably due to differences in relative humidity. The humidity differences could be described by a hysteresis curve that describes differences in humidity from absorption and desorption of water going from one air humidity to another.
