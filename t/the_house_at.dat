5|$|Thatcher {{returned}} to the backbenches as a constituency parliamentarian after leaving the premiership.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{ancillary}} structures near <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> Valley View, including a smokehouse and a water well, and {{the foundations of}} an ice house and a summer kitchen.

5|$|After {{surveys of}} {{historic}} {{properties in the}} county, in 2008 the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places. The county received funding from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History to survey and document its architecture and history. As {{a result of this}} initiative, Valley View {{was one of the first}} eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register. The other seven were Capon Chapel, Fort Kuykendall, Hickory Grove, Hook Tavern, North River Mills Historic District, Old Pine Church and Springfield Brick House. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> Valley View was listed on the NRHP on December12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Big Run, a {{tributary}} stream of the South Branch Potomac River, flows north bisecting the Wappocomo property, bordered by dense foliage.

A smaller unnamed stream {{flows through the}} front lawn of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> Wappocomo before curving northwest toward its confluence with Big Run. Corn is the primary crop produced in Wappocomo's agricultural fields along the South Branch Potomac River, which consist of rich alluvial soils.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin {{was born}} on 10 August 1878 at <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city {{in what was then}} the Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five {{children}} born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant. Their marriage was characterized by a tension between Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings' artistic inclinations—and Sophie's cool pragmatism. The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, societal anti-Semitism early on.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Delius and Jelka had {{returned}} to Grez. He had begun to show symptoms of syphilis that he had probably contracted in the 1880s. He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius's medical treatment was an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing, and his royalties were curtailed by the lack of continental performances of his music. Beecham gave discreet financial help, and the composer and musical benefactor H. Balfour Gardiner bought <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> Grez and allowed Delius and Jelka to live there rent-free.|$|E
5|$|Carlton House Terrace {{underwent}} {{a series of}} renovations between 1999 and November 2003 to improve and standardise the property. New waiting, exhibition and reception rooms were created in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> No.7, using the Magna Boschi marble found in No.8, and greenish grey Statuario Venato marble was used in other areas to standardise the design. An effort was also made to make {{the layout of the}} buildings easier, consolidating all the offices on one floor, Fellows' Rooms on another and all the accommodation on a third.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{his army}} service in 1919, Marquis was restless and unsure of his future path. He first {{restarted}} the practice at Livingston and sold <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> Clyde Park (retaining some land there as a legacy for his daughters). He then decided to move to Whitehall, where he spent more and more of his time writing, at first on his wartime experiences, and then short articles on diverse subjects collected into volumes. He also wrote short stories during this period. However, he could not find a publisher.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the West Virginia Legislature at Wheeling passed an act abolishing slavery in West Virginia on February 3, 1865, thus ending the institution of the plantation in West Virginia. Since the 1960s, many of West Virginia's plantation houses have acquired places on the National Register of Historic Places, the United States government's official list of sites, buildings, and structures deemed worthy of preservation. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>at</b> Traveller's Rest, near Kearneysville, is West Virginia's sole plantation house designated as a National Historic Landmark for its national-level historical significance.

5|$|Much of {{the local}} {{woodland}} was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds.

5|$|Plagis {{stayed with}} the RAF {{following}} the end of hostilities, and from September 1946 to December 1947 commanded No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron in England and Germany, flying Gloster Meteor F.3s.

5|$|Poohsticks is a sport first {{mentioned}} in <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>at</b> Pooh Corner, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. It {{is a simple}} sport which may be played on any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and the one whose stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day's Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Poohsticks {{was invented}} by English author A. A. Milne for his son Christopher Robin Milne. The sport first came to {{prominence}} when it was described in the author's book <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>at</b> Pooh Corner {{as well as in}} the Disney animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh, the protagonist of the book, accidentally drops a pine cone into a river from a bridge and, after observing how it appeared on the other side of the bridge, devises the rules for Poohsticks. Pooh continues to play the sport with the other characters, Christopher Robin, Tigger and Eeyore.|$|E
