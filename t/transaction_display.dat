40|$|Understanding the {{determinants}} of liquidity costs in agricultural futures markets is hampered by a need to use proxies for the bid-ask spread which are often biased, and by a failure to account for a jointly determined micro-market structure. We estimate liquidity costs and its determinants for the live cattle and hog futures markets using alternative liquidity cost estimators, intraday prices and micro-market information. Volume and volatility are simultaneously determined and {{significantly related to the}} bid-ask spread. Daily volume is negatively related to the spread while volatility and volume per <b>transaction</b> <b>display</b> positive relationships. Electronic trading has a significant competitive effect on liquidity costs, particularly in the live cattle market.

We are interested in why these higher bids occur. We find that bids of firms from developing countries are higher {{in cases where the}} <b>transaction</b> <b>displays</b> “national pride ” characteristics, where national pride is identified through a manual examination of media articles. While other factors may also influence these higher bids, we find that the role of national pride is robust across a number of specifications and control variables.

40|$|This paper investigates {{preferences}} and choices in automated transaction dialogues. A transaction dialogue involves obligations of both parties: the system or supplier should present all relevant information; the user or customer is {{bound by a}} transaction, once it is confirmed. However, the transaction is conditional on the {{preferences and}} choices that were expressed in the dialogue. Confirmation of a transaction refers to the choices and preferences stated, much like anaphora and elliptic expressions refer back to previously mentioned objects and actions. The paper presents a model of transaction in dialogue, that is able to express relevance of information and to track preferences of users.

This research focuses on financial performance expressed as transaction market multiples of sales, EBITDA and net profit for the 2002 - 2009 period. The number of transactions declined much more in 2002 than in 2008 and 2009, but the value of <b>transactions</b> <b>displayed</b> the opposite trend. The 2008 - 2009 economic crisis impacted the valuation of food companies more than the 2002 crisis. Market multiples declined much more in 2009 than in 2002 and 2003. On average, transaction multiples are stable, even though their values on a given year are affected by economic cycles. The EV/EBITDA provides results with smaller spread than EV/ Sales and EV/net profit. The present research shows that valuations of dairy companies are quite close to the average valuations in the food business. But valuations of wines and spirits companies are a lot higher than other food business companies.

In part, this follows from satisfactory results of the first experiences in e-commerce of these users.

This presentation comprises the first stage of a research project focused on developing simulation models of e-commerce systems. On the basis of these models, different typical scenarios are tested. This paper introduces a general model for representing and simulating the components of the systems supporting electronic business transactions, using the DEVS (Discrete EVent System Specification) formalism. The model considers a network composed of 2 Web Servers, one servicing static page requests and the other dynamic pages (ASP, Perl, CGI, etc.).

Conducting such transactions under constrained interaction modalities as exemplified by small screen mobile device is a strenuous, fatigueinducing activity. But usually one needs to browse only a small fragment of a Web page to perform a transactional step (e. g. choosing an item from a search results list). We exploit this observation to develop an automata-based process model for online transactions that succinctly captures the transactional steps delivering only the “relevant” page fragments at each step. We realize this model by coupling techniques from content analysis of Web documents, automata learning and statistical classification. This process model and associated techniques have been incorporated into Guide-O-Mobile, a prototype system that facilitates online <b>transactions</b> with limited <b>display</b> size mobile device.

I show that there exists a unique price level sequence that is consistent with an equilibrium under interest rate policy, only if beginning-of-period money yields transaction services. Predetermined real money balances can then serve as a state variable, implying that interest rate setting must be passive - a violation of the Taylor-principle - for unique, stable, and non-oscillatory equilibrium sequences. On the contrary, when the end-of-period money stock facilitates <b>transactions,</b> the equilibrium <b>displays</b> nominal indeterminacy and equilibrium uniqueness requires an interest rate setting consistent with the Taylor-principle.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{adjustment cost}} for housing transactions affects a homeowner’s decision about when to move. It also affects her consumption of nondurables and her portfolio, at dates {{when a new}} house is purchased and over time intervals between moves. These decisions are studied using a calibrated dynamic model. For reasonable <b>transaction</b> costs, portfolios <b>display</b> substantial swings during intervals between moves and make large jumps when a new house is purchased. This suggests that a measure of housing wealth will be useful in empirical studies of portfolios at the micro level. The transaction cost has only a modest effect on nondurable consumption, however. Consequently, it can explain {{very little of the}} equity premium puzzle. These conclusions are robust to the value assumed for the elasticity of substitution between housing and nondurables, a parameter that over a broad range has a surprisingly weak impact on the consumer’s behavior...|$|R

Facey, an indication by the owner of property {{that he or she}} might be interested in selling at a certain price, for example, has been regarded as an {{invitation to}} treat. Similarly in Gibson v Manchester City Council the words [...] "may be prepared to sell" [...] were held to be a notification of price and therefore not a distinct offer, though in another case concerning the same change of policy (Manchester City Council underwent a change of political control and stopped the sale of council houses to their tenants) Storer v. Manchester City Council, the court held that an agreement was completed by the tenant's signing and returning the agreement to purchase, as the language of the agreement had been sufficiently explicit and the signature on behalf of the council a mere formality to be completed. Statements of invitation are only intended to solicit offers from people and are not intended to result in any immediate binding obligation. The courts have tended to take a consistent approach to the identification of invitations to treat, as compared with offer and acceptance, in common <b>transactions.</b> The <b>display</b> of goods for sale, whether in a shop window or on the shelves of a self-service store, is ordinarily treated as an invitation to treat and not an offer.|$|R
40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} This thesis {{examines}} the effect of investor sentiment driven misvaluation on the method of payment decisions in mergers and acquisitions. It aims to establish a link between empirical asset pricing studies on investor sentiment and corporate finance literature on misvaluation driven M&A theories by using a new investor sentiment based proxy for overvaluation of the bidder and the target. The first objective {{of this study is}} to test whether bidders and targets of M&A <b>transactions</b> <b>display</b> signs of overvaluation, measured with the new investor sentiment based overvaluation proxy when split into sub-groups by the method of payment. The second objective is to examine whether the new overvaluation proxy has an impact on the probability of a transaction being financed with equity (vs. cash) when controlling for factors impacting the method of payment decision from previous literature, such as growth and investment opportunities, asymmetric information, cash availability, intra-industry transaction, deal attitude, and target type, in a multivariate setting. Data and methodology The univariate (multivariate) data set consists of 14, 436 (10, 868) public bidder M&A announcements in the US during 1978 - 2011, is obtained from the SDC M&A database, and cleaned according to Pinkowitz et al. ’s (2011) data correction list as the authors report inconsistencies in the SDC method of payment data. New overvaluation proxy variable is constructed using a combination of the level and the change in investor sentiment index, as well as sentiment-betas building upon the work of Baker and Wurgler (2006, 2007, 2012) on investor sentiment. Univariate tests are used to examine the significance of the differences between the average overvaluation variables of bidders and targets in different method of payment groups (i. e. stock vs. cash). Also, the significance of differences between average overvaluation variables by various other takeover characteristics based sub-groups is tested for robustness. Finally, multivariate logistic regressions are conducted to investigate the effect of investor sentiment based overvaluation variable to the probability of a transaction being financed with equity (vs. cash) to control for other known factors affecting the method of payment decision. Findings {{of the study}} The results of my analyses provide strong support for the hypotheses and are in line with the main predictions of the misvaluation driven M&A theories of Shleifer and Vishny (2003), and Rhodes-Kropf and Viswanathan (2004) – stock-bidders display signs of significantly higher overvaluation in relative to cash-bidders, targets of transactions financed with equity display signs of significantly higher overvaluation in relative to targets of transactions financed with cash, and, in a multivariate setting, the higher the investor sentiment based overvaluation variable of the bidder, the higher the probability of the takeover being financed with equity. However, the most intriguing result of this study is that targets display signs of higher overvaluation in comparison to bidders which is contrary to the predictions of the misvaluation driven M&A theories and most of the existing empirical evidence. This result indicates towards bidder shareholders are failing to profit from such transactions given the relative misvaluation difference is unfavorable for them. In other words, bidders seem to use their overvalued equity to acquire relatively more overvalued targets...|$|R
40|$|Consumption {{forms and}} is {{formed by the}} city. How, when and where {{commodities}} are transacted is essential in this urban drama of mutual relationships. This thesis explores how consumption and everyday life in cities are interrelated. The specific objective is to analyse how commodity transaction situations are configured and constrained in time and space, and, how consumer service spaces are formed in and are part of city formation. Transactions are conceptualised as economically and socially situated material projects constituted by consumers, commodities and producers. Commodities and values are transferred and created through transaction spaces. The theoretical perspective is framed around consumption and production of spaces, and particularly informed by Hägerstrand’s time-geographical thinking and Lefebvre’s work on urban space. Methodologically different examples of consumption projects and spaces are used to discuss configurations and formations for commodity transactions. The thesis stresses material and time-spatial constraints for commodity transaction and it discusses the blurring of boundaries between what conventionally has been separate social and economic activities and places. Changing transaction configurations {{and the formation of}} consumer service spaces in the city are explored through analysis of different consumption places and commodities such as books, coffee and clothes and property development projects in Stockholm city centre. <b>Transaction</b> configurations <b>display</b> geographical and historical continuities and changes as well as time-spatial flexibility and spatial fixity.

40|$|This paper aims at {{understanding}} the processes explaining the protective effect of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) regarding occupational stress. The present study {{focuses on a}} widespread occupational stressor: emotional labour (EL). EL refers to the act of managing emotions and emotional expressions {{in order to be}} consistent with organizational 'display rules', defined as the organizationally required emotions during interpersonal service <b>transactions.</b> As these <b>display</b> rules interact with employees spontaneous feelings, they regularly induce a clash between inner/real and required feelings. Different strategies exist to cope with this dissonance, with either beneficial or deleterious outcomes regarding psychological and physical health. The hypothesis underlying this study was that individuals varying in the level of trait El would use different EL strategies, with different outcomes in terms of burnout and somatic complaints. Globally, the results showed that, when confronted with emotional labour, high trait El individuals experience lower levels of burnout and somatic complaints, and this effect was found to be mediated by the choice of emotional labour strategies. Implications of these results for research, theory and practice are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} (IT) extensively regulates organizational {{processes in}} contemporary organizations by allowing or preventing behaviors —either {{to the benefit}} or detriment of the organization. Yet regulatory processes that create, maintain, and enforce rules in IT-rich contexts have not been extensively analyzed in sociomaterial inquiries. We address this gap by conceptualizing and empirically exploring the interplay of rules and IT-based practices. We define a set of constitutive and enabling relationships between a rule, an IT artifact, and practice, and we narrate their relationships from the following perspectives: 1) how rules are materialized in IT artifacts, 2) how practices are interdependent on IT artifacts, and 3) how rules and practices are temporally coupled. To illustrate and analyze {{the nature of these}} relationships, we conduct a longitudinal study of the implementation of an e-learning system in a French public university. In particular, we examine how these relationships were constituted and how they evolved by probing regulatory episodes clustered into five modalities, which we label opportunity-, tool-, functionality-, role-and procedure-oriented modalities. These modalities exemplify specific regulation orientations toward germane features of either the IT artifact or the practice. Accordingly, regulatory episodes differ in terms of the application of the rule (to IT-and/or non-IT–related practices); the scope of the rule (all or part of IT or non-IT related practices); the source (exogenous or endogenous to the practice); and the dynamics and their impact on regulatory processes; they also differ in their form of agency. We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for sociomaterial theorizing and consequent policy implications for regulating contemporary organizations. In summer 2007, Jérôme Kerviel, a trader in the large French bank, Société Général (SG), was fired. He was accused of exposing SG to a massive financial risk resulting in a € 5 billion loss. Jérôme managed to conceal his excessive trading positions through clever violations and (mis) use of SG’s control procedures, most of which were information technology (IT) -based. Although the trading system imposed a maximum ceiling of € 125 million for trades, Kerviel succeeded in consistently leveraging positions in the order of € 600 million. At the same time, he concealed his real positions by “transferring” them to his computer, from which he either erased them or maintained them as fake positions. His practice involved a series of violations of regulations that governed trading in SG: theft of user names and passwords, faking of e-mails, and engaging in inverse operations, among others. By doing so, Kerviel “created” his own (more or less shared with his colleagues) regulated world of high risk-bearing operations. He also demonstrated how advanced IT-based control systems could be misused beyond their intended designs. In fall 2011 we learned that the SG incident is not an isolated phenomenon: Similar IT-based trading systems had also been circumvented by a UBS trader, generating thus far a € 1. 5 billion loss. The reason why SG and UBS stories are so interesting is the lesson they teach about rules and their sociomaterial foundations. In a world where money at hand is a sum of daily <b>transactions</b> <b>displayed</b> on a computer screen and the vault’s walls are a combination of access and authorization passwords, screen interfaces, and software-inscribed trading limits, a new understanding of the relationship between social and material is needed, of how rules become inscribed in their material foundations and how related practices are affected. The cases suggest caution about the effectiveness of rules in regulating practice: instantiating material constraints into IT does not necessarily result in social compliance. Adding more rules and controls inside the IT system is not automatically effective in shaping practices {{in the same way that}} concrete walls and armed guards shaped them. Crucially, students of regulation have known for some time that as more rules are introduced, which was the case at SG, actors can play more games that can result in more unexpected outcomes (Crozier and Friedberg 1977). Despite the pervasive presence and richness of contemporary IT-inscribed rules, we see a paucity of studies on IT use as a form of material-based organizational regulation and associated forms of control. We define IT-based regulation as the regulatory processes that create, combine, and embed rules within IT artifacts and by doing so maintain and enforce rules that, by constraining or enabling social behaviors, govern both the organizational use of IT artifacts and their organizational effects. Organizational studies on regulation have remained faithful to the notion of pure social regulation and have largely ignored its material elements — in particular, the growing presence of IT (Latour 1994, 2005; Orlikowski and Scott, 2008). A handful of studies has focused on the material dimension of regulation but engaged mainly with “pure” material elements of control, including walls, police, or asylums (Hook, 2001; Latour, 2005). Recent growing interest in material foundations of social life (Orlikowski and Scott 2008, Orlikowski 2008, Leonardi 2011) —labeled sociomateriality—has heeded on a high level the presence of rules and their scripting—their entanglement —in IT artifacts (Orlikowski 2005). But how rules emerge as scripts or how such materialized rules influence practices has remained clouded because the epicenter of sociomaterial debates has been the agent’s genius in overcoming materialized scripts in ways that harbor conflict or include illegitimate behavior (Markus and Silver 2008; Barley and Leonardi 2008). In this paper we address this gap by specifically theorizing about sociomaterial regulation that is carried out by embedding rules in IT artifacts. We address the following two questions: 1) What is the nature of IT-based regulations in organizations? We define IT-based regulation as a set of constitutive and enabling relationships between the rules, the IT artifacts, and organizational practices, which we operationalize using three characteristics of rules and their effect over time: 1) the application of a rule (as materialized in the IT artifacts); 2) the scope of a rule (the broad or narrow application to practices); and 3) the source of a rule (whether it is endogenous or exogenous to a practice). 2) How does the embedding of rules in IT artifacts and the related practices evolve through time? We ask whether a sociomaterial perspective can inform how rule creation and its relationship with materiality change over time and influence practices. We juxtapose the sources of rules with the ways in which rules and practices are coupled and identify conflicts between rules and their materialization over time, as informed by our case study...|$|R
