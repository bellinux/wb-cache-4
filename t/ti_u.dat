40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} of graded triangular algebras T of arbitrary dimension are studied in this paper. This is motivated {{in part for}} the important role that triangular algebras play {{in the study of}} oriented graphs, upper triangular matrix algebras or nest algebras. It is shown that T decomposes as T = <b>U</b> + (i∈I <b>Ti),</b> where <b>U</b> is an R-submodule contained in the 0 -homogeneous component and any Ti a well-described (graded) ideal satisfying TiTj = 0 if i 6 = j. Since any T is not simple as associative algebra, the concept of quasi-simple triangular algebra is introduced as those T which are as near to simplicity as possible. Under mild conditions, the quasi-simplicity of T is characterized and it is proven that T is the direct sum of quasi-simple graded triangular algebras which are also ideals...|$|R
