5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of 1999, Color Air transported 100,472 passengers. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> a cabin load of 35%, of which the Trondheim route had 40% and the Ålesund route 32%. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> the airline a deficit of NOK92 million. SAS lost NOK22 million, while Braathens had lost NOK300 million. In comparison, both Braathens and SAS Norway made a NOK320 million profit in {{the first quarter}} of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline {{continued}} to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> the English crowds their first chance to see {{what all the fuss}} was about. Ken Farnes, the Cambridge University fast bowler, also bowled it in the University Match, hitting a few Oxford batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Bogie {{stock was}} built by Ashbury in 1898 and by Cravens and at Neasden Works in 1900. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> a better ride quality, steam heating, {{automatic}} vacuum brakes, electric lighting and upholstered seating in all classes. The Bluebell Railway has four 1898–1900 Ashbury and Cravens carriages and a fifth, built at Neasden, is at the London Transport Museum.|$|E

5|$|Brugge's {{opposition}} in the semi-finals were German team Hamburg. The first leg, at Hamburg's home ground the Volksparkstadion, ended in a 1–1 draw. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> the advantage to Brugge, as they had an away goal. A 1–0 victory in the second leg in Belgium secured a 2–1 aggregate victory, which meant Brugge progressed to their first European final.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh was {{formally}} {{established as a}} royal burgh by King David I of Scotland around 1125. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> the town the privilege of holding a market, {{and the ability to}} raise money by taxing goods coming into the burgh for sale. It is probable, therefore, that some form of boundary was constructed around this time, although {{it may have been a}} timber palisade or ditch, rather than a stone wall.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the second}} Congress of FRELIMO was a {{propaganda}} {{victory for the}} insurgents, despite attempts by the Portuguese, who enjoyed air superiority throughout the conflict, to bomb {{the location of the}} meeting late in the day. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|In Week6, Johnson caught sixpasses for 166yards in an {{overtime}} {{victory over}} Chicago. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> the Lions their first {{victory of the}} season after an 05 start.

5|$|In his research, Chadwick {{continued}} {{to probe the}} nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At {{the time it was}} believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen's nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{began their}} UEFA Champions League {{campaign}} against Polish champions ŁKS Łódź in the qualifying round. Goals from Giggs and Cole {{in the home}} leg gave them a 2–0 win, and a goalless second leg ensured their qualification for the group stage. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> Łódź {{the distinction of being}} the only side to keep a clean sheet against the eventual champions as well as being the only opponents failing to score against them.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 2001, the UK {{signed a}} Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United States Department of Defense (DoD) for full {{participation}} in the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme, confirming the JSF as the FJCA. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> the UK input into aircraft design and the choice between the Lockheed Martin X-35 and Boeing X-32.

5|$|On June 24, Jake Peavy {{surrendered}} three earned runs in five innings, {{which caused}} his ERA {{to rise from}} 1.98 to 2.14. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> Young, who had a 2.08 ERA, the National League-leading average for one day. The next day, Brad Penny allowed only one earned run over eight innings {{to take the lead}} with a 2.04 ERA.|$|E
5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.|$|E
5|$|Over {{time the}} {{increased}} {{numbers of people}} gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish visitors who wanted easier access and more space, and the residents, who complained of the noise. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> rise to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall.|$|E

5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; <b>this</b> <b>gave</b> him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. As he did with the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes {{that he had made}} on previous visits.|$|E
5|$|Ten of {{the twenty}} A-4Gs were lost during the type's service with the RAN. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> the Skyhawk a poor safety record, {{but the high}} loss rate was at least {{partially}} attributable to the intrinsic dangers involved in operating from an aircraft carrier.

5|$|The Witham {{originally}} {{flowed into}} The Wash at Bicker Haven, where {{the port of}} Drayton {{was established in the}} Welland estuary, and it was only as a result of massive flooding in 1014 that it diverted itself to flow into The Haven at Boston. <b>This</b> <b>gave</b> rise to the growth of Boston as a port in the 12th and 13thcenturies, exporting wool and salt to the Hanseatic League, though Boston only received its charter in 1545.|$|E
