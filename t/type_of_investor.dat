5000|$|The second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> {{behavior}} {{concentrates on}} multiple equilibriums. It {{focuses on the}} investor's behavioral changes when the financial market can have multiple equilibrium changes. Thus, [...] "contagion occurs when a crisis in one financial market causes another financial market to move or jump to a bad equilibrium, characterized by a devaluation, a drop in asset prices, capital outflows, or debt default." [...] The third type of behavior is {{when there is a}} change in the international financial system, or in the rules of the game. It can make investors adjust their behaviors after a financial transaction occurs internationally or an initial crisis occurs. These behaviors can lead to spillover effect, causing contagion.|$|E
50|$|This {{continued}} {{accumulation of}} capital mostly accrued to a small capitalist elite that slowly acquired {{the characteristics of a}} rentier-class. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> was risk-averse and therefore preferred investment in liquid, financial assets like government bonds (foreign or domestic) over productive investments like shipping, mercantile inventory, industrial stock or agricultural land, like its ancestors had held. They literally had a vested interest in the funded public debt of the Dutch state, and as this elite was largely the same as the political elite (both Orangist and States Party) their political actions were often designed to protect that interest. Unlike in other nation states in financial difficulty, defaulting on the debt, or diluting its value by inflation, would be unthinkable; the Dutch state fought for its public credit to the bitter end. At the same time, anything that would threaten that credit was anathema to this elite. Hence the wish of the government to avoid policies that would threaten its ability to service the debt, and its extreme parsimony in public expenditures after 1713 (which probably had a negative Keynesian effect on the economy also).|$|E
5000|$|The first type of {{behavior}} is when [...] "investors take action that is ex-ante individually rational but lead to excessive co-movements excessive {{in the sense that}} they cannot be explained by real fundamentals." [...] It breaks down into two sub-categories, liquidity and incentive problems and information asymmetries and coordination problems. The first sub-category is liquidity and incentive problems. A reduction of equity prices can result in a loss of money for investors. [...] "These losses may induce investors to sell off securities in other markets to raise cash in anticipation of a higher frequency of redemptions." [...] These liquidity problems are also challenges for banks, specifically commercial banks.Incentive problems can also have the same effects as liquidity problems. For instance, the first signs of a crisis may cause investors to sell their holdings in some countries, resulting in equity and different asset markets in economies to decline in value. This causes the value of currencies in these economies to also decrease. The second sub-category is information asymmetries and coordination problems. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> behavior can either be considered rational or irrational. This sub-category is when one group, or country, has more or significantly better information compared to another group or country. This can cause a market failure problem, which could potentially cause a financial crisis.|$|E

40|$|Herding Behavior is the {{tendency}} of institutional or individual investors to behave similar. This behavior is irrational because investors do not depend their investment decisions on information available but follow the crowd. Distinguishing the causes of herding behavior is crucial for discovering whether herding leads to market inefficiency and financial bubbles. Herding may destabilize stock prices and thus impair the proper functioning of financial market. This study is analyzing the effect of size, trading volume activity, return and volatility to herding behavior in 2009 to 2014 period. Herding behavior will be measured based on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>investors</b> in Indonesian capital market. Then analysis {{of the effect of}} size, trading volume activity, return and volatility to herding behavior will be conducted using multinomial logistic regression method.

40|$|In {{standard}} portfolio theory, an investor’s only goal is {{to manage}} money. In this paper, {{not to say that}} this isn’t true for many investors, we consider, side-by-side with the standard investor, the existence of another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor.</b> The goal of this other <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor</b> is to build a suitable portfolio. This means that in addition to money, such an investor may wish to monitor his or her portfolio with regard to dividends, the maximum amount invested in any security, short selling, the number of securities involved, social responsibility characteristics, and so forth. To accommodate such an investor, we develop a multiple criteria portfolio selection formulation, corroborate its appropriateness by examining the sensitivity of the nondominated frontier to various factors, and observe the conversion of the nondominated frontier to a nondominated surface. Furthermore, multiple criteria enable us to provide an explanation as to why the “market portfolio, ” so often found deep below the nondominated frontier, is roughly where we would expect it to be. After commenting on approaches for searching nondominated surfaces, the paper concludes with the idea that what is the “modern portfolio theory ” of today might best be interpreted as a projection onto two-space of the real multiple criteria portfolio selection problem from higher dimensional space. 1...|$|E

The results strongly support the view that both FVC and CVC investments have a positive "treatment" effect on the growth of firms' employees and sales.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explores the}} dynamic relation between transaction activity and price appreciation {{in an effort}} to determine if the UK property market displays a return chasing behaviour or a price pressure effect. Using quarterly data from 2001 to 2013, this article explores a topic that has limited coverage for the private property market and it’s considered a relatively unexplored field among researchers. The dynamic is tested at an aggregate level, by property type and by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor.</b> Using a bivariate Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, this investigation uses two measures of transaction activity (flows and purchases) to test for the relation between these and returns. Results show that at an aggregate UK level, there is evidence of return chasing behaviour. This implies that returns are predictive of future flows. The result is consistent for the industrial, retail, and office property types for at least one measure of transaction activity. By <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>investor,</b> results show that there is a price pressure effect for overseas investors, and a return chasing behaviour for institutional investors, quoted property companies, private property companies, and occupiers. No evidence of any interaction was found for private individuals and financial institutions. Moreover, lagged returns were found to be economic and statistically significant in explaining subsequent returns, reinforcing the appraisal bias property data has.
