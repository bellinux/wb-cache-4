40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{separate}} and combined effects of transport disadvantage and social exclusion on well-being using an empirical {{analysis of data}} from a travel and disadvantage survey in Victoria, Australia. Previous research explores the impact of transport on social exclusion but does not study the downstream impacts on well-being. To explore this relationship measures of subjective well-being are compared across four groups: (i) people who are neither <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> nor socially excluded, (ii) <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> only, (iii) socially excluded only and (iv) both <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> and socially excluded. The paper explores which component aspects of social exclusion and transport disadvantage have {{the greatest impact on}} well-being and which social groups are most likely to face transport disadvantage and social exclusion together. The paper concludes with a commentary on how the findings might be used to better target policy interventions meant to improve well-being. Transport disadvantage Social exclusion Well-being...|$|E

40|$|Most {{individuals}} {{travel in}} order {{to participate in a}} network of activities which are important for attaining a good standard of living. Because such activities are commonly widely dispersed and not located locally, regular access to a vehicle is important to avoid exclusion. However, planning transport system provisions that can engage members of society in an acceptable degree of activity participation remains a great challenge. The main challenges in most cities of the world are due to significant population growth and rapid urbanisation which produces increased demand for transport. Keeping pace with these challenges in most urban areas is difficult due to the widening gap between supply and demand for transport systems which places the urban population at a transport disadvantage. The key element in mitigating the issue of urban transport disadvantage is to accurately identify the urban <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged.</b> Although wide-ranging variables and multi-dimensional methods have been used to identify this group, variables are commonly selected using ad-hoc techniques and unsound methods. This poses questions of whether the current variables used are accurately linked with urban transport disadvantage, and the effectiveness of the current policies. To fill these gaps, the research conducted for this thesis develops an operational urban transport disadvantage framework (UTDAF) based on key statistical urban transport disadvantage variables to accurately identify the urban <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged.</b> The thesis develops a methodology based on qualitative and quantitative statistical approaches to develop an urban transport disadvantage framework designed to accurately identify urban transport disadvantage. The reliability and the applicability of the methodology developed is the prime concern rather than the accuracy of the estimations. Relevant concepts that impact on urban transport disadvantage identification and measurement and a wide range of urban transport disadvantage variables were identified through a review of the existing literature. Based on the reviews, a conceptual urban transport disadvantage framework was developed based on the causal theory. Variables identified during the literature review were selected and consolidated based on the recommendations of international and local experts during the Delphi study. Following the literature review, the conceptual urban transport disadvantage framework was statistically assessed to identify key variables. Using the statistical outputs, the key variables were weighted and aggregated to form the UTDAF. Before the variable's weights were finalised, they were adjusted based on results of correlation analysis between elements forming the framework to improve the framework's accuracy. The UTDAF was then applied to three contextual conditions to determine the framework's effectiveness in identifying urban transport disadvantage. The development of the framework {{is likely to be a}} robust application measure for policy makers to justify infrastructure investments and to generate awareness about the issue of urban transport disadvantage...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{transport}} disadvantage is outspread phenomenon. It {{can influence}} people's needs and opportunities. Young people are considered <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> {{part of the}} society. Secondary school students are young people with a great need for mobility but still, their mobility is also limited. Their dependence on {{other people in the}} aspect of transportation and public transportation greatly influence their everyday lives. Important segment of young people's lives are extracurricular activities. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the impact of transport disadvantage on extracurricular activities of secondary school students of the City of Zagreb. Particular emphasis is on the difficulties in accessibility of extracurricular activities and how transport influences these activities. Research was conducted using quantitative and qualitative methods. The data were obtained through questionnaire survey of 826 secondary school students of secondary schools of the City of Zagreb. In order to deepen the research, interviews were performed through eight focus groups. Data analysis revealed that almost half of secondary school students involved in extracurricular activities expressed the attitude of having difficulties with accessibility of extracurricular activities and that over half of secondary school students involved in extracurricular activities responded that transport had impact on these activities. Significant correlations between the attitude of problem existence with accessibility of extracurricular activities and travel time needed to reach them, as well as between travel time to extracurricular activities and attitudes on the impact of transport on these activities were found. The existence of students not able to participate in extracurricular activities because of transportation was determined.

40|$|Residents of socioeconomically {{disadvantaged}} neighbourhoods {{are more}} likely to walk for transport than their counterparts in advantaged neighbourhoods; however, the reasons for higher rates of transport walking in poorer neighbourhoods remain unclear. We investigated this issue using data from the HABITAT study of physical activity among 11, 037 mid-aged residents of 200 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia. Using a five-step mediation analysis and multilevel regression, we found that higher levels of walking for <b>transport</b> in <b>disadvantaged</b> neighbourhoods was associated with living in a built environment more conducive to walking (i. e. greater street connectivity and land use mix) and residents of these neighbourhoods having more limited access to a motor vehicle.

40|$|Introduction Equity, {{diversity}} and competition, which together form a ‘holy trinity’ of effective educational provision {{in schools and}} universities, {{are closely related to}} each other and to our notion of social justice. They also form the basis for educational choice as the preferred lever for systemic improvement in developed economies; the theory being that more choice leads to greater competition, increased diversity in the marketplace and ultimately to greater equity in terms of student attainment and social mobility. Choice in education effectively devolves responsibility for attainment and social mobility from the state to the parent-consumer, and the facility for parents to choose their schools and colleges free from government involvement is increasing in popularity, as evidenced by the growing number of Charter Schools in the US and Academies in the UK and the emergence of privately owned, publicly funded universities. The traditional social democratic imperative is that good publicly funded education for all is necessary for social mobility even if that sometimes means whole-scale restructuring, but there are also neo-liberal imperatives at work supporting the same direction of travel. The latter view is that parents have the moral right to use their resources to benefit their own children and that this should be facilitated by the state even if it reinforces existing social hierarchies. Parents acting in the best interest of their own children generate competition for both schools and universities, which is why choice is fundamental to the new (neo-liberal) right and tolerated by the new (social democratic) left: poor schools are shut down, which is the intention, and informed parents transfer their children to better schools. Parents familiar with the education system and in possession of ‘hot’ information derived from their social networks, discussed in Chapter 9, have the ability to seek out effective schools and universities, whereas disadvantaged parents rarely have the right information at the right time to enable them to make the best choices. Affluent and better-educated parents are also more selective about the schools and universities they choose, especially when governments fail to extend choice programmes to include the independent and faith sectors or provide the necessary <b>transport</b> assistance to <b>disadvantaged</b> students to increase participation rates in these sectors, and they are more involved in governorship and school committees of one sort or another. Although these bureaucratic involvements can sometimes be more symbolic than influential, as Chapter 3 illustrates, they are social markers for creating networks of like-minded parents who rally to the same flag to the exclusion of those who have inferior levels of social capital or who have different sets of beliefs. For example, in the US and elsewhere, where faith schools outperform public schools, school choice has become a battleground for the wider struggle between religion and secularism in society. There is the widespread perception among religious-minded parents that the values taught in public schools are not just intolerant of religion, but are anti-religious, which then becomes exacerbated by the fact that parents committed to their religious beliefs abandon the public school system in large numbers for independent or home schooling, leaving an irreligious remnant behind to justify the original allegation of bias (Kelly 2009 a). Of course, the exercise of choice does not flow automatically from the existence of choice, and since choice in education is driven by the value placed on freedom, rather than by concerns for equity or the needs of local communities, pressure has been put on parents to take responsibility for exercising it wisely. Choice is about passing responsibility and the risk of failure to the consumer, and what differentiates the professional classes from other groups in this respect is that they are at heart more risk-friendly even if they are also more apprehensive because they depend on education to maintain their favourable social trajectory. Families from lower socio-economic groupings tend to be more fatalistic about choice and tend not to spend time using their social capital to manage risk on behalf of their children. Independent fee-paying schools exist and function in response to this risk management (Kelly, 2009 a) because school choice is as much about who else chooses a school as the school one chooses oneself. Fee-paying schools minimise the risk of the same school being chosen by those who might lessen the benefit, and they provide boundaries that prevent the kind of mixing that dilutes middle-class aspiration and work ethic. The riskier society is perceived to be, the more those who can afford it turn to fee-paying schools, but this carries with it conflicting feelings of guilt: for choosing private schooling when not everyone can afford it or for not choosing private schooling and failing to provide for one’s children to the best of one’s ability. The commodification and marketisation of education has increased the risks associated with educational choice and the consequences of being wrong. Most educational choice markets are quasi-markets rather than true markets. Some policies like university league tables (considered in detail in Chapter 2 and Chapter 7) and the schools awards market (considered in detail in Chapter 5) aim to stimulate competition, while other policies like schemes to encourage research partnerships (considered in Chapter 6) aim to encourage cooperation, but overall, these markets are driven and regulated by global rather than national forces. The belief that society has entered a new post-capitalist phase is widely accepted by policy-makers, providing a political foundation for new explicit partnerships between the state and agents of the free market (Kelly, 2009 a), and indeed the nature of states themselves has changed to more ‘agentic’ versions of their old selves. A market state perceives its role as providing opportunity for the most dynamic of its citizens to generate prosperity for everyone, but social mobility has not increased with the popularity of this political philosophy. Instead, a new under-class seems to have replaced the old working-class, and governments have shifted their allegiance from the principle of choice between private and public provision to privatised public provision wherein their role – the role of the ‘partnership state’ - is to guarantee access to basic public services but not to provide them. This in turn has enabled policy-makers to drive education using economic imperatives and to devolve liability for ineffective outcomes to parents and students, while simultaneous global pressures have restricted the ability of governments to intervene in the market on behalf of their citizens. Critics and supporters posit it differently of course: the former suggest that globalisation has usurped the authority of democratic governments to act in the interests of their citizens; the latter suggest that globalisation has forced governments to act with proper discipline by not interfering with the market and that only a free market can guarantee prosperity in the long-term (Kelly 2009 a). Agentic statehood subordinates the will of the individual to the will of government and in regarding people as economic entities it supports and legitimises capitalism while trying to maintain social cohesion. They embrace the relationship between education, economic prosperity and equity, the metrics for which are discussed at length in Chapter 4. They accept the burden of neutralising the effects of factors that impact on educational attainment - Chapter 8 discusses measuring {{diversity and}} Chapter 9 considers the birth-order effect – but there is a paradox at the heart of these neo-liberal imperatives; namely, that the state must occasionally deal with its own failure and be forced into intervention in the marketplace in contradiction of its basic tenet. In the UK, the Conservative governments of the 1980 s were the first to adopt marketising neo-liberal educational initiatives, cutting expenditure on universities and allowing parents greater choice in schooling. Later, the 1988 Education Act, which created the first quasi-market in education, allowed schools to switch to direct funding from central government rather than remain within their local authority, gave parents freedom to select schools and schools the freedom to select students, and encouraged competition and accountability by publishing league tables of examination results. When New Labour was elected to government in 1997 after nearly two decades of conservative rule, its education policies differed little from those of its predecessors. It retained the previous emphasis on accountability, standards and centralisation, and introduced more testing, greater intrusion into teaching methods and yet more league tables for schools and universities (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 7). The reliance of New Labour on a technicist form of conservatism – it introduced an extraordinary array of ‘technical’ initiatives in education, health, law and other public services - led to greater private finance involvement in the building of new public schools, the privatisation of existing schools, and support for privately owned, publicly funded universities. And like its Conservative predecessor, New Labour presented the welfare state as inefficient and a threat to entrepreneurship, which then enabled it to transfer public agencies whole-scale to the commercial sector. It would be wrong to assume that all this has occurred without opposition. The social democratic, anti-neoliberal case has been made, if infrequently and sometimes inconsistently, that democracy flourishes better in a society where education is regarded as something provided for the common good and the state has the dominant role in its provision.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} {{about the relationship between}} transport disadvantage and activity space size is limited to urban areas, and as a result, very little is known about this link in a rural context. In addition, although research has identified <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> groups based on their size of activity space, these studies have, however, not empirically explained such differences and the result is often a poor identification of the problems facing disadvantaged groups. Research has shown that transport disadvantage varies over time. The static nature of analysis using the activity space concept in previous research studies has lacked the ability to identify transport disadvantage in time. Activity space is a dynamic concept; and therefore possesses a great potential in capturing temporal variations in behaviour and access opportunities. This research derives measures of the size and fullness of activity spaces for 157 individuals for weekdays, weekends, and for a week using weekly activity-travel diary data from three case study areas located in rural Northern Ireland. Four focus groups were also conducted in order to triangulate quantitative findings and to explain the differences between different socio-spatial groups. The findings of this research show that despite having a smaller sized activity space, individuals were not disadvantaged because they were able to access their required activities locally. Car-ownership was found to be an important life line in rural areas. Temporal disaggregation of the data reveals that this is true only on weekends {{due to a lack of}} public transport services. In addition, despite activity spaces being at a similar size, the fullness of activity spaces of low-income individuals was found to be significantly lower compared to their high-income counterparts. Focus group data shows that financial constraint, poor connections both between public transport services and between transport routes and opportunities forced individuals to participate in activities located along the main transport corridors...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines unequal {{outcomes of}} urban transportation {{policies in the}} neoliberal era. It focuses on inequalities in the Portland, Oregon metro area between 1994 and 2011 as measured in three key areas: 1) access to public transit; 2) the journey-to-work; and 3) 2 ̆ 2 household-serving 2 ̆ 2 trips. Growing concern over the harmful impacts from an increasing dependence on cars has led planners in the U. S. to encourage a modal shift from private car to public transit, bicycling, and walking. The required policies to make this modal shift possible, however, might inadvertently be benefiting 2 ̆ 2 choice 2 ̆ 2 riders {{at the cost of}} <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> groups. Other contributing factors to this unequal benefit appear to be the suburbanization of poverty, an ongoing gentrification of central areas, and market forces that make it difficult for low income groups to afford housing in transit-rich neighborhoods. The Oregon Household Activity and Travel surveys are used to answer the three major research questions in this dissertation: what has been the effect of neoliberalism on access to public transit?, how do gender, race/ethnicity, and income inequality affect the journey-to-work in Portland?, and how do household-serving trips vary by gender in Portland?. Six hypothesis are tested in answering these questions. Those related to access to transit draw on Fred Block 2 ̆ 7 s theory of the capitalist state and the 2 ̆ 2 urban growth machine 2 ̆ 2 concept, both of which predict spatially unequal outcomes from neoliberal ideology. Hypotheses about the journey to work draw on a rich body of literature around social relations in the household and the job market, as well as residential location. The final question, about household-serving trips, draws on theories of gender socialization. Findings showed that: (i) individuals in the Portland metro area had less access overall to bus public transit in 2011 than in 1994; (ii) impoverished dependent riders have lost access to transit service over time, whereas choice dependent riders increased their access to public transit; (iii) low income groups have been 2 ̆ 2 forced 2 ̆ 2 into greater car-ownership, in part due to the lower access to public transit; (iv) women in Portland have shorter journey-to-work trips than men; (v) Blacks have longer journey-to-work trips than Whites and Latinos; (vi) low-income individuals have shorter journey-to-work trips than higher income individuals; and (vii) women with children make more household-serving trips than men in similar family structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of transport related social exclusion {{is a key}} goal of transport policy in rural Northern Ireland although very little is known to date {{about the extent of}} this phenomenon in the region. This research identifies different drawbacks associated with the processes leading to transport disadvantage, patterns of transport disadvantage in space and time, and the consequences of being <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> in rural Northern Ireland. Spatial analyses were conducted to select three case study areas (Moira, Saintfield, and Doagh) using criteria derived from the literature. The criteria are related to the differential levels of area accessibility and area mobility which are known to influence travel behaviour. 4 focus groups, 458 questionnaires, and 157 weekly activity-travel diary data were collected from individuals living in the selected case study areas and were analysed in this research. Transport disadvantage is a function of a lack of transport and a lack of opportunities (land uses). Using d ata from the focus groups, a number of barriers associated with accessing transport and/or land use systems were identified in a qualitative way – an evaluation of the processes leading to transport disadvantage. On the other hand, individuals activity-travel behaviour patterns were visualised in a GIS environment using data from the questionnaires and activity-travel diaries. A model was developed and run using the ArcGIS ModelBuilder tool to derive scores associated with individual levels of mobility, accessibility, and participation in activities based on the concept of activity spaces for weekdays, weekends, and in a week. These indicators, therefore, measured the performance (outcome) of the processes of transport disadvantage in a quantitative way. However, the weaknesses associated with the traditional mobility, accessibility and participation based measures were identified using criteria derived from the literature and were addressed in this research through the incorporation of: socio-economic and spatio-temporal disaggregation; spatial relativity of the measures; interactions between different explanatory factors; and the partial contributions of different dimensional indicators (e. g. count, type, frequency, and duration of participation) used to measure participation through the development of a composite participation index (PI) measure. This research found that the process based and outcome based measures are complementary and can be used to triangulate the findings from each measure. Also that the spatial relativity and non-relativity concepts are complementary to each other and that the interactions between different explanatory factors generated new patterns of transport disadvantage. These patterns of transport disadvantage were found to vary in space and time and the transport needs of different disadvantaged groups were found to be different. Based on the study findings and a review of existing policies, this research highlights the imperative of policy responses that are tailored to particular sets of circumstances in different areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{story of}} {{transport}} and accessibility problems in rural Australia {{is very similar}} to other wealthy countries with low rural densities and long distances such as the US and Canada &# 150; little or no public transport, very high levels of car ownership, and poor service provision. During the past two decades rationalisation and privatisation of services has led to the closure of many basic services in rural Australia. The withdrawal of services has necessitated longer distance travel for many rural residents &# 150; a problem which has been exacerbated by the rationalisation of public transport services. As a result there have emerged severe accessibility and mobility problems in rural areas, despite the presence of high levels of car ownership in such areas. In terms of rural transportation, the situation in Australia is characterised by two different features; first, poor public transport provision (or non-existence). Second; high levels of car ownership among rural residents. However, high levels of car ownership do not reflect high levels of prosperity; this is likely to indicate a situation of 'enforced ownership' in response to declining levels of public transport provision. Furthermore, many rural residents neither own a car nor have access to a reliable public transport system due to socio-economic and location-based circumstances. Previous research has shown that these residents generally belong to groups who include the elderly, teenagers, students, Indigenous residents, unemployed persons and low-income households. Such groups have been termed transport-disadvantaged. The contention of this thesis, however, is that such groups {{are in a state of}} transport need given their range of transport related problems. This is one dimension of the accessibility problem in rural Australia, which has yet to be investigated. This thesis is concerned with the measurement of transport need through the development of several transport need indices using available census data. The key objective of this thesis is to investigate the relevance and suitability of need indices for identifying the relative spatial distribution of transport needs in rural areas. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is used for the development, analysis and visualisation of the transport need index. This thesis examines transportation needs in rural NSW simply by measuring 'demand' and 'supply' components of transport. To measure the demand index, some socio-economic characteristics of population are involved including: the elderly, no or low car owning households, Indigenous people, students, children, unemployed persons, low-income households, and accessibility. A weight has been assigned to each component based on its relative importance among the other components. Weighted values are then standardised based on 100. To measure the supply index, six components, which represent the availability of various kinds of transport in rural NSW are involved and have been calculated by assigning weights and standardising to 100. These are: CountryLink rail services, CountryLink coach and bus services, Regional Services, Community Transport Program, Wheelchair taxi services, and School Buses. The final transport need for rural NSW is calculated by dividing demand index by supply index. It simply quantifies transportation needs across the rural Statistical Local Areas (SLAs) of NSW. In addition, this thesis discusses the potential and limitations of GIS and our transport need indices to be used as input to decisions about improvements in provision of services, and coordination of existing services to better meet identified needs, for the <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> in rural NSW. In essence, this thesis is an attempt to make Australian transport and social services planners aware of the value of a need based transport-planning methodology...|$|E
40|$|This 2007 {{research}} {{aimed to}} document the transport experiences, and suggested improvements to the transport system, for one potentially <b>transport</b> <b>disadvantaged</b> group – young mothers and their children. Focus group interviews and surveys were conducted with 45 young mums from around Melbourne, Albury-Wodonga and Whittington, Geelong. When we asked young mums {{what it is like}} to get around they typically responded ‘horrible’ and ‘hard’. Transport difficulties create significant barriers to accessing services, social networks and community participation for young mums and their children. Participants in this study reported a much lower car ownership rate than the wider community – 50 per cent did not have a car, compared to 12 per cent of all Victorian adults. In addition, one in three of those who did have a car had only limited access to it. This resulted in 67 per cent of participants being largely dependent on public transport, taxis and lifts to meet their transport needs. Those reliant on public transport reported very high rates of difficulty accessing services and social networks: 74 per cent had difficulty getting to social activities; 70 per cent had difficulty visiting family and friends; 56 per cent had difficulty getting to medical appointments; 30 per cent had difficulty getting to their local shop and the supermarket; 30 per cent had difficulty getting to work or study and Centrelink; and 26 per cent had difficulty getting to a play group or activities for their kids. The most significant transport issues identified by study participants related to the physical inaccessibility of the public transport system. The barriers presented by inaccessible vehicles were exacerbated in many cases by policies in some areas requiring parents to fold prams before entering the bus, and by bus drivers failing to provide assistance. These issues in particular were the cause of a great deal of distress, and in some cases, decisions not to use bus services at all. Given the heavy reliance on buses for public transport service delivery to most of Melbourne, as well as rural and regional areas, these are important issues to be addressed. They need to make it better…not just for mums, but for everyone… so you can walk on and off easily… pram on, pram off, wheelchair on, wheelchair off, people on, people off. (Yarraville) Other significant transport issues raised by participants included the lack of child restraints in taxis, inability to travel on weekends due to limited public transport operating hours, poor quality toilet facilities and limited ‘baby’ parking at important destinations.   This report recommends: 1. that the needs of carers with young children be considered as part of accessible transport planning, including the design of public transport vehicles, buildings and facilities; 2. increased funding for accessible transport infrastructure being prioritised to areas of high need, including areas with high numbers of young children; 3. continued expansion of public transport hours of operation and service frequencies on weekends and in the evenings; 4. development of policies to increase the usability of transport services for carers of young children including: a. designation and publication of when  accessible bus and tram services are  timetabled; b. removal of bus operating policies that  require prams to be folded; c. more assistance from drivers to assist  women with prams or small children  to board vehicles – including to fold prams where required; and d. more involvement of drivers in ensuring that pregnant women and  women holding young children have  access to priority seating. 5. investigation of options for carrying child restraints in the taxi fleet, including the mandated carrying of child restraints by a guaranteed percentage of the taxi fleet and the development of incentive schemes and driver education to facilitate the safe use of child restraints; 6. new planning guidelines for toilet facilities at stations and on long distance trains to accommodate the needs of mums travelling alone with young children, including space for prams and places to safely seat young children; and 7. increased provision of wider ‘baby’ car spaces at key destinations such as shopping centres...|$|E
