5|$|Before 1856 {{there was}} minimal {{discussion}} of statehood within Minnesota. However, as {{discussion of a}} potential transcontinental railroad in the U.S. became serious, leaders in Minnesota recognized that a territory was in a weak position <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> this economic opportunity.|$|E
5|$|Currently most of {{the swell}} is {{administered}} by the BLM and is not given special consideration. A small portion on the eastern edge is protected as Goblin Valley State Park, administered by the Utah Division of Parks and Recreation. Today the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance continues <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> protection.|$|E
5|$|An {{influential}} group {{assembled in}} Britain <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> {{his release from}} prison. Headed by Lord Hankey, the group included politicians Lord de L'Isle and Richard Stokes, Field Marshal Alexander and Admiral of the Fleet The Earl of Cork and Orrery, and military historians Basil Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller. Upon re-gaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who was {{closely associated with the}} group, gave priority to the quick release of the war criminals remaining in British custody.|$|E

50|$|A Republican, he won {{a special}} {{election}} on January 26, 2010, succeeding Senator Dick Day, who resigned on January 8, 2010, to head Racino Now, an organization dedicating <b>to</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> slots at the state's two horse-racing tracks. He was subsequently elected to a full term in the 2010 general election.|$|R
5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and would almost certainly have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The Highway70 {{designation}} {{was first}} used along the Heenan Highway, connecting the Rainy River region to Kenora to provide the first Canadian road link to an area previously accessible only from the United States. In 1922, Kenora MPP Peter Heenan and Dr. McTaggart approached the government <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> construction of a road between Nestor Falls and Kenora. Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area. Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in Mitch Hepburn's cabinet.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} regarding Manahi's VC recommendation {{during the}} Battle of Takrouna still rankled with {{many members of}} the Māori Battalion but while he was alive, Manahi's modesty and unwillingness to bring any attention to himself meant that he was not interested in changing the situation. Following his death, the Manahi VC Committee was established by his former comrades and iwi <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> an upgrade to his award.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Bolack co-chaired a {{bipartisan}} group that aimed to reform New Mexico's election legislation, {{after the state}} was included {{on a list of}} several states with unfair elections. In addition <b>to</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> reform, the group offered $1,000 to anyone providing information leading to the arrest of an election-law violator.|$|R

50|$|In 1933 Poletti was {{appointed}} {{on the recommendation}} of Felix Frankfurter to be counsel to Governor Herbert H. Lehman. Lehman relied heavily on Poletti, asking him to move into the executive mansion, and assigning him tasks from drafting legislation and speeches <b>to</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> passage of New Deal measures advocated by the administration of President Franklin Roosevelt.|$|R
5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award {{as a gesture of}} political rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Lawrence Johnson, {{a member}} of Waco's city council, viewed {{pictures}} of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum, and began <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> {{a monument to the}} lynching. In 2002, Lester Gibson, another member of the city council, proposed that a plaque be installed at the courthouse where Washington was lynched. He further stated that the plaque should carry an apology from the city. The ideas were discussed, but proved unfruitful. In the 2000s, the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support of a historical marker {{on the site of the}} lynching. Some descendants of Fryer objected to the proposed memorial.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E

5|$|Soegijapranata {{was unable}} to prevent Japanese torture of prisoners of war, {{including}} the clergy, but was himself well-treated by the Japanese forces; he was often invited to Japanese ceremonies, but never attended, sending bouquets in his stead. He used this position of respect <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> fair treatment of those interned. He successfully petitioned the Japanese overlords to exempt nuns from the paramilitary draft {{and allow them to}} work at hospitals. He and the Catholic populace also gathered food and other supplies for interned clergy, and Soegijapranata kept in contact with the prisoners, supplying and receiving news, such as recent deaths, and other information.|$|E
5|$|Students are {{involved}} in the community, and PHC requires its Government students to fulfill up to 24 credits of apprenticeship projects, which include internships, research and writing projects, and extracurricular activities such as moot court, Model United Nations, and Mock Trial. Students currently serve as interns {{in a wide variety of}} political organizations, such as congressional offices and think-tanks. Students are active in local and national politics, and members of the Patrick Henry College Republicans chapter often work with local political action groups <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> conservative issues at the federal and state levels. Classes are canceled the day of the national elections and the day before, so that students may volunteer on political campaigns; and many students act as Student Action Team leaders for Generation Joshua, leading groups of usually homeschooled high school students volunteering on campaigns across the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Cycle Center {{includes}} parking {{for up to}} 300bikes, lockers, an Internet station, a cafe, bike rentals, bike {{repair and}} private stall showers. During business hours, the facility has 100spaces set aside for first-come, first-served usage, but after hours the facility is limited to dues-paying members. In addition to the riders, the Chicago Police Lakefront Bicycle Patrol Unit is stationed at the Cycle Center. As the city's high-profile bicycle parking facility, it {{has served as a}} demonstration location for efforts <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> further bicycle accommodations for the Active Transportation Alliance, League of Illinois Bicyclists, and Illinois Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{say that}} {{southern}} {{sections of the}} scheme are more viable than those closer to Sligo. The idea of a greenway on any parts of the route, which may become surplus if a railway order process was undertaken, was suggested by Minister Eamon O'Cuiv at a West on Track conference in May 2009 in response <b>to</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> this idea from Enniscrone resident Brendan Quinn and his colleague John Mulligan.|$|R
25|$|In 1914, the Kelloggs {{moved to}} Washington, D.C., to devote {{themselves}} <b>to</b> <b>lobbying</b> <b>for</b> better Indian legislation. During her career, Kellogg became involved {{not only in}} the affairs of the Oneidas and Six Nations, but also those of the Blackfeet, Brothertown, Cherokee, Crow, Delaware, Huron, Osage and Stockbridge Indians. Her crusade and relentless agitation led to trouble with the law and arrests in Oklahoma in 1913 and Colorado in 1916.|$|R

5|$|The {{campaign}} group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways held {{a celebration}} in 2009 {{to mark the}} increase in passenger numbers. They were joined by pupils from Parson Street Primary School who had provided artwork to brighten up the station. This was done {{as part of the}} Severnside Schools Community Stations Programme, organised by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership. The Severnside CRP also installed plant displays in 2008, and in 2011 distributed leaflets advertising train services to local residents, in association with Bristol City Council and Passenger Focus. In January 2017 a group called Friends of Parson Street Railway Station was formed <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> improvements to facilities and services at the station.|$|E
5|$|The company Sotrasambandet AS {{has been}} {{established}} <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> and potentially debt-finance the construction, which potentially could include other parts of National Roads 555 and 561. In 2008, the company estimated {{that it might be}} possible to start construction in 2013, and complete the project by 2016. On 21 April 2009, State Secretary Geir Pollestad stated that the government would support a bridge, but did not indicate if a two-lane or four-lane solution would be chosen. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has recommended a four-lane bridge, while the Institute of Transport Economics has recommended the two-lane bridge. It is largely up to the city councils of Bergen and Fjell to determine which of the bridge alternatives will be chosen.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} attempts by netball supporters {{to get the}} sport played in the Summer Olympics. In 1996, the netball leadership actively pursued the possibility of netball being played at the 2000 Summer Olympics. The government of New South Wales encouraged the Australian Olympic Committee <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> the inclusion of netball in the 2008 Beijing Olympic games. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Netball England national team member Tamsin Greenway, two time Olympic gold medallist Kelly Holmes and Olympic heptathlon competitor Denise Lewis are English supporters {{who would like to}} see netball in future Olympic games. The earliest the sport could be included on the programme would be 2024.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{selection}} for the Gator Bowl {{was not without}} controversy. The Hokies' three Big East losses pushed them to third place in the conference, behind Miami (which earned an automatic bid to the national championship game) and Syracuse, which lost only one Big East Conference game. Instead of attending the Gator Bowl, Syracuse earned a bid to the 2002 Insight Bowl, {{considered to be a}} less prestigious game due to its lesser payout and shorter history. Syracuse fans, coaches, and players were offended that Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the Gator Bowl despite Syracuse's better record due to Tech's reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games. In the wake of Tech's selection, Syracuse athletic director Jake Crouthamel vowed <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> changes in the way the Gator Bowl's Big East selection was made.|$|E
5|$|Wiesenthal was {{nominated}} for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, the fortieth anniversary {{of the end of}} the war. Rumour had it that the Nobel Committee would give the prize to a Holocaust-related candidate. Fellow Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel, also nominated, began a campaign in hopes of winning the prize, travelling to France, Ethiopia and Oslo for speaking tours and humanitarian work. Rabbi Hier of the Wiesenthal Center urged Wiesenthal <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> the prize as well, but other than delivering a lecture in Oslo, Wiesenthal did little to promote his candidacy. When Wiesel was awarded the 1986 prize, Wiesenthal claimed the World Jewish Congress must have influenced the Committee's decision, a claim the WJC denied. Biographer Tom Segev speculates that the loss may have been because of the negative publicity over the Waldheim affair.|$|E
5|$|A {{legacy of}} the Manhattan Project was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area <b>to</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>for</b> their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the Manhattan Project still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the Manhattan Project, that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
