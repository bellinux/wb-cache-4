We examined chemical variability over a range of <b>test</b> <b>sizes</b> for two surface-dwelling foraminifers (Globigerinoides sacculifer and Globigerinoides ruber). Measurements of d 11 B in G. ruber show no significant relationship with <b>test</b> <b>size</b> in either Atlantic or Pacific sites and appear to provide a robust proxy of surface seawater pH. Likewise {{there is no significant}} variability in the d 11 B of our Atlantic core top G. sacculifer, but we find that d 11 B increases with increasing <b>test</b> <b>size</b> for G. sacculifer in the Pacific. These systematic differences in d 11 B are inferred to be a consequence of isotopically light gametogenic calcite in G. sacculifer and its preferential preservation during postdepositional dissolution. The trace element ratio proxies of ocean carbonate equilibria, U/Ca and B/Ca, show systematic increases in both G. ruber and G. sacculifer with increasing <b>test</b> <b>size,</b> possibly as a result of changing growth rates. This behavior complicates their use in paleoceanographic reconstructions. In keeping with several previous studies we find that Mg/Ca ratios increase with increasing size fraction in our wellpreserved Atlantic G. sacculifer but not in G. ruber. In contrast to previous interpretations we suggest that these observations reflect a proportionally larger influence of compositionally distinct gametogenic calcite in small individuals compared to larger ones. As with d 11 B this influences G. sacculifer but not G. ruber, which has negligible gametogenic calcite...|$|R

Surprisingly, we {{know very little about}} whether “Bergmann size clines” are due to a genetic response or are a consequence of phenotypic plasticity. Here, we use data on body size (mass and tarsus length) from three long-term (1979 – 2008) study populations of great tits (Parus major) that experienced a temperature increase to examine mechanisms behind Bergmann’s rule. We show that adult body mass decreased over the study period in all populations and that tarsus length increased in one population. Both body mass and tarsus length were heritable and under weak positive directional selection, predicting an increase, rather than a decrease, in body mass. There was no support for microevolutionary change, and thus the observed declines in body mass were likely a result of phenotypic plasticity. Interestingly, this plasticity was not in direct response to temperature changes but seemed to be due to changes in prey dynamics. Our results caution against interpreting recent phenotypic body size declines as adaptive evolutionary responses to temperature changes and highlight the importance of considering alternative environmental factors when <b>testing</b> <b>size</b> clines. ...|$|E
40|$|Plant size {{is a major}} {{predictor}} of ecological functioning. We tested the hypothesis that feeding damage to plants increases with plant size, as the conspicuousness of large plants makes resource finding and colonisation easier. Further, large plants can be attractive to herbivores, as they offer greater amounts and ranges of resources and niches, but direct evidence from experiments <b>testing</b> <b>size</b> effects on feeding damage and consequently on plant fitness is so far missing. We established a common garden experiment with a plant size gradient (10 - 130 cm height) using 21 annual Brassicaceae species, and quantified plant size, biomass and number of all aboveground components (flowers, fruits, leaves, stems) and their proportional feeding damage. Plant reproductive fitness was measured using seed number, 1000 seed weight and total seed weight. Feeding damage to the different plant components increased with plant size or component biomass, with mean damage levels being approximately 30 % for flowers, 5 % for fruits and 1 % for leaves and stems. Feeding damage affected plant reproductive fitness depending on feeding damage type, with flower damage having the strongest effect, shown by greatly reduced seed number, 1000 seed weight and total seed weight. Finally, we found an overall negative effect of plant size on 1000 seed weight, but not on seed number and total seed weight. In conclusion, being conspicuous and attractive to herbivores causes greater flower damage leading to higher fitness costs for large plants, which might be partly counterbalanced by benefits such as enhanced competitive/compensatory abilities or more mutualistic pollinator visits...|$|E

As increasing attention is given to developing this proxy {{it is important that}} methods are comparable between studies. Here, we compare SNW data generated using two different methods to account for variability in <b>test</b> <b>size,</b> namely (i) the narrow (50 μm range) sieve fraction method and (ii) the individually measured <b>test</b> <b>size</b> method. Using specimens from the 200 – 250 μm sieve fraction range collected in multinet samples from the North Atlantic, we find that sieving does not constrain size sufficiently well to isolate changes in weight driven by variations in test wall thickness and density from those driven by size. We estimate that the SNW data produced as part of this study are associated with an uncertainty, or error bar, of about &plusmn; 11 %. Errors associated with the narrow sieve fraction method may be reduced by decreasing the size of the sieve window, by using larger tests and by increasing the number tests employed. In situations where numerous large tests are unavailable, however, substantial errors associated with this sieve method remain unavoidable.
