50|$|GE took a {{different}} approach with their first high bypass ratio turbofan, the TF39. A unique, very complex design; the <b>T-stage,</b> which supercharges the core stream, is located ahead of the main fan rotor. The <b>T-stage</b> itself comprises an overhung mini-rotor followed {{by a set of}} outlet guide vanes; the main fan rotor is located immediately behind these OGV's. Outboard of the <b>T-stage</b> rotor are the main inlet guide vanes, which only affect the bypass stream. The <b>T-stage</b> rotor extends to about half the main rotor stage annulus and runs in a tip shroud. The main fan stage has a mid-span platform/flow splitter which separates the single-stage outer annulus from the 2-stage inner annulus. These two stages mainly supercharge the 16-stage high-pressure compressor. However, a fair proportion of the air entering the <b>T-stage</b> is bled off into the bypass duct, there being two annular passages leading to the bypass duct. The nominal bypass ratio of 8:1 must refer to the ratio of total bypass mass flow to HP compressor entry mass flow.|$|E

50|$|Today, a {{conventional}} turbofan featuring a <b>T-staged</b> fan {{would have an}} overhung fan rotor (without any inlet guide vanes), followed {{by one or more}} <b>T-stages</b> supercharging the core stream alone. The name <b>T-staged</b> fan is derived from the overall appearance of the LP compressor when the side elevation is shown diagrammatically.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>T-stages</b> {{usually only}} {{supercharge}} the core stream, some engines do feature a deliberately oversized intermediate pressure (IP) compressor, which compresses both the core flow and {{a proportion of}} the bypass flow. This enhances {{the stability of the}} <b>T-stages</b> during throttling. Where necessary, the alternative is to employ blow-off valves.|$|R

50|$|The {{alternative}} is to place a zero-stage, mounted on the HP shaft, {{at the front of}} the HP compressor.

50|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} the second leading {{cause of cancer death}} in the United States (after lung cancer), and the third most common cancer overall in men (after {{prostate}} and lung cancer) and women (after breast and lung cancer). Once identified, the treatment approach for rectal cancer is dictated by the stage of the tumor (<b>T-stage)</b> and local lymph nodes (N-stage). There are currently no imaging methods that provide reliable N-staging accuracy of colorectal cancers. While endorectal ultrasound (EUS) is the standard for staging the degree of wall invasion of rectal cancers (<b>T-stage),</b> its accuracy is poor in the critical determination between uT2 and uT3, with 10-35% of uT2 tumors being overstaged. The consequences for the patient are dramatic. A stage uT3 rectal carcinoma is treated by radical surgical resection, and is typically treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation. Neoadjuvant treatment damages adjacent healthy tissues, and can impair the healing process following surgery, leading to increased complications of infection, bleeding, decreased colonic mobility, and incontinence. Whereas stage uT2, N- and lower tumors generally receive a transanal local excision and are not treated neoadjuvantly, eliminating these additional risks to the patient.|$|E

50|$|The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay, {{developed}} by Genomic Health, is a genomic test {{that has been}} clinically available for patients with newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, since January 2010. The test is a validated diagnostic assay based on an individual patient’s colon tumor expression of 12 genes, which quantifies the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer following surgery. The result from the assay is a continuous Recurrence Score® value from 0 to 100 that corresponds to a specific likelihood of colon cancer recurrence 3 years after surgery. A lower score corresponds to a lower risk of recurrence, and a higher score corresponds to {{a higher risk of}} recurrence. The Recurrence Score result provides additional information on recurrence risk beyond traditional clinical and pathological characteristics such as tumor stage (<b>T-stage),</b> mismatch repair (MMR) status, number of lymph nodes examined, tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion.

Tumor glucose metabolism was assessed by maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) obtained by 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography. TBF values were obtained by arterial spin labeling with 3 -tesla MRI. The correlations between both SUVs and TBF were assessed in the total series and among patients divided by <b>T-stage</b> (T 1 -T 3 and T 4 groups) and tumor location (pharynx/oral cavity and sinonasal cavity groups). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for significant correlations. Significant correlations were detected: a negative correlation in the advanced <b>T-stage</b> group (TBF and SUV max: r, - 0. 61, SUVmean: r, - 0. 62), a positive correlation in the non-advanced <b>T-stage</b> pharynx/oral cavity group (TBF and SUVmax: r, 0. 70, SUVmean: r, 0. 73), a negative correlation in the advanced <b>T-stage</b> pharynx/oral cavity group (TBF and SUVmax: r, - 0. 62, SUVmean: r, - 0. 65), and a negative correlation in the advanced <b>T-stage</b> sinonasal cavity group (TBF and SUVmax: r, - 0. 61, SUVmean: r, - 0. 65).

40|$|Aim: Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCC) has a {{very poor}} prognosis. Surgical {{resection}} is a radical treatment option for this disease. However, it is still difficult to cure, and prognostic traits are ambiguous. Evaluation of the tumor typing and staging may elucidate effective prognosis and provide helpful advice for clinical surgeon. This study aimed to analyze the prognostic value of tumor typing and staging in HCC. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of 85 patients with HCC undergoing surgical resections procedures at the Second Xiangya Hospital in Hunan Province between 2002 and 2012. The Bismuth type, modified <b>T-stage,</b> postoperative complications, survival time, and other clinical manifestations associated with the surgical treatment were analyzed. Results: Patients were classified according to Bismuth typing: Subtype I (12 cases), Subtype II (4 cases), Subtype IIIa (3 cases), Subtype IIIb (16 cases), and Subtype IV (50 cases). Patients were classified according to the T staging: Stage T 1 (19 cases), Stage T 2 (5 cases), and Stage T 3 (61 cases). Based on data collected from 67 patients who completed the follow-up survey, both the Bismuth type and modified <b>T-stage</b> were significantly correlated with survival time (each P = 0. 01). Conclusion: The majority of our patients with HCC were characterized as Subtype IV in Bismuth typing and Stage T 3 in modified <b>T-stage.</b> Both Bismuth typing and modified <b>T-stage</b> showed prognostic value in HCC. Compared with Bismuth typing, modified <b>T-stage</b> is a better indicator of the resectability of HCC...|$|E

In {{this pilot}} study, the diagnostic role of contrast-enhanced harmonic imaging endoscopic ultrasonography (CH-EUS) with Sonazoid was prospectively evaluated in preoperative <b>T-staging</b> of pancreaticobiliary malignancies. Patients and methods. Patients with suspected pancreaticobiliary malignancies underwent CH-EUS by a single examiner. After the lesions were observed carefully with conventional harmonic imaging EUS (H-EUS), CH-EUS was performed with intravenous injection of Sonazoid. A reviewer who was blinded reviewed the recordings of H-EUS and CH-EUS and assessed the <b>T-staging.</b> The accuracy of H-EUS and CH-EUS for <b>T-staging</b> was compared {{to the results of}} surgical histopathology in patients who underwent surgery. Result. Twenty-six patients underwent surgical resection and could be included in the study. The final diagnosis were pancreatic cancer in 11, bile duct cancer in 7, gallbladder cancer in 4 and ampullary cancer in 4. The overall accuracy of H-EUS and CH-EUS for <b>T-staging</b> were 69. 2 (18 / 26) and 92. 4 % (24 / 26), respectively (p < 0. 05). There were disagreement in six cases between H-EUS and CH-EUS. CH-EUS staged correctly in all of these six cases, whereas H-EUS misdiagnosed the depth of invasion in one case of gallbladder cancer and one case of ampullary cancer, and invasion of portal vein in two cases of pancreatic cancer and two cases of bile duct cancer. Conclusion. The depth of invasion of biliary cancer and vascular invasion of pancreatic and biliary cancer could be demonstrated more clearly with CH-EUS compared to H-EUS. CH-EUS has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative <b>T-staging</b> of pancreaticobiliary malignancies...|$|R

We aimed {{to assess the impact of}} stage of disease (pT) and the type of primary surgery (laparoscopy versus open) on resectability rates. Material and methods. The data of 90 consecutive patients referred to the Tata Memorial Hospital between 1 January 2003 and 30 April 2007 for revision radical surgery for incidental gallbladder cancer were reviewed retrospectively. Results. Of the 90 patients who underwent revision surgery, accurate data on <b>T-stage</b> was available in 76, and of these 76 patients, 44 (57. 8 %) had prior laparoscopic simple cholecystectomy, while 32 (42. 2 %) had undergone open surgery. The median time interval between the two surgeries was 2 months (range 4 weeks to 11 months). By <b>T-stage,</b> 23 patients had T 1 b disease, while 33 and 20 patients had T 2 and T 3 disease, respectively. Successful revision surgery could be undertaken in 71 % of patients (54 / 76) and 29. 6 % of these had residual disease confirmed by histopathological examination. Conclusions. <b>T-stage</b> is an important factor in determining operability as confirmed by our study. As the <b>T-stage</b> of the disease increased, the chances of finding residual disease increased, while operability decreased. Furthermore, the case for revision surgery is strengthened because the incidence of lymph nodal disease is high even for pT 1 b cancers. The type of primary surgery does not affect operability in patients undergoing revision radical surgery for incidental gallbladder cancer...|$|E

30|$|Given the {{complexity}} of the female pelvic anatomy, hybrid PET/MRI allows simultaneous imaging exclusively in which the two modalities are truly synergistic, which allows better understanding of tumor biology and morphology. In a recent study by Queiroz et al.

Similarly, Nakajo et al.(2010) reported that fused PET/MRI was superior to PET/CT for the cervical cancer detection and delineation. PET/MRI does also have a very promising role for assessing therapeutic response and for detecting disease recurrence (Sarabhai et al., 2018).

40|$|Purpose: We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the relationships between primary tumour; maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumour volume (TV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and tumour-node metastases (TNM) classification in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. Methods: Fluorine- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans of 57 consecutive newly diagnosed NPC patients (age range, 15 - 80 years) were retrospectively reviewed. SUVmax, TV and TLG were recorded. Two-tailed Spearman's correlation was used to analyse {{the relationships between the}} metabolic parameters and the TNM staging system. Results: Positive correlations were observed between SUVmax (P< 0. 001, R= 0. 516), TV (P< 0. 001, R= 0. 504) and TLG (P< 0. 001, R= 0. 620) and <b>T-stage,</b> and both TV and SUVmax were independent variables that significantly affected <b>T-stage</b> (P< 0. 001, adjusted R 2 = 0. 370). No other significant correlations were found between the metabolic parameters and TNM classification system. Conclusion: The metabolic parameters derived from fluorine- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography were positively correlated with <b>T-stage</b> in primary NPC.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the relationship between}} tumour SUVmax and size and TNM staging in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the PET/CT findings of 25 consecutive patients (age range 15 - 80 yrs, mean 51. 1 ± 14. 3) with histologically proven NPC at initial diagnosis (n= 11) or recurrence (n= 14) over a 8 -month period. Histological type was undifferentiated carcinoma in all except one of squamous cell carcinoma. All pts were scanned prior to commencement of treatment or had completed treatment at least 1 -year ago. SUVmax of the 18 F-FDG-avid lesion in the nasopharynx and maximum diameters were measured on axial PET reconstruction and the co-registered contrast-enhanced CT scan respectively by two radiologists in consensus blinded to the clinical details. All patients were staged using the AJC/UICC TNM staging system. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to study the simultaneous influence of tumour SUVmax and size on T-, N-, and M staging. Results: Mean SUVmax and tumour size was 5. 6 ± 3. 91 (range: 1. 80 – 16. 00) and 4. 58 ± 5. 92 cm 2 (range: 0. 18 – 27. 5), respectively. Using univariate analysis, there were significant correlations between <b>T-stage</b> and tumour size (r= 0. 671, p< 0. 001), <b>T-stage</b> and SUVmax (r= 0. 436, p= 0. 030) and tumour size and SUVmax (r= 0. 758, p< 0. 001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed tumour size {{to be the only}} independent variable that significantly affected <b>T-stage</b> (adjusted R 2 = 0. 351, p= 0. 003).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} the resectability rate for hilar cholangiocarcinoma, to analyze reasons for unresectability, and {{to devise a}} presurgical clinical <b>T-staging</b> system. METHODS: Ninety patients with hilar cholangiocarcinomas seen between March 1, 1991, and April 1, 1997, were evaluated. Accurate patterns of disease progression and therapy were evaluable. Disease was staged in 87 patients using extent of ductal tumor involvement, portal vein compromise, and liver atrophy. RESULTS: In 21 patients, disease was deemed unresectable for cure at presentation. In 39 patients, disease {{was found to be}} unresectable at laparotomy, 23 secondary to nodal (N 2) or distant metastases. Unresectability was the result of metastases in 52 % and of locally advanced disease in 28 %. Thirty patients (33 %) had resection of all gross disease, and 25 of these (83 %) had negative histologic margins. Twenty-two patients underwent partial hepatectomy. The 30 -day mortality rate was 7 %. Projected survival is greater than 60 months in those with a negative histologic margin, with a median follow-up of 26 months. A presurgical <b>T-staging</b> system allows presurgical selection for therapy, predicts partial hepatectomy, and offers an index of prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: In half the patients, unresectability is mainly the result of intraabdominal metastases. Presurgical imaging predicts unresectability based on local extension but is poor for assessing nodal metastases. In one third of patients, disease can be resected for cure with a long median survival. Curative resection depends on negative margins, and hepatic resection is necessary to achieve this.

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to identify tumor- and patient-related risk factors for distal rectal cancer in patients treated with an abdominoperineal resection (APR) associated with positive circumferential resection margin (CRM), local recurrence (LR), and overall survival (OS). Background: The introduction of total mesorectal excision (TME) has improved the outcome of patients with rectal cancer. However, survival of patients treated with an APR improved less than of those treated with low anterior resections (LAR). Besides, an APR {{is associated with a}} higher LR rate. Methods: Patients were selected from the TME trial, which is a randomized, multicenter trial, studying the effects of preoperative radiotherapy (RT) in 1861 patients. Of the Dutch patients, 455 underwent an APR. Location of the bulk of the tumor was scored with surgery, pathology, or other reports. CRM was available from pathology reports. Result: A positive CRM was found in 29. 6 % of all patients, 44 % for anterior, 21 % for lateral, 23 % for posterior, and 17 % for (semi) circular tumor location (P < 0. 0001). In a multivariate analysis, <b>T-stage,</b> N-stage, and tumor location were independent risk factors for CRM. If a (partial) resection of the vaginal wall was performed in women, 47. 8 % of patients still had a positive CKM. <b>T-stage,</b> N-stage, and CRM were risk factors for LR and age, <b>T-stage,</b> N-stage, CRM, and distance of the inferior tumor margin to the anal verge for OS.
