5000|$|No khepresh {{has been}} found. Based on ancient artistic representations, some Egyptologists {{have speculated that}} the khepresh was made of leather or {{stiffened}} cloth [...] covered with a precise arrangement of hundreds of sequins, discs, bosses, or rings. Another possibility is that the khepresh was woven like a basket, as the deshret (red crown) {{is known to have}} been, from plant fiber such as grass, straw, palm leaf, or reed. The regular array of circles on painted and sculpted depictions of the crown may be an artistic approximation of the hexagonal holes in an open <b>triaxial</b> <b>weave.</b> As with many other royal crowns, a uraeus (cobra) was hooked {{to the front of the}} khepresh.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{elaborate}} {{finite element}} formulation {{was developed for}} the <b>triaxial</b> <b>woven</b> fabric (TWF) composites and this is presented in a parallel publication [Zhao, Q. and Hoa, S. V. Triaxial Woven Fabric (TWF) Composites With Open Holes (Part I) : Finite Element Models For Analysis, Accepted, Journal of Composite Materials, this same issue. ]. This paper presents examples using the finite elements developed and experimental work to obtain results for comparison purposes. One example deals with the TWF specimens subjected to loading along an axial yarn direction. The other example deals with other TWF specimens subjected to loading transverse to the axial yarn direction. Effects of the width and length of the sample are examined. Noncontact laser extensometer method {{is used for the}} deformation measurement. The significance and meaning of the results are discussed.

40|$|Undeniably, it {{is human}} nature to prefer objects which are {{considered}} beautiful. Most consider beautiful as perfection, hence they try to create objects which are perfectly balance in shape and patterns. This creates a whole different kind of art, the kind that requires an object to be symmetrical. This leads {{to the study of}} symmetrical objects and pattern. Even mathematicians and ethnomathematicians are very interested with the essence of symmetry. One of these studies were conducted on the Malay traditional <b>triaxial</b> <b>weaving</b> culture. The patterns derived from this technique are symmetrical and this allows for further research. In this paper, the 17 symmetry types in a plane, known as the wallpaper groups, are studied and discussed. The wallpaper groups will then be applied to the triaxial patterns of food cover in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Single {{layers of}} <b>triaxial</b> <b>woven</b> fabric {{composites}} {{have been used}} to make communication satellite reflectors due to their extremely light weight with good stiffness and strength property. Special superfinite elements have been developed for the analysis of these lightweight materials. These superfinite elements are used for the deflection and stress analysis of a membrane sector of the satellite reflector subjected to lateral pressure. Due to the significant difference {{in the size of the}} satellite structure (order of meters) and the size of the superfinite elements (order of millimeters) it is not possible to model the satellite structure using the superfinite elements and computer facilities available in most labs (personal computers). In the process of finding a solution to this problem, a special similitude behavior for the deflection of the curved panels made of triaxial fabrics was discovered. Using this behavior, the deflection of a large-size reflector panel (order of meters) can be analyzed using models in the millimeters size range. Stresses in the triax reflector model were also calculated. However, no special similitude behavior was obtained for the stresses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} new {{analytical}} solutions to predict tensile and in-plane shear strengths of <b>triaxial</b> <b>weave</b> fabric (TWF) composites {{accounting for the}} interaction between angularly interlacing yarns. The triaxial yarns in three directions of 0 ° and ± 60 ° in micromechanical unit cell (UC) are idealized as the curved beams with a path depicted by using sinusoidal shape functions. The tensile and in-plane shear strengths of TWF composites are derived {{by means of the}} minimum total complementary potential energy principle founded on micromechanics. In order to validate the new model, the predictions are compared with experimental data in prior literatures. It is shown that the predictions from the new model agree well with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the formulation of}} the hyperelastic strain energy density function for <b>triaxial</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composites. The energy function, which comprises three components: matrix, tow, and interaction, demonstrates a nonlinear stress–strain response. The model constitutes the material expressions, initial straightening and elastic recovery coefficients, which carry mechanical meaning, properly defined {{on the basis of}} micromechanics and elementary structural theory. In the solution, existing widely used but highly iterative fitting procedure that can be cumbersome and computationally expensive is circumvented. It is found that this model captures the experimental response with exceptional agreement in both longitudinal and transverse stretching. During in-plane uniaxial tension, affected invariants are those aligned along the load direction and those off-axis, corresponding to longitudinal and transverse stretching, respectively. Mechanical isotropy has been found valid only in low strain regime. Regardless of load direction, matrix and interaction energies are found to be of isotropic nature...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{computationally}} the buckling {{of simply}} supported sandwich columns constructed using elastic cores reinforced by skin-sheets of <b>triaxial</b> <b>weave</b> fabric (TWF) composites. A novel computationally cheap volume segmentation based thin plate {{model for the}} elastic properties of TWF is first developed. The predicted elastic properties of TWF exhibit quasi-isotropic behavior and correlate well with published numerical and measured results. Having demonstrated strong agreement with established results, these properties are then employed {{in the use of}} a plate on elastic foundation concept to study the stability of sandwich columns under a uniaxially compressed load environment. The parametric study comprises the effects of thickness, aspect ratio, and modulus of the sandwich core (treated as an elastic foundation), as well as the inclusion {{of the effects of the}} initial in-plane and out-of-plane imperfections of the skin-sheets on the critical buckling load. Remarkable dependencies of the critical buckling load on these parameters are demonstrated, due to both independent and wedding actions, noting that a perturbation due to out-of-plane imperfections has been observed to be the most significant contributor to reduction in compressive resistance...|$|E

The feasibility of <b>weaving</b> <b>triaxial</b> fabrics in tight, low porosity configurations with yarns of appropriate sizes and materials was demonstrated along with the stability and isotropy of triaxial fabrics. The triaxial fabric constructions, BP 44 P and BP 40 M, can be reproduced on a production basis. Both fabric constructions afford excellent strength-to-weight ratio and exhibit improved tear strength and shear resistance over biaxial fabrics...|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{composites}} {{are widely}} used for space applications such as antennas, solar panels and spacecraft support structures. This paper presents a combined electromagnetic and acoustic analysis of a <b>triaxial</b> carbon fiber <b>weave</b> structure, designed for ultra lightweight reflector antennas in satellite communication systems. The electromagnetic and acoustic performance of the structure are analyzed {{over a wide range}} of parametric studies, both at a microscopic and mesoscopic length scale. The electromagnetic study indicates that the main parameter governing the electromagnetic reflection performance of the weave is the electric conductivity of the carbon fibers, given that the weave structure is significantly smaller than the wavelength of the incident signals. The acoustic study identifies a critical threshold in the mesoscale geometry in order to avoid a critically high resistive behavior of the weave structure, driven by viscous effects. Design guidelines are drawn from these analyses in order to achieve a trade-off between the electromagnetic reflection properties and the resistance to acoustic loading of such composite materials. These combined analyses allow to deepen the understanding from both an electromagnetic and acoustic perspective in order to open for some new design possibilities...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} numerically the uniaxial stability of <b>triaxial</b> <b>weave</b> fabric (TWF) composites employing finite element (FE) model with homogenized constitutive relation. TWF, which presents high specific-strength and stiffness {{due to its}} porous and lightweight properties, was previously modelled using solid elements or plybased approach, and thus making computation considerably complex and timeconsuming. To circumvent these issues, the current FE formulation is of geometrical nonlinearity employing Newton-Rhapson method where TWF unit cell is treated as a standalone non-conforming composite plate element making use of the homogenized ABD stiffness matrix, where Aij, Bij, and Dij indicate the extensional, coupling, and bending stiffness, respectively in which degree of freedom has been greatly reduced. By means of Matlab program, the currently formulated model has demonstrated good agreement with existing numerical and experimental results from literature in terms of elastic properties. For the buckling analysis, four types of boundary conditions are explored: fully simply supported, fully-clamped, free-simply supported and freeclamped. High dependencies of post-buckling patterns of compression load against both maximum and minimum deflections on numerous aspect ratios from 0. 25 to 5 are observed in TWF, from which a characteristic equation has been defined for practical convenience before the occurrence of post-buckling. Such equation is described {{on the basis of}} the critical buckling load, Nmax, and stiffness factor, S, the best characterization of which is expressed in a logarithmic manner. The study has recognized that the buckling characteristics correlate directly to TWF’s aspect ratios and level of rigidity imposed through the boundary conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the formulation and numerical computation of the buckling behaviour of <b>triaxial</b> <b>weave</b> fabric (TWF) composites subjected to mechanical and thermal loads. The formulation was constructed by adopting {{two types of}} numerical method, namely the finite element method (FEM) and the meshfree (MFree) method, based on the classical plate theory. A combination of Lagrange and Hermite interpolation functions was adopted in the FEM formulation whereas the Multi-Quadrics radial basis function was employed in the MFree formulation. The formulation complexities, high time-consumption and tedious computation attributed to previous studies, which considered a variety of modelling techniques for {{the description of the}} complex tow geometry, were identified as the primary disadvantages, preventing them from widespread use. Therefore, simplification of modelling the TWF is vital for convenience and practicality. Such simplification was provided from the literature by describing the constitutive relation of the TWF using the contemporary 6 × 6 ABD matrix, adopting the homogenized and segmentation methods. The former employs the periodic boundary condition while the latter considers the volume segment of a unit cell. These material expressions were employed in both FEM and MFree methods in order to study the behaviour, especially the stability of the TWF composite when subjected to uniaxial compressive mechanical and uniform thermal loads, focusing on the cases of all edges clamped and simply supported. The source codes for the mechanical buckling and thermal buckling for both FEM and MFree were developed in this study. Authentication and verification of the source codes were done by making comparison with selected problems from the literature. As aspect ratio increases, the TWF plate was found to be less resistant towards mechanical buckling, which was in contrast to the thermal buckling behaviour. Overall, good agreement has been found in models adopting the homogenized and segmentation methods especially for the plates that were fully clamped for both thermal and mechanical bucklings using the FEM and MFree methods. The plates with fully clamped edges were identified to have higher resistance towards mechanical and thermal loads in comparison with those of simply supported edges...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} design and characterization of functional structures for scattering of electromagnetic waves. An abundance of these structures {{can be found}} in nature, such as the structural coloration in the feathers of a peacock, the scales of butterflies and the shell of scarab beetles. Human design of structures providing specific interactions with electromagnetic waves have a long history. Today, these structures {{can be found in}} everyday products and applications like the filter of a microwave oven, shaded windows, polarizing glasses and 3 D movies. A high demand of functional structures is also found in more advanced applications such as antenna design, electromagnetic scattering reduction for stealth applications, and in satellite communication systems. The dissertation consists of a general introduction and nine scientific papers, of which the majority have been published in peer-reviewed international journals. The general introduction sets the stage for the technical details contained in the included papers. Fundamental relations and scattering concepts in electromagnetic theory are presented, alongside with the approaches for design, optimization and experimental characterization of functional structures. The included papers can be divided into two main tracks: Papers I–VI concern satellite communications and Papers VII–IX are related to electromagnetic scattering characterization and reduction. In Papers I–V circular polarization selective structures for satellite communication applications are designed and characterized numerically and experimentally. A novel concept design is presented providing more than double the frequency bandwidth of previous designs. Furthermore, an experimental procedure and a data post processing scheme are presented for accurate characterization of circular polarization selective structures. In Paper VI a multiphysics study of a <b>triaxial</b> <b>weave</b> functioning as a reflector antenna surface is presented. The electromagnetic scattering properties of the structure are evaluated using numerical simulations and approximation models. These results are combined with an acoustic study and design guidelines for such space antennas are specified. In Papers VII–VIII electromagnetic radiation-absorbing materials for scattering reduction applications are evaluated. By using an analytic framework in canonical scattering problems, and numerical methods in more application oriented scenarios, two fast computation methods are developed. These methods are used to evaluate a number of different radiation-absorbing materials in different scenarios, and provide information of the physical interaction between electromagnetic waves and scatterers coated with said materials. Finally, in Paper IX different methods are utilized to locate defects in composite materials. Compressive sensing techniques are implemented to achieve sub-wavelength resolution of data extracted from experimentally acquired scattered fields. A key point is identifying that the scattering from hidden defects can be formulated as a sparse inverse scattering problem in some basis...|$|E
