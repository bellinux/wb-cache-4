5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), as well as <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas.</b> The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan is replaced by the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas,</b> the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Infancy <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> – {{historical}} allegory or myth in {{the format}} of a biographical discursive <b>gospel?</b> <b>The</b> article argues that the Greek version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Infancy <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> in Codex Sinaiticus (Gr 453) represents the genre <b>of</b> a discursive-biographical <b>gospel</b> type and as a result, the narrative and argumentative structure <b>of</b> this infancy <b>gospel</b> is <b>of</b> importance. So too is the phenomenon that the narrative argument <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Infancy <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> is cast {{in the form of}} the ancient god-child myth. This article theorizes about myth by exploring it as folklorist art and its function as model for behaviour. In <b>the</b> Infancy <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> as a myth of a child-god the child Jesus acts as if he were an adult. This adult-like behaviour of the child Jesus is not interpreted in an allegorical way. Rather, as myth, the message is interpreted in a tautegoric manner and explained in a social scientific way. </p...|$|R

25|$|Some {{scholars}} regard <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> {{as part of}} {{the tradition}} from which the canonical gospels eventually emerged; however, <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas</b> is heavily gnostic and likely not written by orthodox Christians.

25|$|As a {{hypothetical}} document, the Q source is still only a hypothesis.

Some scholars suggest that due to the Gnostic content, Thomas was compiled in the 2ndCentury, one century after the Synoptic Gospels.

25|$|Bart Ehrman {{argues that}} the {{historical}} Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the earliest Christian documents: Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles.

25|$|The Common Sayings Source {{is one of}} many {{theories}} that attempts to provide insight into the Synoptic Problem.

25|$|The {{theory of}} the Common Sayings Source relies {{a great deal on}} the {{acceptance}} of the two-source hypothesis or the three-source hypothesis and the existence of the Q source.

25|$|After the Coptic {{version of}} the {{complete}} text was discovered in 1945 at Nag Hammadi, scholars soon realized that three different Greek text fragments previously found at Oxyrhynchus (the Oxyrhynchus Papyri), also in Egypt, were part of <b>the</b> <b>Gospel</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thomas.</b> These three papyrus fragments of Thomas date to between 130 and 250 AD.|$|E
