5000|$|The {{ancestors}} of <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> and Slovaks were united {{in the so-called}} [...] "Samo Empire" [...] for some thirty years in the seventh century. The {{ancestors of}} the Slovaks and Moravians were later united in Great Moravia between 833 and 907. <b>The</b> <b>Czechs</b> were only part of Great Moravia for some seven years before splitting from it in 895. Furthermore, {{in the second half}} of the tenth century, <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> conquered and controlled western Slovakia for around thirty years. This was the last time the two nations were united; the Hungarians had conquered Slovakia by the eleventh century, while <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> maintained their own principality (a kingdom since 1198) of Bohemia, from around 900 to 1919.|$|R

50|$|A much changed team {{under new}} manager Michal Bílek entered the Euro 2012 qualifiers. The {{campaign}} began disastrously {{with a home}} loss to Lithuania. But an important win at home to Scotland was followed by wins against Liechtenstein. World champions Spain defeated <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> in between <b>the</b> Liechtenstein games, but the play-off spot was still in their hands. In the next game, a controversial last minute penalty from Michal Kadlec away to Scotland secured a 2-2 draw. Despite Scotland winning their next two games and <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> again being defeated by Spain, the team could finish second if they could beat Lithuania away from home in the final game, assuming Spain would beat Scotland at home. Spain won 3-1 and <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> convincingly defeated Lithuania 4-1 to seal second spot and a place in <b>the</b> play-offs. <b>The</b> <b>Czechs</b> were drawn to face Montenegro in the two-legged play-off. A memorable goal from Václav Pilař and a last minute second from Tomáš Sivok helped <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> to a 2-0 first leg lead. In the second leg in Podgorica, a late goal from Petr Jiráček sealed a 1-0 win and <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> ran out 3-0 aggregate winners and qualified for Euro 2012.|$|R

50|$|After the World War I, <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> outnumbered Slovaks {{two to one}} in the new Czechoslovak state. The Slovaks {{lived in}} the shadow of the more internationally {{recognized}} <b>Czech</b> leadership and <b>the</b> great capital of Prague. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> and Slovaks was asymmetrical: Slovakia was considered an agrarian appendage to <b>the</b> highly industrial <b>Czech</b> nation, and <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> viewed Slovak culture as lacking in maturity and refinement. The languages of the two nations are closely related and mutually intelligible, many Czechs viewed Slovak as a caricature of Czech.In his 1934 memoirs, the President of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, writes he said in a 1924 interview to a French journalist of Le Petit Parisien: «There is no Slovak nation, it has been invented by Hungarian propaganda. <b>The</b> <b>Czechs</b> and Slovaks are brothers. They understand each other perfectly. All that separates them is the cultural level - <b>the</b> <b>Czechs</b> are more developed than the Slovaks, because the Magyars kept them in the dark. (...) In one generation there will be no difference between the two branches of our national family.» However the interview is nowhere to be found in the scanned full archives of Le Petit Parisien.|$|R
