Intrinsic strength, durability and absence of cross-resistance are key factors in the selection of antiretrovirals.

The D 30 N mutation does not result in cross-resistance with other <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> and it decreases viral fitness. In order to check for this mutation after failure with nelfinavir, the 246 HIV- 1 genotyping test was performed on virus samples from 55 patients with failure of nelfinavir as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Most (84 %) of the viral strains were of subtype B.

Principal component analysis of the feces metabolome uncovered eight TPV metabolites, including three monohydroxylated, three desaturated, one dealkylated, and one dihydroxylated. In vitro study using human liver microsomes recapitulated five TPV metabolites, all of which were suppressed by RTV. CYP 3 A 4 was identified as the primary enzyme contributing to the formation of four TPV metabolites (metabolites II, IV, V, and VI), including an unusual dealkylated product arising from carbon-carbon bond cleavage.

The Bt toxins used for insect control have a narrow specificity against lepidopteran and coleopteran pests only. Yet, aphids and thrips are highly important pests worldwide, causing severe direct losses and transmitting devastating viruses such as Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV). So far, few useful traits against aphids or thrips have been reported. The ideal of an insecticide-free culture of GM crops like cotton or potato is, therefore, currently compromised by the continued need in those crops to fight sucking pests using chemical means.

However, some unfavorable properties including low aqueous solubility, low intestinal absorption and fast biotransformation lead to its poor oral bioavailability and limited therapeutic efficacy. The objective of this dissertation project is to investigate whether stereoisomerized peptide prodrugs targeting influx transporter system could improve intestinal absorption and oral bioavailability of SQV. Four stereoisomeric dipeptide prodrugs of SQV including L-valine-L-valine-SQV (LLS), L-valine-D-valine-SQV (LDS), D-valine-L-valine-SQV (DLS) and D-valine-Dvaline- SQV (DDS) and two amino acid prodrugs including L-valine-SQV (LS) and Dvaline- SQV (DS) were synthesized and investigated using in vitro cell culture models. All dipeptide prodrugs exhibit improved aqueous solubility, lowered cytotoxicity, and reduced P-gp/MRP 2 -mediated efflux activities regardless of stereochemistry in promoieties. SQV attached with L-isomers shows higher affinity for peptide transporters but lower stability and higher toxicity, whereas conjugation with D-isomers can enhance stability and reduce toxicity, but not be recognized by peptide transporters. Subsequently, results of metabolism studies performed in rat liver microsomes indicate that elimination half life of SQV was prolonged dramatically by 7 - to 40 -fold due to prodrug modification with the rank order of DDS > DLS > LDS > LLS > DS > LS > SQV. In comparison with D-configuration, L-configuration favors the interaction between prodrugs and rat hepatic CYP 3 A enzymes, resulting in a relatively rapid clearance by CYP 3 A. Stereoselectivity is also observed in protein binding of prodrugs in rat plasma. Lower protein binding was obtained by LS, LLS and LDS but higher by DS, DDS and DLS as compared with SQV. Pharmacokinetics studies performed in rats provide further evidences that oral bioavailability of SQV is drastically enhanced by conjugation with dipeptide L-valine-Dvaline. In conclusion, stereoisomeric dipeptide prodrug modification targeting specific influx transporters could be a successful strategy to improve bioavailability of poorly absorbed drug SQV. Additionally, influence of exogenous human efflux transporters (P-gp, MRP 2 and BCRP) on functional activities of endogenous peptide transporters (PepT) was also delineated in MDR-transfected MDCK cell lines in this project. Results demonstrate that overexpression of MDR genes reduces PepT function probably due to the phenomenon of transporter-compensation resulting in down-regulation of endogenous genes. It may provide some mechanistic insight into possible reasons for underestimation in drug screening using these cell models.

In particular, the quest for removal of interferon from HCV therapy remains one of the great unmet medical needs in HCV therapy development. With an increasing number of other DAAs in clinical development including second-wave, first-generation, and second-generation NS 3 / 4 A <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> nucleoside/nucleotide analogue inhibitors and non-nucleoside inhibitors of HCV-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, inhibitors of nonstructural protein 5 A (NS 5 A) and host-targeted compounds such as cyclophilin inhibitors and silibinin, the hope for better tolerated HCV therapies and potentially interferon-free HCV combination therapies has grown considerably. The proof of concept that IFN-free regimens may lead to HCV eradication has recently been brought in GT 2 / 3 patients treated with PSI- 7977 and ribavirin for 12 weeks as well as in GT 1 b patients treated with BMS- 790052 +&#x 200 A;BMS- 650032 for 24 weeks. Although some patients with GT 1 a infection were also cured under this regimen, the majority of patients relapsed after treatment discontinuation, suggesting that at least for the 1 a HCV genotype more effective interferon-free regimens still need to be developed. Interestingly, also GT 1 non-responders treated with GS- 7977 +ribavirin showed a high relapse rate, again underlining that more challenging patient populations will still exist which either need broader oral combinations or longer treatment durations. Overall, the dramatic increase in efficacy has also been seen in DAA-based HCV therapy in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients. However, complex drug-drug interactions and tolerability issues remain a concern for all HCV patients, but particularly for HIV patients receiving antiretroviral therapy with a high potential for drug interactions...|$|R

We aimed to assess whether <b>first</b> generation <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> interfere with neutrophil function. We included 108 consecutive, retrospective CHC patients and 44 consecutive, prospective CHC patients who were treated with peginterferon and ribavirin with or without <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> according to the guidelines {{in the period of}} November 2012 to June 2015. 33 healthy volunteers served as controls. Infection data were evaluated in all patients. Neutrophil phagocytosis, oxidative burst, elastase and diamine oxidase levels during 12 weeks of triple (n = 23) or dual therapy (n = 21) were studied in the prospective part. In the retro- and prospective cohorts patients experiencing clinically relevant infections were significantly more frequent during <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitor</b> therapy (31 % and 26 %) than during therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin (13 % and 0 %). Neutrophil phagocytosis decreased to 40 % of baseline with addition of <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to P/R but recovered 6 months after end of treatment. <b>Protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> also seemed to reduce serum elastase levels but did not impact on gut permeability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Observed {{adverse effects}} of {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) on the lipid profile could be of significance in pregnancy. This systematic review aims to summarize studies that investigated the association between HIV, ART and serum lipids during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in five electronic databases to obtain articles that measured serum lipid concentrations or the incidence of dyslipidaemia in HIV-infected pregnant women. Included articles were assessed for quality according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. The extracted data was analysed through descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Of the 1264 articles screened, 17 articles were included in this review; eleven reported the incidence of dyslipidaemia, and twelve on maternal serum lipid concentrations {{under the influence of}} HIV-infection and ART. No articles reported pregnancy outcomes in relation to serum lipids. Articles were of acceptable quality, but heterogenic in methods and study design. Lipid levels in HIV-infected women increased 1. 5 - 3 fold over the trimesters of pregnancy, and remained within the physiological reference range. The percentage of women with dyslipidaemia was variable between the studies [0 - 88. 9 %] and highest in <b>the</b> groups on <b>first</b> generation <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and for women on ART at conception. CONCLUSION: This systematic review observed physiologic concentrations of serum lipids for HIV-infected women receiving ART during pregnancy. Serum lipids were increased in users of <b>first</b> generation <b>protease</b> <b>inhibitors</b> and for those on treatment at conception. There was no information available about pregnancy outcomes. Future studies are needed which include HIV-uninfected control groups, control for potential confounders, and overcome limitations associated with included studies...|$|R
