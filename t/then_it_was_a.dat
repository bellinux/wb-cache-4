After several years in which the side had defied {{predictions}} and finished mid-table in the County Championship, Somerset fell to bottom place in 1952, and stayed there for four years. But Gimblett's own performance drew one of the game's accolades: in the 1953 edition of Wisden, he was {{named one of the}} Five Cricketers of the Year, alongside Tom Graveney, David Sheppard, Stuart Surridge and Fred Trueman.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} business {{view of the}} EV1 as {{a failure}} is inherently controversial. If it is viewed {{as an attempt to}} produce a viable EV product, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> success, although certainly from GM's perspective the vehicle was not a commercial success, since the high profit margins typically seen with internal combustion engine vehicles remained elusive. However, if one considers the vehicle as a technological showpiece—a production electric car that actually could replace a gasoline powered vehicle—then the program's outcome is less definitive. The EV1 was produced for the consumer market, and many lessees found driving an EV1 to be a favorable experience.|$|E
30|$|The {{next step}} is to {{determine}} what type of FH. This distinction is based on the clinical exam of the foot and ankle. If there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fixed equino-valgus foot deformity, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type 3. If there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fixed equino-varus foot deformity, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type 4. If the ankle deformity <b>is</b> dynamic, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type 2. If there is no foot deformity and the ankle <b>is</b> stable, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> type 1. An MRI is not necessary to separate types 1, 2, 3 and 4; these types can be determined by clinical and radiographic examination. An MRI examination is helpful to subdivide the type 3 FH into subtypes a, b or c.|$|R

25|$|Warwickshire's bowling, which lacked {{an injured}} Heath Streak, also suffered, and despite {{excellent}} figures of six for 92 from Alex Loudon the Nottinghamshire batsmen ran {{away with it}} as Darren Bicknell, Jason Gallian and Australian David Hussey all made fifties. <b>Then,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Nottinghamshire spinner's turn to take centre stage - Graeme Swann. In 23 overs, he took six for 57, including the entire Warwickshire middle order from three to six - only Westwood passed 25, and Warwickshire could only muster 133. As if to make the humiliation complete, Swann was promoted to number 1, and hit one boundary and four additional runs before stumps were drawn after one over. Nottinghamshire were eight for no loss overnight, chasing 12 to win, and Darren Bicknell hit the winning runs off Dewald Pretorius four balls into the fourth day.|$|E
25|$|The {{next two}} Blues games {{would see the}} team go {{head to head with}} other Premier League teams in trouble {{at the foot of the}} table.

The only highlight of the game was a goal for Mauro Zárate. The last game of the month saw Manchester City visit St Andrew's. Two Zárate goals and a penalty by Gary McSheffrey were enough to overcome the Manchester team, who scored with a penalty of their own from Elano.|$|E
25|$|In October 2012, Lexus {{staged a}} {{race as a}} result of a charity bet between pilot Marc Arnold and Kent Stevinson to race a Lexus LFA against an Eclipse 500 jet. The top speed of the LFA is 203mph while the Eclipse 500 can reach speeds of 400mph. In order to make it a fair test to measure acceleration, handling, braking, {{according}} to Paul Williamson the race took place on a 4800 feet runway. The plane was given a head start of about 110mph with the Lexus LFA launching from a dead stop as the jet flew by at 110mph. As the race begun, the plane started accelerating from 110mph and Lexus LFA launched from a dead stop. Both accelerated to the end of the runway where the LFA will have to brake and turn around with the plane turning around as well. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> race all the way back to the starting line with the LFA needing to brake before the plane in order for the Lexus LFA to win the race. The proceeds of the win were to benefit charities. Lexus decided to choose the Lexus LFA Nurburgring Edition for the race and professional race car driver and champion Scott Pruett was selected as the driver for the Lexus LFA. Once the race was complete, the Lexus LFA was able to win through completing the race including a full dead stop at the end before the plane cleared the finish line 2 seconds ahead of the Eclipse 500 jet. The Lexus LFA hit a maximum speed of 171mph before it hit the braking zone.|$|E

At 16, Baird started to hitch-hike to London, although her aunt never knew, as she would never have allowed it. Baird talked about the trips to London, and how relatively safe they were: [...] "Hitching was easy <b>then.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> way of life. Everything was becoming more free.

It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E

His subjects from a particular administered unit (part of the province) believed that this “Beam” was too large for them to use as a measurement for collecting crops from each household of the surrounding villages, so they made a secret plan. They arranged a big feast in honor of Pu Tong Seal with many delicacies.
