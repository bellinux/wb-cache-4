50|$|These are tools {{designed}} for fishing other wireline components {{which have been}} dropped or placed in the well down hole. All wireline tools are designed with 'fishing necks' on their top side, intended to be easily grabbed by pulling tools with a matching 'id' {{to that of the}} 'od' of the fishing neck. Pulling tools are also used for retrieving seated components such as plug prongs. Almost all pulling tools are equipped with a safety feature (shear pin) so they may release a stuck tool and allow the <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> to be brought to the surface for changes in components (hydraulic jars for example).|$|E

30|$|The {{first group}} of well logging data {{consists}} of instantaneous well logs, such as the ROP, which records {{the speed at which}} the drill bit penetrates the rock, usually reported in m/h. Normally, the speed of the drill bit decreases as the drill bit bores into denser formations. At Soultz, the mean speed is 8  m/h in soft sediments (above 1 -km depth), 5  m/h in hard sediments (below 1 -km depth) and just 2  m/h in the granite. When the ROP is higher than the mean value, the occurrence is generally interpreted as the effect of a localized fracture zone. In such a case, the driller is obliged to reduce the weight on the bit (WOB) to drill in stable drilling conditions. The WOB is the mass of the <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> that applies a vertical load on the drill bit and ranges, in the Soultz case, from 11 tons in soft sediments to 15 tons in hard Triassic sediments or granite. If the WOB is reduced by the driller, the ROP is artificially low but could nevertheless indicate a fracture zone.|$|E

40|$|A new {{elemental}} oxide {{classification scheme}} for crystalline rocks is developed {{and applied to}} geochemical well logs from the Cajon Pass drill hole. This classification scheme takes advantage of measurements of elements taken by a geochemical logging <b>tool</b> <b>string.</b> It uses K_ 2 O versus SiO_ 2 /Al_ 2 O_ 3 to distinguish between granites, granodiorites, tonalites, syenites, monzonites, diorites, and gabbros. Oxide measurements from cores are used to calibrate the elemental abundances determined from the well logs. From these logs, a detailed lithologic column of the core is generated. The lithologic column derived from the well log classification scheme is compared with a lithologic column constructed from core samples and well cuttings. In the upper 1295 m of the well, agreement between the two columns is good. Discrepancies occur from 1295 to 2073 m and {{are believed to be}} caused by the occurrence of rock types not distinguished by the classification scheme and/or the occurrence of secondary minerals.

Though this design {{is one of the major}} advantages of DP assembly for conventional reservoirs, it becomes a major hurdle for tight reservoir testing since a large sump volume needs to be displaced (~ 20 – 22  L in a 8.5 ” hole) before getting the fluid breakthrough from the formation. This sump volume displacement will take anywhere between 5 and 8  h in tight reservoirs depending on the mobility range.|$|E

Difficult drilling conditions in fractured gabbros resulted in a washed-out hole. Despite these unfavorable circumstances, open-hole logs from the Formation MicroScanner (FMS) <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> provide strong constraints on the fracture orientations and suggest a few directions of preferential enlargement. These results were obtained because five logging passes were recorded {{to compensate for the}} expected low data quality by redundancy and because the now classical analysis of FMS data has been adapted to this situation of multiple passes and washed out borehole. An east enlargement direction is thought {{to be related to the}} east-west strike of the dense network of fractures observed both in cores and on the FMS resistivity images, and an east-northeast enlargement direction may be the result of drill pipe wear along the borehole plunge direction. Additional east-southeast to south-southeast and north-northeast enlargements may reflect the influence of either the Nazca-Galapagos or the Cocos-Nazca plate boundary state of stress, respectively. However, the interpretation of these poorly defined directions remains uncertain. The analysis of the FMS resistivity images shows mainly east-west striking and southward dipping fractures and very few north-south trending features.

40|$|Uncovering {{signatures}} of positive selection {{has been a}} long-standing interest {{in the field of}} genomics. The high prevalence of metabolic diseases such as diabetes has been suggested to be associated with positive selective pressures. Advantageous alleles increase in frequency and linked surrounding deleterious mutations rise in frequency as well, therefore the high prevalence of many diseases. High-density SNP maps of the human genome enable us to look for such regions involved in the susceptibility to diseases, particularly diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Firstly, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the performance of several existing methods to detect positive selection. Out of the 7 methods (EHHST, XPEHHST, XP-EHH, iHS, nSL, XPCLR and hapFLK) that were compared under various demographic scenarios, XPCLR and iHS were found to perform best. These two methods were used for a genome scan of the HapMap Phase II database. Based on these results, we carried out an enrichment analysis to uncover signals enriched for positive selection.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the tissue-protective activities of erythropoietin (EPO) has underlined the importance of some cytokines in tissue protection, repair and remodeling. As such activities have been reported for other cytokines, we asked whether we could define a class of tissue-protective cytokines. We therefore explored a novel approach based on functional clustering. In this pilot study, we started by analyzing {{a small number of}} cytokines (30). We functionally classified the 30 cytokines according to their interactions by using the bioinformatics <b>tool</b> <b>STRING</b> (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes), followed by hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of this functional clustering were different from those obtained by clustering cytokines simply according to their sequence. We previously reported that the protective activity of EPO in a model of cerebral ischemia was paralleled by an upregulation of synaptic plasticity genes, particularly early growth response 2 (EGR 2). To assess the predictivity of functional clustering, we tested some of the cytokines clustering close to EPO (interleukin- 11, IL- 11; kit ligand, KITLG; leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF; thrombopoietin, THPO) in an in vitro model of human neuronal cells for their ability to induce EGR 2. Two of these, LIF and IL- 11, induced EGR 2 expression. Although these data would need to be extended to a larger number of cytokines and the biological validation should be done using more robust in vivo models, rather then just one cell line, this study shows the feasibility of this approach. This type of functional cluster analysis could be extended to other fields of cytokine research and help design biological experiments...|$|E

Sites 994, 995, and 997 were drilled on the Blake Ridge to refine {{our understanding of the}} in situ characteristics of natural gas hydrate. Because gas hydrate is unstable at surface pressure and temperature conditions, a major emphasis was placed on the downhole logging program to determine the in situ physical properties of the gas hydrate-bearing sediments.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsScale {{build up}} {{is one of}} the leading reasons for {{production}} decline in oilfields worldwide. Scale can be formed whenever water is produced; either by direct precipitation from the water that occurs naturally in the reservoir rocks, or as a result of produced water becoming oversaturated with scale components when two incompatible waters are mixed downhole. The two most common scales formed in an oilfield are calcium carbonate and barium sulfate. Scale can be found in the reservoir, along the wellbore and in the surface process system. There are various methods for controlling scale. The methods shall either prevent scale formation or remove scale that has already occurred. Scale inhibition and choosing the correct injection fluid are two methods for preventing scale formation. Removal of scale can be divided into chemical dissolution and mechanical removal. For chemical dissolution, the alternative is to bullhead the well with chemicals to remove the scale. Mechanical removal includes the use of different equipment e. g. brushes, broaches, string shots and milling. This thesis focuses especially on mechanical wireline milling for removal of scale. Due to this, the wireline rig-up equipment for both platforms and riserless well intervention vessels, has been presented. Wireline milling is a mechanical method which uses a special <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> with a milling bit in the end, to remove scale. Four scale milling case histories from the Smørbukk field in the Norwegian Sea has been studied. They were all performed from a riserless well intervention vessel. Different plots with measurements from one of the case histories, taken during the milling operation have been looked into. The plots contain different measurements such as head tension, current and wireline tension and are plotted against time. The objective of the thesis has been trying to locate parts of the execution of scale milling operations that can be improved. Some of the key findings were: -	When carrying out a scale milling operation; as much as possible information about the scale, and other well conditions, should be obtained before the scale milling start. This can be information about the scale type, where it is located, and the length and thickness of the scale restrictions. Other important information is temperature, pressure and fluid in the well. This information can make the choice of equipment easier and reduce the risk for something going wrong during the operation. To obtain information about the scale restrictions, a caliper can be run in well. -	The weight on bit should be controlled carefully throughout the milling operation. The correct weight on bit is crucial to avoid stalling out with the bit. The consequence of stalling with the bit is no progress in the scale milling, and maybe the need for pulling out of hole with the <b>tool</b> <b>string.</b> -	The removal of scale cuttings is very important during a milling operation. If the cuttings are not sufficiently removed, there will be an accumulation of cuttings around the mill bit and no progress in the milling. -	Real time measurement taken during the scale milling is important for having optimal control over the operation. -	In wells with challenging well conditions, like high temperature and high pressure, pre-testing of equipment for real well conditions, may be important for optimizing the scale milling operation. This can be a good measure to prevent equipment failures and short circuits during the milling operation and decrease the need for tripping in and out of hole more than planned for. -	The effect that acid has on scale is difficult to conclude based on these case histories and should be further investigated. -	The overall experience from the scale milling operations emphasizes the need for a detailed planning of milling operations. Experience, equipment limitations and the different aspects of a milling operation should be thoroughly addressed before one start to mill the scale. This may help to reduce the number of problems during the milling operation...|$|E
40|$|A hemofilia A é um distúrbio hemorrágico congénito caracterizado pelo comprometimento da cascata de coagulação devido à ausência ou deficiência da atividade do fator VIII que é provocada por uma mutação presente no respetivo gene. As características clínicas e as complicações que acompanham os pacientes hemofílicos ao longo da sua vida, como hemorragias espontâneas ou artropatia resultante de hemartroses recorrentes, exigem o recurso frequente a serviços de saúde. Contudo, nem sempre se verifica uma correlação entre a severidade da doença, que é inferida a partir do genótipo, e o fenótipo apresentado clinicamente. Considerando que a distinção entre fenótipos tem implicações para a prática clínica, torna-se {{fundamental}} o seu estudo do ponto de vista bioquímico. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo a análise do perfil proteico de soro e plasma de pacientes com hemofilia A severa, acompanhados no Serviço de Imunohemoterapia do Hospital Infante D. Pedro, em Aveiro, para melhor compreender as alterações proteicas no soro/plasma induzidas pela mutação que provoca esta doença. Neste sentido, procedeu-se à análise do perfil de proteínas do soro/plasma por SDS-PAGE e da atividade de proteases, presentes nestes biofluidos, por zimografia em gel. Complementarmente, realizou-se uma análise por imunoblotting de forma a verificar se as alterações na atividade da MMP- 9, detetada na análise por zimografia, se deviam a diferenças no teor desta protease. Por último, com vista a integrar a MMP- 9 nos processos celulares, recorreu-se à ferramenta bioinformática String para analisar as interações proteína-proteína com a MMP- 9. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que a hemofilia A promove alterações da atividade proteolítica do soro e do plasma, caracterizadas pela diminuição significativa da atividade de MMP- 9, apesar de presente em maior quantidade, o que sugere o envolvimento do inibidor TIMP- 1 na regulação da sua atividade. Por sua vez, a análise efetuada por String evidenciou a interação desta metaloproteinase com vários fatores da via intrínseca da cascata de coagulação, confirmando, desta forma, o potencial envolvimento da MMP- 9 na hemofilia A. Hemophilia A is a congenital blood disorder, characterised by the {{impairment of}} the coagulation cascade {{due to the}} absence or deficiency of factor VIII activity, which {{is caused by a}} mutation in the factor’s gene. The clinical features and the complications that accompany hemophiliacs throughout their lives, such as spontaneous bleeds and arthropathy that results from recurrent hemarthrosis, require the frequent use of health services. However, the correlation between the disease’s severity, which is inferred from the genotype, and the phenotype presented clinically is not always found. Considering that the distinction between phenotypes has implications to clinical practice, its study becomes essential from the biochemical point of view. The present study aimed to analyse the protein profile of serum and plasma from severe hemophilia A patients, who have been accompanied at the Imunohemotherapy Service of Infante D. Pedro Hospital, in Aveiro. This analysis was designed to better understand the protein alterations in serum/plasma induced by the mutation that causes this disease. In this sense, we determined protein profile of serum/plasma by SDS-PAGE and protease activity by in gel zymography. Then, an immunoblotting analysis was performed in order to verify if the alterations in MMP- 9 activity, which had been detected by in gel zymography, were due to differences in the quantity of this protease. Finally, we used the bioinformatical <b>tool</b> <b>String</b> to study the protein-protein interactions with MMP- 9 with the purpose of integrating this protease in cellular activities. The results showed that hemophilia A promotes alterations of serum and plasma proteolytic activity, characterised by the significant decreased activity of MMP- 9, despite being present in higher levels, which suggests the influence of inhibitor TIMP- 1 in the regulation of its activity. Furthermore, the analysis carried with String highlighted the interaction of MMP- 9 with several factors of the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, confirming the potential involvement of this protease in hemophilia A.

40|$|Operations Mobilization of Vidar Viking, Aberdeen, Scotland The Vidar Viking {{came under}} {{contract}} on 22 July 2004, when mobilization began in Aberdeen, Scotland. Mobilization in Aberdeen included two major installations: a moonpool {{and a full}} coring/drilling spread. By 26 July, all equipment for the Vidar Viking had arrived, including information technology equipment bound for the Oden. The derrick was load-tested and certified. The Vidar Viking took on {{a full complement of}} fuel at Aberdeen. Test Coring Site: Witch Ground, North Sea The Vidar Viking set sail for Landskrona, Sweden, on 28 July 2004. While the ship was en route, a first test of the drilling equipment was conducted in the Witch Ground area of the North Sea, ~ 8 h steam from Aberdeen. A test borehole was drilled in 152 m water depth to a depth of 37 meters below seafloor (mbsf) using the British Geological Survey's (BGS's) advanced piston corer (APC) and extended core barrel. Cores were obtained with both systems. The APC recovered > 4 m in all runs (maximum = 4. 5 m). The Vidar Viking left the test coring site at 1900 h on 30 July and proceeded to Landskrona. Meanwhile, mobilization of the Oden proceeded at Gothenburg, Sweden, which included loading the laboratory equipment. On the evening of 31 July, the Oden set sail for Tromsø, Norway. Mobilization of Vidar Viking, Landskrona, Sweden The Vidar Viking reached Landskrona on the morning of 1 August 2004. The stern notch, a 100 ton section required by the Vidar Viking when working in ice, and the helideck were installed. The remaining containers were loaded onto the deck, including the core and European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling Science Operator curation containers sent from Bremen, Germany. Other mobilization work continued until the morning of 3 August, when the Vidar Viking departed for Tromsø. Mobilization of Vidar Viking and Oden, Tromsø, Norway The Oden arrived in Tromsø on the evening of 5 August 2004. The Vidar Viking arrived on the morning of 7 August. Two helicopters, required for ice reconnaissance missions, landed on the Oden and were secured. Rendezvous of three Expedition 302 ships Expedition 302 officially began when the Oden left Tromsø, Norway, at 2350 h on 7 August 2004. The Vidar Viking remained in Tromsø for the next 12 h to wait for dynamic positioning spare parts to arrive. The Oden transited to 81 ° 56 'N, 44 ° 59 'E to meet the other two ships in the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX) fleet for Expedition 302, the Sovetskiy Soyuz and the Vidar Viking, {{at the edge of the}} polar ice pack on 10 August. The fleet entered the ice together with the Sovetskiy Soyuz leading, the Oden following, and the Vidar Viking bringing up the rear. Transit to first site During the transit to the operational area, ice reconnaissance and personnel transfer flights began on 12 August 2004. The fleet made unprecedented headway of 8 – 10 kt in sea ice. The fleet arrived on site at 2350 h on 13 August and began preparations for drilling and operations for maintaining position in sea ice. Preparations for drilling began with clearing ice from the moonpool. Once this was done, a steel skirt was deployed through and below the moonpool to protect the drill string from ice impact below the hull. Once the ice protection skirt was in place, the drill floor and iron roughneck were installed. The drill floor was ready for operations by 0900 h on 15 August. During this time, the fleet's ability to maintain station was tested by positioning the Sovetskiy Soyuz and the Oden upstream of the Vidar Viking. The initial stationkeeping tests were successful, and the Fleet Manager gave approval to start drilling operations at 1100 h on 15 August. Site operations Cores were recovered in five holes (Holes M 0002 A, M 0003 A, M 0004 A, M 0004 B, and M 0004 C) (Table T 1). Hole M 0001 A was abandoned after the bottom-hole assembly (BHA) was lost. Logging was attempted in two holes and data were collected in Hole M 0004 B. Table T 2 documents the allocation of time, broken down into (1) waiting for better ice conditions, (2) operational breakdown, and (3) drilling operations. Waiting for better ice conditions was labeled "W. " If waiting on ice conditions required pulling pipe and subsequent preparations to begin drilling operations, these times were included in the W category because that time delay was caused by the "waiting for ice" situation. "Breakdown time" is defined as operational time consumed as a result of equipment or mechanical failure. The loss of a BHA, for example, regardless if caused by human error or mechanical failure, necessitated a drill string trip. If the trip time was caused by equipment failure, it was considered as breakdown time "B. " Site M 0001 (SP 2720 on Line AWI 91090) Site M 0001 (shotpoint [SP] 2720 on Line AWI 91090) was reached at 1100 h on 15 August 2004. Later that day during drill string deployment, the high-pressure mud valve on the top drive was damaged. The valve was removed, the rest of the drill string was run, and then the broken valve was replaced. Pipe trips were slowed or stopped intermittently to allow overheated hydraulic fluid in the new drill rig to cool. By 16 August, the drill string was deployed to the seafloor and the first piston corer was deployed at 0600 h. After pumping for 30 min, pressure was not obtained and the piston corer was retrieved without having fired. Damaged seals on the piston corer were replaced. Ice conditions were marginal, and at 0900 h operations were stopped and the drill string was lifted from the seabed. Ice conditions improved by 1400 h, and operations continued. The piston corer was deployed again, and no pressure developed in the drill string. Upon retrieval, the piston corer had not fired. It was suspected that the piston corer had not latched into the BHA. The extended core barrel was then deployed but was not recovered, which indicated that the BHA was lost. At 2000 h, the drill string was tripped to the surface and the BHA and extended core barrel losses were confirmed. Beginning early on 17 August, a new BHA was assembled and lowering of the drill string began. When > 800 m was deployed, the high-pressure mud valve on the swivel was damaged during pipe handling. The drill string was tripped to the surface because the operator did not want to risk leaving the drill string hanging in the water column for an unspecified period of time. After completing the pipe trip, the damage was assessed and the Oden's chief engineer was tasked with manufacturing a new valve using materials from a spare pup joint. As an interim solution, a conventional valve assembly was installed, which restricted operations so that no piston core could be deployed. Ice conditions deteriorated between 0900 and 2200 h, and the time was utilized to move the Vidar Viking to a new position (Hole M 0002 A). Because there were no mud valve spares, the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat began making arrangements for a Swedish Air Force C- 130 airdrop of two new valve parts and one conventional valve assembly. Site M 0002 (SP 2560 on Line AWI- 91090) Based on a strategy developed by the ice management team, the drill string was lowered while drifting onto the location of Site M 0002. By 2200 h on 18 August 2004, this strategy put the Vidar Viking within 190 m of the proposed site. The final positioning was done by icebreaking this short distance to Hole M 0002 A. Once on location at 0820 h, three more drill pipes were added and coring started. Because the mud valve was not yet repaired, the extended core barrel was deployed instead of the APC. A first attempt at coring was unsuccessful, but after adding more pipe and drilling another core run, some core was retrieved. The first core on deck arrived at 1335 h at a water depth of 1209 m. Drilling operations continued throughout the afternoon. The newly fabricated mud valve from the Oden arrived late in the afternoon, and preparations were made for its installation during a wireline trip. The temporary valve was replaced before more drill pipe was added for the next core run. By midnight on 19 August, a depth of 31 mbsf had been reached. Drilling and extended core barrel coring continued until 23 August (Table T 1) when the Fleet Manager ordered the drill pipe to be pulled to 40 mbsf because ice conditions had deteriorated. Permission to continue drilling operations was given midday, and operations continued until 2100 h when the ice conditions forced the termination of Hole M 0002 A at a depth of 271. 69 m. The drill string was tripped to the drill deck during the morning of 24 August. After waiting for ice conditions to change in the afternoon, a transit began at 1930 h to a position from which the Vidar Viking could drift onto location while tripping in the drill string. While we waited for improved ice conditions and operations set up for the next site continued, an air gun seismic survey was run from the Oden to tie Site M 0002 to the next site (Site M 0003). Site M 0003 (SP 2521 on Line AWI- 91090) The Vidar Viking reached the ice-drift position at 2100 h and awaited ice reconnaissance results. The iron roughneck, which had been removed to repair oil leaks, was installed after repairs; the ice protector skirt was lowered; and the drill floor was prepared. At 2300 h, the BHA and drill collars were run. At 0240 h on 25 August 2004, after 400 m of pipe had been deployed, the housing of the iron roughneck cracked and had to be removed for major repairs. Operations resumed at 1400 h using power tongs. The seafloor was reached at ~ 2300 h, and at 0110 h on 26 August, the first APC core was recovered from Hole M 0003 A (Table T 1). A second APC core with a shattered liner was recovered. The third APC core became stuck in the BHA. While trying to release the corer, the wireline parted at the mechanical termination, and it was necessary to pull the string. Hole M 0003 A was terminated at 0440 h. The ice management team conducted ice reconnaissance surveys, reviewed options, and recommended that the fleet move to a location farther west, where a longer-term prediction of relatively good ice could be made. Once the site was selected, the ice team predicted an upstream ice position for the Vidar Viking to start to drift onto the new location. The fleet steamed to the updrift ice position, arriving at 0630 h on 27 August. During this time, wireline termination repair, APC service, and iron roughneck testing and refitting took place. Site M 0004 (SP 3006 [Holes M 0004 A and M 0004 B] and 3004 [Hole M 0004 C] on Line AWI- 91090) At 0755 h on 27 August 2004 during the pipe trip to the seafloor, the high-pressure mud valve was damaged again. The valve was removed, and the remaining string was run to 1150 m depth while the valve was repaired. At 1800 h, the Vidar Viking was on location (Hole M 0004 A). Once on station, the repaired mud valve was installed and the drill string was run to the seabed. At 2230 h, drilling operations in Hole M 0004 A commenced and the hole was advanced by washing ahead to 17 mbsf (Table T 1) before a piston corer was deployed. Shortly after midnight on 28 August 2004, the APC became stuck in the BHA but was freed after ~ 1 h. Once on deck, the plastic liner in the core barrel was found to be shattered and 3. 5 m of the core was stuck in the barrel. In light of these problems with the APC—in particular, the risk of junking the hole again—it was decided to switch to extended core barrel coring. Two extended core barrel cores were recovered to a depth of 30. 5 mbsf followed by washing to 265 mbsf using the insert bit. This decision to wash ahead was made in order to recover sediment deeper than that recovered in Hole M 0002 A. By 2240 h, a depth of 265 mbsf was reached. Extended core barrel coring operations continued for the next 3 days (29 – 31 August), where the hole was advanced at varying rates with good to poor recovery. During this time, the drilling was very slow (e. g., 1 m/h) and recovery in many cores was zero (Cores 302 -M 0004 A- 13 X through 18 X). Different strategies were tried to improve the advance rate. At times, the hole was advanced by washing ahead in an attempt to make faster progress but this strategy was ultimately abandoned after it was found that the washing rate was almost the same as the coring rate. On 31 August from 0200 to 0500 h, for two coring runs in a row no core was recovered. The extended core barrel shoe was switched to a coring shoe for a third attempt at recovery. This coring run cleared a blockage in the bit as evidenced by a large drop in pump pressure. Following this core (with good recovery) and after clearing the blocked bit, core recovery and advancement improved over the next 12 h until basement was reached in Core 302 -M 0004 A- 35 X. Basement penetration was difficult (8 m penetration in 12 h with low core recovery), and a decision was made at 0900 on 1 September to stop coring at a total depth of 428 mbsf and conduct logging in Hole M 0004 A. The logging tools were moved to the rig floor, and the <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> (Formation MicroScanner–Accelerator Porosity Sonde–Natural Gamma Ray Spectroscopy Tool–Scintillation Gamma Ray Tool [FMS-APS-NGT-SGT]) and wireline rig-up proceeded simultaneously. The run into hole commenced at 2130 h. This was done at low speed in order to allow the tools to warm up. Communication with the tool was initially established, and it was lowered to the end of the drill pipe. A computer malfunction caused a communication loss to the tools. The problem was corrected by 0200 h. The tool was powered up, and attempts were made to get the tool to pass through the BHA into the open hole. All efforts failed at the same depth (~ 1366 meters below rig floor [mbrf]); so, while at rest at this depth, the calipers were opened on the FMS to check whether it was free or lodged. The calipers had some movement, which indicated that the <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> was free. The landing ring for the core barrel is the narrowest section of the whole pipe string (95 mm) and lies ~ 6 m above the bit. All the logging tools had been checked through a landing ring dockside in Aberdeen, but there was no hole calibration ring on board that could be used as a second check. Sequentially, four more logging attempts were made. Each time, it was assumed that the logging tools were too large in diameter and the string diameter was further reduced by removing the larger diameter components. The APS bowspring was removed first, followed by the knuckle joint. Finally, only the narrowest velocity-density string was deployed, which failed to clear the bit at the same depth as the previous runs. After the fifth attempt failed, the logging time allocated had been consumed and attempts to log Hole M 0004 A ended at 1045 h on 2 September. After the logging gear was cleared away and the drill string was lifted out of the seabed, preparations were made to start a second hole (Hole M 0004 B) at the site. During preparations, the inner barrel was deployed but did not latch. After an improvised downhole hammer was deployed and worked for 2 h, a short length of core (~ 10 cm of mudstone), which had been partially blocking the BHA, was recovered. By 2030 h on 2 September, the Vidar Viking was at the new position for the next hole (Hole M 0004 B). Coring in Hole M 0004 B started at a depth of 10 mbsf using the extended core barrel because the APC was deemed too risky. After retrieving the first sample, the hole was washed to 20 mbsf for an in situ temperature measurement. The BGS temperature probe was lowered to the base of the hole, pushed into the sediment, and programmed to record the temperature every 5 s. The probe was left to record temperature for 40 min, after which it was retrieved. Plans to wash to a depth of 215 mbsf, core to 230 mbsf, and then wash to 250 mbsf and log were stymied by problems with drilling pressure lines/gauges freezing at – 10 ?C. Because of these problems and the limited time left, the hole was only advanced to a depth of 220 mbsf. Temperature measurements were made at 60 and 100 mbsf. At 0000 h on 4 September, the pipe was pulled to 65 mbsf to prepare for logging. Rigging of the wireline and <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> occurred concurrently, and rig-up of both was completed by 0415 h. The <b>tool</b> <b>string</b> comprised the FMS-Borehole Compensated Sonic (BHC) -NGT-SGT; the choice of tools was such that it coul...|$|E
