It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it {{for the benefit of}} future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

Members of this family, while still massive, are of a {{markedly}} more slender build than other sauropods, such as the titanosaurs and brachiosaurs. All are characterised by long necks and tails and a horizontal posture, with fore limbs shorter than hind limbs. Diplodocids flourished in the Late Jurassic of North America and possibly Africa.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers.

5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Salford's {{early history}} {{is marked by}} {{its status as a}} Royal caput and the {{judicial}} seat of the ancient hundred of Salfordshire, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> lent its name. It was granted a charter by Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester, in about 1230, making Salford a free borough. During the early stages of its growth, Salford was of greater cultural and commercial importance than its neighbour Manchester, although most contemporary sources agree that since the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th centuries that position has been reversed.|$|E
5|$|It interbreeds {{regularly}} and extensively with the mallard, <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is closely related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells {{and come in}} varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches {{the middle of her}} incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates and vegetation.|$|E
