500|$|Each {{season of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall story arc which episodes tie into, {{as well as}} a specific manifestation of evil known as <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bad.</b> As noted by Buffy scholar Roz Kaveney, episodes in the fourth season address authority, order, and the estrangement from the self and others as Buffy and her friends take on new roles after high school. An ongoing theme in the series is Buffy's complex relationship to her destiny as the current Slayer and how she uniquely expresses this role, and this plot element is further explored in season four in general, and in the episode [...] "Restless" [...] in particular.|$|E
500|$|The wolf is [...] {{a common}} motif in the {{foundational}} mythologies and cosmologies of peoples throughout Eurasia and North America (corresponding {{to the historical}} extent of the habitat of the gray wolf). The obvious attribute of the wolf is its nature of a predator, and correspondingly it is strongly associated with danger and destruction, making it {{the symbol of the}} warrior on one hand, and that of the devil on the other. The modern [...] trope of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bad</b> Wolf is a development of this. The wolf holds great importance in the cultures and religions of the nomadic peoples, both of the Eurasian steppe and of the North American Plains. In many cultures, the identification of the warrior with the wolf (totemism) gave rise to the notion of Lycanthropy, the mythical or ritual identification of man and wolf.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times said of Milstead's 1980s films: [...] "Those {{who could}} get past the unremitting weirdness of Divine's {{performance}} discovered that the actor/actress had genuine talent, including a natural sense of comic timing and an uncanny gift for slapstick." [...] In {{a letter to the}} newspaper, Paul Thornquist described him as [...] "one of the few truly radical and essential artists of the century... was an audacious symbol of man's quest for liberty and freedom." [...] People magazine described him as [...] "the Goddess of Gross, the Punk Elephant, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bad</b> Mama of the Midnight Movies... a Miss Piggy for the blissfully depraved." [...] Following his death, fans of Divine visited Prospect Hill Cemetery to pay their respects. In what has become a tradition, fans have been known to leave makeup, food, and graffiti on his grave in memoriam; Waters claims that some fans have sexual intercourse on his grave, which he believes Divine would love.|$|E

500|$|Early {{concepts}} for {{the film}} called for a [...] "fat, batty, cartoon type, self-satisfied" [...] Queen. However, Walt Disney became concerned that such an approach would make the character seem less plausible.

[...] Disney further developed the main plot himself (Ollie Johnston said the film's story was based on the idea that the Queen's character was going to murder [...] "another drawing" [...] and Disney decided to make it appear believable), finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, whom he envisioned as a mixture of Lady Macbeth and <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bad</b> Wolf, and decided to set on [...] "a high collar stately beautiful type" [...] whose [...] "beauty is sinister, mature, plenty of curves – she becomes ugly and menacing when scheming."

However, she believed that Azazel having a family was an unnecessary parallel with the Winchesters that [...] "doesn't quite make sense". After viewing the episode, Brian Tallerico of UGO gave his opinion that the series should follow Buffy the Vampire Slayer format of having a different recurring villain each season.
