40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{numerical}} {{scheme is}} {{applied in the}} study of an acoustic–structure interaction of sound and a vibratory composite structure by finite element method and boundary element method (FEM–BEM) coupling analysis. The composite structure, as described by the finite element model, is made of a fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) shell of a <b>torpedo</b> <b>head.</b> The purpose of this report is to evaluate sound insulation of a FRP shell and to learn how to predict the amount of noise reduction from a sound source to a sonar detector. Two acoustical fields were applied to the FEP <b>torpedo</b> <b>head</b> for numerical calculations. The fields were simulated using BEM, and field calculations were performed inside and outside of the shell structure. The FRP shell was modeled using FEM. The two acoustical fields and the vibratory structure are then coupled at the interface. Various laminated shells with different fiber orientation are investigated. The frequency domain of the BEM–FEM coupling algorithm was applied to analyze the noise reduction of a FRP shell submerged in the selected fluids. Based on the results, we found the fiber arrangement of FRP layer does not obviously affect the results of noise reduction. The influence of fiber arrangement on the vibrating modes is obvious in the noise reduction. Furthermore, a hemisphere-shaped shell that possesses transverse isotropy on the surface seems to produce small levels of sound insulation. It was also found that glycerin is more suitable than water for the interior fluid of the hemisphere, even though the glycerin corresponds to a sound constructive interference at high frequencies. Furthermore, small arched-shaped FRP shells appear to possess a higher noise reduction...|$|E

The destroyer was getting underway, so Wahoo fired a spread of three torpedoes at the moving target from 1200 yd; all missed aft. Another torpedo was fired, which the destroyer avoided by turning away, continuing through 270 degrees of a circle and headed straight for Wahoo, whose position was marked by the wakes of the steam torpedoes. At a range of 800 yd she fired her last bow torpedo. This hit amidships, breaking the destroyer's back. [...] "Apparently her skipper had lost his nerve when he saw our last <b>torpedo</b> <b>heading</b> toward him and put the rudder over to try to miss it, and by swinging himself broadside to it he signed the destroyer's death warrant."

Since other allied {{countries}} helped with logistics, little {{was provided by}} Brazil aside from the ships themselves and the men crewing them.

While on this section of the voyage, Bahia, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Norte, Belmonte and Laurindo Pita spotted an apparent <b>torpedo</b> <b>heading</b> for Belmonte, but it missed. Rio Grande do Norte then fired several shots and depth-charged what the force believed to be a U-boat.
