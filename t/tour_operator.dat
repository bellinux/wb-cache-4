5|$|Bergen Aviation was {{established}} in 1984. Fifty percent of Bergen Aviation was owned by the insurance company Vesta, twenty percent was owned by Vestlandreiser, and the rest was owned by various companies based in Bergen. The airline's first contract was with charter <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> Vestlandsreiser, which was scheduled to begin on 1 May 1986. The contract was secured after Vestlandsreiser on 30 January 1986 had announced that they would terminate their agreement with Swedish airline Transwede, citing the latter's repeated delays and cancellations. The contract consisted of services from Stavanger Airport, Sola; Bergen Airport, Flesland; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; and Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Palma de Mallorca Airport, Spain and Crete, Greece. To operate the charter routes, Bergen Aviation bought a 99-seat Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle from Hispania Líneas Aéreas in January 1986, financed with a loan from Nevi.|$|E
5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter contract {{agreement with the}} Danish <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator the use of two Boeing 720s for 55 million Danish krone (DKK), 10 million lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the main contract started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a minimum price it could accept, largely {{based on the fact}} that Spies did not have an alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October. The company later signed agreements with the Danish tour operators Karavan-rejser and Danmarks Internasjonale Studentkomite (DIS).|$|E

40|$|The Hong Kong tourism {{industry}} has enjoyed {{rapid growth in}} recent years and is becoming one of the pillars in its economy. This paper will consider a Hong Kong tourism supply chain that provides package holidays. <b>Tour</b> <b>Operators</b> are responsible for configuring and pricing their package holiday products. A common and key activity of all these tourist products is a visit to a theme park destination. This tourism supply chain includes three sectors. Theme park and hotel and accommodation providers respectively coordinate with <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> where a horizontal competition exists to optimize their own objectives. We are interested in investigating into (1) what optimal equilibrium states <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> could achieve through competing with each other; (2) the coordinated relationships between <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> and theme park or hotel and accommodation providers; and (3) the differentiations between the effect of quantity competition and the effect of price competition on the three sectors (e. g. <b>tour</b> <b>operators,</b> hotel and accommodation providers, and theme park). These three questions are studied through a tourism supply chain oligopoly game framework: (a) under Cournot model of a coordinated sequential game where <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> achieve a Nash equilibrium through quantity competition; (b) under Bertrand model of a coordinated sequential game where <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> achieve a Nash equilibrium through price competition; and (c) comparing the tourist quantity and the profits of the three sectors between quantity competition and price competition. The most important finding is that <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> are more interested in quantity competition, while the theme park prefers price competition among <b>tour</b> <b>operators.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses an actor-network {{perspective}} on innovation {{to examine the}} introduction of a mandatory product-oriented environmental management system (in Dutch: Product en MilieuZorg or PMZ) for Dutch outbound <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> by the Netherlands Association of <b>Tour</b> <b>Operators</b> (VRO). In-depth interviews and a quantitative analysis of the actions taken by 126 outbound <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> revealed that the introduction of the PMZ was extensively negotiated. The results show the various stages of implementation and three types of tour operators: `unconvinced minor participants¿, `open-minded yet sceptical participants¿, and `loyal actors¿. The analysis also demonstrates that on average, <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> made 13. 6 actions, which is almost three times the minimum requirement (five) set by the VRO. Between them, the 126 <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> have undertaken a total of 1710 actions, of which over 87 % concern the environmental dimension of sustainability. Unquestionably, the introduction of PMZ helped <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> to identify some of the environmental consequences of their operations, and to single out and implement environmental friendly initiatives. However, the rather general criteria and lax entry requirements at this stage led to an abundance of proposed actions by <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> that were often `soft¿ and indeterminate.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> and their existing tourism destinations. The intent {{is to help the}} <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> plan strategically for building the sustainability of their destinations. A Framework for Strategic Sustainability Development, based on scientific consensus, was used to structure this work. Interviews with <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> and tourism experts gave practical insight complementing the literature review and case studies analysed during the research. The key findings were the need for <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> to: consider a whole-systems perspective; cooperate with the tourism destination to build a common vision of success and a clear understanding of sustainability; and to prioritise their actions based on achieving the vision. From this the authors proposed guidance notes to assist <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> in addressing these barriers. The paper concludes that <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> can {{play a major role in}} building a sustainable society while perpetuating the tourism industry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore whether <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> work with CSR within their {{organizations}} in Mexico, and describe how they implement it as well as why they work with it. Furthermore, the paper will analyze similarities and differences between the Swedish and Mexican <b>tour</b> <b>operator’s</b> CSR strategies as well as the reasons for this. Lastly, recommendations will be made to the Mexican <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> on how they can gain knowledge from Swedish <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> on CSR strategies and the development of these. The theoretical framework contains descriptions of theories on strategy, competitive advantage, the CSR Pyramid, stakeholder theory as well as CSR in the context of developing countries, which are all relevant theories for the issue studied as well as for answering the research questions. The empirical findings that have been collected through interviews with two Swedish, and two Mexican <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> address the respective <b>tour</b> <b>operator’s</b> work with CSR in Mexico. In the analysis the theoretical framework has been put in relation to the empirical evidence. The analysis consists of how and why CSR activities are implemented in the respective organization. It also addresses the difficulties <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> from developed countries face when implementing CSR on destinations in developing countries. Lastly, our conclusions show that there are several ways of implementing CSR in developing countries, as well as different views on why taking social responsibility within the tourism industry is important. Moreover, the main reason for this divergence lies in different perspectives, which has also been shown to be a contributing factor to the challenges faced by Swedish <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> in the context of a developing country. In the end of the thesis recommendations will be made to Mexican firms on how to develop, and implement CSR strategies more successfully as well as recommendations for further research within the field of CSR in developing countries...|$|R
