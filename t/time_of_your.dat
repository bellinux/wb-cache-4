500|$|After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day {{began to}} work on a new album in 1997.

It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of [...] "Good Riddance (<b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life)" [...] won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video.

500|$|After {{taking a}} break from touring in {{promotion}} of the band's fourth album Insomniac (1995), Green Day recorded the more experimental Nimrod (1997). The record, which delved into a more wide variety of genres including folk, ska, and surf rock, featured the unprecedented acoustic hit [...] "Good Riddance (<b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life)". [...] Vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong recalled that the song's stylistic departure from the group's earlier work made him anxious about the song's release: [...] "I was scared for that song to come out...because it was such a vulnerable song, to put that song out and it was like which way will it end up going? [...] It was really exciting and it kind of sparked more in us as songwriters to expand on that." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Nimrod touches upon more {{reflective}} themes not present on earlier Green Day albums. [...] Much {{of the album}} illustrates Armstrong's sentiments on growing up and {{his role as a}} husband and father. [...] "The Grouch" [...] centers on Armstrong's fears of [...] "wasting away, getting fat, becoming impotent, and losing his ideals." [...] On [...] "Walking Alone", he reflects on old friends from his childhood, and notes that he is [...] "too drunk to figure out they're fading away." [...] Armstrong discusses the struggle to stay sober on [...] "Hitchin' a Ride". [...] "Good Riddance (<b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life)" [...] was inspired by Armstrong's failed relationship with a woman that ended when she joined the Peace Corps in 1990. [...] The same woman is also the subject of [...] "She" [...] from Dookie, [...] "Whatsername" [...] from American Idiot (2004) and [...] "Amanda" [...] from ¡Tré!.|$|E

That May he {{recorded}} his last session of songs, [...] "Happy Go Lucky Me" [...] and [...] "Banjo Boy", the former of which peaked at number 40 in the UK Singles Chart. He then spent the summer season at the Queen's Theatre in Blackpool in The <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Life—a performance which was also broadcast by the BBC. One of the acts in the show was the singer Yana, with whom Formby had an affair, made easier because of Beryl's absence from the theatre through illness. His final televised performance, a 35-minute BBC programme, The Friday Show: George Formby, was aired on 16 December. Bret considers the programme to be Formby's [...] "greatest performance—it was certainly his most sincere", although reviewing for The Guardian, Mary Crozier thought it [...] "too slow". She {{went on to say}} [...] "George Formby is really a music-hall star, and it needs the warmth and sociability of the theatre to bring out his full appeal". Beryl's illness was worsening. Worn down by the strain, and feeling the need to escape, Formby took the part of Mr Wu in Aladdin in Bristol, having turned down a more lucrative part in Blackpool.|$|E
