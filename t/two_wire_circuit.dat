5000|$|A typical {{balanced}} cable contains <b>two</b> identical <b>wires,</b> which are twisted {{together and then}} wrapped with a third conductor (foil or braid) {{that acts as a}} shield. The <b>two</b> <b>wires</b> form a <b>circuit</b> carrying the audio signal; one wire is in phase with respect to the source signal, the other wire is reversed in polarity. The in-phase wire is called non-inverting, positive or [...] "hot" [...] while the out-of-phase wire is called inverting, phase-inverted, anti-phase, negative or [...] "cold". The hot and cold connections are often shown as In+ and In− ("in plus" [...] and [...] "in minus") on circuit diagrams.|$|R

5000|$|In AC systems the <b>two</b> <b>wires</b> of a <b>circuit</b> {{alternate}} polarity {{many times}} per second. In electrical power systems, all wires carrying the same instantaneous polarity {{at any moment}} will have a common identifying marking scheme, such as wire color. Depending on the conventions used for wiring the power system, the color coding or other marking may also indicate additional properties of the conductor, such as its role as neutral in a power circuit. In a polyphase AC system, identifying the wires belonging to a common phase is important to ensure proper operation of the circuit.|$|R

50|$|In the 1890s and 1900s the Telegraph {{authorities}} {{were faced with}} the dilemma of modernising the old telegraph systems, then in use for 40 or more years, to new voice telephone systems. The cost to convert the hundreds of kilometers of overhead 'one wire' systems to 'two wire' for telephone would have been enormous. Extra wire, crossarms, and transposition of wires to reduce crosstalk all added to the conversion cost. Where conversion could be justified by high traffic levels, meaning high income from those busy lines, they were quickly converted to <b>two</b> <b>wire</b> telephone <b>circuits,</b> {{but in many cases}} the cost could not be justified. A method was invented whereby a telephone circuit could be established using the one wire and earth return method similar to the telegraph circuit method. The telegraph could be retained as this was still accepted as the basic method for transferring simple data someone similar to SMS text messages versus voice calls today.|$|R

50|$|Telegraph {{lines in}} rural areas {{typically}} used one <b>wire</b> earth return <b>circuits,</b> this is a system whereby one conductor is installed on insulators mounted on telegraph poles. The circuit return current travels back via the earth to the origin battery. One wire on a pole was very economical to build and one <b>wire</b> <b>circuits</b> expanded rapidly to remote rural communities. Telephone circuits as distinct from telegraph <b>circuits</b> ideally use <b>two</b> <b>wires</b> to provide a noise free line. Once telephone communications became more commonplace in big cities there became more interest in voice telephone lines for long distance communications to smaller centers remote from the cities. Voice messages improved the correctness of the information and could allow more messages to be sent including direct person to person communications. Telegraphs typically operated between two telegraph offices and the messages written on a telegraph note and hand delivered to the recipient.|$|R

In case of a single <b>wire</b> the electrical <b>circuit</b> has to be closed by the water itself, giving rise to a larger resistance and corrosion of the electrodes. In case of <b>two</b> <b>wires</b> no electric current has to be sent through the water, but the twin wires, which cause a short-circuit whenever they come into contact with each other, complicate the construction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{the use of}} Auxiliary {{power supply}} (APS) systems to {{energize}} low power rating appliances (e. g. televisions, water dispensers, etc.) and lighting (e. g. CFL lamps) has become pervasive in countries where long power rationing schemes are applied. Although the existing APS systems offer overload protection, it cannot be directly connected to the existing electric circuit unless heavy loads such as refrigerators, microwaves, washing machines, electric water heaters, etc. are disconnected {{in the absence of}} the grid. This is usually overcome by separating the <b>wiring</b> <b>circuits</b> feeding these loads from those devoted for lighting and other low power loads like TV and stereo sets, food processors, etc. However, such a separation is very costly and sometimes infeasible in places with narrow <b>wires</b> tubing <b>circuit</b> if a new by side <b>wiring</b> <b>circuit</b> is to be installed. This paper details a module developed from on-shelf cheap components to wirelessly make heavy loads disconnect themselves as soon as the grid is off. The core idea behind our load self-disconnection module is inspired by the low price remote power plugs which use the 434 MHz Radio Frequency (RF) technology to remotely on/off as many as 256 electric appliances up to a 30 M distance away. Thus, no transmission obstacle, wide coverage and no nearby products interference are achieved as results. Index Terms — Remote control system, load self-disconnection...|$|R
