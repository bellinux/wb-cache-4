40|$|The early-diverging eudicot order Trochodendrales {{contains}} only two monospecific genera, <b>Tetracentron</b> and Trochodendron. Although an extensive fossil record {{indicates that the}} clade is perhaps 100 million years old and was widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere during the Paleogene and Neogene, the two extant genera are both narrowly distributed in eastern Asia. Recent phylogenetic analyses strongly support a clade of Trochodendrales, Buxales, and Gunneridae (core eudicots), but complete plastome analyses do not resolve the relationships among these groups with strong support. However, plastid phylogenomic analyses have not included data for <b>Tetracentron.</b> To better resolve basal eudicot relationships and to clarify when the two extant genera of Trochodendrales diverged, we sequenced the complete plastid genome of <b>Tetracentron</b> sinense using Illumina technology. The <b>Tetracentron</b> and Trochodendron plastomes possess the typical gene content and arrangement that characterize most angiosperm plastid genomes, but both genomes have the same unusual âˆ¼ 4 kb expansion of the inverted repeat region to include five genes (rpl 22, rps 3, rpl 16, rpl 14, and rps 8) that are normally found in the large single-copy region. Maximum likelihood analyses of an 83 -gene, 88 taxon angiosperm data set yield an identical tree topology as previous plastid-based trees, and moderately support the sister relationship between Buxaceae and Gunneridae. Molecular dating analyses suggest that <b>Tetracentron</b> and Trochodendron diverged between 44 - 30 million years ago, which is congruent with the fossil record of Trochodendrales and with previous estimates of the divergence time of these two taxa. We also characterize 154 simple sequence repeat loci from the <b>Tetracentron</b> sinense and Trochodendron aralioides plastomes that will be useful in future studies of population genetic structure for these relict species, {{both of which are}} of conservation concern...|$|R
40|$|Leaves superficially {{similar to}} Cercidiphyllum have been {{commonly}} reported from the Paleogene of the Northern Hemisphere. These leaves include various shapes with acrodromous veins, and with crenate to nearly entire margin. My recent {{investigation of the}} fine venation character reveals that Paleogene leaves referred once to Cercidiphyllum from Japan contain various genera such as Cocculus, Disanthus, Populus and <b>Tetracentron.</b> Leaves of Cocculus and Disanthus with no marginal glands are easily excluded from Cercidiphyllum-like fossils. On the other hand, leaves of three genera, Populus, <b>Tetracentron</b> and Cercidiphyllum, are liable to confuse each other. Populus leaves are usually small in areolation intruded by thick veinlets with asterate branching, while leaves of Cercidiphyllum and <b>Tetracentron</b> are mostly large in areolation intruded by thin, irregularly branching veinlets. There are, however, some marked differences in the secondary looping and venation within the teeth area between the typical leaves of Cercidiphyllum and <b>Tetracentron,</b> but their feutures contain many exceptions. The nature of marginal glands is a most note-worthy distinction between these two genera. The combination of the above-noted characters can lead to accurrate generic assignment of "Cercidiphyllum" leaves in the Paleogene...|$|R

5000|$|Terminal Inflorescence in erect, {{aggregated}} racemiforms (botryoid {{or small}} panicles) (Trochodendron) or defined, axillary, multi-floral amentoid spikes with the flower in whorls of 4 (<b>Tetracentron).</b> Bracts and bracteoles present or absent.|$|R
50|$|Pollination is {{probably}} myiophyllous, even though <b>Tetracentron</b> shows a clear anemophilous syndrome. The pulverulent seeds are dispersed {{by the wind}} (anemochory). Trochodendron is present in both protandrous and protogynous forms that are self-compatible.|$|R
30|$|In summary, we {{investigated}} the floral biology, breeding system and pollination ecology of <b>Tetracentron</b> sinense Oliv. The occurrence of successful wind and insect pollination indicates that T. sinense is ambophilous, {{and the maintenance}} of ambophily may attribute to the decrease of population density. The breeding system of T. sinense is mixed with self-pollination and out-crossing, with no indication of agamospermy. Outcrossing predominated in the mating system, and autonomous self-pollination in its breeding system may provide reproductive assurance for the population maintenance. During flowering and pollination in natural population of <b>Tetracentron</b> sinense, the decrease of population density and harsh environmental condition might be one of crucial reasons resulting in endanger for this species.|$|R

40|$|The {{sporogenesis}} {{and development}} of gametophytes in <b>Tetracentron</b> sinense Oliv. were studied with light microscopy. The anther has four microsporangia; its primary anther wall consists of an epidermis, an endothecium, one or two middle layers and one glandular tapetum. Simultaneous cytokinesis follows meiosis, forming a tetrahedral tetrad. Mature pollen grains are two-celled {{at the time of}} anther dehiscence. Its ovule is anatropous, bitegmic and crassinucellate; the development of the female gametophyte is of the monosporic 8 -nucleate Polygonum type. Signifi cantly, some striking features were fi rst found in T. sinense: (1) anther dehiscence occurs soon after the endothecium fi brously thickens and the intersporangial septum degenerates; (2) tapetum degeneration is retarded, persisting up to the stage of two-celled pollen grain; (3) a few cellular events such as the vacuolization and the contraction and deformation of the pollen mother cell (PMC) and microspore are not normal at the PMC, dyad and tetrad stages. The abnormalities during male reproduction might be one of important factors resulting in the poor natural regeneration of T. sinense.

30|$|<b>Tetracentron</b> sinense Oliv. is a {{deciduous}} {{tree with}} a catkin-like inflorescence, {{and placed in}} its own family, Tetracentraceae previously (Fu & Bartholomew 2001), or more commonly in Trochodendraceae together with the monotypic Trochodendron (Martyn & Peter 2007). This species is today mainly distributed in south-central China (Fu & Bartholomew 2001), and scattered within a region 1100 â€“ 3 500 Â m above sea level (Martyn & Peter 2007). Due to its rarity and poor ability to regenerate naturally, it is considered 'rareâ€™ according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) (Fu 1992). Since its vesselless wood is quite rare in angiosperm suggesting primitiveness, the species has received much taxonomic attention (Chen et al. 2007, Angiosperm Phylogeny Group 2009). However, studies on the reproductive biology of T. sinense are relatively scarce (Gan et al. 2012).

40|$|International audienceFossil wood {{specimens}} {{from the}} late Early-early Middle Jurassic of Jameson Land, Eastern Greenland, have several unexpected features: tracheids of irregular size and shape, thinly pitted ray cell walls, heterogeneous rays, partially scalariform radial pitting, both areolate and simple pits, and pitted elements associated with rays. These characters diverge markedly from those typical of Jurassic wood, which usually conform to those of modern conifers. Although this combination of features is not encountered in any extant angiosperm, each has been documented in one or several extant homoxylous angiosperms, particularly Amborella, Trochodendron, and <b>Tetracentron.</b> As these wood specimens are not found in connection with any reproductive part, {{it is impossible to}} confidently assign them to the angiosperms. If a Jurassic angiosperm did exist, however, it might well have had a similar wood.

40|$|The {{uppermost}} Eocene Florissant Formation, Rocky Mountains, Colorado, {{has yielded}} numerous insect, vertebrate, and plant fossils. Three previous comprehensive palynological studies investigated sections of lacustrine deposits of the Florissant Formation and documented {{the response of}} plant communities to volcanic eruptive phases but overall found little change in plant composition throughout the investigated sections. These studies reported up to 150 pollen and spore phenotypes. In the present paper we used a taxonomic approach to the investigation of dispersed pollen and spores of the Florissant Formation. Sediment samples from the shale units containing macrofossils were investigated using light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The general picture of the palynoflora is in agreement with previous studies. However, the combined LM and SEM investigation provides important complementary information to previous LM studies. While a fairly large amount of previous pollen determinations could be confirmed, the purported taxonomic affinities of several pollen phenotypes need to be revised. For example, pollen referred to as Podocarpus or Podocarpidites sp. belongs to the Pinaceae Cathaya, Malus/Pyrus actually belongs to Dryadoideae, pollen of the form genus Boehlensipollis referred to as Proteaceae/Sapindaceae/Elaeagnaceae or Cardiospermum belongs to Sapindaceae but not to Cardiospermum, and pollen of Persicarioipollis sp. B with previously assumed affinities to Polygonaceae actually belongs to Thymelaeaceae. Pandaniidites and one type of Malvacipollis cannot be linked with Pandanaceae and Malvaceae. A few taxa are new records for Florissant (Ebenaceae: Diospyros; Mernispermaceae; Trochodendraceae: <b>Tetracentron).</b> In general, SEM investigations complement the LM palynological studies and improve the identification of dispersed pollen and spores and enable integration of data from dispersed fossil pollen into {{a wide range of}} comparative morphological, taxonomic, evolutionary, biogeographic, and phylogenetic studies. 2009 - 435...|$|R
