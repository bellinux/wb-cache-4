40|$|Note: <b>Title</b> <b>page</b> <b>missing</b> in manuscript. A {{series of}} clastic sediments nearly two miles in {{thickness}} is exposed in the Beaverlodge Lake area in northern Saskatchewan. It overlies unconformably {{a complex of}} highly metamorphosed and deformed ancient rocks. The series consists of first, a basal conglomerate composed of angular fragments, second, a succession of "red" siltstone, sandstone, and arkose, all of which contain pebbles and conglomerate bands and, third, coarse loosely consolidated conglomerates composed of well-rounded fragments. Because of its similarity to the Athabaska Sandstone of Keweenawan Age, south of Lake Athabaska, the series is called the Athabaska Series. Interbedded with sandstone in a zone about halfway up the series are several bodies of highly amygdaloidal basic lava flows. Cutting the structure are narrow basic dykes. The Athabaska Series {{is believed to have}} been deposited rapidly under shallow water conditions in a semi-arid temperate climate. Though the series has been deformed and severely faulted, the sediments are in some places scarcely consolidated...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{represents the}} first step in developing a statement of health policy designed {{to address the needs of}} the population to the turn of the century. While there is a lonq tradition of reviews and planning Frameworks For particular health services or client groups this is the first attempt to view health policy as an integrated whole and in a broader perspective than simply health services. This is a consultative document and it is aimed at a wide audience - the community at large. For these reasons it is not prescriptive or technical in its approach but rather, suggests t h e broad direction and pre - requisites or effective measures to control and combat contemporary health problems. It is intended to generate discussion, not just among those immediately concerned with health policy or health services but among the community generally most of whom also have reason to be concerned about health, either as patients or as tax-payers. In the light of this discussion it is hoped that a broad consensus will emerge on the future direction and content of health policy. *note <b>title</b> <b>page</b> <b>missing...</b>|$|E

This work explores three centuries of childbirth, attempting to recreate the experience of each time period for the reader. My research focused on three main research questions: What changes have there been in pain management techniques for labor and delivery {{over the last three}} centuries? In what ways have birthing methods changed since the 18 thcentury? How have the technology and instruments related to childbirth improved since the 1700 's? The methodology of this study was a systematic review of historical literature from the 1700 's to 1900 's using mainly secondary sources. This project is significant because {{it is important to be}} knowledgeable of history in order to avoid mistakes made in the past. It is also important to use knowledge from the past to continue to improve outcomes in the future, and prevent history from repeating itself. The conclusion from this work is that women lost the power of childbirth with the medicalization of the event. However, with the help of midwives, women have the ability to gain back control of birthing babies to their rightful owners. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E
