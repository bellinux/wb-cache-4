5|$|Theses 30–34 {{deal with}} the false {{certainty}} Luther believed the indulgence preachers offered Christians. Since no one knows whether a person is <b>truly</b> repentant, a letter assuring a person of his forgiveness is dangerous. In theses 35 and 36, he attacks the idea that an indulgence makes repentance unnecessary. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the <b>truly</b> repentant person, who alone may benefit from the indulgence, has already received the only benefit the indulgence provides. <b>Truly</b> repentant Christians have already, according to Luther, been forgiven of the penalty as well as the guilt of sin. In thesis 37, he states that indulgences are not necessary for Christians to receive all the benefits provided by Christ. Theses 39 and 40 argue that indulgences make true repentance more difficult. True repentance desires God's punishment of sin, but indulgences teach one to avoid punishment, since that is the purpose of purchasing the indulgence.|$|E
5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to <b>truly</b> understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to <b>truly</b> understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance and acceptance of one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E
5|$|Although never <b>truly</b> domesticated, a {{small number}} of jungle cats have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, suggesting that they may have been used to help control rodent populations.|$|E

5|$|Campy performances, cheesy special effects, and downright awful {{dialogue}} all {{contribute to}} making Jaws 3 a <b>truly</b> dismal experience for just about everyone.

5|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{licensed}} vaccine for HIV or AIDS. The most effective vaccine trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction {{in the risk of}} transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a <b>truly</b> effective vaccine. Further trials of the RV 144 vaccine are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Diaminocarbenes do not <b>truly</b> dimerise, {{but rather}} form the dimer by {{reaction}} via formamidinium salts, a protonated precursor species.

5|$|Como's Hollywood-type {{good looks}} {{earned him a}} seven-year {{contract}} with 20th Century-Fox in 1943.
