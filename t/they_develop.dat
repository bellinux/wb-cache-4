5|$|Like all ants, banded sugar ants begin life as eggs. If the egg is fertilised, the ant {{becomes a}} female; if not, {{it will become}} a male. <b>They</b> <b>develop</b> through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through a larval and pupal stage before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Like other ants, Myrmecia ants {{begin as}} an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant becomes a diploid female; if not, {{it becomes a}} haploid male. <b>They</b> <b>develop</b> through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through larval and pupal stages before emerging as adults.|$|E
5|$|Set in Shandong, {{the story}} {{revolves}} around a Chinese scholar, Wang, who becomes infatuated by a demon in disguise as {{a beautiful young}} maiden. <b>They</b> <b>develop</b> a romantic relationship which goes awry after Wang discovers her true identity. Thereafter, a Taoist priest's skills are put {{to the task of}} exorcising the demon; a fight between good and evil ensues.|$|E

5000|$|Goldrich co-founded a {{real estate}} {{development}} and management company known as Goldrich & Kest Industries with Sol B. Kest, a Holocaust survivor. In 1964, <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> Eldorado, a residential building located at 4425 Ventura Canyon Avenue in Sherman Oaks. <b>They</b> also <b>developed</b> Sutton Terrance, another residential building located at 6251 Coldwater Canyon Avenue in North Hollywood. Another apartment complex <b>they</b> <b>developed,</b> Sepulveda Village in Mission Hills, comprised 18 buildings, with the reception located at 10023 Sepulveda Boulevard. A year later, in 1965, <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> Northridge Village Townhouses, an apartment complex in Northridge, California. In 1981, they purchased hotels in Tenderloin, San Francisco.|$|R

5|$|The {{flowers of}} all banksias arise in a spiral pattern around the flower spike axis; however in Banksia coccinea <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> into {{distinctive}} vertical columns, which are strongly accentuated by large gaps in between. Paired in columns, the red styles {{contrast with the}} grey-white perianth making a striking flower spike.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E
5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames, suggested that <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired about developing a new game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' request for a new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: The New Order. Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E
5000|$|The company manages [...] "four luxury planned {{communities}} in Alabama, Florida and California." [...] In 1985, <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> their first community: Oakbridge in Lakeland, Florida.

5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Brisco was {{developed}} by Boam and Cuse {{at the request of}} Fox executive Bob Greenblatt. Impressed by the duo's work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Greenblatt suggested <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> a series that bore the tone and style of vintage movie serials. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. Brisco {{was one of the last}} television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros. Western backlot. Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Landsea {{noted that}} the efforts to reanalyze the Atlantic {{hurricane}} database {{will not be able}} to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken. Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid-1960s. Moreover, newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002. Thus large, long-term 'trends' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any real change in the climate in which <b>they</b> <b>develop.</b>|$|E

5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|Larvae hatch {{from their}} egg casing {{in two to}} six weeks. They are born carnivores, feeding instinctively on small {{invertebrates}} that move in their field of vision. Food items include small aquatic crustaceans (cladocerans, copepods and ostracods), aquatic dipterans and tadpoles. As <b>they</b> <b>develop,</b> they naturally feed upon larger prey. To increase their chances for survival, some individuals grow bigger heads and become cannibals, and feed upon their own brood mates.|$|E

5|$|Like every ant, {{the life}} of a jack jumper ant starts from an egg. If the egg is fertilised, the ant will be a female (diploid); if not, it will become a male (haploid). <b>They</b> <b>develop</b> through {{complete}} metamorphosis, meaning that they pass through a larva and pupa stage before emerging as an adult. Cocoons that are isolated from the colony are able to shed their pupal skin before hatching, allowing themselves to advance to full pigmentation. Newborns can also eclose (emerge from their pupa stage) without assistance from other ants. Once born, jack jumper ants can identify distinct tasks, an obvious primitive trait Myrmecia ants are known for.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{is a rare}} but {{life-threatening}} {{state of}} extreme hypothyroidism. It may occur in those who {{are known to have}} hypothyroidism when <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> another illness, but it can be the first presentation of hypothyroidism. The illness is characterized by very low body temperature without shivering, confusion, a slow heart rate and reduced breathing effort. There may be physical signs suggestive of hypothyroidism, such as skin changes or enlargement of the tongue.|$|E
5|$|Shruti {{lives with}} her widowed mother and brother and her {{neighbour}} Brahmi, a software engineer, who pesters her to marry him. A corrupt police officer named Pasupathy, who works for Ali Bhai, is attracted to Shruti. He is determined to make her his mistress, undeterred by Shruti's multiple rejections. After Pandu kills a henchman of Narayana, he is confronted by Pasupathy {{and is able to}} prevent Shruti from being molested. She meets him the next day to thank him, and Pandu introduces himself as a self-employed person who undertakes any activity for money. <b>They</b> <b>develop</b> unspoken romantic feelings for each other angering Pasupathy.|$|E

50|$|The Lumbee oral {{tradition}} says that <b>they</b> <b>developed</b> {{as a people}} from Native American ancestors, including refugees of other tribes, such as the Cheraw and Tuscarora, most of whom left the Carolinas in the early 18th century. They likely also intermarried with the free people of color of the area, absorbing their children into their culture. <b>They</b> <b>developed</b> in the antebellum era {{through a process of}} ethnogenesis.|$|R
5|$|Spots {{were found}} to {{correspond}} to three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. <b>They</b> <b>develop</b> because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed {{in the vicinity of}} moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here <b>they</b> <b>develop</b> and grow, remaining for about three months before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
