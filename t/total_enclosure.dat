40|$|Roller blind boxes, {{also know}} as blind boxes or roller casings, are quite popular {{elements}} in Italian buildings, as <b>total</b> <b>enclosures</b> for the roller blinds. The boxes quite frequently show a removable face, {{for reasons of}} access, {{and in some cases}} air ventilation vents. The peculiar acoustical behaviour of the boxes is due to the presence of apertures and leaks and for this reason manufacturers are focusing their attention on the improvement of their sound insulation performances. An experimental investigation was carried out by sound intensity measurements in a reverberation room to determine the sound insulation of various steel blind boxes. The initial design showed not satisfying sound insulation ratings. A light, sound absorbing inner lining of the casing demonstrated to be even more efficient than a traditional, denser sound insulating treatment, particularly when noticeable leaks were present at the access faces of the box. Suitable absorbing materials such as mineralized wood fibres and polymeric foams were chosen and compared achieving up to 5 dB of improvement for Rw. Analyses of the frequency behaviour of the sound insulation and of the intensity maps were performed. The influence of leaks was finally estimated, demonstrating that a proper sealing could lead up to a further 10 dB performance rise...|$|R

40|$|With the {{uncertain}} cost of energy, optimizing {{the use of}} air in process dryers, ovens and air pollution control systems is critical to your bottom line. The revived emphasis on air management through the entire process, from plant make-up air heating systems to pollution control system exhaust, provides many opportunities to save energy and cut operating costs. This presentation includes an overview of good air management practices used to optimize energy use in your process and plant. One {{of the most important}} benefits of the more stringent air pollution control regulations throughout the world is the focus on better use and conservation of our natural resources. Through the efforts of many of the world's finest engineers and scientists the world is now realizing the benefits of an environmentally friendly approach to manufacturing. These benefits, which include more efficient process operation, less waste generation and reduced emissions, have produced the unforeseen benefit of reduced production costs and higher quality products. Process dryers and ovens are used in the manufacture {{of a wide variety of}} products produced by the companies represented at the Industrial Energy Technology Conference. This equipment is installed and operating in facilities that produce printed materials, packaging materials, adhesive tapes, pharmaceutical diagnostic materials, coated papers & films, foil laminations, electronic media, and photographic & x-ray films. They are also used extensively in the food industry. The products manufactured include baked goods, cereals, pet food, tobacco, and many other products. Ovens are used to bake and cure surface coated materials. Such as building siding, window frames, window blinds, automotive parts, wood products, and miscellaneous metal parts. More stringent environmental regulations are also impacting the design and operation of coating and food processes. Today air pollution control devices are used on many of the above applications to control the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and odors. As emission limits have decreased, the use of permanent <b>total</b> <b>enclosures</b> PTE's are becoming a standard part of the process line design. These enclosures are used to obtain 100 % capture of the solvents used in the process. In addition, concerns over solvent concentrations in ovens along with concerns over exposure limits to employees have combined to drive process exhaust flows ever higher. Increasing process exhaust flows has been the common approach to addressing process and environmental issues. This increase in exhaust flows has resulted in significant increases in energy use and operating costs...|$|R

40|$|Power {{control is}} {{becoming}} a key challenge for effectively operating a modern data center. In addition to reducing operating costs, precisely controlling power consumption is an essential way to avoid system failures caused by power capacity overload or overheating due to increasing high server density. Control-theoretic techniques have recently shown a lot of promise for power management because of their better control performance and theoretical guarantees on control accuracy and system stability. However, existing work oversimplifies the problem by controlling a single server independently from others. As a result, at the enclosure level where multiple high-density servers are correlated by common workloads and share common power supplies, power cannot be shared to improve application performance. In this paper, we propose an enclosure-level power controller that shifts power among servers based on their performance needs, while controlling the <b>total</b> power of <b>enclosure</b> to be lower than a constraint. Our controller features a rigorous design based on an optimal Multi-Input-Multi-Output (MIMO) control theory. Empirical results demonstrate that our controller outperforms two state-ofthe-art controllers, by having better application performance and more accurate power control. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of phytoplankton to nutrient loading and planktivorous fish additions {{was investigated in}} large experimental enclosures installed in lac Croche at the Station de Biologie des Laurentides de l'Universite de Montreal. During the summer period (July and August), phytoplankton biomass significantly increased with fertilization {{and the presence of}} fish in the deep, thermally stratified, enclosures. The presence of fish increased algal biomass, particularly under the fertilized conditions. In the shallow, thermally mixed <b>enclosures,</b> <b>total</b> phytoplankton biomass was significantly affected by fertilization but not by the presence of fish. The taxonomic composition at both the species and the division levels differed in all treatments. In the deep stratified enclosures, both the addition of nutrient (p. 001) and fish (p =. 003) favored a large increase in Chlorophyta biomass which was composed of 1 or 2 species. Pyrrhophytes increased slightly with the presence of fish. In the shallow enclosures, nutrient additions significantly affected the division composition of total algal biomass, whereas presence of fish did not. The presence of planktivorous fish influenced phytoplankton community structure by modulating total algal biomass, the distribution of biomass according to size classes and the overall taxonomic composition. The impacts of fish were more numerous in the deep than in the shallow enclosures. Thermal stratification may thus be an important factor influencing the impact of planktivorous fish on phytoplankton. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground The {{essential}} enzyme dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) is exquisitely specific for dUTP and {{is critical}} for the fidelity of DNA replication and repair. dUTPase hydrolyzes dUTP to dUMP and pyrophosphate, simultaneously reducing dUTP levels and providing the dUMP for dTTP biosynthesis. A high cellular dTTP: dUTP ratio is essential to avoid uracil incorporation into DNA, which would lead to strand breaks and cell death. We report the first detailed atomic-resolution structure of a eukaryotic dUTPase, human dUTPase, and complexes with the uracil-containing deoxyribonucleotides, dUMP, dUDP and dUTP. Results The crystal structure reveals that each subunit of the dUTPase trimer folds into an eight-stranded jelly-roll β barrel, with the C-terminal β strands interchanged among the subunits. The structure {{is similar to that}} of the E. coli enzyme, despite low sequence homology between the two enzymes. The nucleotide complexes reveal a simple and elegant way for a β hairpin to recognize specific nucleic acids: uracil is inserted into a distorted antiparallel β hairpin and hydrogen bonds entirely to main-chain atoms. This interaction mimics DNA base pairing, selecting uracil over cytosine and sterically precluding thymine and ribose binding. Residues from the second subunit interact with the phosphate groups and a glycine-rich C-terminal tail of the third subunit caps the substrate-bound active site, causing <b>total</b> complementary <b>enclosure</b> of substrate. To our knowledge, this is the first documented instance of all three subunits of a trimeric enzyme supplying residues that are critical to enzyme function and catalysis. Conclusions The dUTPase nucleotide-binding sites incorporate some features of other nucleotide-binding proteins and protein kinases, but seem distinct in sequence and architecture. The novel nucleic acid base recognition motif appears ancient; higher order structures, such as the ribosome, may have evolved from a motif of this kind. These uracil–β-hairpin interactions are an obvious way for peptides to become early coenzymes in an RNA world, providing a plausible link to the protein–DNA world. Within the β hairpin, there is a tyrosine corner motif that normally specifies β-arch connections; this tyrosine motif was apparently recruited to discriminate against ribonucleotides, more recently than the evolution of the β hairpin itself...|$|R

Therefore, we want to study the effects different capture-slaughtering system on fallow deer haematic parameters and meat quality. 28 fallow deer, bearing to the wild population living in San Rossore Natural Park were submitted to blood drawing: 12 deer in the enclosure after capture operations and 16 deer after being killed by a gamekeeper while they were standing free on a pasture. Blood was collected by vacuumtainer, centrifuged and deep frozen; AST, ALT, CK, cholesterol, trygliceride, glucose, total protein, albumin, BUN and cortisol were determined. In the enclosure 4 deer were killed {{and a total of}} 8 carcasses were aged for 7 days. The loin, excised from the carcass, was analysed for: pHu, meat colour, water holding capacity, tenderness, chemical composition. Data were analysed by non parametric methods to test the effect of the different treatment. As regard blood analyses a higher content of AST, ALT and CK was observed in the animals in the enclosure (510 vs. 191, 96 vs. 51, 5337 vs. 1346, for AST, ALT, CK, respectively). Cortisol and cholesterol content did not differ between the two groups. Triglycerides and glucose were fundamentally higher in the animals in the <b>enclosure.</b> <b>Total</b> protein, albumin and BUN were slightly higher in the animals in the enclosure (albumin statistically different: 3. 5 vs. 3. 1). pHu showed a normal meat acidification: however, observing the data, pHu of one fallow deer killed in the enclosure was higher than 6. 0, threshold value for the onset of the DFD syndrome. Meat colour is rather dark; meat colour of the high pHu-animal resulted very dark. Drip loss and cooking loss were quite low; water-holding capacity of the high pHu-animal was very high, confirming a behaviour like DFD meat. Shear force was very low, thus meat was tender. Chemical composition showed a very low ether extract content. It is possible to conclude that capture operations can affect blood parameters, inducing stress in captured animals but without influencing meat quality that shows good characteristics. Nevertheless, the observation of one animal with a high meat pHu and with a syndrome like-DFD, may suggest a further deepening, also with the aim to test the capture operations so to avoid any possible stress to the animals that must be slaughtered...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2006 / 07 in Metema district, North Gondar Zone of Amhara region, Ethiopia, with the objectives to characterize the existing rangeland and to determine the feed resources utilization practices, to assess the natural grazing land condition based on herbaceous, woody and soil condition and to evaluate the chemical composition of major livestock feed resources of the area. A single-visit formal survey, group discussions and visual observations are used to collect the primary information and secondary sources are also used in livestock feed resources assessment of the district. A total of 140 respondents from 7 kebeles were selected for interviewing by stratified random sampling techniques. To assess the range conditions, the samples were collected by classifying the district into cotton–livestock and sesame–livestock farming systems. Within a farming system, grazing lands were further stratified into three sampling areas: communal, road side and enclosure grazing areas. In each of the range sites a sampling block of 4 km × 1 km was demarcated and this was further stratified into four sampling plots of equal size. In each of the plot, a belt transects of 50 m × 4 m was laid out randomly. Then, the parameter used for (herbaceous, soil and woody) grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, soil erosion, soil compaction, seedling count, age distribution and woody density enumeration, canopy cover and hedging were determined. For the height classes 1 – 3 m, > 3 – 4. 5 m and > 4. 5 m was used. Feed samples were stratified by season and types and subjected to chemical analysis for determination of DM, ash, CP, ADF, ADL and IVDMD. About 83 % of the inhabitants in the district practice mixed crop–livestock farming system. The mean family size is 5. 31 ± 0. 20 persons per household, while the average land holding is 6. 78 ± 1. 33 ha/household. The mean livestock holding per household is 12. 52 ± 6. 23 TLU, and is composed of cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys and camels. Natural pasture (55. 7 %), crop residues (20. 7 %), stubble (14. 3 %) and hay (9. 3 %) are the major feed resources for dry season whereas in the wet season only natural pasture serves as feed resource. The total estimated DM yield of grazing land and stubble is 780, 750 and 51, 954 t DM per annum, respectively. The total estimated available feed supply is 833, 531. 2 t DM per annum. Of the identified 33 herbaceous species, 14 and 19 are different grasses and non-grass species. From the non-grass species 6 legumes and 13 sedges and other species are recorded. Of the grasses, 23. 07 %, 38. 46 % and 30. 77 % are highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. Of the identified 20 woody species, 15 %, 35 %, and 50 % are highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. The largest proportion of woody vegetation is contributed by different species of acacia (20 %) and commbretum (10 %). Trees and shrubs grouped within the height class of > 1 – 3 m constituted 41. 2 % in communal grazing areas, 38. 5 % in road side grazing and 33. 3 % in enclosures. Range condition assessment factors such as basal cover, litter cover, grass species composition, woody vegetation density, canopy cover, hedging effect, age distribution and total condition score are significant (P< 0. 05) in communal grazing areas of the sesame–livestock than in the cotton–livestock farming system. The communal grazing areas have significantly (P< 0. 05) higher values of grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, age distribution, and woody species density score, than the road side grazing areas and lower (P< 0. 05) than the enclosure grazing areas. The dry matter biomass of grass, highly desirable, desirable species of grasses and legumes and others obtained in the same farming system were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than the road side grazing types and lower (P< 0. 05) in total grass biomass, highly desirable grass, and <b>total</b> biomass than <b>enclosure</b> areas. The <b>total</b> dry matter biomass, dry matter biomass of grass and highly desirable grasses, and legumes are significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the enclosure followed by communal grazing and the road side grazing areas. In general, there is low feed resources conservation and utilization and very poor traditional grazing land management system in Metema. The abundant feed resources in the wet season are wasted. In the dry season, grasses are turned to ash by wild and man-made fire in the process of forest honey harvesting and crop land cleaning. As a result, the livestock populations seriously suffer from the critical feed shortage during the long dry season. The rangeland, species composition and biomass production are also affected by human, livestock and natural factors (biotic and abiotic factors). The human population of the district has increased due to settlement programs, investment induced settlers, expanding crop cultivation and have increased the pressure on the rangelands and natural grazing areas. Bush encroachment and overgrazing are also serious problems. Shifting cultivation practice is also contributing to the increased bush encroachment. The seasonal movement and transhumant livestock production by highlanders in adjacent districts also increases the grazing intensity. Absence of adequate baseline information about the rangeland resources, unsynchronized seasonal availability of feed resources and cropland encroachment to the rangeland are some of the main constraints of the district, and studies on rangeland management systems and improved livestock production should be initiated.

Behavioral sampling was completed at Flamingo Land over a period of eight months. Further data on behavior, enclosure design and breeding success were collected via questionnaires, visits to zoos, and literature review.

In the first, the native is a prop in a colonial mise-en-scene colonial travelogues attest, though present, the native seldom rises above the threshold of recognition. His proximity to nature is so total as to defy recognition. In the second, the native is recognized only insofar as his proximity to nature renders him an anchor in an evolutionary meta-discourse. The native's presence is interpreted as validating a taxonomic scheme that produces Europeans as a genus apart. In both representational forms, the negation of the native's potentiality is imbricated {{in the construction of}} the nation as the site of identity and difference through an organic discourse that transforms territory into an epiphenomenon of landscape. Post-World War II movements of capital and populations across national borders have profoundly altered conceptions of the political. These dislocations have introduced ever-widening social and political imaginaries that challenge the nation-state's function as the locus proper of sovereignty. Consequently, the native's symbolic import, as a concept-metaphor that moors identity to the nation, is disrupted. Using postcolonial migrancy not only as a concept that denotes spatial movement, but as a philosophical disposition, the dissertation interrogates the consequences for the nation and the narratives of difference it enables when they encounter the postcolonial native as a nomad whose presence denatures the link between nation and identity. The dissertation argues that encounters between nation-states and postcolonial migrants result neither in the <b>total</b> <b>enclosure</b> of the natives nor in the evisceration of the nation. Rather, the encounter gives rise to a fractal politics that resists the sedimentation of identities into established political and cultural communities.

However, to date, the design {{of this type of}} equipment is still not precise due to an overall shortage theoretical analyses and experimental data reported in the literature. For this reason, this thesis aims at formulating theoretical models to predict the performance of single and twin screw feeders. The models concentrate on the volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque or power requirement of screw feeders. The models are based on analyses of the relevant particulate mechanics. An element of bulk solid sliding on the helical surface of a screw flight will move in a direction related to the angle of friction between the bulk solid and the surface, and helical of the flight surface. An analytical solution to the integral equation to express the volumetric efficiency of screw feeders has been obtained. A theoretical model for the torque requirement is developed by analysing the stresses acting on the five confining surfaces surrounding the bulk solid contained within a pitch. This model allows the torque characteristics to be predicted. A criterion for uniform draw-down performance is presented based on the pitch characteristics of the screw. To obtain detailed information on the interaction among the screw geometry, the operating conditions and properties of the bulk solid, a systematic experimental investigation is undertaken into the performance of screw feeders with different screw and trough configurations, three types of bulk material and different operating conditions. Experimental programs on the twin screw feeders are also conducted to observe the effect of operating conditions and geometric parameters. The factors affecting performance of the twin screw feeders also are analysed. Experimental data are compared with the results obtained from the theoretical predictions. The volumetric efficiency, draw-down performance and torque requirements of screw feeders predicted by the theoretical models developed in this work are found to provide results which agree well with experimental data. The performance prediction models are also applied in industrial practice. Some typical problems experienced by industry are analysed. New design of screw feeders are provided for four upgrade projects...|$|E
