5000|$|An External Torx version exists, {{where the}} screw head has {{the shape of}} a <b>Torx</b> {{screwdriver}} <b>bit,</b> and a <b>Torx</b> socket is used to drive it. The external “E” Torx nominal sizing does not correlate to the “T” size, (e.g. an E40 socket is too large to fit an T40 <b>Torx</b> <b>bit,</b> while E8 <b>Torx</b> socket will fit a T40 <b>Torx</b> <b>bit</b> [...] ).|$|R

50|$|SCMS copy {{protection}} looks for bits {{written in the}} subcode data in a digital link. There are three states of these bits: copy allowed (00), copy once (10) and copy prohibited (11). If the source has the copy bits 00, and a copy is made of the source, the copy itself will have the <b>bit</b> <b>set</b> as 00 as well, allowing copies to be made from copies. If the source has the copy <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> as 10, every copy of this material will have the <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> to 11, and making a copy from the copy would be prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|S: Sequence number <b>bit.</b> <b>Set</b> to 1 if a {{sequence}} number is present.|$|R
50|$|If NMIEN's DLI <b>bit</b> is <b>set</b> when ANTIC {{encounters}} a Display List instruction with the DLI modifier <b>bit</b> <b>set,</b> then ANTIC triggers the DLI {{on the last}} scan line of that Display List instruction mode line.|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} graphics, when a given {{image is}} intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask. This way, for each intended image there are actually two bitmaps: the actual image, in which the unused areas are given a pixel value with all <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> to 0s, and an additional mask, in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits.|$|R

50|$|Each HDCP-capable device has {{a unique}} set of 40 56-bit keys. Failure to keep them secret violates the license agreement. For each set of values, a special public key called a KSV (Key Selection Vector) is created. Each KSV {{consists}} of 40 bits (one bit for each HDCP key), with 20 <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> to 0 and 20 <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> to 1.|$|R
50|$|When the {{destination}} replies, the corresponding ACK includes {{a bit of}} congestion. The sender receives the ACK and calculates how many packets it received with the congestion indication <b>bit</b> <b>set</b> to one. If {{less than half of}} the packets in the last window had the congestion indication <b>bit</b> <b>set,</b> then the window is increased linearly. Otherwise, the window is decreased exponentially.|$|R

50|$|NCQ {{is usually}} used in {{combination}} with enabled write buffering. In case of a read/write FPDMA command with Force Unit Access (FUA) <b>bit</b> <b>set</b> to 0 and enabled write buffering, an operating system may see the write operation finished before the data is physically written to the media. In case of FUA <b>bit</b> <b>set</b> to 1 and enabled write buffering, write operation returns only after the data is physically written to the media.|$|R
50|$|S = Script (Batch file. Requires E and R <b>bits</b> <b>set</b> to work.)

5000|$|The mask {{is applied}} {{whenever}} a file is created. If the mask has a <b>bit</b> <b>set</b> to [...] "1", {{that means the}} corresponding file permission will always be disabled when files are subsequently created. A <b>bit</b> <b>set</b> to [...] "0" [...] in the mask means that the corresponding permission {{will be determined by}} the requesting process and the OS when files are subsequently created. In other words, the mask acts as a last-stage filter that strips away permissions as a file is created; each <b>bit</b> that is <b>set</b> to a [...] "1" [...] strips away that corresponding permission for the file.|$|R
