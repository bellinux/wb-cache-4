500|$|The film {{did receive}} some criticism. Geoffrey Macnab of The Independent gave the film a mixed review, writing: [...] "On the one hand, Saving Mr. Banks (which was {{developed}} by BBC Films and has a British producer) is a probing, insightful character study with a very dark undertow. On the other, it is a cheery, upbeat marketing exercise in which the Disney organization is re-promoting {{one of its most}} popular film characters." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concluded that if the film [...] ""were 100 percent false and yet felt true, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine.</b> But this has the self-conscious whiff, if not of mendacity, then of public relations." [...] Lou Lumenick of The New York Post criticized the accuracy of the film's events, concluding that [...] "Saving Mr. Banks is ultimately much less about magic than making the sale, in more ways than one." [...] American history lecturer John Wills praised the film's attention to detail, such as the inclusion of Travers' original recordings, but doubted that the interpersonal relations between Travers and Disney were as amicable as portrayed in the film. Landon Palmer of Film School Rejects also described several moments where the film had a [...] "shrewd consumption of [...] own criticisms", only to later negate them and Disney-fy Travers as a character.|$|E
2500|$|Ratings for NBC affiliates' {{local news}} {{broadcasts}} at 11 began to slip by mid-October, especially on NBC owned-and-operated {{stations in the}} largest markets, creating high anxiety for the network. The Tonight Show still retained a slightly higher share of the coveted 18–24 demographic against Letterman, but saw those numbers slip even more when The Jay Leno Show began. Affiliates began to complain, {{and in addition to}} a domino effect on the local news, O'Brien and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, O'Brien's successor at 12:30, the disastrous ratings for Leno had damaged NBC's existing primetime lineups. [...] This cascading effect caused by the lowered 10pm lead-in was so significant that local news viewership fell an average of twenty-five percent nationwide, with the decline in some markets being as high as fifty percent. [...] By November, two months after the debut of The Jay Leno Show, ratings for The Tonight Show were brought down [...] "roughly two million viewers a night year-to-year" [...] from when Leno hosted the program. [...] Clearing the 10pm time period for Leno also damaged relations with the producers of shows that previously occupied that slot, such as Law & Order: SVU Dick Wolf. Leno offered an October 29 interview to Broadcasting & Cable, which included a notable exchange on the possibility of ever returning to the 11:35 slot: [...] "If it were offered to me, would I take it? If that's what they wanted to do, sure. <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> if they wanted to." [...] Industry trades were abuzz over the 11:35 comment, and when Conan sidekick Andy Richter called the move less than [...] "classy" [...] in a chat with TV Squad, Leno called Ludwin to complain.|$|E

He smiled, and then he thought how these men were really a sort of slaves and convicts --slaves to want and self-convicted of poverty. All at once he fancied them actually manacled there together, two by two, a coffle of captives taken in some cruel foray, and driven to a market where no man wanted to buy. He thought how old their slavery was; and he wondered if it would ever be abolished, as other slaveries had been. Would the world ever outlive it?

First, word came out that his brother-in-law, Wang Ling, had been {{plotting}} to depose Emperor Cao Fang and replaced him with Cao Biao, one of Cao Cao’s more talented sons. Having received word of this, Sima Yi led an army to Shouchun. Knowing {{that there was no}} way he would be able to beat Sima Yi, Wang Ling surrendered. Though officially pardoned, he committed suicide on the way to the capital. For plotting rebellion against the emperor, Sima Yi executed most of Wang Ling’s relatives - however, because of the long friendship between them and the service Guo Huai had rendered to Wei, Wang Ling’s sister (Guo Huai’s wife) was spared. Lady Wang left to attend her brother’s funeral and gather his personal effects, but along the way she was ambushed and captured by some of the Qiang and Hu tribes. Guo Huai received word of this and took a part of his army to go and rescue his wife. Technically, this was an illegal thing for him to do - Shu had attacked almost every year, and Guo Huai was abandoning his post to attend to personal matters. He sent a letter to Sima Yi that basically said he was going to save his wife and if Sima Yi wanted to punish him <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine,</b> but he was going to save her regardless. Upon receiving this letter, Sima Yi pardoned Guo Huai for abandoning his post. So Guo Huai was able to save his wife and was not punished for doing so.|$|E

Nearly every member of the club who rowed had a pair. Later on, this same member came to me and asked if we could not make him a bathing suit of the same {{material}} .... a suit was made for him and he went to the ocean to bathe in the cold water. When he came back, he came into the store and told us that it was heavy and one could not swim well in it, but that he was well satisfied because it was so much warmer than any suit that he had ever had before and that it made ocean bathing a pleasure. ... this experience gave us the idea that a bathing suit made of this stitch, only in lighter weight, would be an excellent garment. We discussed this between ourselves and decided that we would order a needle bed for our sweater machine <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine</b> enough to knit a rib-stitch bathing suit in a weight that would be comfortable. Roy, Carl, Joe Gerber and I were constantly in the water those days, either in the Y. M. C.

We soon developed a suit which we found was the most excellent garment for swimming that we had ever seen.|$|E

Mackay 2 ̆ 7 s study of the irrational behavior of crowds was unusually detailed, but it hardly stands alone. Over two thousand years earlier, Socrates had complained to Crito, 2 ̆ 2 Would that the majority could inflict the greatest evils, for they would then be capable of the greatest good, and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fine,</b> but now they cannot do either.

The decisions affecting matters of general interest come to by an assembly of men of distinction, but specialists in different walks of life, are not sensibly superior to the decisions that would be adopted by a gathering of imbeciles.
