500|$|Halfway {{through the}} casting process, Cardiac Arrest actress Helen Baxendale became available. BAFTA Scotland award-nominated Baxendale {{was seen as}} a coup, though she was {{hesitant}} to audition as she believed that she could not do comedy. Harries persuaded her that she was more than qualified, citing her comedic performance in Cardiac Arrest. She was cast as Rachel on the basis of her chemistry at the audition with Nesbitt. Fay Ripley assumed that she would be reading for the role of Rachel, and was surprised to be auditioning for Jenny. Many of the actresses seen for the part were [...] "finger-wagging" [...] and [...] "predictable", an approach Ripley did not take. Raised in Surrey, Ripley had to adopt a Manchester accent for the part. She [...] "managed to bodge together a sort of Manchester accent" [...] for the audition, assuming that she would not get the part. When she was cast, she worked on improving the accent by spending <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> local people.|$|E
500|$|Robert Gordon Orr, OC (born March 20, 1948) is a Canadian former {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} player, widely acknowledged {{as one of}} the greatest hockey players of all time. Orr used his ice skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman. [...] He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, starting with 10 with the Boston Bruins followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies. He holds the record for most points and assists in a single season by a defenceman. Orr won a record eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the NHL's best defenceman and three consecutive Hart Trophies as the league's most valuable player (MVP). Orr was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1979 at age 31, the youngest to be inducted at that time. On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Orr was part of the second group of players to be named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. After his hockey career, he became a well-known scout for many professional teams. He also spends <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> and mentoring young skaters.|$|E
500|$|This {{left one}} {{position}} for the remaining batsmen in the squad. Up to this point, Brown had scored 800 runs on tour {{at an average of}} 72.72, with four centuries, and was on his third tour of England. Brown had played in the first-choice team in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Harvey had accumulated 296 runs at 42.29, all rounder Loxton had 310 runs at 51.66, but was injured, while Hamence had made only 251 runs at 27.88 and {{was the only one of}} the four to not have scored a century. Hamence was overlooked while Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle-order while Barnes and Morris were preferred as the first-choice opening pair, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches where Australia fielded their first-choice team; Brown batted in the middle order. Bradman explained the decision in his memoirs: [...] "Hamence was not in good enough form and Harvey scarcely ready". During the opening stages of the tour, Bradman spent little <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Hamence at practice sessions, leading analysts to conclude that the Australian skipper viewed Hamence as being highly unlikely to play in the Tests. Australia went on to defeat England by eight wickets, although Brown struggled and made only 17.|$|E

500|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{began its}} dealings with Canada badly, with Kennedy mispronouncing Diefenbaker's {{name in a}} press conference announcing the Prime Minister's visit to Washington in February 1961. A furious Diefenbaker brought up in Cabinet whether to send a note of protest at the gaffe to Washington; his colleagues were inclined to let the matter pass. When the two met in Washington on February 20, Diefenbaker was impressed by Kennedy, and invited him to visit Ottawa. President Kennedy, however, told his aides that he never wanted [...] "to see the boring son of a bitch again". The Ottawa visit also began badly: at the welcome at the airport, Kennedy again mispronounced Diefenbaker's name and stated that after hearing the Prime Minister's (notoriously bad) French, he was uncertain if he should venture into the language (Kennedy's French was equally bad). After meeting with Diefenbaker, Kennedy accidentally left behind a briefing note suggesting he [...] "push" [...] Diefenbaker on several issues, including the decision to accept nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, which bitterly divided the Cabinet. Diefenbaker was also annoyed by Kennedy's speech to Parliament, in which he urged Canada to join the OAS (which Diefenbaker had already rejected), and by the President spending most of his <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Leader of the Opposition Pearson at the formal dinner. Both Kennedy and his wife Jackie were bored by Diefenbaker's Churchill anecdotes at lunch, stories that Jackie Kennedy later described as [...] "painful".|$|E
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came {{while working on}} the night shift with Gordon Lish at the Menlo Park Veterans' Hospital. There, Kesey often spent <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the patients, sometimes {{under the influence of}} the hallucinogenic drugs with which he had volunteered to experiment. Kesey did not believe that these patients were insane, but rather that society had pushed them out because they did not fit the conventional ideas of how people were supposed to act and behave. Published under the guidance of Cowley in 1962, the novel was an immediate success; in 1963, it was adapted into a successful stage play by Dale Wasserman, and in 1975, Milo≈° Forman directed a screen adaptation, which won the [...] "Big Five" [...] Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor (Jack Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Director (Forman) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Lawrence Hauben, Bo Goldman).|$|E
2500|$|In their 2013 book, [...] "The Business Solution to Poverty," [...] Paul Polak and Mal Warwick {{directly}} {{addressed the}} criticism leveled against Prahalad's concept. They noted that big business often failed to create products that actually met {{the needs and}} desires of the customers who lived at the bottom-of-the-pyramid. Their answer was that a business that wanted to success in that market had to spend <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> and understanding those customers. Polak had previously promoted this approach in his previous book, [...] "Out of Poverty," [...] that described the work of International Development Enterprises (iDE), which he had formed in 1982. Polak and Warwick provided practical advice: a product needed to affect at least a billion people (i.e., have universal appeal), {{it had to be}} able to be delivered to customers living where there wasn't a FedEx office or even a road, and it had to be [...] "radically affordable" [...] to attract someone who earned less than $2 a day.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} day, September 30, Sweeney {{took the}} field against the Cleveland Indians {{in front of}} 19,104 fans at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City. Sweeney's first at bat {{was interrupted by a}} standing ovation. His second at bat was delayed as well due to applause. Sweeney was removed from first base in the 7th inning and was given a third standing ovation. Sweeney entered the dugout, and upon still hearing fans roaring, he exited the dugout towards the field and bowed, waved, and said [...] "Thank you." [...] After the game, Sweeney and his two children rounded the bases as part of a Sunday home game tradition at Kauffman Stadium called [...] "Sunday Fan Fun Run." [...] Then he spent <b>time</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> reporters, and as always, signed autographs for fans before he left the parking lot. Since Leaving the Kansas City Royals his Number 29 has been left out of circulation leading some to believe the Royals might end up retiring his number one day.
