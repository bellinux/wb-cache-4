5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in <b>Training</b> <b>will</b> take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E

50|$|In October 2016, Eurostar {{published}} {{details about}} its forthcoming Amsterdam service. They have since {{said it will}} start operating from Easter 2018.Trains will stop in Brussels {{for half an hour}} for a security check. It now seems that passengers for London from Amsterdam and Rotterdam will undertake all security checks before boarding and will not need to get off in Brussels. The <b>train</b> <b>will</b> also convey passengers from the Netherlands on journeys to Brussels who won't need to pass through security and they will be allocated half the <b>train</b> which <b>will</b> be kept separate from the London-bound passengers by locking the intermediate door. This half of the <b>train</b> <b>will</b> be security swept on arrival at Brussels before Brussels to London passengers can board. The journey from London to Amsterdam Centraal will take 3hrs 50mins and <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> call at Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam and Schipol Airport. From Amsterdam Centraal to London <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> take 4hrs 9mins to include the 25 minutes approx stop at Brussels. Amsterdam to London <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> not call at Antwerp.|$|R

50|$|Each <b>train</b> <b>will</b> {{be made up}} of 3 coaches on the {{formation}} - leading car / intermediate car / leading car. The length and width of the cars will be 18m and 2.7m respectively. The total length of <b>train</b> <b>will</b> be approximately 54 m.|$|R
25|$|Surgical {{training}} in the U.S. requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last an additional one to three years. Because post-residency fellowships can be competitive, many trainees devote two additional years to research. Thus in some cases surgical <b>training</b> <b>will</b> not finish until {{more than a decade}} after medical school. Furthermore, surgical training can be very difficult and time-consuming.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{technique for}} buddy breathing {{is for the}} divers to alternately breathe from the demand valve, usually each taking two breaths before exchanging the DV, but {{it is common for}} the receiver to be out of breath {{at the start of the}} procedure, and they may need a few more breaths to stabilize. Once a rhythm has been established, it is usual to terminate the dive and start the ascent, so buddy breathing <b>training</b> <b>will</b> usually include assisted ascents. Assisted ascents using a secondary demand valve are simpler than buddy breathing ascents, and this skill is quicker to learn.|$|E
25|$|Enrollment is limited; {{each year}} the {{institution}} establishes the number of places available (numerus clausus). The exam scores count for the final evaluation, which includes the secondary school average marks. Then the students have to choose six institutions/courses they prefer to attend, in preferential order. The ones who reach the marks needed to attend the desired institution/course, {{given the number of}} vacancies, will be admitted. This means that the students could not be admitted at its first or second choice, but be admitted at the third or even sixth choice. In some cases, those entering polytechnic institutes with previous vocational <b>training</b> <b>will</b> receive institutional preference.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the trains}} were {{expected}} to arrive in August 2008, the delivery was delayed to November 2008 by the manufacturer. Rapid Rail said that the <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> only be usable by September 2009 after having sufficient rolling stocks, power line upgrades and safety testing. Transport Minister, Datuk Seri Ong Tee Keat has said in Parliament that the new <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> begin operations by December 2009. However, in July 2009, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak announced that the four-car <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> only be fully operational by end-2012.|$|R
5000|$|From the International District/Chinatown Station, <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> {{travel on}} {{existing}} ramps to the Interstate 90 express lanes from the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, possibly in mixed traffic with buses. The I-90 express lanes, which formerly carried vehicle traffic (both single-occupancy vehicles and high-occupancy vehicles (HOV)), were permanently closed on June 4, 2017. The former roadway will {{be modified to}} serve only trains, and an all-day HOV lane {{has been added to}} each direction of the I-90 bridge. The <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> use the center roadway from Seattle through the Mount Baker Tunnel, across Lake Washington on the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, under Aubrey Davis Park on Mercer Island, and on the East Channel Bridge to South Bellevue. <b>Trains</b> <b>will</b> turn and head north from I-90 along Bellevue Way and 112th, before cutting across to Main and I-405. In Downtown Bellevue, the <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> go through a tunnel underneath 110th, a plan that the board decided upon in July 2011. [...] From there, <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> head east at NE 12th street past Overlake Hospital through the Bel-Red industrial area along NE 16th street. In the Overlake neighborhood, <b>trains</b> <b>will</b> connect with State Route 520 and head north towards Downtown Redmond and Redmond Town Center.|$|R

25|$|Finally, {{there is}} the Evaluative Holding Platoon (EHP). This is a {{generalized}} platoon that encompasses all recruits who for any reason are unable to continue with their training platoon and are being evaluated for possible discharge. This platoon may include recruits who have failed {{to adapt to the}} conditions of the Marine Corps' boot camp or have refused to continue training. Any recruit in Special Training Company is carefully assessed for physical, mental and moral fitness and when he or she is considered to be prepared to resume <b>training</b> <b>will</b> generally be placed with a platoon at the last training level the recruit had completed.|$|E
25|$|Promotion is {{not based}} solely on merit but on {{position}} attained, level of education, and seniority. Officers with advanced degrees (for which study at the National Defence Academy qualifies) can expect to attain grade VIII before reaching the retirement age of sixty to sixty-five. Those with a baccalaureate degree can expect to reach grade VII (colonel), and those without university <b>training</b> <b>will</b> retire as captains or majors. Career NCOs form {{part of the same}} comprehensive personnel structure. It is common for NCOs to transfer at some stage in their careers to civilian status at the equivalent grade, either in the Ministry for National Defence or in the police or prison services after further training.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is {{a hormone}} which helps {{regulate}} glucose {{levels in the}} body. When blood glucose is high, insulin is released from the Islets of Langerhans. Insulin, among other things, will then facilitate the uptake of glucose into cells via increased expression and translocation of glucose transporter GLUT-4. Under conditions of exercise, however, blood sugar levels are not necessarily high, and insulin is not necessarily activated, yet muscles are still able to bring in glucose. AMPK seems to be responsible in part for this exercise-induced glucose uptake. Goodyear et al. observed that with exercise, the concentration of GLUT-4 was increased in the plasma membrane, but decreased in the microsomal membranes, suggesting that exercise facilitates the translocation of vesicular GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane. While acute exercise increases GLUT-4 translocation, endurance <b>training</b> <b>will</b> increase {{the total amount of}} GLUT-4 protein available. It has been shown that both electrical contraction and AICAR treatment increase AMPK activation, glucose uptake, and GLUT-4 translocation in perfused rat hindlimb muscle, linking exercise-induced glucose uptake to AMPK. Chronic AICAR injections, simulating some of the effects of endurance training, also increase the total amount of GLUT-4 protein in the muscle cell.|$|E
