5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially {{turned down by}} most of the major labels and several independent record labels. The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records in 1999, {{due in large part to}} the constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage {{to record a}} demo tape with a mock radio talk show about {{the contents of the}} work. He mailed <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the release}} of <b>this</b> <b>tape,</b> Nixon had denied any {{involvement}} in the scandal. He claimed {{that there were no}} political motivations in his instructions to the CIA, and claimed he had no knowledge before March 21, 1973, of involvement by senior campaign officials such as John Mitchell. The contents of <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> persuaded Nixon's own lawyers, Fred Buzhardt and James St. Clair, that “the President had lied to the nation, to his closest aides, and to his own lawyers—for more than two years.” The tape, which Barber Conable referred to as a “smoking gun,” proved that Nixon had been involved in the cover-up from the beginning.|$|E

25|$|The Office {{started when}} Stephen Merchant, {{while on a}} BBC {{production}} course, had {{to make his own}} short film. In August 1999 he made a docu-soap parody, set in an office, with help from Ash Atalla, who was shown a 7-minute video called 'The Seedy Boss', thus David Brent was created, Merchant passed <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> on to the BBC's Head of Entertainment Paul Jackson at the Edinburgh Fringe, who then passed it on to Head of Comedy Jon Plowman, who eventually commissioned a full-pilot script from Merchant and Gervais.|$|E
25|$|Kapton tape {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used tapes and methods for TC and TC {{conductor}} attachment. When several layers are applied, each layer has an additive effect on the insulation and may negatively impact a profile. A disadvantage of <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> is that the PCB has to be very clean and smooth to achieve an airtight cover over the thermocouple weld and conductors. Another disadvantage to Kapton tape is that at temperatures above 200°C the tape becomes elastic and, hence, the TCs have a tendency to lift off the substrate surface. The result is erroneous readings characterized by jagged lines in the profile.|$|E

25|$|As evening comes, Michael tells Ted that The Passion of Saint Tibulus {{was more}} {{successful}} for him than even Jurassic Park. Ted decides to give up, but finds Dougal doesn't have the handcuff key, {{and they are}} forced to walk home still handcuffed to the railing. Back at the house, Brennan scolds them as they have caused the film to become so popular that people are arriving from all over Ireland and Europe to see it. As punishment, Brennan plans to reassign them all to locations worst than Craggy Island, and then leaves. Ted and Dougal lament their fate, but Jack shows them the video cassette, which has a video of Brennan in California with his secret mistress and his son. Ted realises he can use <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> for blackmail and force Brennan to change his mind, and joins the other two as they watch the tape a few more times.|$|E
25|$|On 5 September 2006, Huntley {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in his prison cell and {{thought to have}} taken an overdose. He had previously taken an overdose of antidepressants in prison in June 2003 while awaiting his trial. He was under police guard in hospital for two days, before being returned to Wakefield prison, prompting much reaction from many present at the scene, as well as making {{the front pages of}} many of the UK newspapers the next morning. Following this attempted suicide, his cell was cleared and a tape was found which was marked with Queen on one side and Meat Loaf on the other. <b>This</b> <b>tape</b> is thought to contain confessions from Huntley on what he did and how he did it. It is believed that Huntley made the tape in return for antidepressants from a fellow prisoner, who hoped to obtain and later sell the confession to the media after his release. On 28 March 2007, The Sun began publishing transcripts of Huntley's taped confession.|$|E
25|$|Kargil War: R {{was heavily}} criticised in 1999, {{following}} the Pakistani incursions at Kargil. Critics accused R {{of failing to}} provide intelligence that could have prevented the ensuing ten-week conflict that brought India and Pakistan {{to the brink of}} a full-scale war. While the Army has been critical of the information they received R has pointed the finger at the politicians, claiming they had provided all the necessary information. However, R was successful in intercepting a telephonic conversation between Pervez Musharraf, the then Pakistan Army Chief who was in Beijing and his chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz in Islamabad. <b>This</b> <b>tape</b> was later published by India to prove Pakistani involvement in the Kargil incursion. In 2011, a think tank report stated that RAW had warned in its October 1998 assessment that Pakistan Army might launch a limited swift offensive with possible support of alliance partners, however the government ignored such reports.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the day of}} his suicide, the Miami New Times {{published}} a cover story on Teele which was based on the report of the corruption probe and detailed alleged dealings with illegal drugs and a transvestite prostitute with a criminal record. Shortly before he shot himself, Teele called Miami Herald columnist Jim DeFede, who <b>taped</b> their conversation. <b>This</b> <b>taping</b> led to the dismissal of DeFede.

25|$|Dr. David R. Williams (NASA {{archivist}} at Goddard Space Flight Center) and Apollo 11 {{flight director}} Eugene F. Kranz both {{acknowledged that the}} Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed. The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a slow-scan television (SSTV) camera (see Apollo TV camera). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a scan conversion had to be done. The radio telescope at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon {{at the time of}} the Apollo 11 moonwalk. Parkes had a bigger antenna than NASA's antenna in Australia at the Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, so it received a better picture. It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> that is missing. A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur 8 mm film camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the ALSEP scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.|$|E

Bassist Joe Bouchard remembered the producer requesting his brother, drummer Albert Bouchard, play the cowbell: [...] "Albert thought he was crazy. But he put all <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> around a cowbell and played it. It really pulled the track together." [...] However, producer David Lucas says that he played it, a claim supported by guitarist Eric Bloom.|$|E
500|$|Bruce MacVittie {{auditioned for}} the role of Larry Biedron by mailing a tape of himself {{performing}} to the show's producers. Yoshimura had previously seen MacVittie perform on the New York City stage and thought that he was a [...] "wonderful, wonderful actor". After watching his rehearsal tape, Yoshimura settled on MacVittie for the part based not only on his acting, but also on his short physical stature. Yoshimura said, [...] "I'm watching <b>this</b> <b>tape</b> and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, this little guy! Who would suspect this little guy to have these murderous kinds of tendencies. Laura MacDonald was also cast as Lange's girlfriend Sarah Flannigan based on an audition tape she sent to the show. Wendee Pratt was cast as emergency medical technician Joy Tolson, who works to help Lange throughout the episode but does not get along with him. Yoshimura said that he particularly enjoyed Pratt's performance [...] "because she's not playing at all sympathetic. This guy's a pain in her ass." [...] Shari Elliker, a WBAL (AM) disc jockey from the Baltimore area, made a cameo appearance as a witness in the subway.|$|E

500|$|Between 1968 and 1972, Bob and Rita Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer re-cut {{some old}} tracks with JAD Records in Kingston and London {{in an attempt}} to commercialise the Wailers' sound. Bunny later {{asserted}} that these songs [...] "should never be released on an album ... they were just demos for record companies to listen to". In 1968, Bob and Rita visited songwriter Jimmy Norman at his apartment in the Bronx. Norman had written the extended lyrics for Kai Winding's [...] "Time Is on My Side" [...] (covered by the Rolling Stones) and had also written for Johnny Nash and Jimi Hendrix. A three-day jam session with Norman and others, including Norman's co-writer Al Pyfrom, resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. <b>This</b> <b>tape</b> is, according to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, rare in that it was influenced by pop rather than reggae, {{as part of an effort}} to break Marley into the American charts. According to an article in The New York Times, Marley experimented on the tape with different sounds, adopting a doo-wop style on [...] "Stay With Me" [...] and [...] "the slow love song style of 1960's artists" [...] on [...] "Splish for My Splash". An artist yet to establish himself outside his native Jamaica, Marley lived in Ridgmount Gardens, Bloomsbury, during 1972.|$|E
