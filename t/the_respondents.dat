Contrarily, Neill had little impact on school curriculum and classroom teaching methods. Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.|$|E

5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an adjunctive measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases.

5|$|After {{the passage}} of the storm, four towns in New Zealand {{declared}} states of emergency. The New Zealand government provided about $80million (1988NZD) to the east coast region of the North Island for assisting in cyclone damage. $8million was used to create an East Coast Forestry Conservation Scheme, which was set to protect forests and prevent erosion. A study was taken five years after the storm, consisting of a group of 112people who were evacuated or received monetary assistance in response to the cyclone; the study showed 12% of <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> as experiencing Posttraumatic stress disorder, of which they reported a general lack of assistance and public support.|$|E
5000|$|The issue {{requesting}} clarification {{was whether}} or not <b>the</b> <b>respondent's</b> Fourth Amendment rights were violated. The court failed to construct a majority defining [...] "seizure". Whether or not <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> voluntarily consented to the search or was coerced into it, there is sufficient evidence that <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> was given <b>the</b> option to go on her way. According to Justice Stewart, evidence that <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> was not asked {{to go to the}} DEA office with the agents is not enough to dismiss that <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> gave consent. There was no evidence of force, and <b>the</b> <b>respondent's</b> voluntary accompanying <b>the</b> agents is sufficient to side with the District Court. Evidence that she was a 22-year-old Negro with no high school diploma and was being apprehended by white agents, though not completely irrelevant, was held as not being decisive evidence.|$|R

5|$|Furthermore, {{the appeal}} did not engage foreign policy considerations. The treaty was a civil {{convention}} between two countries and {{an agreement to}} render mutual judicial assistance, and {{had nothing to do}} with foreign affairs other than that it was made between state parties. It also did not involve the policing of government conduct in international affairs, because it only implicated the procedures private litigants had to take to serve writs on defendants residing in Hong Kong. When interpreting the treaty, the Court only had to determine the domestic legal obligations of <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> seeking to serve a writ out of jurisdiction. Thus, the issue of whether the treaty applied to Hong Kong was justiciable, and the Ministry's letter was not decisive on the matter.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland {{with the emergence}} of the Solidarity mass movement. By the end of October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority did not want to impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E
5|$|Ownby {{confirms}} {{estimates that}} Falun Gong is practiced {{by hundreds of}} thousands of people outside China, with the largest communities found in Taiwan and in North American cities with large Chinese populations, such as New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, and Toronto. Demographic surveys by sociologist Susan Palmer and David Ownby in North American communities found that 90% of practitioners were ethnic Chinese (in Europe, there are proportionally more Caucasians). The average age was approximately 42. Among survey respondents, 56% were female and 44% male; 80% were married.

5000|$|If another person’s {{interests}} {{stand to}} be affected by an order in an ex parte application, the court will not grant a final order without giving <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to present a defence.

After the order has been provisionally granted, it is then served on <b>the</b> <b>respondent.</b> <b>The</b> rule nisi calls on <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> to appear before the court on a certain date to furnish reasons for the provisional order not to be confirmed and made final. <b>The</b> <b>respondent</b> must then deliver an answering affidavit, unless <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> relies solely on a point of law.

50|$|The {{evidence}} revealed, to Smalberger's mind, that <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> {{was essentially}} a peripatetic businessman, but that he nonetheless remained free to choose what work to accept and where. The evidence pointed to a heightened degree of stability and permanence in relation to <b>the</b> <b>respondent's</b> presence in South Africa and particularly in Johannesburg, where he spent the greater portion of his time. The overall duration of his stays over the relevant period of time indicated more than temporary visitations. There was no indication that <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> was conducting substantial business elsewhere at the time. Because of <b>the</b> <b>respondent's</b> romantic involvement and cohabitation with Mrs Rowand, it was further acceptable that <b>the</b> <b>respondent</b> was not in Johannesburg simply for the purpose and duration of his work.|$|R
5|$|The 1989 {{amendments}} to the ISA were challenged before the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that sections 8B(1) and 8B(2) of the ISA govern judicial review {{in the context of}} that Act, and thus preclude any consideration of the legal position laid down in the obiter remarks of the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Therefore, applying the subjective test, the respondents' burden of justifying the legality of the applicant's detention was discharged as <b>the</b> <b>respondents</b> had produced a valid detention order and evidence of the subjective satisfaction of the President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, that the applicant was a risk to national security.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative <b>the</b> <b>respondents,</b> the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
