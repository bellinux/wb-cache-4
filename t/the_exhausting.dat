40|$|Abstract: In {{turbocharged}} engines with wastegate <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> {{pressure can}} change rapidly.

Estimates of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold pressure relies on information from an air-to-cylinder observer and a static map of stationary <b>exhaust</b> pressure. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> manifold pressure estimator is validated using a series of wastegate steps on a turbocharged SAAB 2. 3 dm 3 SI-engine. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> pressure estimation is designed for steady-state conditions and the validation shows that it works well and converges within 1 to 4 seconds...|$|R

There he studied the Huron and Iroquois languages. He did missionary duty at Sault St. Louis (Caughnawaga) from 1718 to 1731. He made his solemn profession of the four vows at Sault St. Louis on February 2, 1721. He was absent from Sault St. Louis only for the scholastic year 1721-22, when he replaced Father Fran√ßois Le Brun as instructor in the royal school of hydrography in the college at Quebec, as <b>the</b> <b>exhausting</b> labours of the mission had undermined his health.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} heros {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>exhausting</b> {{five days of}} play, but with a doubt, the most unsung of them was Greg Matthews, who scored 44 and 27 not out and took five wickets in each innings. His stamina and resilience were absolutely staggering, especially on the last day, when he bowled 39.5 overs just about consecutively to keep us {{in the game and}} then ultimately tie it. Making his feat all the more noteworthy in the eyes of his fellow players was the fact that he wore two sleeveless sweaters throughout the day. Actually, he gave one to the umpire when he fielded and only wore them both when he was bowling. We just shook our heads in disbelief, because it was so hot with 90 degree humidity, but as usual Greg had a theory. He explained that nomadic herders in the desert wore woollen coats because they kept the cool air in, thus acting as a kind of air-conditioner.|$|E
5000|$|These {{conflicting}} {{requirements are}} reconciled by constructing <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe with diverging and converging conical sections to create pressure wave reflections which travel {{back up the}} pipe and are presented at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port. <b>The</b> <b>exhaust</b> port opens while there is still significant pressure in the cylinder, which drives the initial outflow of <b>exhaust.</b> As <b>the</b> pressure wave from <b>the</b> pulse of <b>exhaust</b> gas travels down the pipe, it encounters a diverging conical section; this causes a wave of negative pressure to be reflected back up the pipe, which arrives at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port towards <b>the</b> end of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> phase, when <b>the</b> cylinder pressure has fallen to a low level, and helps to draw <b>the</b> remaining <b>exhaust</b> gas out of the cylinder. Further along <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pressure wave encounters a converging conical section, and this reflects a positive pressure wave back up the pipe. This wave is timed to arrive at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port after scavenging is completed, thereby [...] "plugging" [...] <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port to prevent spillage of fresh charge, and indeed may also push back into the cylinder any charge which has already spilled.|$|R

50|$|Exhaust brakes are simpler in {{operation}} than an engine brake. Essentially, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe of <b>the</b> vehicle is restricted by a valve.

25|$|A {{policy change}} {{resulted}} in the pressurised PR variant of the Mk VII being renamed PR Mk X (type 387). This version followed the PR Mk XI into production and {{was based on the}} Mk VII airframe with PR Mk XI wings and camera installation. It had the pressurised Mk VII cockpit, with the Lobelle sliding canopy, and retained the fighter style windscreen with the bullet-proof glass panel. The long thin air intake to the cockpit pressurisation system was fitted under the exhaust stacks on the starboard cowling. The performance was {{similar to that of the}} PR XI although the pressurised cockpit meant that this version could stay at altitudes of over 40,000ft for longer without <b>the</b> <b>exhausting</b> physiological effects experienced by the pilots of unpressurised cockpits. Sixteen Mk Xs were built during April and May 1944, with the first mission being flown on 11 May. All saw limited service in 541 and 542 Squadrons in a high altitude reconnaissance role. Experience with this version led to the development and production of the pressurised version of the PR Mk XIX.|$|E

50|$|In a piston-ported {{two-stroke}} engine however, {{the situation is}} more complicated due {{to the need to}} prevent unburned fuel/air mixture from passing right through the cylinders into <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> phase of <b>the</b> cycle, backpressure is even more undesirable than in a four-stroke engine due to the shorter time available for <b>exhaust</b> and <b>the</b> lack of pumping action from the piston to force <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> out of <b>the</b> cylinder. However, since <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port necessarily remains open for a time after scavenging is completed, unburned mixture can follow <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> out of <b>the</b> cylinder, wasting fuel and increasing pollution, and this can only be prevented if the pressure at <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> port is greater than that in the cylinder.|$|R

Embarrassed by the loss, Olajuwon and the Rockets stormed back to shock the star-studded defending champions with 4 straight wins in an impressive four games to one series victory, a feat that no other Western Conference team had come close to doing against the Showtime Lakers.

Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting a shot at revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before, yet the matchup was interesting with the young front court challenging the playoff-hardened Celtics front court of Bird, McHale and Parish. The Celtics won the first two games at the Boston Garden, only for the Rockets to win two games once the series went back to Houston ‚Äì a close game 3 under Sampson's leadership, and a 15 point-leading game 5 without him as he got ejected ‚Äì while also losing game 4 due to late Larry Bird 3 pointers and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitchell Wiggins.

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{deactivate}} a cylinder, <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve is prevented from opening after the power stroke and <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas charge is {{retained in the}} cylinder and compressed during <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> stroke.

40|$|Particulate {{emission}} from {{diesel engines}} is receiving {{a great deal}} of attention due to its probable carcinogenic property. In <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe of a diesel engine, the change of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas temperature can result in nucleation and condensation of volatile materials and coagulation of particulates. The objective of the present study is to investigate experimentally the transformation of diesel particulates within <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe when <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas is being cooled. Using a water cooler to control and adjust <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas temperature, <b>the</b> influences of exhaust-gas cooling on mass concentration, composition, size distribution and number-averaged diameter of the particulates, under different engine operating conditions, were analyzed. In addition, the effect of the flow rate of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas in <b>the</b> cooler on the number-averaged diameter of the particulates was also discussed. The results showed that the transformation of the diesel particulates in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe depended mainly on the level of cooling, the concentration of the volatile materials, the initial concentration of the particulates in <b>the</b> <b>exhaust,</b> and <b>the</b> residence time of <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas within <b>the</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipe. <b>The</b> mass concentration and the soluble organic fraction of the particulates increased, while the gaseous hydrocarbon concentration decreased upon cooling <b>the</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Coupled with these were a decrease in the total number of particulates and an increase in the number-averaged diameter of the particulates, as measured by the Electrical Aerosol Size Analyzer.
