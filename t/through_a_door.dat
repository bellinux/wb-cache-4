5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>door</b> with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups.
