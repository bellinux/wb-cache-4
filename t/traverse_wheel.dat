5000|$|The M40 {{is shaped}} like a long tube with an M8C [...]50 cal {{spotting}} rifle above. The spotting rifle fires a round whose trajectory closely matches that of the 105 mm round and gives off {{a puff of smoke}} on impact with the target. On the left side, there is an elevating wheel, in the center of which is the trigger wheel used to fine adjust the elevation {{and at the same time}} firing the spotting rifle when pulled, and the gun when pushed. The mounting is a tripod, but the front leg has a castering wheel. On top of the mount is a <b>traverse</b> <b>wheel.</b> On the center of the <b>traverse</b> <b>wheel</b> is a locking wheel, when the wheel is down, the rifle is locked in traverse, and can only be moved right and left with the <b>traverse</b> <b>wheel.</b> When the wheel is raised, the rifle can be traversed by hand. Austria produced a two-wheeled mount for the M40.|$|E
5000|$|On July 19, 1902, Byron J. Carter, {{manager of}} a Jackson bicycle shop, along with {{founding}} partners, George A. Matthews, a buggy manufacturer, and Charles Lewis, once Jackson's biggest employer as owner of a spring axle company, formed the Jackson Automobile Company, on Hupp Street, Jackson. Carter was its first vice president. In 1905 he left to form the Motorcar Company in Jackson, featuring his friction drive car and naming it “Cartercar.” The new variable speed transmission used friction discs, not gears, and also allowed the car to brake by reversing the lever. [...] Carter developed his friction-drive system with parts from a corn sheller. Responding {{to the problem of}} other friction-drive cars failing in wet conditions, he developed an aluminum friction disc with a cardboard <b>traverse</b> <b>wheel</b> lining.|$|E

50|$|The {{trail was}} the split-box type trail with {{detachable}} spades. The <b>traversing</b> hand <b>wheel</b> and the scale were {{located on the}} left side of the carriage. The elevation scale, the range drum, and the sight were on the right side of the carriage.|$|R
50|$|The {{aluminum}} disk was twenty-two {{inches in}} diameter and was faced with an aluminum disk of equal size with a facing of just {{over a quarter of}} an inch in thickness. The <b>traversing</b> <b>wheel</b> was eighteen {{inches in diameter}} with a 1.5 in working face, strawboard rings eighteen inches outside diameter by three inches radial dimension. It was clamped between cast iron members supporting the strawboard rings inside and clamping them sideways. This fibrous friction wheel is splined to slide on a sleeve seventeen inches in diameter variably carried on a steel shaft thirteen inches in diameter. It journaled in swinging boxes so that the wheel can be pressed against or separated from the iron, aluminum-faced driving disk, which is motor driven.|$|R
50|$|The first Panthers (Ausf D) had a {{hydraulic}} motor that could traverse the turret at a maximum {{rate of one}} complete revolution in one minute, independent of engine speed. This was improved in the Ausf A model with {{a hydraulic}} traverse that varied with engine speed; one full turn taking 46 seconds at an engine speed of 1,000 rpm but only 15 seconds if the engine was running at 3,000 rpm. This arrangement was a weakness, as traversing the Panther's turret rapidly onto a target required close coordination between the gunner and driver, who had to run the engine to maximum speed. By comparison, the M4 Sherman's electrically traversed turret rotated at up to 360 degrees in 15 seconds and was independent of engine speed, which gave it an advantage over the Panther in close-quarters combat. A hand <b>traverse</b> <b>wheel</b> was provided for the Panther gunner to make fine adjustment of his aim.|$|E
50|$|MÄGERLE, BLOHM and JUNG offer {{machines}} for surface grinding, {{the most common}} form of grinding that produces smooth finishes on flat surfaces and Machines, and profile grinding, the grinding of cylindrical work without <b>traversing</b> the <b>wheel</b> whose periphery is profiled to the form required and extends over the full length of the work. In Surface grinding, the grinding wheel revolves on a spindle, and the workpiece, mounted on either a reciprocating or a rotary table, is brought into contact with the grinding wheel.|$|R

50|$|The main {{or driving}} disk {{is faced with}} a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the <b>traversing</b> <b>wheel</b> with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding a color scale which performs well when converted to a grayscale. We assume that each color is converted to a shade of gray with the same intensity as the color. We also assume that the color scales have a linear variation of intensity and hue, and find scales which maximize the average chroma (or "colorfulness") of the colors. We find two classes of solutions, which <b>traverse</b> the color <b>wheel</b> in opposite directions. The two classes of scales start with hues near cyan and red. The average chroma of the scales are 65 - 77 % those of the pure colors. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|We were slowly {{penetrating}} the great range {{within a few}} miles of the North Carolina border, passing cornfields so steep that we wondered how they could be cultivated, bouncing past old-time log cabins built of hand-hewn timber, and waving to unbelievably large numbers of silent children who watched amid the barking of their dogs as strangers went by. We stopped by a cabin and inquired of an aged woman who sat leaning back in a homemade hickory chair with her feet on the rail, how far it was to Greenbriar, which had been designated to us {{as the end of the}} trail that could be <b>traversed</b> by four <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a review and extension of current grinding theory. Grinding operations are classified {{on the basis}} of (a) the cutting action of the grit, (b) the geometry of wheel and work, (c) the type of chip produced, (d) the existence or otherwise of a continuous lateral <b>traverse</b> of the <b>wheel.</b> The theory is developed using the above method of classification. Recent experimental work by Purcell(12) on the wear of the wheel in surface grinding is reinterpreted {{in the light of the}} theory. It is shown to be consistent with the postulate of a constant task per grit. A method of calculation is suggested by which a satisfactory surface grinding technique may be applied to the form grinding of gears, where the task per grit is not independent of the imposed grinding conditions...|$|R
40|$|Mobile robots {{can safely}} operate in environments that pose risks to human health, such as {{disaster}} zones and planetary exploration. Robots in these environments may encounter uneven terrain like debris fields, staircases, and rock ledges that {{are impossible to}} <b>traverse</b> with <b>wheels</b> or tracks but are surmountable by legged humanoid platforms through careful selection of footholds. The DARPA Robotics Challenge demonstrated that today's field robots are capable of uneven terrain traversal but they moved slowly and only for short durations. The stretches of walking are separated by longer stationary periods consumed by LIDAR data acquisition and human operator decision making. With the goal of improving autonomy, speed, and reliability, this thesis research investigates new algorithms for continuous locomotion over uneven terrain through online terrain perception and continuous footstep re-planning. A new algorithm for planar segmentation of terrain features is presented, along with a novel approach that integrates stereo depth fusion for terrain perception and online footstep re-planning using mixed-integer quadratic optimization. The approach is implemented within a novel software framework called Director, and results are validated on hardware using the Atlas humanoid robot with autonomous laboratory experiments and semi-autonomous field experiments at the DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals. by James Patrick Marion.

50|$|In {{common with}} Rheinmetall's other Minenwerfer designs, the leMW was a rifled muzzle-loader that had {{hydraulic}} cylinders {{on each side}} of the tube to absorb the recoil forces and spring recuperators to return the tube to the firing position. It had a rectangular firing platform with limited <b>traverse</b> and elevation. <b>Wheels</b> could be added to ease transportation or it could be carried by at least six men. In 1916, a new model, designated as the n.A. or neuer Art (new version), was fielded that included a circular firing platform, giving a turntable effect, which permitted a full 360 degree traverse. It also had a longer 16 in barrel and could be used for direct fire between 0° and 27° elevation if the new 90 kg (200 lb) trail was fitted to absorb the recoil forces. In this mode it was pressed into service as an anti-tank gun.|$|R
30|$|The problem is, when a rover with rigid <b>wheels</b> <b>traverses</b> loose soil, {{there is}} a {{possibility}} of extremely bad traction conditions. This means that slipping and sinking behaviors can occur. The wheels of the MER was sinking into the soil and could not move; a situation that is not easily rectified. When the rovers are traversing loose soil, we have to consider the condition of the ground under the wheels. The relation between the wheel and loose soil can be described using Terramechanics [4]. Using terramechanics, the entrance angle, which can indicate the depth that the wheel is sinking into the soil, is used to lead the drawbar pull. Many researchers are studied about Terramechanics [5]–[8]. Ding et al. summarized the most recent work on Terramechanics [9]. It is necessary to understand the range of the contacting angle between the wheel and loose soil for the derivation of drawbar pull. The contacting angle is shown using the entrance angle and the leaving angle. If the entrance angle can be detected while the rovers are traversing, the drawbar pull and the sinkage can be derived “real time”. It is effective to detect sinkage to determine the rovers moving path.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis framework for planetary missions that have coupled mobility and EDL (Entry-Descent-Landing) systems. Traditional systems engineering approaches to mobility missions such as MERs (Mars Exploration Rovers) and MSL (Mars Science Laboratory) independently study the EDL {{system and the}} mobility system, and does not perform explicit trade-off between them or risk minimization of the overall system. A major challenge is that EDL operation is inherently uncertain and its analysis results such as landing footprint are described using PDF (Probability Density Function). The proposed approach first builds a mobility cost-to-go map that encodes the driving cost of any point on the map to a science target location. The cost could include variety of metrics such as <b>traverse</b> distance, time, <b>wheel</b> rotation on soft soil, and closeness to hazards. It then convolves the mobility cost-to-go map with the landing PDF given by the EDL system, which provides a histogram of driving cost, {{which can be used}} to evaluate the overall risk of the mission. By capturing the coupling between EDL and mobility explicitly, this analysis framework enables quantitative tradeoff between EDL and mobility system performance, as well as the characterization of risks in a statistical way. The simulation results are presented with a realistic Mars terrain dat...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{increasing}} number of wearable and mobile devices are capable of automatically sensing and recording rich information about the surrounding environment. To make use of such data, it is desirable for each data point to be matched with its corresponding spatial location. We focus on using the trajectory from a device’s odometry sensors that reveal changes in motion over time. Our goal is to recover the route traversed, which we will define as a sequence of revisitable positions. Dead reckoning, which computes the device’s route from its odometry trajectory, is known to suffer from significant drift over time. We aim to overcome drift errors by reshaping the odometry trajectory to fit the constraints of a given topological map and sensor noise model. Prior works use iterative search algorithms that are susceptible to local maximas [15], {{which means that they}} can be misled when faced with ambiguous decisions. In contrast, our algorithm is able to find the set of all routes within the given constraints. This also reveals if there are multiple routes that are similarly likely. We can then rank them and select the optimal route that is most likely to be the actual route.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the respective journeys {{of the central}} female protagonist in Brecht’s Mother Courage and Zinnie Harris’ more recent The <b>Wheel</b> (<b>Traverse</b> Theatre, 2011). Both plays trace the experience of war on ordinary working women as they assume care of children and enter {{into a state of}} constant travel to avoid an increasingly pervasive war as it spreads across Europe. Interestingly, I argue, Harris follows Brecht in his use of epic theatre to present both the historical horror of war against a backdrop of day to day drudgery, where the finding of food and shelter becomes part of the daily routine of survival. Both Mother Courage and The Wheel’s central protagonist, Beatriz, are forced to dislocate themselves from a permanent home and enter into an unstable state of flux as they crisscross national boundaries that are in a perpetual state of transformation. Where Harris’ play goes further, however, is in its jumping of both real-time and spatial borders. Beatriz’s nightmarish, cyclical journey encompasses the major conflict zones of the twentieth century, as she endlessly encounters war after war. The nature of my intervention in this paper is twofold. Firstly, I aim to compare the use of epic theatre in these innovative theatrical approaches to women and their crossing of boundaries. Secondly, I will analyse the use of a consistently threatening and intensifying conflict as dramatic device, paying particular attention to: the use of literal and metaphorical demarcation, masculine/feminine dichotomy in the conflict zone, and the enactment of the impact of war on journeying women...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{properties}} of terrains encountered by the Curiosity rover {{during the first}} 360 sols of operations have been inferred from analysis of the scour zones produced by Sky Crane Landing System engine plumes, wheel touch down dynamics, pits produced by Chemical Camera (ChemCam) laser shots, rover <b>wheel</b> <b>traverses</b> over rocks, the extent of sinkage into soils, and the magnitude and sign of rover‐based slippage during drives. Results have been integrated with morphologic, mineralogic, and thermophysical properties derived from orbital data, and Curiosity‐based measurements, {{to understand the nature}} and origin of physical {{properties of}} traversed terrains. The hummocky plains (HP) landing site and traverse locations consist of moderately to well‐consolidated bedrock of alluvial origin variably covered by slightly cohesive, hard‐packed basaltic sand and dust, with both embedded and surface‐strewn rock clasts. Rock clasts have been added through local bedrock weathering and impact ejecta emplacement and form a pavement‐like surface in which only small clasts (< 5 to 10 cm wide) have been pressed into the soil during wheel passages. The bedded fractured (BF) unit, site of Curiosity's first drilling activity, exposes several alluvial‐lacustrine bedrock units with little to no soil cover and varying degrees of lithification. Small wheel sinkage values (< 1 cm) for both HP and BF surfaces demonstrate that compaction resistance countering driven‐wheel thrust has been minimal and that rover slippage while traversing across horizontal surfaces or going uphill, and skid going downhill, have been dominated by terrain tilts and wheel‐surface material shear modulus values.

40|$|Hierdie artikel ontleed die dagboek van Louis Tregardt ten einde die waarde daarvan as historiese bron te bepaal. Tregardt was die enigste Voortrekkerleier wat 'n dagboek bygehou het en wel vir die tydperk van einde Julie 1836 tot die begin van Mei 1838. Hierin vermeld hy, benewens sy daaglikse aantekeninge oor die aktiwiteite waarmee hy en sy trekgenote hulle normaalweg besig gehou het, 'n magdom besonderhede wat nie geredelik in ander bronne beskikbaar is nie. Hy skryf oor sy eie lewens-en wêreldbeskouing, oor onderlinge verhoudinge binne asook tussen Voortrekkergesinne, oor rasse-vooroordele en oor gewelddadigheid. Hy skryf oor verskeie van hulle gebruike, waaronder godsdiens, opvoeding, mediese behandeling, praktyke in verband met dood en begrafnis en eet-en drinkgewoontes. Uitvoerige besonderhede word oor Tregardt en sy trekgenote se leefwêreld verskaf, insluitende oor die klimaat, fauna en flora, jag, boerderybedrywighede, veesiektes, behuising, meubels, gereedskap, kleredrag, die onderhoud van ossewaens en trekgereedskap, vervaardiging van gebruiksartikels soos seep, die uitdagings op die trekpad, waaronder roofdiere en veediewe en interaksie met inheemse gemeenskappe en met die Portugese by Delagoabaai. Laastens werp die dagboek lig op die Afrikaans wat destyds gebesig is - 'n aspek wat nie in die artikel ontleed word nie. Aangesien Tregardt se dagboek so 'n verskeidenheid fasette aan die lig bring, is die finale gevolgtrekking dat dit as een van die mees uitstaande dokumente uit die GrootTrek-tydperk beskou moet word en dat die waarde daarvan nie oorskat kan word nie. In {{this article}} {{it is argued}} that the diary of Louis Tregardt {{contains}} a wealth of historical information. Tregardt was the only Voortrekker leader of the Great Trek era who kept a diary. It covers the period from the end of July 1836, when Tregardt and his group of Voortrekkers had already reached the Soutpansberg region in what is today the Limpopo Province of South Africa, to 1 May 1838, when his wife died less than three weeks after they had reached the Portuguese Fort at what is now Maputo in Mozambique. The diary was written in the language spoken by Tregardt and his companions: an early form of Afrikaans which was evolving from Dutch. Two transcriptions of Tregardt’s diary have been published to date. The author of this article is busy translating the diary into Afrikaans. Selections from the diary have been published in English. Furthermore, a variety of academic and popular historical studies on Tregardt and his diary have been undertaken, especially on the language used by the diarist. Tregardt’s trek has inspired creative work by foremost literary and artistic figures in South Africa. However, the only extensive evaluation of the diary as an historical source was undertaken by Gustav Preller in 1917. Since then a large body of information on Tregardt and his trek, which Preller did not have access to, has emerged. It certainly is time for a re-evaluation of the diary as an historical source. The first issue focused on in this article is the diarist himself, namely Tregardt. Why did he keep the diary? Did he mostly report on events and circumstances in which he himself participated or which he experienced? Did he enter information on a daily basis or long after events about which he wrote? Is the information which he included in the diary of sufficient interest to justify claims that it should be regarded as an important source? The answers to these questions can be summarised as follows: It is not clear why Tregardt kept a diary, but it certainly was not to justify his actions. He reported on what he himself did or witnessed. He wrote almost daily and seldom more than two days after events; and he certainly provides unique and valuable information. Indeed, this evaluation of Tregardt’s diary as an historical source is based primarily on an analysis of the variety of issues about which the diary provides information that is not readily available from other sources. In the first place, Tregardt provides detailed information about his own character and views; about relationships within Voortrekker families; about racial prejudices; and about violence. Secondly, the diary highlights the differences between the various types of pioneers who participated in the Great Trek. Thirdly, extensive information is provided on Voortrekker customs and habits, including religious practices, education, death and funerals, clothing, food and drink, disease and medicine. Fourthly, the diary contains extensive information about the world of the Voortrekker. This includes the fauna and flora of the areas where they trekked; the climate and rainfall; the challenges of trekking in areas never before <b>traversed</b> by <b>wheeled</b> vehicles; interaction with indigenous communities as well as cultural practices of those communities; their hunting activities and indiscriminate killing and wounding of game; their wagons and the challenges to keep those wagons going; houses and shelters which the Voortrekkers built; their furniture and their tools; their farming activities and their struggle to move forward with their large herds of cattle and sheep; stock diseases and, finally, their interaction with the Portuguese at Delagoa Bay. In conclusion, the author agrees with Preller that there is no other single document from the Great Trek era that contains such a wealth of information as does Tregardt’s diary. In addition, the diary is a literary gem reflecting the early development of the Afrikaans language – an issue not addressed in this article. The only possible conclusion is that the value of Tregardt’s diary as an historical source cannot be over-estimated. [URL]...|$|R
