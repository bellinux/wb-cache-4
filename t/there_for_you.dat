500|$|Diana asks Paul {{to prove}} to her how far he is {{prepared}} to go to create an alliance between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together. Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option he has got to keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match – every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E
500|$|Katzenberg {{moved the}} opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, [...] "never confirmed", was that Katzenberg had given PDI [...] "rich {{financial}} incentives to induce them to whatever {{it would take to}} have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start". Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug’s Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt. Jobs believed it [...] "a blatant extortion attempt" [...] and would not go for it, explaining that {{there was nothing he could}} do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. [...] "I was the one guy <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> back then, and now you’re allowing them to use you to screw me," [...] Katzenberg said. He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug’s Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.|$|E

He told Nick Greiner [...] "I'll go you 50/50", and the NSW State government paid {{the other half of}} the cost.

You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E

Recorded with therapeutical background, Norwood has noted the fatal 2006 car accident, in which she was involved, as a reason for its inclusion on the album. [...] "To know that you have somebody by your side who is gonna always be <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> that comforts you in a way and that kinda gives you an extra confidence about yourself," [...] she said, [...] "And that's what I love about it: It's first the message and than you get into the beat and the whole musical part of it. I think everyone's gonna be able to relate to that [...] It's universal." ...|$|E
2500|$|The gradobranitelj in Bukor in the 1950s was Trivun Selenić. Perceiving {{that there}} might be hail, he would go behind the village, wave his arms toward the cloud, and speak the {{following}} (the meaning of the italicized words is unclear): [...] "Raviše đaviše, nađuniši pistols, the dress on silver, the girl onto the neck! Barbarian's head smashed! I am the first voivode here. The dinner is not served for you here. Go there to those hills. It is served <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> So dine there." [...] Trivun explained that hail clouds were led by devils accompanied by souls of the drowned and hanged. By the statement [...] "I am the first voivode here" [...] he would proclaim that he was the principal commander of devils, who consequently had to obey his commands and proceed around his village. Trivun recognized that all this was a sin: both his declaring himself a voivode of devils, and averting hail from his village, because it would fall and make damage at some other place. Miljko Ivković from Dobrići spoke nothing, but went onto the field, took his cap off, made the Sign of the Cross, and put the cap back on. After that, he three times made {{the sign of the cross}} with a knife in the direction of the cloud, thus cutting it into quarters, which he then drove apart. In the end he stuck the knife's handle into the ground, the blade turned toward the cloud.|$|E
