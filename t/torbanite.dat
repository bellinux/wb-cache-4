5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and <b>Torbanite.</b> Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. <b>Torbanite,</b> named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E

40|$|The {{name of the}} {{discoverer}} of {{oil shale}} in Tasmania was not recorded {{in the annals of}} that time: The earliest account appears in the "Papers and Proceedings-of the Royal Society of Van Diemen's Land" in a paper read by J. Milligan in the year 1851. It was the original purpose of the writer to deal with the two types of shale, namely, tasmanite and the so-called <b>torbanites</b> or kerosene shales, but as the subject assumed such large proportions it was decided to confine attention to tasmanite only. number of companies hold shale interests in Tasmania today, one of which, the Australian Shale Oil Company, has erected a very large plant, and has opened another area for mining. It is expected that the plant will be put into operation this month. Investigation shows that the shales are found in disconnected basins situated in the north and north-central parts of Tasmania, associated with kerogenite and humickerogenite coals. The most important is that extending from Latrobe to Quamby Bluff and Chudleigh. The first question for consideration is whether it is advisable to market the fuel oil portion as such, or whether it is advantageous to crack the fuel oil into benzine and tar. Tests have shown that the straight-run benzine and the cracked fuel oil derived from tasmanite contain oils of the aromatic series, and that the benzine so produced has proved an excellent motor fuel...|$|R

50|$|Bathgate was an {{established}} centre of traditional industries when {{the line was}} proposed, but the situation was revolutionised when James Young, an industrial chemist, had developed an industrial process of manufacturing paraffin from <b>torbanite,</b> a type of oil shale. He had obtained a patent for the process in October 1850, and the <b>torbanite</b> had been discovered on the Torbanehill estate, about halfway between Bathgate and Whitburn. Young joined in partnership with Edward William Binney and Edward Meldrum and the Bathgate Works started operations in February 1851. This was the first commercial oil works in the world. When the <b>torbanite</b> was exhausted, shale rocks were exploited, at Bathgate {{and elsewhere in the}} locality, and although they had an inferior oil content they were nonetheless commercially desirable. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway built a branch line from the E&BR line to Blackhall, connecting Young's oil processing plant; the line opened in 1850 and diverged from the E&BR immediately east of the Bathgate station.|$|E
