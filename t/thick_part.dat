2500|$|The fort {{is located}} in Kampung Sarombe, on the island formed by two major mouths of the present Jeneberang river. Originally it was a {{rectangular}} shaped fort about 240 x 500 meters with bastions on each corner. Currently the southern section (150 meter) of the western wall is the most visible, two-thirds of the original western wall. It is a red brick wall of 3.5 meter <b>thick.</b> <b>Part</b> {{of the reason why}} this part survived further damage is because a holy tomb located on the southwest bastion. This bastion is now a mound of 6.5 meters high and 13 meters in diameter. It is known as Maccini' Sombala' (Makassarese [...] "the sighting of sails") or Tompo' Bataya (Makassarese [...] "the highest brick-formation"). Maccini' Sombala' was originally the name of the royal palace within Somba Opu, which was built on August 26, 1650, to replace an earlier palace; the name lingered into the bastion centuries later. Another wall extend to the east of the bastion for about 500 meter, broken by flooding at many places. The rear eastern wall can also be traced, though it strangely curves. The once very strong 500 meter long northern wall is the most difficult to trace. This wall might be washed by a small stream that formed in the past during the development of the delta and washed away {{the northern part of the}} ruined fort, as well as its ruined northeast bastion.|$|E

6000|$|Five of {{the crew}} manned the winch; the mate and Jerry went to a block-tackle which was also {{connected}} with the lifting apparatus. Then the order to hoist was given, and immediately after, just as the sun went down, the floating light went up,--a modest yet all-important luminary of the night. Slowly it rose, for the lantern containing it weighed full half a ton, and caused the hoisting chain and pulleys to groan complainingly. At last it reached its destination {{at the head of}} the <b>thick</b> <b>part</b> of the mast, but about ten or fifteen feet beneath the ball. As it neared the top, Jerry sprang up the chain-ladder to connect the lantern with the rod and pinion by means of which, with clockwork beneath, it was made to revolve and [...] "flash" [...] once every third of a minute.|$|E
60|$|Oolanga was disappointed, but {{he dared}} not exhibit any feeling lest it should betray {{that he was}} hiding. Therefore he slunk downstairs again noiselessly, and waited for a more {{favourable}} opportunity of furthering his plans. It must be borne in mind {{that he thought that}} the heavy trunk was full of valuables, and that he believed that Lady Arabella had come to try to steal it. His purpose of using for his own advantage the combination of these two ideas was seen later in the day. Oolanga secretly followed her home. He was an expert at this game, and succeeded admirably on this occasion. He watched her enter the private gate of Diana's Grove, and then, taking a roundabout course and keeping out of her sight, he at last overtook her in a <b>thick</b> <b>part</b> of the Grove where no one could see the meeting.|$|E

If the leaf were a lake of the same shape, and its stem the entering river, the lines of the currents passing through it would, I believe, be nearly {{the same as that of}} the veins in the aquatic leaf. I have not examined the fluid law accurately, and I do not suppose there is more real correspondence than may be caused by the leaf's expanding in every permitted direction, as the water would, with all the speed it can; but the resemblance is so close as to enable you to fasten the relation of the unbranched leaves to streams more distinctly in your mind,--just as the toss of the palm leaves from their stem may, I think, in their likeness to the springing of a fountain, remind you of their relation to the desert, and their necessity, therein, to life of man and beast. {55} ...|$|E
60|$|The fact is, {{this way}} of selling and cooking meat in large, gross {{portions}} is of English origin, and belongs to a country where all the customs of society spring from a class who have no particular occasion for economy. The practice of minute and delicate division comes from a nation which acknowledges the need of economy, and has made it a study. A quarter of lamb in this mode of division would be sold in three nicely prepared portions. The <b>thick</b> <b>part</b> would be sold by itself, for a neat, compact little roast; the rib-bones would be artistically separated, and all the edible matters scraped away would form those delicate dishes of lamb-chop which, fried in bread-crumbs to a golden brown, are so ornamental and so palatable a side-dish; the trimmings which remain after this division would be destined to the soup kettle or stew pan. In a French market is a little portion for every purse, and the far-famed and delicately flavored soups and stews which have arisen out of French economy are a study worth a housekeeper's attention. Not one atom of food is wasted in the French modes of preparation; even tough animal cartilages and sinews, instead of appearing burnt and blackened in company with the roast meat to which {{they happen to be}} related, are treated according to their own laws, and come out either in savory soups, or those fine, clear meat-jellies which form a garnish no less agreeable to the eye than palatable to the taste.|$|E

50|$|Drafting {{is done by}} {{pinching}} off a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back while twist is added to it. The active hand pulls back until the yarn is the desired thickness. The passive hand controls how much twist is allowed in the drafting yarn: too much twist and the yarn won't draft; too little and the yarn will break. Twist concentrates in the thin areas of the yarn, solidifying these. Thus the tension doesn't stretch these parts thinner, but instead drafts the <b>thicker</b> <b>parts</b> until all the yarn is approximately the same thickness. This {{has the effect of}} automatically thinning out the <b>thicker</b> <b>parts,</b> which is what allows this technique to work.|$|R
