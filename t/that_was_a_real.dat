Electronic jamming equipment was added without removing tanker capability so the EKA-3B could jam enemy radar while waiting to refuel tactical aircraft. Eventually, the EKA-3B {{was replaced by}} the smaller dedicated Grumman KA-6D Intruder tanker, which although it had less capacity and endurance, was deployed in greater numbers within the carrier's air wing. Two additional Naval Reserve units were established in the early 1970s as air refueling squadrons, VAQ-208 and VAQ-308, at NAS Alameda, California. Both units operated aircraft with electronic warfare equipment removed and were redesignated as KA-3Bs. VAK-208 and VAK-308 were decommissioned in the early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|When Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens {{started to}} move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public {{appearance}} and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to [...] "get the public to think that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> person". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.|$|E
500|$|An early {{issue that}} {{attracted}} much attention, {{both positive and}} negative, was G.I. Joe #21, titled [...] "Silent Interlude", which was told entirely without words or sound effects. In a 1987 interview, Hama explained that the motivation for the story was that he [...] "... {{wanted to see if}} [...] could do a story <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real,</b> complete story—beginning, middle, end, conflict, characterization, action, solid resolution—without balloons or captions or sound effects." [...] At first, the issue was controversial; some readers felt cheated that it had no words and could be [...] "read" [...] so quickly. However, it eventually became one of the series' most enduring and influential issues. Issue #21 has been recognized as a modern comic classic, and has become a prime example of comics' visual storytelling power. Comic book artist and theorist Scott McCloud (author of Understanding Comics) describes [...] "Silent Interlude" [...] as [...] "... a kind of watershed moment for cartoonists of [...] generation. Everyone remembers it. All these things came out of it. It was like 9/11." [...] The issue would eventually be ranked #44 in Wizard Magazine's listing of the [...] "100 Best Single Issues Since You Were Born", and #6 on io9's [...] "10 Issues of Ongoing Comics that Prove Single Issues Can Be Great." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Arima Arima" [...] {{was set in}} Ramoji Rao Film City, Hyderabad and was choreographed by Prabhu Deva. It was picturised on Chitti, his robot {{army and}} Sana. According to the {{director}} S. Shankar, art director Sabu Cyril and cinematographer R. Rathnavelu, picturising this song was the most challenging {{part of the whole}} film. The song also features two robotic lions, the creation of which, according to Sabu Cyril, is a professional secret. In an interview, Ratnavelu said, [...] "This film has been a big challenge right from the start till the patchwork. But the most challenging part for me was shooting the climax song, Arima Arima, which will be the USP of the film. The song was shot in a set in Hyderabad in 2008. I had to perceive in 2008 what would be in vogue now. So, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> challenge and that has come out really well." ...|$|E

[...] Mara Reinstein of Us Weekly gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, feeling [...] "excited audiences desperate for escapism [...] lap up the film's {{inherent}} joyfulness", but Gunn [...] "has doubled down on all his once-nifty novelties. Strip them away and what remains is a bloated semi-mess." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times was positive of the film's soundtrack and cast, especially Russell, but felt Gunn was trying too hard to re-capture the magic of the first film, and the increased scope of effects and action becomes weary. Turan concluded, [...] "There are enough reminders of the first Guardians to make the sequel an acceptable experience, [...] less like itself and more like a standard Marvel production." [...] Manohla Dargis at The New York Times said the film [...] "certainly has its attractions, but most of them are visual rather than narrative." [...] She also felt Gunn was trying too hard, and found many elements of the sequel to be too serious even with Russell balancing that with a much-needed [...] "unforced looseness".|$|E

60|$|Still, the queer object {{interested}} him languidly, by its odd {{and timely}} {{connection with the}} subject of his morning sermon; and he looked at it again a little more closely. By Jove, yes, it was a feather, not a doubt in the world of that now; he could see distinctly the central shaft of a tail-quill, and the little barbed branches given off regularly on either side of it. The shale on which it was impressed was a soft, light-brown mudstone; in fact, a fragment of lithographic slate, exactly like that employed by lithographers for making pictures. He could easily see how the thing had happened; the bird had fallen into the soft mud, long ages since, before the shale had hardened, and the form of its feathers had been distinctly nature-printed, while it was still moist, upon its plastic surface. But a bird in the oolite! <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> discovery; and, as the Gospel Evangelists were no Sabbatarians, Cyril did not scruple in the pursuit of Truth to dig away at the thin slab with his knife, till he egged it out of the rock by dexterous side pressure, and laid it triumphantly down at last for further examination on the big stone that stood before him.|$|E

His eyebrows too? He could not find them. His head, no doubt, was very near to the dervish's when they were rolling upon the ground together, and this was the effect of the explosion of his own gun. Well, he would have time to grow some more hair before he saw Fleet Street again. But the cut, perhaps, was a more serious matter. Was it enough to prevent him getting to the telegraph-office at Sarras? The only way was to try and see. But there was only that poor little Syrian grey of his. There it stood in the evening sunshine, with a sunk head and a bent knee, as if its morning's work was still heavy upon it. What hope was there of being able to do thirty-five miles of heavy going upon that? It would be a strain upon the splendid ponies of his companions--and they were the swiftest and most enduring in the country. The most enduring? There was one creature more enduring, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> trotting camel. If he had had one he might have got to the wires first after all, for Mortimer had said that over thirty miles they have the better of any horse. Yes, if he had only had a real trotting camel!
