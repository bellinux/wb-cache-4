However, manipulating some of those candidate genes has yielded no effect or only a marginally positive effect on fiber yield or quality.

Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) {{is the most}} important <b>textile</b> <b>crop</b> in the world, and often encounters abiotic stress during its growth seasons. In this study, a gene encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was isolated from cotton, and designated as GhMPK 17. The open reading frame (ORF) of GhMPK 17 gene is 1494 bp in length and encodes a protein with 497 amino acids. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that GhMPK 17 expression was up-regulated in cotton under NaCl, mannitol and ABA treatments. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing GhMPK 17 gene showed higher seed germination, root elongation and cotyledon greening/expansion rates than those of the wild type on MS medium containing NaCl, mannitol and exogenous ABA, suggesting that overexpression of GhMPK 17 in Arabidopsis increased plant ABA-insensitivity, and enhanced plant tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of GhMPK 17 in Arabidopsis reduced H 2 O 2 level and altered expression of ABA- and abiotic stress-related genes in the transgenic plants. Collectively, these data suggested that GhMPK 17 gene may be involved in plant response to high salinity and osmotic stresses and ABA signaling...|$|E

40|$|Cotton is {{the most}} {{important}} <b>textile</b> <b>crop</b> {{as a result of its}} long cellulose-enriched mature fibers. These single-celled hairs initiate at anthesis from the ovule epidermis. To date, genes proven to be critical for fiber development have not been identified. Here, we examined the role of the sucrose synthase gene (Sus) in cotton fiber and seed by transforming cotton with Sus suppression constructs. We focused our analysis on 0 to 3 days after anthesis (DAA) for early fiber development and 25 DAA, when the fiber and seed are maximal in size. Suppression of Sus activity by 70 % or more in the ovule epidermis led to a fiberless phenotype. The fiber initials in those ovules were fewer and shrunken or collapsed. The level of Sus suppression correlated strongly with the degree of inhibition of fiber initiation and elongation, probably as a result of the reduction of hexoses. By 25 DAA, a portion of the seeds in the fruit showed Sus suppression only in the seed coat fibers and transfer cells but not in the endosperm and embryo. These transgenic seeds were identical to wild-type seeds except for much reduced fiber growth. However, the remaining seeds in the fruit showed Sus suppression both in the seed coat and in the endosperm and embryo. These seeds were shrunken with loss of the transfer cells and were � 5 % of wild-type seed weight. These results demonstrate that Sus plays a rate-limiting role in the initiation and elongation of the single-celled fibers. These analyses also show that suppression of Sus only in the maternal seed tissue represses fiber development without affecting embryo development and seed size. Additional suppression in the endosperm and embryo inhibits their own development, which blocks the formation of adjacent seed coat transfer cells and arrests seed development entirely...|$|E

However, few genes controlling fiber quality and yield traits have been cloned and characterized to date. In this study, {{a large number of}} genes controlling the upper half mean length (UHML) of fibers were cloned using a newly-developed high-throughput gene and QTL cloning system and subjected to systems analysis. Furthermore, the molecular basis and regulation mechanisms of UHML were investigated using the cloned fiber length genes. A total of 474 GFL (Gossypium Fiber Length) genes were cloned. The effect of each GFL gene on UHML varied from 2. 64 % to 7. 92 %. Of 474 GFL genes, 88. 6 % decreased UHML when turned on or actively expressed in the developing fibers at the 10 days post-anthesis (10 -dpa), whereas only 11. 4 % increased UHML. The GFL genes encode proteins and enzymes that are involved in a variety of biological processes and metabolic pathways. The 474 GFL genes interacted to form an interaction network in the 10 -dpa fibers, which suggests that UHML is the consequence of interactions among the GFL genes. In addition, the evolution of fiber length was examined between diploid and tetraploid cottons using the GFL genes. The results showed that the variation of the GFL gene networks, including the number of genes and number of gene x gene interactions, also {{plays an important role in}} the variation of fiber length during polyploidization. Therefore, this study has, for the first time worldwide, cloned a large number of genes controlling UHML and deciphered the underlying molecular basis and regulation mechanisms, thus providing novel resources and knowledge for development of new toolkits for enhanced cotton fiber breeding. The UHML is determined not only by its controlling genes, GFLs, but also by their actions, action directions and interactions. Moreover, the results of this study have not only provided a first line of evidence that a quantitative trait is controlled by a large number of genes, but also added new molecular basis, thus forming the molecular mechanisms of quantitative genetics...|$|E

In order to sustain our fashion and textile industry together with the environment, this study aimed at incorporating the newly introduced concept of 'textile material diversity' based on the theory of 'biodiversity' to the present industrial situation to provide solution. Textile material diversity accentuates not only the usage and manufacturing of a diverse range of sustainable textiles, but also the diverse sources of <b>textile</b> <b>crops</b> to prevent monoculture. The results of this study are first a theoretical concept of textile material diversity to develop feasible solutions and suggestions for the fashion fields, and secondly an introduction of a new sustainable textile material (i. e. bacterial cellulose) to broaden the textile material diversity. To begin with, the sustainability issues influenced by textile materials, figures of fiber consumption and the current status of textile material diversity in the fashion industry are investigated. An extensive literature review is done to identify the gamut of environmental impacts with further implication on the negative impacts of monoculture on biodiversity. This study also presents the general characteristics and case studies of bacterial cellulose exploration for textile development in the literature review. Introduction of bacterial cellulose is then to fulfill the concept of textile material diversity and enrich the spectrum of textile materials. The study further introduces different methods of tailor-shaped cultivation of bacterial cellulose. It is to develop different cultivation methods for the production of bacterial cellulose in order to cater different usage and shape of bacterial cellulose textiles. It improves the environmental values of bacterial cellulose textile production and further promotes it as a sustainable practice. These techniques allow bacterial cellulose to be cultivated into a desirable garment panel shape without cutting or producing extra textile wastes. Different methods of tailor-shaped cultivation can be applied in different shape requirements. With these self-synthesizing and tailor-shaped properties, the biodegradable and natural bacterial cellulose has great potential to be a new sustainable textile material for the fashion and textile industry. All in all, this study provides practical solutions including suggestions of alternative sustainable textile materials to lower the risk of monoculture and more options to the manufacturing and design sectors to tackle the industrial challenges.

The {{research}} of textile handicrafts {{was conducted in}} January and February 1999, in the Croatian villages of Gornji Bogićevci, Stari Grabovac, Rajić, Brestača and Kozarice. These villages are situated in the Western Slavonia, between the towns of Okučani and Novska. The basis of the research were the questions, and especially the drawings, taken from the Questionnaire of the Ethnographic Atlas, which were supplemented by the questions which helped the informants reconstruct the period when textile plants were raised and manufactured, with the questions which helped them remember the people and places where they used to obtain different types of cotton threads, and with the questions on customs and beliefs connected to the processes of textile manufacture. The obtained data were also concerned with the role the textile handicrafts had in everyday life and customs of the inhabitants of these villages. The article starts with my own field data, and continues with the data found in the Questionnaire of the Ethnographic Atlas. The data are arranged according to specific topics and locations, {{and according to the}} order of actions performed during the processes of textile mnanufacture. The subtitles are taken from the titles of specific topics in the Ethnographic Atlas 2 ̆ 7 s Questionnaire, as well as all the additional titles. The research has shown that the data found in the Questionnaire of the Ethnographic Atlas and the newly collected data coincide and complement each other. The terms for the specific stages of manufacture and the terms for the devices used, are mostly of Slavic origin. Terms and titles of foreign origin which are common in this part of Slavonia, can also be found. The devices of the similar shape and outer appearance can also be found in other parts of Slavonia and Croatia. This region, as past researches have already shown, is a region whose ethnological characteristics prove it to be a region of constant contact and mixing of different cultural influences. This region is also a border line where the distribution of certain cultural elements stops, while the distribution of other elements begins. One of such elements is the use of wool for weaving. At the end of the 19 th century, the ethnographer Milko Cepelić noticed that wool was used for weaving in this region, or more precisely, that the border¬line of the regions were wool was used for weaving crossed this specific region, and included the town of Novska and the village of Rajić. Behind this imaginary border-line, we have a region were flax and hemp were used more often than wool. Certain cultural elements can be distinguished here, and they can be compared with elements which can be found in other parts of Croatia, such as the usage of wooden knife for the cleaning of woolen threads from the wooden residue called pozder. This research confirms the distribution of this knife in the region of Western Slavonia and shows that the distribution of this cultural element is much wider than it was believed so far. The term stan for the weaving loom was used in the villages inhabited by Croatian population, and the term natra in the Serbian villages in the part of the Western Slavonia which was included in this research. According to the ethnographic maps, the term stan is common in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The term natra can be found in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Serbia. Another important point is that the informants already know very little about the weaving techniques and the ways they were performed. They mostly remember the terms, and after the Homeland war, in the majority of the houses there were no weaving devices which could help us connect certain weaving techniques with the terms which were used, or possibly, to help us reconstruct the techniques themselves. Here, it would be important to organize specific researches dealing only with this part of textile manufacture, which would include additional field researches, and the search for the preserved textile exhibits in private collections and museums, which can be found in other parts of Croatia, as well. The article also partly deals with the customs which were connected with the raising and manufacturing of the <b>textile</b> <b>crops,</b> customs connected with the weaving itself, and the customs of giving away textile items and items of clothing. The research has shown that the elected informants belong to the last generation which took part in the activities connected with the raising and manufacturing of the <b>textile</b> <b>crops,</b> so that they could also remember the customs, stories, jokes and games which accompanied these activities. It is possible, and perhaps necessary, to compare some of these elements with the same or similar elements from other parts of Croatia. Particularly interesting is the story of women, all members of an extended family called zadruga, who used to spin in the dark, so that the landlord would not see them, and drank stolen rakija (brandy). The similar or the same story is being told as an account of a true event in different parts of Slavonia and among other extended families. The existence of such stories can be explained by their appearance in certain journals published for rural population, especially in those published in the period {{from the beginning of the}} 20 th century until the World War II, the period in which all the publications of Seljačka Sloga proved to be very popular among the peasants. The Christmas custom of fortune telling which is performed on the Christmas Eve and deals with the successful growth of the textile threads, is already well known. Less common is the dance custom performed during the shrove-tide, which is also aimed at assuring the height (i. e. length) of the flax thread, and is also found in Western Slavonia.

The pitfalls and detours of research have been counterbalanced by exciting new discoveries in cellulose structure, biosynthesis, and molecular biology. Cellulose exists in crystalline and noncrystalline states, with the metastable cellulose I allomorph being the most abundant native crystalline form. Two stages of cellulose I crystallization will be described as well as a new form of ordered, noncrystalline cellulose known as quasi-tactic cellulose. The biosynthesis of cellulose is exceedingly complex, involving many genes and enzymes. Ordered membrane complexes (TCs) control the polymerization and crystallization to form cellulose micro®brils. Biochemical investigations have proven to be very dif®cult; however, recent breakthroughs on in vitro cellulose I assembly lend con®dence that this part of cellulose research will soon yield great advances.

In the flax plant, the following parameters were determined: dry matter yield, soluble and total Zn concentrations in leaf and stem, chlorophyll, crude fibre, and tensile properties. For the different soil samples, the following parameters were determined: available Zn (DTPA-AB and Mehlich- 3 extractable Zn), easily leachable Zn (BaCl 2 -extractable Zn), the distribution of Zn fractions, pH and redox potential.

In contrast, adding the high Zn rate of this chelate to the weakly acidic soil produced an excessive Zn concentration in the plant, which caused a significant decrease in both dry matter yield and chlorophyll content. Furthermore, assessing available Zn with the DTPA-AB method proved the best way of estimating the level of excess Zn in flax plants. The soluble Zn concentration, which was established with 2 -(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid reagent (MES), of plant fresh and dry matter could be used as an alternative way of diagnosing the nutritional status of Zn in flax plants.

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of textile factory effluents (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 % concentration) on germination and some physiological parameters like biomass production, chlorophyll contents, root development in three leguminous crops viz., pea (Pisum sativum L.), lentil (Lens esculentum L.) and Gram (Cicer arietinum L.). Plants were raised first in perti dishes and then in plastic pots in triplicate and irrigated with various concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50 and 100 %) of effluent. Germination %, biomass production, chlorophyll contents and various attributes of root development were determined in plants grown under different treatments.

This sector contributes 20 % of the country’s value added, 67 percent of which is paid to informal labour in the form of wages. Given that poverty is most prevalent in rural areas, where there is a 74. 3 percent incidence of poverty as opposed to 36. 8 percent for urban areas, it is reasonable for the government to make improved productivity and the creation and distribution of wealth in rural areas a national priority. The effects of a ten percent increase in capital in both food and cash crop farming are as follows: (i) an increase in value added and production, along with a decrease in agricultural prices; (ii) improved price-competitiveness for the economy; (iii) an increase in final consumption and net exports, resulting in an expansion of GDP; (iv) an increase in real wages for informal labour, which is heavily used in the agricultural sector, along with lower wages in the formal sector; and (v) higher real income and welfare for households. This analysis thus confirms that increasing investment in agriculture, particularly for food crops, could improve the distribution of income and welfare in rural areas.

The carbon-dioxide resulting from burning biomass fuel is recycled through plant growth and hence does not contribute to global warming. Biomass fuel also contains little sulfur and hence does not contribute to acid rain problems. Notwithstanding the environmental desirability of using biomass waste materials, not much of them are used currently due to the need to densify the waste materials and the high cost of conventional methods of densification such as pelletizing and briquetting. The purpose of this project was to test a unique new method of biomass densification developed from recent research in coal log pipeline (CLP). The new method can produce large agglomerates of biomass materials called ''biomass logs'' which are more than 100 times larger and 30 % denser than conventional ''pellets'' or ''briquettes''. The Phase I project was to perform extensive laboratory tests and an economic analysis to determine the technical and economic feasibility of the biomass log fuel (BLF). A variety of biomass waste materials, including wood processing residues such as sawdust, mulch and chips of various types of wood, combustibles that are found in municipal solid waste stream such as paper, plastics and <b>textiles,</b> energy <b>crops</b> including willows and switch grass, and yard waste including tree trimmings, fallen leaves, and lawn grass, were tested by using this new compaction technology developed at Capsule Pipeline Research Center (CPRC), University of Missouri-Columbia (MU). The compaction conditions, including compaction pressure, pressure holding time, back pressure, moisture content, particle size and shape, piston and mold geometry and roughness, and binder for the materials were studied and optimized. The properties of the compacted products [...] biomass logs [...] were evaluated in terms of physical, mechanical, and combustion characteristics. An economic analysis of this technology for anticipated future commercial operations was performed. It was found that the compaction pressure and the moisture content of the biomass materials are critical for producing high-quality biomass logs. For most biomass materials, dense and strong logs can be produced under room temperature without binder and at a pressure of 70 MPa (10, 000 psi), approximately. A few types of the materials tested such as sawdust and grass need a minimum pressure of 100 MPa (15, 000 psi) in order to produce good logs. The appropriate moisture range for compacting waste paper into good logs is 5 - 20 %, and the optimum moisture is in the neighborhood of 13 %. For the woody materials and yard waste, the appropriate moisture range is narrower: 5 - 13 %, and the optimum is 8 - 9 %. The compacted logs have a dry density of 0. 8 to 1. 0 g/cm{sup 3 }, corresponding to a wet density of 0. 9 to 1. 1 g/cm{sup 3 }, approximately. The logs have high strength and high resistance to impact and abrasion, but are feeble to water and hence need to be protected from water or rain. They also have good long-term performance under normal environmental conditions, and can be stored for a long time without significant deterioration. Such high-density and high-strength logs not only facilitate handling, transportation, and storage, but also increase the energy content of biomass per unit volume. After being transported to power plants and crushed, the biomass logs can be co-fired with coal to generate electricity...|$|R

Westerhuis, W. (2016) Hemp for textiles: plant size matters, PhD thesis. Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands, 234 pp. With English and Dutch summaries.   Fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) {{may be an}} alternative to cotton and synthetic fibres as a raw material for textile yarn production in the European Union. The agronomic options to manipulate plant development and crop growth with the aim to optimise hemp long fibre production were investigated. Field trials with factors sowing density, sowing date, harvest time and variety were conducted. Stems were traditionally processed by retting, drying, breaking, and scutching. Following standard protocols, almost 1500 hemp stem samples were analysed. Varieties differ widely in their fibre content, but this thesis shows that when variety and plant size are known, the amounts of fibres, wood, and retting losses are known. The dry weight of the stems at harvest, not the factors underlying this weight, are determinant. In retted stems the dry matter is split–up into fibres and wood in a fixed way. The options to manipulate this ratio by crop management, given variety, are very small and for practical reasons they can be neglected. In fibre hemp two bast fibre types occur. Primary or long fibres are valuable for yarn spinning. Secondary fibres are too short and their presence hampers the production of fine yarns. This thesis shows that the secondary fibre front height increases with plant weight. Although a causal relationship between secondary fibre formation and flowering does not exist, the secondary fibre front is found higher in flowering plants when compared to non–flowering plants of the same height. This {{is likely to be}} caused by the higher weight or momentum of flowering plants as compared with non–flowering plants of the same height. Consequently, a harvest before flowering is preferable. This was shown in a greenhouse experiment, in which the short–day response of hemp was used to create size ranges of flowering and non–flowering plants. To produce high–quality raw materials for <b>textile</b> production, short <b>crops</b> should be grown. The options to produce plants with the desired size are manifold. Since sowing density, sowing date, and harvest time do not have an additional effect on the primary fibre content besides the indirect effect through stem weight, any combination of these factors could be chosen to optimize plant size.    ...|$|R
