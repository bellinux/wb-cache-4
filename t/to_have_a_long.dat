5|$|The {{closely related}} simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) {{has evolved into}} many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the African green monkey (SIVagm) and sooty mangabey (SIVsmm) are thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> evolutionary history with their hosts. These hosts have adapted {{to the presence of}} the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood but evokes only a mild immune response, does not cause the development of simian AIDS, and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical of HIV infection in humans.|$|E
5|$|The lighter {{isotopes}} {{usually have}} shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100ms for 260Bh, 261Bh, 262Bh, and 262mBh were observed. 264Bh, 265Bh, 266Bh, and 271Bh are more stable at around 1s, and 267Bh and 272Bh have half-lives of about 10s. The heaviest isotopes {{are the most}} stable, with 270Bh and 274Bh having measured half-lives of about 61s and 54s respectively, and the even heavier unconfirmed isotope 278Bh appearing to have an even longer half-life of about 690s. The unknown isotopes 273Bh and 275Bh are predicted to have even longer half-lives of around 90minutes and 40minutes respectively. Before its discovery, 274Bh was also predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> half-life of 90minutes, but it {{was found to have}} a shorter half-life of only about 54seconds.|$|E
5|$|While {{maintenance}} {{issues and}} not the actual design of the aircraft were ultimately found responsible for the crash, the accident and subsequent grounding of all DC-10s by the Federal Aviation Administration added to an already unfavorable reputation of the DC-10 aircraft {{in the eyes of}} the public, caused by several other incidents and accidents involving the type. The investigation also revealed other DC-10s with damage caused by the same faulty maintenance procedure. The faulty procedure was banned, and the aircraft type went on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> career as a passenger and cargo aircraft. In response to this accident, American Airlines was fined $500,000 by the U.S. government for improper maintenance procedures.|$|E

When called on to settle the matter, Pope Urban V, invalidated Eymerich's election {{on the grounds that}} the office of Vicar General conflicted with the office of Inquisitor General. He did not, however, confirm Ermengaudi in the position, opting for a neutral third, Jacopo Dominici.|$|R

5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because he is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey in the afterlife. First, {{a group of men}} form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans {{to be the most important}} component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

500|$|The early 6th century {{saw another}} queen ruling the city, {{known only as}} the [...] "Lady of Tikal", who was very likely a {{daughter}} of Chak Tok Ich'aak II. She seems never <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ruled in her own right, rather being partnered with male co-rulers. The first of these was Kaloomte' B'alam, who seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> career as <b>a</b> general at Tikal before becoming co-ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence.

He was intimate with Southey, who spoke of his knowledge of the Middle Ages as marvellous, and he was in close correspondence with Lingard, the historian, who was godfather to one of his sons. His death took place suddenly by paralysis on 17 July 1858. One of his sons was a missionary priest, working in the Australian bush in 1888.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} ZETA's failure to achieve fusion, the device went on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{experimental}} lifetime and produced numerous important {{advances in the}} field. In one line of development, the use of lasers to more accurately measure the temperature was developed on ZETA, and was later used to confirm {{the results of the}} Soviet tokamak approach. In another, while examining ZETA test runs it was noticed that the plasma self-stabilised after the power was turned off. This has led to the modern reversed field pinch concept. More generally, studies of the instabilities in ZETA have led to several important theoretical advances that form the basis of modern plasma theory.|$|E
