25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right {{to do what you want}} with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E
500|$|Goya {{does not}} focus on {{the reasons for the}} shortage, nor does he {{apportion}} blame to any one party. Instead, he is concerned only with its effect on the population. Although the images in the group were based on the experience of Madrid, none of the scenes depict specific events, and there are no identifiable buildings to place the scenes. Goya's focus is on the darkened masses of dead and barely alive bodies, men carrying corpses of women, and bereaved children mourning for lost parents. Hughes believes , Madre infeliz! (Unhappy mother!), to be the most powerful and poignant of the group. He suggests that the space between the small girl sobbing and the corpse of her mother represents [...] "a darkness <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> very essence of loss and orphanhood". This group of plates was probably completed by early 1814. A scarcity of materials during the famine may have accounted for the freer application of aquatint in these prints; Goya was sometimes forced to use defective plates or reuse old plates after they were burnished.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, MacFarlane {{announced}} that the episode would become available on a special DVD release, with series producer Kara Vallow confirming the release would be available on September 28, 2010, along with Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. A month after the announcement, Kevin Reilly, President of Fox Entertainment, stated that the final decision not to air the episode was largely due to concerns about finances and advertisers: [...] "Of all the issues, [...] is the one <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most of a hot button. Particularly at that moment in time, the economy was really struggling {{and there were a}} lot of very tough conversations going on with clients." [...] Reilly said that [...] "the advertisers know what they’re getting" [...] with Family Guy, and he thought that the episode handled the subject fine, but [...] "this one felt like it could cause trouble, and it was just not worth it." [...] Despite the concerns in the U.S. about the episode, it aired on June 20, 2010, on BBC Three in the UK, as a part of the season's regularly scheduled Sunday night run on the station. Although it was originally speculated that Adult Swim might air the episode, Fox stated that there were no plans to air it on their network. Several months before the episode debuted on television, the script was performed in a live table read at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood, California on August 12, 2009. The special reading was attended by Academy of Television Arts and Sciences voters on the heels of the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. Family Guy was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in the category since The Flintstones in 1961. Commenting about the event, MacFarlane said, [...] "We did this to drum up Emmy votes, so we could lose by fewer votes." ...|$|E

You're more confident about what you're doing and having some gravitas, but at the same time, because we're having more and more expectations put on us by everyone, the complexities are increasing.

2500|$|To be sure, in Quanta, the Court {{held that}} “he longstanding {{doctrine}} of patent exhaustion provides {{that the initial}} authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.” But what constitutes [...] "authorization"?

2500|$|Johann Sebastian Bach, the composer, {{does not}} in fact exist in the novel's universe. [...] At the {{beginning}} of the story Susan, a concert cellist, is having problems practising a piece. During the novel Prof. Chronotis uses his time machine to board the Salaxian ship, still in orbit around the Earth. [...] Inside the ship they encounter elaborate and beautiful music <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of the ship's computer system operation, similar to Richard's Anthem program. [...] After they have foiled the ghost's plot and destroyed the ship, Richard finds Susan practising the same music he heard aboard the ship. [...] She tells him it is by Bach. [...] Prof. Chronotis later tells Richard how he managed to retrieve some of the music by introducing it in the Baroque period through the invention of a fake composer.|$|E
2500|$|Cassius O'Shaugnessy, Alan's college {{friend and}} the actual man who studied yoga, {{is a sort of}} most-interesting-man type <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> quintessence of {{individuality}} in the novella. A world traveller, Cassius samples all that life has to offer and provides a contrast to Sam, who does not take risks and lives a comfortable life of middle-class security. Bufithis explains that Cassius' life is a critical commentary on the Slovodas and their friends who prejudge and try to rationally control experience—contrasting though with action. O'Shaugnessy is the romantic that seized the day and took control of his own life and destiny, and he, like a hero, has become a topic of conversation for the meek souls on Sunday afternoon. Marvin calls Cassius a [...] "psychopath", presaging Mailer's Hipster in [...] "The White Negro", and explicitly illustrating how Sam and his friends are polar opposites: law-abiding and rational, but lifeless. Cassius' story, then, only validates Sam's notion that his world-view is correct.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} in the Sunday Herald Sun Bryan Patterson gave Like It Like That a 4 out of 5 star rating and said, [...] "Happily, Sebastian's big soul songs have more of an upbeat New York sound than the slick and imposed LA {{production}} <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> fate of most Idol winners. It is now time to forgive and forget that Sebastian had his start in a sometimes exploitative and often tacky TV talent show. When you're good – really good – inauspicious starts don't really matter Sebastian has paid his dues and finally found his sound. And it's good music, all written or co-written by the young man." [...] The Daily Telegraph music editor Kathy McCabe also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars saying, [...] "Sebastian steps up in songwriting and performance on the soul tracks which were no doubt inspired by his Memphis sessions detour. [...] "All to Myself" [...] is a knock-out song, and book-end song [...] "Attention" [...] is a sexy, hip-swinging soul number which perfectly showcases Sebastian's vocal range." [...] American radio announcer and music journalist Tony Peters wrote, [...] "Great soul music is still out there, you just gotta hunt for it. In this case, that means going halfway around the world. [...] "All to Myself" [...] and [...] "Attention" [...] both have that classic Motown stompin' feel that makes you move your feet, while [...] "Bring Yourself" [...] has conversational lyrics akin to Stevie Wonder's best work. Sebastian {{had a hand in}} composing the entire album, and he doesn't just re-write classic soul songs. He's obviously immersed himself in the genre and can truly add to it." ...|$|E
