5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company, and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in holding back the North Koreans.|$|E
25|$|The grand-ducal {{government}} of the Seekreis was dissolved, and Hecker gradually gained reinforcements. But friendly advisers also joined him, pointing out the risks of his undertaking. Hecker, however, {{was not at all}} ready <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> On the contrary, he added to violence an absurd defiance, and offered an amnesty to the German princes on condition of their retiring within fourteen days into private life. The troops of Baden and Hesse marched against him, under the command of General Friedrich von Gagern, and on April 20 they met near Kandern, where, although Gagern was killed, Hecker was completely defeated.|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu {{was careful}} and {{cautious}} in his behaviour. Whenever policy changes were announced, if {{he played a}} role in lobbying for those changes, he would keep quiet about his involvement. Xun Liang (荀良), one of his younger relatives, advised him to let others know the good deeds he did so that he would gain greater respect. Wu Tong (武統), his son-in-law, also urged him to attract people to support him. However, Xun Xu refused <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and he warned his sons against forming their own political clouts and forgetting their place as subjects of the emperor. Later, Emperor Wu promoted Xun Xu to be the Prefect of the Masters of Writing (尚書令).|$|E

50|$|In 2006, at an {{interview}} with the Moroccan weekly TelQuel, the supposed Khat al-Shahid leader, Mahjoub Salek, declared that negotiations were the only way to resolve the conflict, and that all it needs was a signal from King Mohamed VI. He further called on the Moroccan king Mohamed VI to open the doors of his palace <b>to</b> Sahrawis and <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>to</b> end the conflict.|$|R
25|$|The rebels {{realized}} {{that the people in}} Mecca supported the defense offered by Uthman and were not in the mood <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> That was a great psychological victory for Uthman. It is said, according to Sunni Muslim accounts, that before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman’s cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (referring to Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} few years TWiT episodes were made {{available}} in a variety of file formats for individual download or RSS subscription. These included a standard 64kbit/s MP3, a low-bandwidth 16kbit/s MP3, Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), and open source Ogg Vorbis. However, the Ogg Vorbis version of the show ceased to be offered in August 2009 with the AAC and low bandwidth MP3 versions ending in early November 2009. In response, Leo Laporte stated that he was a believer that his content should be made available to the widest audience possible in the format of their choice, as well as philosophically agreeing with the open source nature of Ogg Vorbis. However the time and effort the TWiT Staff needed to encode, upload, and distribute alternate audio formats in the limited time between recording and release each Sunday evening was not justified by the number of people choosing <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fire burns out and all {{the cats}} help get the camp set up again. Three days before the Gathering, Ashfur asks Firestar if he can go. Hollyleaf, Lionblaze, Jayfeather, and Squirrelflight are worried {{that he is going}} to {{publicly}} announce their secret. Between then and the day of the Gathering, the three warn Ashfur that he will regret it if he reveals the secret. Although he is frightened, he refuses <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Right before the Gathering, the patrol of warriors going notices that both Ashfur and Squirrelflight are missing. On the way to the Gathering, they see Ashfur's body lying in the WindClan stream as if he had drowned. They take him back to camp and set him for vigil. Leafpool notices a slit in his neck, suggesting he was murdered. After the Gathering, Firestar announces that Ashfur's death was unknown and suspects a cat from ThunderClan may have killed him, and the three see Squirrelflight looking scared and holding her breath. The three vow to keep the recent events involving them, Squirrelflight, and Ashfur a secret.|$|E
6000|$|Three or four {{farmers from}} [...] "out Greenvale way" [...] were {{drawn up by}} the stove, {{discussing}} the cheese factory sales and various Greenvale happenings.

25|$|Heirens {{grew up in}} Lincolnwood, {{a suburb}} of Chicago. His family was poor and his parents argued incessantly, leading Heirens to wander the streets <b>to</b> avoid <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> He took <b>to</b> crime and later claimed that he mostly stole for fun and to release tension. He never sold {{anything}} he had stolen.|$|R

500|$|In the Boxing Day {{match against}} Everton, Baroš was {{involved}} thoroughly in the proceedings. He opened the scoring in the 35th minute, having handled the ball immediately beforehand. This was not punished and the referee awarded a goal. Baroš subsequently celebrated {{in front of}} the travelling Everton fans, making a gesture as if <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> A number of missiles from the crowd were subsequently thrown in Baroš' direction. The goal was just his third in what Glenn Moore of The Independent described as [...] "an indifferent season" [...] for Baroš. He went on to score his second goal of the game, and Villa's fourth, earning him man of the match honours. Baroš scored twice in January 2006's fourth round FA Cup win against Port Vale, and added another in the following round's 1–1 draw with Manchester City. Late in the season, he scored two goals in the Second City derby against Birmingham City at Villa Park, marking his 11th and 12th goals of the season and winning another man of the match award. He would score no further goals that season.|$|E
500|$|In {{the post-war}} period Poulenc crossed swords with composers {{of the younger}} {{generation}} who rejected Stravinsky's recent work and insisted that only the precepts of the Second Viennese School were valid. Poulenc defended Stravinsky and expressed incredulity that [...] "in 1945 we are speaking as if the aesthetic of twelve tones is the only possible salvation for contemporary music". His view that Berg had taken serialism as far as it could go and that Schoenberg's music was now [...] "desert, stone soup, ersatz music, or poetic vitamins" [...] earned him the enmity of composers such as Pierre Boulez. Those disagreeing with Poulenc attempted to paint him as a relic of the pre-war era, frivolous and unprogressive. This led him to focus on his more serious works, and to try to persuade the French public <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> In the US and Britain, with their strong choral traditions, his religious music was frequently performed, but performances in France were much rarer, so that the public and the critics were often unaware of his serious compositions.|$|E
2500|$|The storyline {{concerns}} extraterrestrials who {{are seeking}} to stop humanity from creating a doomsday weapon that could destroy the universe. The aliens implement [...] "Plan 9", a scheme to resurrect the Earth's dead, referred to as [...] "ghouls". By causing chaos, the aliens hope the crisis will force humanity <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> If not, the aliens will then destroy mankind with armies of the undead.|$|E
60|$|The girl, however, {{said nothing}} for a while. She was not impulsive, and her face {{remained}} almost as cold in its clear whiteness as the panelling behind it, but her heart beat a little faster than usual, and she was trying somewhat unsuccessfully to analyze her sensations. In the meanwhile {{the voices of the}} men who now surrounded the one with the paper reached her, and she noticed vacantly that her father seemed <b>to</b> be <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Although threatened, Scottish {{police did}} not {{interrupt}} the show. Activist group, Mothers Against Guns, {{released a statement}} stating Madonna [...] "should know better". They further stated {{the use of the}} props are in bad taste, even more so after the Colorado shootings. The singer's camp responded saying, [...] "Madonna would rather cancel her show than censor her art. Her entire career, she has fought against people telling her what she can and cannot do. She’s not about <b>to</b> start <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> now".|$|R
50|$|When {{there was}} {{fighting}} {{at the front}} Fr. Mayer would be found himself crawling along the ground from one soldier to the next talking <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and administering the Sacraments <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> When he was warned that he was putting his own life in danger through such activities, he replied simply, My life is in God's hands. In December 1915 Fr. Mayer was the first chaplain to win the Iron Cross for bravery in recognition of his work with the soldiers at the front. In December 1916, he lost his left leg after it was injured in a grenade attack. He returned to Munich to convalesce and {{was referred to as}} the Limping Priest.|$|R
2500|$|The term ἐκκλησία {{appears in}} only two verses of the Gospels, in both cases in the Gospel of Matthew. When Jesus says to Simon Peter, [...] "You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church", the church is the {{community}} instituted by Christ, but in the other passage the church is the local community to which one belongs: [...] "If he refuses <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> tell it to the church." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Total Information Awareness program, of the Information Awareness Office, {{was formed}} in 2002 by the Pentagon and led by former rear admiral John Poindexter. The program {{designed}} numerous technologies {{to be used to}} perform mass surveillance. Examples include advanced speech-to-text programs (so that phone conversations can be monitored en-masse by a computer, instead of requiring human operators <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them),</b> social network analysis software to monitor groups of people and their interactions with each other, and [...] "Human identification at a distance" [...] software which allows computers to identify people on surveillance cameras by their facial features and gait (the way they walk). The program was later renamed [...] "Terrorism Information Awareness", after a negative public reaction.|$|E
2500|$|The jazz {{pianist and}} {{educator}} Kenny Barron commented, [...] "I have every record [...] ever made—and I try never <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> ... If I did, I'd throw up {{my hands and}} give up!" [...] Jean Cocteau dubbed Tatum [...] "a crazed Chopin". Count Basie called him the eighth wonder of the world. [...] Dave Brubeck observed, [...] "I don't think there's any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart." [...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I {{talk to the people}} I admire, they're always talking about continuous growth and development and I look at them and say, 'Well... what are YOU going to do?' But, as Harold Mabern says, 'There's always Art Tatum records around'". Dizzy Gillespie said, [...] "First you speak of Art Tatum, then take a long deep breath, and you speak of the other pianists." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Beckett's play {{is a sort}} of quartet, a {{dialogue}} between a man, 'he', and a woman, 'she', interspersed by 'Music' and 'Voice'. 'Music' and 'Voice' are, we are led to believe, going on all the time; 'he' has two buttons, which allow him <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> in <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Within the Beckett canon Rough for Radio I is usually thought of as a preliminary exploration of the possibilities of radio, which would be explored more fully in Cascando and Words and Music.” Barry McGovern confirms that Beckett requested that “the first Rough for Radio was not for production, the author feeling that Cascando had overtaken it, so to speak.” ...|$|R
50|$|Consequently, {{he needed}} a younger, fitter, {{assistant}} to run training sessions, and chose the flamboyant and dynamic Malcolm Allison, who had recently departed Plymouth Argyle after a spell as manager. Allison had other job offers from Stanley Matthews at Port Vale, Raich Carter at Middlesbrough and Joe Mercer at City which he took after admitting he had always claimed a love <b>to</b> City after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> on the radio during the 1933 FA Cup Final.|$|R

2500|$|Eventually, auditions were held, and {{he chose}} Tomiko Van as lead singer and Ryo Owatari as guitarist. Ryo turned {{up for the}} auditions in a red {{tracksuit}} with a Fender Jaguar and his effects pedals. He was asked to perform a small segment, but instead played three songs. Tomiko sang [...] "Heart" [...] as a band member 42 hours after the Avex staff read her application. On September 29, 1999, the trio released their first single [...] "Tangerine Dream", and held a live concert at the Shibuya AX. They performed almost daily {{at a number of}} locations, ranging from Shibuya's 109 (which is famous for street performers), to Yokohama Station and traveled to Fukuoka and other cities. Before [...] "Tangerine Dream" [...] was released, DAI and their fellow workers were giving out copies of their recordings for free to passers by.

40|$|Behavioural and {{learning}} difficulties experienced by students from minoritised cultural groups often arise because their cultural beliefs, values and preferred practices differ markedly {{from those of}} their teachers and their school. Research in New Zealand has shown that if inclusive education is to have real meaning for these students and their families, then their teachers and schools need to move towards pedagogies founded on relationships that are more inclusive of cultural differences. This paper discusses what we can understand about inclusion for Māori students experiencing behavioural {{and learning}} difficulties, from the experiences of their teachers and family members. Often effective interventions {{are found to be}} connected to a Māori worldview and begin by taking the time to develop relationships with Māori families, <b>to</b> regularly <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> and seek <b>to</b> work and learn alongside them...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, Owen Roe {{has emerged as}} one of Irelandâs very best actors â yet, until now, heâs rarely filled a major leading role. His {{performance}} as the Irishman in Ben Barnesâs 2001 Gigli Concert was astonishing precisely because it was so well matched by Mark Lambert in the role of JPW King. Likewise, his work as Petruchio in the 2006 Rough Magic Taming of the Shrew was memorable because it was so thoroughly complemented by Pauline McLynneâs Katherina. Roe, in other words, is the kind of actor one could build a company around: he excels when he works with others â mirroring <b>them,</b> reacting <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Some actors are so great that they can make others seem mediocre by comparison. Roe is great because he allows everyone around him to seem excellent...|$|R

50|$|The Bloder brothers, Kip (Fallon) and Wayne (Chris Parnell), make obnoxious jokes, {{no matter}} what situation, and {{laughing}} incessantly at themselves. Their laughter is characteristically low-key and sounds extremely forced. They usually go back and forth, taking turns making jokes, which are generally little more than puns or comic references based on whatever situation they are in, much {{to the chagrin of}} whoever happens <b>to</b> be <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> They often try to pick up women, but they appear to be uncomfortable and their constant joking usually gets in the way. The more uneasy they appear to be, the more they joke and laugh. When thoroughly defeated, they occasionally go back and forth between crying and laughing (apparently at nothing). In one sketch, their father, Kurt Bloder (played by Jon Stewart), appears and exhibits behavior just like the two.|$|R
