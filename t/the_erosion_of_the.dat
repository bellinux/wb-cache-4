5|$|The Table Rocks {{offer an}} example of {{inverted}} relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding region.

5|$|CR26 has {{continued}} to deteriorate in the years since, with one , limited maintenance segment seeing the most wear. This section, situated midway between NY30 and NY3, has become both littered with potholes and extremely narrow due to <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway's shoulders. In mid-2009, residents of Loon Lake petitioned the county to repair all of CR26 and to continuously maintain the highway, citing the road's regional importance as a through route for commuters traveling {{to and from the}} village of Malone.|$|E

Under this agreement the trust would manage the site, English Heritage would maintain the historic fabric of the castle, while the council would construct a new visitors' centre. A new, controversial visitor's centre {{was built in the}} style of a collection of jousting tents, while the floors and roof of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with European Union funding, in an attempt to limit <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle stonework.|$|E

The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes {{of a variety of}} deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw. The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Copán River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.|$|E
5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist {{of a series of}} sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>erosion</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface {{coatings}} <b>of</b> reed switches considering different physicochemical processes occurring on the contact surfaces {{and inside the}} inter-electrode gap was proposed.

25|$|A major {{causative factor}} (60% of gastric {{and up to}} 50–75% of {{duodenal}} ulcers) is chronic inflammation due to Helicobacter pylori that colonizes the antral mucosa. The immune system is unable to clear the infection, despite the appearance of antibodies. Thus, the bacterium can cause a chronic active gastritis (type B gastritis). Gastrin stimulates the production of gastric acid by parietal cells. In H. pylori colonization responses to increased gastrin, the increase in acid can contribute to <b>the</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mucosa and therefore ulcer formation.|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} of the ridge consists of andesite rocks of the Birker Fell Andesite Formation. These rocks are a succession of sheets of andesite lava flows which came from shallow-sided volcanoes.

Around the summit of Common Fell it shows areas of hyaloclastite, a rock made up of shattered angular fragments and formed by the quenching of lava in water.
