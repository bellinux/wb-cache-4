5|$|The party {{arrived at}} the vicarage to be greeted by Mrs Blackburne. (Mrs Blackburne had {{originally}} intended to travel on the inaugural journey with her husband, but the previous day had felt a presentiment {{that something was wrong}} at home and her presence was required, and had returned alone by boat. She had then heard a rumour that a mob from Oldham were planning to storm the track at Eccles to attack the Duke of Wellington, and decided to remain in the vicarage.) Huskisson was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> and given laudanum and brandy. At about 2.00pm Hunter and Brandreth cut Huskisson's clothing away from his damaged leg to give it a proper examination. Unfamiliar with industrial injuries, they were baffled {{by the nature of the}} damage to Huskisson's leg, but concluded that despite the apparent severity of his injuries the wounds were treatable.|$|E

5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared <b>the</b> video <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and sunglasses in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped <b>sofa.</b> Parker compared <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> in <b>the</b> video <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> used in <b>the</b> American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|R
30|$|New {{definitions}} for sepsis and {{septic shock}} {{were published in}} 2016 [20], recommending to define sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction, captured by the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and defining septic shock {{as the need for}} vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial blood pressure of ≥ 65  mmHg and serum lactate level > 2  mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia. Therefore, we retrospectively collected <b>the</b> respective information <b>to</b> calculate <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> score and <b>to</b> identify septic shock accordingly.|$|R

30|$|Methods: RCTs {{in adult}} {{intensive}} care patients reporting both SOFA and mortality endpoints were identified using a PubMed and Embase query. Reported SOFA abstractions {{were classified as}} early, late and delta according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> definition used <b>to</b> compute <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> endpoint (Table  87). Treatment effects on SOFA were calculated as <b>the</b> between-group <b>SOFA</b> standardized difference. Treatment effects on mortality were calculated as log odds ratio (OR) of treatment vs. control group mortality. We used random-effects meta-regression to: (i) quantify the linear relationship between RCT treatment effects on mortality (logOR) and SOFA; (ii) quantify residual heterogeneity (expressed as I 2 and tau). The review protocol was prospectively registered (CRD 42016034014).|$|R

40|$|Component systems {{allow to}} build large scale {{applications}} from reusable components. However, {{many of the}} contemporary component systems have an extensive component development cycle with a long turnaround time. <b>To</b> speed up <b>the</b> component development, the dynamic languages, which allow <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> implementation at runtime without compilation and restarting, could be used. Therefore, the support of components implemented in dynamic languages could simplify development of application prototypes and add other advantages of interpreted dynamic languages (dynamic typing etc.). The aim of this thesis is <b>to</b> extend <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> 2 component system runtime to support primitive components implemented in dynamic languages. The extension is based on <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> 2 component aspect mechanism and it focuses on minimal changes of the existing core runtime implementation. The presented implementation also provides tools for interaction with running scripted components {{in order to allow}} dynamic implementation changes. On the basis of this extension, the thesis evaluates potential of <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> 2 microcomponent-based controller part for building runtime extensions, particularly extensions integrating new runtime technologies such as dynamic languages...|$|R

500|$|The issue became central <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{demand by}} many Okinawans and other Japanese {{citizens}} for the significant reduction and eventual elimination of U.S. military forces stationed in Okinawa. [...] In {{the opinion of}} many Japanese citizens living in Okinawa, the U.S. used <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> <b>to</b> shield U.S. servicemembers who committed crimes against Japanese citizens from the Japanese criminal justice system. [...] The September 4, 1995, widely reported rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen caused the U.S. and Japan <b>to</b> revise <b>the</b> <b>SOFA,</b> stating that in the future, the U.S. would give [...] "sympathetic consideration" [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hand-over of U.S. servicemembers accused of violent crimes such as rape or murder to Japanese authorities before indictment. [...] To many in Okinawa, the incident involving Brown appeared to fall under this new provision in <b>the</b> <b>SOFA.</b> [...] After <b>the</b> initial allegations involving Brown were publicized and before charges had even been filed, Okinawa Governor Keiichi Inamine publicly stated, [...] "This is a heinous crime trampling on female human rights. Moreover, this is a crime committed by a marine corps major, a person who {{should be in a}} leadership position." ...|$|R

40|$|Experiences of {{participatory}} {{design with}} full-scale modelling in three case studies {{form the basis}} of this work. When the participants in these studies visualised their dwellings there was a strong focus on <b>the</b> <b>sofa.</b> This piece of furniture {{is one of the most}} common in Swedish homes. It also requires much space. Additionally, the lay-people focused on different kinds of functional needs while sitting in <b>the</b> <b>sofa,</b> such as <b>the</b> possibility <b>to</b> watch <b>the</b> children play, <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> television-screen, and <b>to</b> have a good view of the outdoor environment. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> is <b>the</b> bearer of important aesthetic values and for some people even sentimental value. These findings raised the question what could be learned about different people’s relationship <b>to</b> their homes. <b>The</b> intention has been to improve professional practice of today concerning house design. In seven narratives individual “home-builders” describe the processes of developing their homes and especially the role of their sofas. Each story is reflected, using scientific theories and/or comparative studies. The approach is phenomenological. The influence of <b>the</b> childhood <b>sofa</b> when arranging <b>the</b> home for the adult person is analysed from a psychoanalytical point of view. Another topic for discussion is what the effects are when <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> is considered both as a stage and a place for the audience. This affects the arrangements of every single space and practical living function. Being surrounded by old and dear objects, including sofas that require a special environment and treatment, gives rise to a discussion concerning which considerations that should be made in order to make room for aspects of sentimental value. During a lifetime people also experience different cultures and environments that have an impact on their priorities and way of living. Therefore life-styles and ways of life are dealt with in one chapter. People are not always, however, attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sofas</b> they already possess. The process of moving to a new dwelling with new wallpaper and floor surfaces also raises <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> replace pieces of furniture such as <b>sofas.</b> <b>The</b> theme of replacement can thus be compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> theme of having a career. But <b>the</b> <b>sofa</b> also has a career of its own. Very rarely used in the living-rooms less than fifty years ago it today seems <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> place where contemporary everyday life, including all kinds of activities, goes on. Finally, gender aspects could have been integrated in every single story. As a topic for discussion gender considerations are focused on in order to understand how requirements on house design change with a shift in sex roles. The aim of <b>the</b> thesis is <b>to</b> offer professional designers, i. e. architects, further means to reflect on what the demands and expectations are for contemporary Swedish house design...|$|R

30|$|As we {{previously}} reported, {{and perhaps}} unexpectedly, {{the presence of}} co-morbidities, the time from presumed onset of symptoms <b>to</b> surgery, <b>the</b> underlying cause of FP {{and the degree of}} organ support needed in critical care did not appear to influence survival significantly in these postoperative critically ill patients [24, 25]. We are not aware of any prognostic tool designed <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> risk of long-term mortality specifically in the critically ill postsurgical FP patient. The risk prediction models described in our study aim <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> <b>SOFA</b> score’s predictive power for mortality at 6  months and 28  days, by adding just a few key variables: age, lowest recorded temperature, highest recorded heart rate and haematocrit on admission to intensive care.|$|R

40|$|Purpose We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score {{can be used to}} predict mortality of patients without suspected infection. Materials and methods Using prospectively collected data within the first hour of intensive care unit admission, the predictive ability of qSOFA was compared with the Simplified Acute Physiology Score III, Admission Mortality Prediction Model III, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II model, and standard (full-version) SOFA score using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and Brier score. Results Of the 2322 patients included, 279 (12. 0 %) died after intensive care unit admission. The qSOFA score had a modest ability to predict mortality of all critically ill patients (AUROC, 0. 672; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 638 - 0. 707; Brier score 0. 099) including the noninfected patients (AUROC, 0. 685; 95 % CI, 0. 637 - 0. 732; Brier score 0. 081). The overall predictive ability and calibration of the qSOFA was comparable to other prognostic scores. Combining qSOFA score with lactate concentrations further enhanced its predictive ability (AUROC, 0. 730; 95 % CI, 0. 694 - 0. 765; Brier score 0. 097), comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard <b>SOFA</b> score. Conclusions <b>The</b> qSOFA score had a modest ability to predict mortality of both septic and nonseptic patients; combining qSOFA with plasma lactate had a predictive ability comparable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard <b>SOFA</b> score...|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} profitability {{between the}} farmers participating in Sangthong Organic Farmers Association (<b>SOFA)</b> and <b>the</b> inorganic farmers in Sangthong District, Vientiane Capital, Laos, and estimated the factors influencing farmers <b>to</b> participate in <b>the</b> <b>SOFA.</b> <b>The</b> data collection {{was conducted with}} random sampling procedure to 110 organic farmers and 110 inorganic farmers in 10 target villages. Comparative analysis on revenue structure was conducted, to investigate whether organic farmers could gain more profit from rice production than inorganic farmers. Binary logistic regression model was employed <b>to</b> identify <b>the</b> factors influencing farmers’ participation in <b>the</b> <b>SOFA.</b> <b>The</b> results of revenue structure comparison showed that as hypothesized, the organic farmers can get higher profit from their rice than the inorganic farmers. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that six factors influencing farmers’ participation in <b>the</b> <b>SOFA,</b> including their age, farming experiences, family labors, farming activities, education and profit margin. This study implied <b>the</b> government <b>to</b> promote local organic aroma rice to more private export companies; the local authority can encourage local farmers to participate in organic group, by providing more information and simplifying some processes; the private companies should maintain reasonable price to sustain profits for organic members...|$|R
30|$|No {{published}} data {{enabled us}} to calculate a number of subject to be recruited, since the predictive values of SSEP and BAEP’s components IPL in deeply sedated critically ill patients have never been previously assessed. The present study was a pilot study {{for the design of}} a prospective multicenter study on the prognostic value of SSEP and BAEP in the ICU (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT 02395861). We estimated that 80 – 100 included patients would be sufficient to test predictors of in-ICU mortality (primary objective). Data are reported as numbers (percentage), mean (standard deviation), or median (inter-quartile range). Groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations between impaired conduction times and in-ICU mortality adjusted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> global <b>SOFA</b> score and <b>the</b> non-neurological <b>SOFA</b> score. p values < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.|$|R
