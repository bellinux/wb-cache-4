40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{bleaching}} of alpaca tops and dyeing of bleached alpaca tops/yarns {{on the quality of}} <b>tops</b> <b>and</b> <b>yarns.</b> A dark brown alpaca top was bleached with hydrogen peroxide. Two bleaching methods were tried for effectiveness of color removal. A portion of each bleached top was dyed after bleaching. Color parameters were examined for unbleached, bleached and bleached/dyed tops, these tops were then converted into yarns of different twist levels and counts using a worsted spinning system. Some of the bleached yarn from each bleaching method was dyed in a package dye vat to compare the difference of top dyeing versus yarn package dyeing on yarn quality. Fiber diameter, yarn strength, yarn evenness, yarn hairiness and fiber degradation were tested to examine {{the effects of}} bleaching and dyeing on these properties at top and yarn stages. A processing route for bleaching and dyeing alpaca fiber was recommended. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The skin {{friction}} coefficient {{on the surface}} of a rotating yarn package affects the power required to drive the package. This paper examines the relationship between the {{skin friction}} coefficient on the package surface and its diameter and rotating speed, based on the fundamentals of aerodynamics and the experimental results of power consumption. Skin friction coefficients on the surfaces of an airplane, car <b>top,</b> <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> package are discussed. The results indicate that the skin friction coefficient on the package surface without hairiness depends on the package diameter and spindle speed only. The skin friction coefficient on the yarn package surface is about three times that on the top surface of a car, and is about twenty times that on an airplane surface. The power consumed to overcome skin friction drag is more than that consumed to drive the spindle if the spindle speed is very slow. However, the situation reverses when the spindle speed is fast...|$|R

On the basis of sensitivity analysis, the factors that affected yarn hairiness significantly included yarn twist, ring size, average fiber length (hauteur), fiber diameter <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> count, with twist having the greatest impact on yarn hairiness. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the processing requirements of both cash-mere and superfine Merino wool is often kept confidential and little research on cashmere processing has been pub-lished. Given the lack of technical information on the dehairing, worsted processing, and quality of cashmere tex-tiles, a series of experiments have been completed [1]. This work has shown that Australian cashmere has greater length after carding than cashmere from other origins [2, 3], sug-gesting that Australian cashmere should perform at a satis-factory level during <b>top</b> making <b>and</b> produce <b>yarns</b> of at least equivalent quality to cashmere from Iran and Mongolia. The trends in textiles, and in particular for textiles com-posed of animal fibers, are for finer fabrics that are suitable for trans-seasonal wear [4, 5].

40|$|Alpaca fibre has low crimp {{and smooth}} fibre surface. This makes the fibre {{difficult}} to process, particularly in sliver/fibre transferring and delivering processes. Blending with wool enhances the alpaca fibre processibility, makes the fibre more easily processed on modern wool processing facilities, {{and allows the}} development of new products. To evaluate the effect of wool fibre properties, especially wool crimp, on alpaca/wool blends, two alpaca fibre lots were processed to tops then blended with three commercial wool tops via <b>top</b> gillings. <b>Yarns</b> <b>and</b> knitted fabrics were subsequently engineered with identical machine settings. The performance of alpaca/wool blend slivers, <b>yarns</b> <b>and</b> fabrics has been investigated in this paper. Blending alpaca fibre with wool improves the cohesion properties of the blend slivers, especially with high-crimp wools. Wool fibre crimp does not affect the evenness of blend yarns, but may affect the <b>yarn</b> hairiness value <b>and</b> tensile properties. The alpaca/wool fabrics exhibit satisfactory pilling performance. Thei...|$|R

40|$|Double-stack disk {{friction}} {{units were}} used to produce good, high-crimp <b>yarn</b> like wool <b>and</b> the results were compared to conventional triple-stack disk friction units. The quality of false-twist textured yarn from disk friction spindles is very strongly influenced by unit operating conditions and untwisting tension. The authors previously proposed a method to derive tension and untwisting tension in the yarn given the twisting tension <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> path in double-stack disk friction units. In this study {{our goal was to}} calculate both <b>yarn</b> path <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> tension.

In addition, we succeeded in using our model to predict conditions for guide hole to produce false-twist yarn. The validity of our model was proven by the results.

40|$|The {{influence}} of fibre, <b>yarn,</b> <b>and</b> fabric properties on the bagging behaviour of woven fabrics is studied by developing rheological models and comparing {{them with the}} results of statistical analysis on experimental measurements. Three rheological models are developed to describe the bagging-deformation features at different stages of bagging processes, from which three types of deformation energy are identified: elastic and viscoelastic energies of the fibres, and the frictional-deformation energy resulting from the frictional slippage between fibres <b>and</b> <b>yarns.</b> To evaluate the theoretical analysis, 24 fabrics were tested to determine their bagging behaviour, the mechanical properties of constituent fibres <b>and</b> <b>yarns,</b> <b>and</b> fabric structural features. Statistical regression analysis is applied to derive the parameters describing bagging fatigue and their relationships with the fibre <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> mechanical properties <b>and</b> fabric structural features. A comparison of the experimental results with the theoretical analysis indicates that a decrease in the work of loading with repeated bagging deformation resulted from two basic causes: the stress relaxation of the fibres due to the fibres' viscoelastic behaviour and the friction between fibres <b>and</b> between <b>yarns</b> due to frictional restraints inherent in the fabric structures. The three parameters (Q o, U σ) describing the fabric-fatigue process are shown to be dependent on fibre <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> mechanical properties <b>and</b> fabric structural parameters, such as fabric thickness, weight, cover factor, and interlacing points. Using the regression equations for the three parameters (Q o, U σ), we show that the bagging-fatigue behaviour and fabric-residual-bagging height are predictable from the fundamental fibre <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> mechanical properties <b>and</b> fabric structural parameters, indicating that a subjective perception of fabric-bagging is also predictable from the parameters.

30|$|Incorporation of coarser {{polyester}} fibres in {{the inner}} layers of plated fabrics resulted in improved thermal resistance for both carded (RC 1.1 –RC 3.3) <b>and</b> combed <b>yarn</b> fabrics (RM 1.1 –RM 3.3) (Fig.  2). This {{may be attributed to}} the increase in fabric thickness and porosity (Table  4) with the increase in fibre linear density. High coefficient of determination (0.90) and (0.96) for carded <b>and</b> combed <b>yarn</b> fabrics respectively suggested positive linear relationship between fibre linear density and thermal resistance. The findings indicate that fibre <b>and</b> <b>yarn</b> combination that would result in high thermal resistance of plated fabrics are polyester fibre of high linear density <b>and</b> carded ring <b>yarns</b> compared to combination of polyester fibre of lower linear density <b>and</b> combed <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
