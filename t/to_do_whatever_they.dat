25|$|Scorsese {{initially}} {{named the}} film Wise Guy and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi {{changed the name}} to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, {{and put them into}} a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.|$|E

Finally, they found relative safety in Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp. In 2001, 3,600 lost boys, including John, Daniel and Panther, were invited by the United States to live in America. Assisted by Catholic Charities International, the three boys uproot their lives and once again embark on a journey, leaving behind thousands of other refugees who, {{in the course of}} their traumatic odyssey, have become their adopted extended family. They must now learn to adapt to the shock of being thrust into the economically intense culture of the United States. <b>They</b> dedicate themselves <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> can <b>to</b> help those they left behind in Kakuma, and to discovering the fate of their parents and family.|$|R
50|$|Rhythm 0 (1974) was {{a six-hour}} work of {{performance}} art by Yugoslav artist Marina Abramović in Studio Morra, Naples. The work involved Abramović standing still while {{the audience was}} invited <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> her <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wished, using one of 72 objects she had placed on a table. These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, and a gun loaded with one bullet.|$|R

Bart discovers that the family's backyard contains a blind spot {{that none of}} the cameras can see, and he and Homer soon begin charging people <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> want there. When Ned scolds Homer for allowing so many immoral activities to go on, Homer retorts that the situation is Ned's fault as he has abused his power and literally played God over the town. Ned apologizes to the town for his interference, and he and Homer proceed to destroy all the cameras. The final scene reveals that Bakerbutcher has been using the footage to put together a British reality television series called The American Oafs, which Queen Elizabeth II enjoys watching because Ralph Wiggum reminds her of her son, Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C", largely criticizing the {{installment}} for its apparent randomness. He argued that [...] "being {{in a dream}} allows the writers <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> want without any explanation, meaning characters and environments change suddenly and constantly, leaving the viewer as confused as Finn." [...] Sava felt that the only scenes with any pathos were to be found {{near the end of}} the episode, but even they were [...] "still more focused on bizarre imagery than emotional depth", such as the sequence wherein Finn's fears manifest themselves by emerging from his navel. Sava did compliment the episode's designs, however, writing that [...] "this episode puts the show’s off-kilter design sense on full display." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{became evident}} {{by the third}} day of {{production}} that the episode was going to run significantly short, partly caused by the time-efficient filming style. The scene in which Daniel informs Jack and Teal'c of the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> like, was a late pitch by Brad Wright, who had also had the idea for some time to show someone golfing through the Stargate. Preliminary discussions about computer-generating the golf ball to not break the US$100,000 Stargate prop were later overturned, and the actors used a real golf ball. Many of the other humorous scenes in [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] were improvised on set during filming. With juggling being one of Richard Dean Anderson's earlier careers, director Peter DeLuise filmed the juggling sequence in a last effort to fill the episode's time slot. [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] has no deleted scenes.|$|E

50|$|Jekyll and Hyde {{tells the}} story of a doctor, Jekyll, who, trying to find the basis of good and evil, {{develops}} an evil alter ego, Hyde. The song is sung by the two female leads, Lucy and Emma. Emma, Jekyll’s fiance, is a refined young woman who is reluctant to support her husband’s experiments fearing that he is becoming too involved in the process. Lucy is a prostitute at a gentlemen's club who becomes infatuated with the Hyde persona, eventually resulting in her death. While the two characters are very different, they both love the same man, albeit different personas within the same physicality. In this song, they lament about their separate desires for Jekyll/Hyde to see how much they love him and how their lives have been altered by the man and his experiments. Both women dream about their futures, with or without Jekyll/Hyde. They both, separately, come to the realization that their love for him is much too strong to ever truly break away. In mutual agreement, they recognize that when they look into the eyes of the man they love, they are filled with everything they need to continue on. The song ends with them fully believing that the love they have for Jekyll/Hyde enriches their lives and are committed <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> can for him.|$|R
500|$|At the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, the European powers {{allocated}} the Congo Basin {{region to}} a private charitable organisation run by Leopold II, who had long held ambitions for colonial expansion. The territory under Leopold's control exceeded [...] and, amid financial problems, was ruled by a tiny cadre of white administrators drawn from across Europe. Initially, the colony proved unprofitable and insufficient, with the state always close to bankruptcy. The boom in demand for natural rubber, which was abundant in the territory, created a radical shift in the 1890s—to facilitate the extraction and export of rubber, all [...] "uninhabited" [...] land in the Congo was nationalised, with the majority distributed to private companies as concessions. Some was kept by the state. Between 1891 and 1906, the companies were allowed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wished with almost no judicial interference, the result being that forced labour and violent coercion were used to collect the rubber cheaply and maximise profit. A native paramilitary army, the Force Publique, was also created to enforce the labour policies. Individual workers who refused to participate in rubber collection could be killed and entire villages razed. Individual white administrators were also free to indulge their own sadism.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's first {{performance}} of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was on The MDNA Tour (2012) as the concert's opening track. The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk, along with dancer Derrell Bullock, who assisted as supervisor. According to Faulk, Madonna asked Bullock {{to experiment with}} the concept of [...] "girl gone wild", {{and come up with a}} routine and style of his own. He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day. The singer also wanted to experiment {{with the concept of}} Catholic church, along with monks and gargoyles. Her message behind it was that of freedom, [...] "people getting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wanted to". Four dancers from Brooklyn, adept at bone breaking dance, were enlisted as backup crew for the performance. Young recalled that they could [...] "create these abstract, very animalistic shapes. What they can do with their arms is unbelievable. Anything that most people can do in front of their bodies, they do it behind their bodies." [...] The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video. Most of them refused to abide by it, resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show. The dancers complied and learned the choreography.|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, {{because he thought it}} inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E

Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm.

A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.|$|R

500|$|Hack (1982) was {{developed}} by Jay Fenlason with help from Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jonathan Payne, students at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School at the time, while participating in the school's computer lab overseen by Brian Harvey. Harvey {{had been able to}} acquire a PDP-11/7 minicomputer for the school and instituted a course curriculum that allowed students <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wanted on the computers, including playing games, as long as they had completed assignments by the end of each semester. Fenlason, Woodland, Thome, and Payne met through these courses and became a close-group of friends and competent programmers. Harvey had invited the group to the computer labs at UC Berkeley where they had the opportunity to use the mainframe systems there, and were introduced to Rogue, inspiring them to create their own version as their class project. Fenlason had created a list of features they wanted to improve upon in Rogue such as having a level's layout saved once the player moved off that level. [...] They approached Toy and Arnold at a local USENIX conference for the source code to Rogue, but were refused, forcing them to develop the routines from scratch. The resulting program, Hack, stayed true to the original Dungeons and Dragons influences, and derived its name from being both a [...] "hack and slash" [...] game as well as a programming hack to recreate Rogue without having access to its source code. Fenlason was not able to include all the desired features, and his involvement in Hacks development concluded after the students had left the school. Fenlason had provided the source code to Hack to the USENIX conferences to be distributed on their digital tapes, from which it was later discovered and built upon through USENET newsgroups, porting it to various systems. Like Angband, the maintainership of the Hack code passed through several hands, and some variants were created by different forks.|$|E
500|$|Dale Keown's {{comic book}} artwork of the Hulk was an {{inspiration}} for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had [...] "too much fat [...] the proportions were a little off". He explained, [...] "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank." [...] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as {{they did not want}} him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions. The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate. His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film. The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art. He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character. Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change. As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms. Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of [...] "an über-human" [...] like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle. The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark. The character also shares Roth's tattoos. A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character. Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across as stupid.|$|E

30|$|Quality {{management}} {{has been with}} us {{from the very beginning of}} human history. In the hunt and gathering economy, humans worked day and night to find enough food, shelter, and clothing to survive. They had very limited choices and often had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> could find. Thus, the level of quality management was almost non-existent. As people began to accumulate knowledge about better ways to secure the food they needed to survive, the agricultural economy was born. Humans began to plant crops and grow livestock for sustainability. Still, the demand exceeded supply for a comfortable living, and quality management was rudimental at best.|$|R

Murad, fearing a counterattack from Skanderbeg, sent a scouting patrol towards the surrounding mountains to watch for an attack. Skanderbeg still managed to lead, at dusk, a raid on the Turkish encampment, killing several hundred men, capturing and destroying Turkish supplies, and almost losing his own life. When Skanderbeg returned to his men, his [...] "shield was so battered that its shape was scarce to be discerned." [...] The raid cost Skanderbeg ten dead and even more wounded.
