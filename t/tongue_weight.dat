50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is <b>tongue</b> <b>weight,</b> the weight with which the trailer presses down on the tow vehicle's hitch. Insufficient <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> can cause the trailer to sway back and forth when towed. Too much <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> can cause problems with the tow vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Trailer {{stability}} can {{be defined}} as the tendency of a trailer to dissipate side-to-side motion. The initial motion may be caused by aerodynamic forces, such as from a cross wind or a passing vehicle. One common criterion for stability is the center of mass location with respect to the wheels, which can usually be detected by <b>tongue</b> <b>weight.</b> If the center of mass of the trailer is behind its wheels, therefore having a negative <b>tongue</b> <b>weight,</b> the trailer will likely be unstable. Another parameter which is less commonly a factor is the trailer moment of inertia. Even if the center of mass is forward of the wheels, a trailer with a long load, and thus large moment of inertia, may be unstable.|$|E
50|$|For {{cars and}} light trucks, towing is {{accomplished}} via a trailer hitch. In {{addition to the}} vehicle limits, the hitch assembly may have {{its own set of}} limits, including <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> (the amount of weight that presses downward on the hitch) and trailer weight (the full weight of the trailer, including contents). When the hitch is a factory option, the hitch capacity is usually stated in the vehicle documentation as a towing specification, and not otherwise marked on the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|In motor vehicles, {{the gross}} trailer weight rating (GTWR) {{is the total}} mass of a road trailer that is loaded to capacity, {{including}} {{the weight of the}} trailer itself, plus fluids, and cargo, that a vehicle is rated to tow by the manufacturer. In the United States and Canada, the static <b>tongue</b> load, the <b>weight</b> of the trailer as measured at the trailer coupling, is generally recommended to be 10-15% of the GTWR.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- A simple {{discrete}} recurrent {{neural network}} model is considered. The local stability is analyzed with the associated characteristic model. In order to study the quasi-periodic orbit dynamic behavior, {{it is necessary to}} determinate the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation. In the case of two neurons, one necessary condition that produces the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation is found. In addition to this, the stability and direction of the Neimark-Sacker are determined by applying the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem. An example is given and numerical simulation are performed to illustrate the obtained results. The phase-locking is analyzed given some experimental result of Arnold <b>Tongue</b> in determinate <b>weight</b> configuration...|$|R
50|$|Vitamin B12 {{deficiency}} {{can lead}} to anemia and neurologic dysfunction. A mild deficiency may not cause any discernible symptoms, but as the deficiency becomes more significant, symptoms of anemia may result, such as weakness, fatigue, light-headedness, rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing and pale color to the skin. It may also cause easy bruising or bleeding, including bleeding gums. GI side effects including sore <b>tongue,</b> stomach upset, <b>weight</b> loss, and diarrhea or constipation. If the deficiency is not corrected, nerve cell damage can result. If this happens, vitamin B12 deficiency may result in tingling or numbness to the fingers and toes, difficulty walking, mood changes, depression, memory loss, disorientation and, in severe cases, dementia.|$|R
5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the towing vehicle's rear axle to the towing vehicle's front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle. Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> without using a weight-distributing hitch. Tow vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|E
40|$|The gross anatomy, morphometric and histol-ogy of {{the tongue}} and {{dentition}} were studied in African hedgehogs and pangolins. In this study, eight hedgehogs and six pangolins were used. The average body weight and body length of hedgehogs and pangolins were 210. 00 ± 11. 03 g, 15. 80 ± 0. 09 cm and 1449. 42 ± 220. 15 g, 115. 75 ± 6. 75 cm, respectively. The average <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> and length of hedgehogs and pangolins were 1. 32 ± 0. 09 g, 3. 10 ± 0. 51 cm, and 19. 75 ± 0. 85 g, 66. 38 ± 11. 92 cm respec-tively, while the relative <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> (RTW) and relative tongue length (RTL) were 6. 27 %, 21. 62 % and 1. 10 %, 1. 92 % respectively.

40|$|Yield of {{saleable}} beef {{was predicted}} in 4 genotypes of bullocks (Hereford, Brahman, Brahman x Hereford and Simmental x Hereford). Simple and multiple regression equations {{were used to}} determine how well 4 fat thickness measurements (12 th rib and rump measurements SC 3 SC 5 and SC 7) individually, with or without the inclusion of hot side weight, foreshanks weight and short cut <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> predicted the yields of saleable beef. Each of the 4 fat thickness measurements (alone) predicted percentage yield of saleable beef with low r. s. d. 2 ̆ 7 s at the means. The regression coefficients for the 4 fat thickness measuring sites were negative and significant in the Hereford, Brahman and Brahman x Hereford groups. In the Simmental x Hereford cattle, the regression coefficients for the rump sites (SC 3, SC 5 and SC 7) were positive but significant only in SC 5 which had the lowest r. s. d. (1. 56...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the parameters of halitosis and sialometry in patients who had undergone head and neck radiotherapy, correlating oral concentration of volatile sulfur compounds (VSC) with the presence of tongue coating, salivary flow rate and BANA test. Material and Methods: 35 patients allocated in two groups were examined: group I (control) - patients with systemic and oral health; group II - patients submitted to head and neck radiotherapy. All volunteers were submitted to halitosis measurements through a sulphide monitor, evaluation of <b>tongue</b> coating <b>weight,</b> non-stimulated sialometry and BANA test. Results: The results were analyzed through analysis of variance, Pearson?s correlation and Student?s t-test, showing that there was statistically significant difference in halimetry between the groups, where the irradiated patients showed halitosis. There was a relation between the presence of tongue coating and the levels of VSCs in both groups and it was also noted that the irradiated patients showed a decreased salivary flow rate compared to healthy patients. Conclusion: On the conditions of the present research, it was concluded that halitosis can be considered an adverse effect of radiotherapy, connected to hiposalivation and poor oral health...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of orally {{administered}} viable Lactobacillus casei Shirota strain YIT 9029 on the immunity parameters of Wistar and Brown Norway rats were examined. For this purpose, we used the Trichinella spiralis host resistance model. Two weeks before and during T. spiralis infection, rats were fed 109 viable L. casei bacteria 5 days per week. The T. spiralis-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response was significantly enhanced in both Wistar and Brown Norway rats given L. casei. In both rat strains fed L. casei, serum T. spiralis-specific immunoglobulin G 2 b (IgG 2 b) concentrations were also significantly increased. In the model, no significant effects of L. casei on larval counts or inflammatory reactions in the <b>tongue</b> musculature, body <b>weights,</b> or lymphoid organ weights were observed. Serum specific antibody responses, other than IgG 2 b, were not changed by feeding of L. casei. In contrast to L. casei, it was shown that orally administered Bifidobacterium breve or Bifidobacterium bifidum had no influence on the measured infection and immunity indices in the rat infection model. Since the rat DTH response {{is considered to be}} a manifestation of Th 1 cell-mediated immunity and the IgG 2 b isotype has been associated with Th 1 activity, it was concluded that Th 1 cells could play an active role in the immunomodulatory effects of orally administered L. casei. Furthermore, our data do not indicate that the effect of oral supplementation with L. casei is dependent on the genetic background of the host...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this present}} study is to compare the gross anatomy, morphometry, {{histology}} and biochemical analysis of the cerebral cortex in African hedgehogs and pangolins. In this comparative study, six hedgehogs and five pangolins were used followed by histopathological and biochemical analysis. The average body weight and body length of hedgehog and pangolins were 181. 50 g, 15. 80 cm and 1558. 40 g, 115. 75 cm, respectively. The average brain weights and volume of hedgehog and pangolin were 1. 42 g, 1. 27 mL and 10. 56 g, 66. 38 mL, respectively while their Relative <b>Tongue</b> <b>Weight</b> (RTW) were determined to be 0. 67 and 1. 92 %, respectively. The biochemical analysis of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) in hedgehog and pangolin {{were found to be}} 12449. 80, 11728. 60 and 17090. 75, 14937. 00 U L- 1, respectively.

40|$|Ninety-five steers {{were used}} to develop a method of {{estimating}} the weights or percentages of the four carcass tissues-muscle, bone, fat and connective tissue-while the carcasses {{were still on the}} slaughter floor. From an investigation of a number of non-carcass parts it was found that three measurements could be used to estimate all four carcass components. The measurements were (a) short-cut tongue weight; (b) foreshanks weight; (c) hot side weight. Simple and multiple regression equations were developed to estimate the weights of muscle, bone and connective tissue in the chilled side, and the accuracy of the estimates was compared with that of recorded prediction methods. The most useful equations employed short-cut <b>tongue</b> <b>weight</b> and hot side weight to estimate total side muscle weight, and foreshanks weight to estimate both total side bone weight and total side connective tissue weight. Fat weight was estimated from hot side weight and the estimates of the weights of the other three carcass components. This technique was more accurate than the Australian Beef Carcase Appraisal System and Butterfield’s equation, both of which use fat thickness measurement at the 10 th rib. When fat thickness measurement was included in regression equations, the estimates of muscle weight and fat weight were slightly improved. Advantages of using the ŉon-carcass parts’ technique are as follows. All four major carcass components are predicted; the carcass components can be recorded as absolute weights or percentages of chilled side weight; chilled side components are predicted whilst the hot side is still on the slaughter floor no commercial loss occurs in carcass, offals or by-products; all measurements used in prediction are weights; and fat thickness measurements may be included in the prediction. The additional information enables producers to make a more critical assessment of the nutritive performance and genetic progress of their herds...|$|E
