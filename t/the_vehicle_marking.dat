40|$|The Hazard Detection System (HDS) is a {{component}} of the ALHAT (Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology) sensor suite, which together provide a lander Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) system with the relevant measurements necessary to enable safe precision landing under any lighting conditions. The HDS consists of a stand-alone compute element (CE), an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a gimbaled flash LIDAR sensor that are used, in real-time, to generate a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of the landing terrain, detect candidate safe landing sites for the vehicle through Hazard Detection (HD), and generate hazard-relative navigation (HRN) measurements used for safe precision landing. Following an extensive ground and helicopter test campaign, ALHAT was integrated onto the Morpheus rocket-powered terrestrial test vehicle in March 2014. Morpheus and ALHAT then performed five successful free flights at the simulated lunar hazard field constructed at the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) at Kennedy Space Center, for the first time testing the full system on a lunar-like approach geometry in a relevant dynamic environment. During these flights, the HDS successfully generated DEMs, correctly identified safe landing sites and provided HRN measurements to <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>marking</b> the first autonomous landing of a NASA rocket-powered vehicle in hazardous terrain. This paper provides a brief overview of the HDS architecture and describes its in-flight performance...|$|E

40|$|Combat Vehicle 90 is a Swedish {{infantry}} combat {{vehicle that}} BAE Systems Hägglunds in Örnsköldsvik has designed {{and started to}} produce in 1993. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle</b> is still undergoing development and due to increasing demands of armor and fire power the weight of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> has drastically increased. The first version of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>Mark</b> 1, has a combat weight of 23 tons and the latest version, Mark 3, has a combat weight of 35 tons. The increased weight of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> affects a numerous of <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> components and its performance, especially the drivetrain and suspension. <b>The</b> <b>vehicle</b> has in its drivetrain final gears that decrease the rotational speed from the transmission and thus increasing the drive torque to the driving wheels and tracks. The final gears are oil lubricated and because of <b>the</b> increased <b>vehicle</b> weight <b>the</b> input power has increased and thus the power loss in the final gears increases. This result in a higher oil temperature than intended which in turn can lead to major mechanical failure and thus a need of oil cooling is required. An oil cooling system for the final gears was implemented in the Mark 3 version of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> but <b>the</b> system does not work satisfactorily as {{there are problems with}} the drive unit to the circulation pump. This master thesis aims at finding a new improved solution for the oil circulation system. This report describes the work done from an idea to a final solution. The solution was designed in the CAE-tool Catia V 5 and calculations regarding dimensions of the pump and the influence of channel diameter for the pressure drop were conducted. The result of this master thesis is an integrated circulation pump in the final gear which fulfills the demands that were specified for the problem and thus is a solution to the given problem.
