500|$|Lafayette grew {{increasingly}} disillusioned with Louis-Phillippe, who backtracked on reforms and denied his promises to make them. [...] The retired general angrily broke with his king, a breach which widened {{when the government}} used force to suppress a strike in Lyon. Lafayette used his seat in the Chamber to promote liberal proposals, and in 1831 his neighbors elected him mayor of the village of La Grange and to the council of the département of Seine-et-Marne. [...] The following year, Lafayette served as a pallbearer and spoke at the funeral of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque, another opponent of Louis-Phillippe. Despite Lafayette's pleas for calm, there were riots {{in the streets and}} a barricade was erected at the Place de la Bastille. The king forcefully crushed <b>this</b> <b>June</b> Rebellion, to Lafayette's outrage. Lafayette returned to La Grange until the Chamber met in November 1832. He condemned Louis-Phillippe for introducing censorship, as CharlesX had.|$|E

2500|$|Norfolk Southern (NS), {{successor}} to Conrail's {{lines in the}} immediate area, agreed in June 1998 to place the Corry-Hornell [...] "Southern Tier Extension" [...] back in service, in exchange for certain financial incentives. <b>This</b> <b>June</b> 1998 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was memorialized in the Surface Transportation Board's record of Decision in July 1998. The New York Legislature then created the Chautauqua, Cattaraugus, Allegany, and Steuben Southern Tier Extension Railroad Authority (STERA) in June 2000 in order to acquire the New York portion {{of the line and}} lease it back to NS. This was done in February 2001, and on April 23, the newly created WNY, a subsidiary of the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad, sub-leased the line from Norfolk Southern and began operating the line. Except for a short segment near the Buffalo Line crossing at Olean, which NS did not sub-lease to WNY (but for which Norfolk Southern did provide [...] overhead trackage rights to WNY), the WNY sub-leased the line from Corry PA to Hornell NY from Norfolk Southern.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} {{of the members of}} all three Wheeling Conventions, the May (First) Convention, the June (Second) Convention, and the Constitutional Convention, was of an irregular nature. The members of the May Convention were chosen by groups of Unionists, mostly in the far Northwestern counties. Over one-third came from the counties around the northern panhandle. The May Convention resolved to meet again in June 1861 should the Ordinance of Secession be ratified by public poll on May 23, 1861, which was the case. The June 1861 convention consisted of 104 members, 35 of which were members of the General Assembly in Richmond, some elected in the May 23rd vote, and some hold-over State Senators. Arthur Laidley, elected to the General Assembly from Cabell County, attended the June Convention but refused to take part. The other delegates to the June Convention were [...] "chosen even more irregularly-some in mass meetings, others by county committee, and still others were seemingly self-appointed". It was <b>this</b> <b>June</b> Convention which drafted the Statehood resolution. The Constitutional Convention met in November 1861, and consisted of 61 members. Its composition was just as irregular. A delegate representing Logan County was accepted as a member of this body, though he did not live in Logan County, and his [...] "credentials consisted of a petition signed by fifteen persons representing six families". The large number of Northerners at this convention caused great distrust over the new Constitution during Reconstruction years. In 1872, under the leadership of Samuel Price, former Lt. Governor of Virginia, the Wheeling constitution was discarded, and an entirely new one was written along ante-bellum principles.|$|E

60|$|<b>This</b> <b>June</b> {{morning in}} the wild forest was {{significant}} of nature's brightness and joy. Broad-leaved poplars, dense foliaged oaks, and vine-covered maples shaded cool, mossy banks, while between the trees the sunshine streamed in bright spots. It shone silver on the glancing silver-leaf, and gold on the colored leaves of the butternut tree. Dewdrops glistened on the ferns; ripples sparkled in the brooks; spider-webs glowed with wondrous rainbow hues, and the flower of the forest, the sweet, pale-faced daisy, rose above the green like a white star.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning she}} set out early, riding her best horse, and she took a sheep trail across country. The {{distance}} by road was much farther. The June morning was cool, sparkling, fragrant. Mocking birds sang from the topmost twig of cedars; doves cooed in the pines; sparrow hawks sailed low over the open grassy patches. Desert primroses showed their rounded pink clusters in sunny places, and here and there burned the carmine of Indian paintbrush. Jack rabbits and cotton-tails bounded and scampered away through the sage. The desert had life and color and movement <b>this</b> <b>June</b> day. And as always there was the dry fragrance on the air.|$|E
60|$|It was on {{a morning}} in June that John Gayther was hoeing peas, drawing the fine earth up about their tender little stems as a mother would tuck the clothes about her little {{sleeping}} baby, when, happening to glance across several beds, and rows of box, he saw approaching the Daughter of the House. Probably {{she was looking for}} him, but he did not think she had yet seen him. He put down his hoe, feeling, as he did, that <b>this</b> <b>June</b> morning was getting very warm; and he gathered up an armful of pea-sticks which were lying near by. With these he made his way toward a little house almost {{in the middle of the}} garden, which was his fortress, his palace, his studio, or his workshop, as the case might be.|$|E

60|$|If, then, {{you feel}} that you know the town well enough to be {{admitted}} into the inner life and movement of it, walk down <b>this</b> <b>June</b> afternoon half way down the Main Street--or, if you like, half way up from the wharf--to where Mr. Smith is standing at the door of his hostelry. You will feel as you draw near that it is no ordinary man that you approach. It is not alone the huge bulk of Mr. Smith (two hundred and eighty pounds as tested on Netley's scales). It is not merely his costume, though the chequered waistcoat of dark blue with a flowered pattern forms, with his shepherd's plaid trousers, his grey spats and patent-leather boots, a colour scheme of no mean order. Nor is it merely Mr. Smith's finely mottled face. The face, no doubt, is a notable one,--solemn, inexpressible, unreadable, the face of the heaven-born hotel keeper. It is more than that. It is the strange dominating personality of the man that somehow holds you captive. I know nothing in history to compare with the position of Mr. Smith among those who drink over his bar, except, though in a lesser degree, the relation of the Emperor Napoleon to the Imperial Guard.|$|E
6000|$|It was far on in June now, and Maggie was {{inclined}} to lengthen the daily walk which was her one indulgence; but this day and the following she was so busy with work which must be finished that she never went beyond the gate, and satisfied her need of the open air by sitting out of doors. One of her frequent walks, when she was not obliged to go to St. Ogg's, was to a spot that lay beyond {{what was called the}} [...] "Hill,"--an insignificant rise of ground crowned by trees, lying {{along the side of the}} road which ran by the gates of Dorlcote Mill. Insignificant I call it, because in height it was hardly more than a bank; but there may come moments when Nature makes a mere bank a means toward a fateful result; and that is why I ask you to imagine this high bank crowned with trees, making an uneven wall for some quarter of a mile along the left side of Dorlcote Mill and the pleasant fields behind it, bounded by the murmuring Ripple. Just where this line of bank sloped down again to the level, a by-road turned off and led to the other side of the rise, where it was broken into very capricious hollows and mounds by the working of an exhausted stone-quarry, so long exhausted that both mounds and hollows were now clothed with brambles and trees, and here and there by a stretch of grass which a few sheep kept close-nibbled. In her childish days Maggie held this place, called the Red Deeps, in very great awe, and needed all her confidence in Tom's bravery to reconcile her to an excursion thither,--visions of robbers and fierce animals haunting every hollow. But now it had the charm for her which any broken ground, any mimic rock and ravine, have for the eyes that rest habitually on the level; especially in summer, when she could sit on a grassy hollow under the shadow of a branching ash, stooping aslant from the steep above her, and listen to the hum of insects, like tiniest bells on the garment of Silence, or see the sunlight piercing the distant boughs, as if to chase and drive home the truant heavenly blue of the wild hyacinths. In <b>this</b> <b>June</b> time, too, the dog-roses were in their glory, and that was an additional reason why Maggie should direct her walk to the Red Deeps, rather than to any other spot, on the first day she was free to wander at her will,--a pleasure she loved so well, that sometimes, in her ardors of renunciation, she thought she ought to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it.|$|E
