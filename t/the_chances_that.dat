5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required {{to achieve the same}} results in the same amount of time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have been worth $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> he will finish his career having played for just one organization, the one that drafted him. This distinction of having Molina retire as a Cardinal is something that carried weight for both parties throughout the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Tombaugh's {{task was}} to {{systematically}} capture sections {{of the night sky}} in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth's orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.|$|E

40|$|This article {{tests the}} {{applicability}} of Treas’s transaction cost economic framework to con-texts outside the allocation of bank accounts among married couples in the United States. Using the Japanese Panel Study of Consumer Life, the authors apply logistic regressions among Japanese couples who have joint accounts to predict (a) <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> wife has a separate bank account from the joint account and (b) <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> she has an allowance. The results provide only partial support for the hypotheses based on Treas’s framework. Whereas Treas argues that the potential discontinuity of a marriage has {{a major influence on}} a couple’s separate financial arrangement, the study finds no evidence consistent with this ar-gument. Although some of Treas’s hypotheses are well supported when predicting <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> a Japanese wife has an allowance, the same hypotheses are not supported when predicting <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> she has a separate bank account...|$|R
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which increase <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> {{the offspring of}} the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will spit out the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E

25|$|Especially in {{children}} and people with severe TBI, the life-threatening condition of persistent seizure called status epilepticus is a risk in early seizures; 10 to 20% of PTS develop into the condition. In one study, 22% of children under 5 years old developed status seizures, while 11% of the whole TBI population studied did. Status seizures early after a TBI may heighten <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> a person will suffer unprovoked seizures later.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> {{a person}} will suffer PTS are {{influenced}} by factors involving the injury and the person.

The single largest risk for PTS is penetrating head trauma, which carries a 35 to 50% risk of seizures within 15years. If a fragment of metal remains within the skull after injury, the risk of both early and late PTS may be increased. Head trauma survivors who abused alcohol before the injury are also at higher risk for developing seizures.|$|E
25|$|As in all Australian elections, {{the flow}} of {{preferences}} from minor parties can be crucial in determining the final outcome.

Howard made a pitch for the preferences of the Australian Greens by appearing to offer concessions on the issue of logging in old-growth forests in Tasmania, and the Coalition directed its preferences to the Greens ahead of Labor in the Senate, but the Greens nevertheless decided to allocate preferences to Labor in most electorates. In exchange, Labor agreed to direct its preferences in the Senate to the Greens ahead of the Democrats (but critically, not ahead of other minor parties), increasing <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> the Greens would displace Australian Democrats Senators in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.|$|E

25|$|Despite an {{expansive}} array of altruistic behaviors, cotton-top tamarins engage in great bouts of spite through negative reciprocity and punishment. They {{have been observed}} to immediately start denying cooperation with monkeys that deny them benefits. Further, in captivity, these primates are not observed to increase altruistic behavior with fellow primates that are committed fully to cooperation. Based on this, researchers believe that repeated interactions in a cooperative society {{like that of the}} cotton-top tamarin can heighten <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> an individual will designate behavioral punishments to others in its group. This reaction has also been observed in other species. However, these reciprocal punishments, or relative lack of altruistic actions, may alternatively happen as a result of response facilitation that increases the chances of a cotton-top punishing another primate after watching that individual perform a similar action.|$|E
25|$|While {{this method}} greatly {{improves}} <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> an attack will be successful, {{it is not}} without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities. Another {{problem is that the}} NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space {{from the end of the}} current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.|$|E
25|$|In total, the {{mitochondrion}} hosts about 3000 {{different types}} of proteins, but only about 13 of them are coded on the mitochondrial DNA. Most of the 3000 types of proteins {{are involved in a}} variety of processes other than ATP production, such as porphyrin synthesis. Only about 3% of them code for ATP production proteins. This means most of the genetic information coding for the protein makeup of mitochondria is in chromosomal DNA and is involved in processes other than ATP synthesis. This increases <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> a mutation that will affect a mitochondrion will occur in chromosomal DNA, which is inherited in a Mendelian pattern. Another result is that a chromosomal mutation will affect a specific tissue due to its specific needs, whether those may be high energy requirements or a need for the catabolism or anabolism of a specific neurotransmitter or nucleic acid. Because several copies of the mitochondrial genome are carried by each mitochondrion (2–10 in humans), mitochondrial mutations can be inherited maternally by mtDNA mutations which are present in mitochondria inside the oocyte before fertilization, or (as stated above) through mutations in the chromosomes.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This article aims to {{quantify}} the risk factors associated with the human cases of H 5 N 1 avian influenza in South-east Asian countries and China; a dangerous region for this disease {{that has the potential}} for a pandemic outbreak. Study design: A statistical model with time and spatial dimensions was built to capture the international spread patterns of this disease. Methods: The grid search method was used to fit the model with 2004 - 2006 data. The grid search approach is a simple procedure that allows the fit of any function to data. Results: This study found that: (1) when the number of domestic H 5 N 1 human cases increases by one person in a certain time period, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will have a human case in the next period increases by 22. 10 %; (2) when the number of human cases in a neighbouring country increases by one person in a certain time period, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will have a human case in the next period increases by 1. 62 %; (3) when the number of avian cases in a neighbouring country increases by one, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will have a human case increases by 0. 02 %; (4) as the human population increases by one unit. <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will have a human case increases by 0. 10 %; (5) when the quantity of imported poultry increases by 1000 metric tons, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will have a human case increases by 0. 03 %; (6) when the outbreak of the disease among domestic birds increases by one, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will have a human case increases by 0. 19 %; and finally (7) when the number of birds destroyed increases by 1000, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> country will have a human case decreases by 0. 30 %. Conclusions: These findings shed new light on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the epidemic, and thus need to be taken into consideration in interdisciplinary and scientific discussion of the disease.

25|$|Surfing, {{like all}} water sports, carries the {{inherent}} danger of drowning. Anyone {{at any age}} can learn to surf, but {{should have at least}} intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>that</b> the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.|$|E
