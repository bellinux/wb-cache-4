Intracoronary adenosine and post conditioning {{has been reported to}} reduce infarct size in patients with acute MI. Our purpose is to compare these two strategies. Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for STEMI within 6 hours after symptom onset were randomly assigned to the postconditioning, adenosine or controls group. Exclusion criteria were: previous MI, revascularization, controindication to PCI or cardiogenic shock. Adenosine was administrated in 2 mg bolus with over the wire cathether; postconditioning included 4 sequencies of 1 minute balloon inflation/one minute reperfusion. Primary end point include: wall motion score index (1 - 6 months), ST resolution 30 minute after the procedure, cardiac markers (peak values) and infarct related end diastolic wall <b>tickness.</b> 2 -way ANOVA is used to identify interaction between the treatment modality. A P< 0. 05 will be considered statistically significant. Results: 46 patients were enrolled. The 3 groups were similar for age, sex, and infarct location.

40|$|AbstractBackground and purpose: Hirschsprung’s disease (HD) is {{the most}} common {{etiology}} of neonatal intestinal obstruction. Definite diagnosis is based on demonstration of aganglionosis in seromuscular and full <b>tickness</b> rectal biopsy. Because of problems and complications of full <b>tickness</b> and seromuscular rectal biopsies, mucosal-submucosal rectal biopsy is prefered,but interpretation of these biopsies with Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining and even with usual Immunohistochemical staining (acetylcholinesterase) is difficult. Because neuron-specific enolase (NSE) for diagnosis of Hirschsprung’s disease is an available marker with performance on paraffin blocks and lack of data about its accuracy, this study was done to determine the accuracy of NSE staining on mucosal- submucosal rectal biopsies in diagnosis of HD and allied disorders. Materials and methods : We studied 65 mucosal- submucosal and 65 seromuscular biopsies of patients suspected of HD or allied disorders in Shafa and Booali hospitals Sari,Iran (from 23 Sep. 2003 until 22 Oct. 2004). For each patient both seromuscular and Mucosal-submucosal biopsiess were prepared. Mucosal-submucosal slides were stained by NSE and seromucular slides stained by H&E then the slides examined double blindly and the results compared with each other. Results : Sensitivity, specificity, efficeincy, positive and negative predictive value in diagnosis of HD are 100 %, % 84. 2,% 89. 1, % 81. 8, 100 % respectively (p< 0. 05), showing statistically significant difference with standard. On evaluation of Hypogangliononsis, we had one false – negative and nine false – positive. Conclusion: In NSE staining, finding of ganglion cell definitively role out HD but lack of ganglion cell in % 81. 8 confirms H. D.

This structure is easily etched into smaller than 100 bigger than silicon using a standard K O H etcha nt and a nitride masking layer. Subsequently the grid area is metallized to prevent oxidation. In order to achieve a higher static pressure without increasing the driving voltage, several devices can be stacked. Depending on the application, the maximum flow rate can be adjusted through the grid area. Alternatively, a stripe geometry can be used, or the distance between the grids can be adjusted precisely by etching back the upper grid from the frontside...|$|E

This study {{investigated}} the relationship between changes in circulating numbers of leukocytes and muscle damage after 24 maximal eccentric actions of the elbow flexors. Blood samples and criterion measurements were taken immediately before and after and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, and 120 h after exercise from eight non-resistance trained, male students. The number of leukocytes (neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, cosinophil, basophil), erythrocytes, and platelets and hematocrit were analyzed by a hematology analyzer. Plasma samples {{were used to determine}} creatine kinase activity, myoglobin, and C-reactive protein. Maximal isometric force, range of motion, upper arm circumference, mucsle <b>tickness</b> by B-mode ultrasonography, and muscle coreness were measured as indicators of muscle damage. All muscle damage indicators canged significantly (P< 0. 05) after exercise and suggested that severe muscle damage occurred to the elbow flexors. C-reactive protein, lymphocytes, cosinophils, basophils, erythrocytes, platelets,and hematocrit ded not change significantly over time. Neutrophils increased significantly (P, 0. 01) and peaked at 12 h after exercise. Monocyters increased significantly (P< 0. 05) and peaked at 8 h after exercise. However, the amount of increase in neutrophils (2 × 109 ･ 1 - 1) and monocytes (0. 2 × 109 ･ 1 - 1) after exercise was small and not necessarily associated with the magnitude of muscle damage...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The mechanisms, {{responsible}} for the secondary injuries occuring after acute injury of the brain are; release of nitrous oxide which is an inflammatory mediator, abnormal formation of free oxygen radicals and excessive stimulation of excitatory aminoacids. In this study, it is aimed to investigate changes in intercellular adhesion molecule levels in the brain, that occur subsequent to blunt head trauma, and after administration of an antioxidant agent, vitamin E. Material and Method: In this study, rats were divided into 4 groups. In group A; rats had only skin incision, group B; rats were traumatized after the skin incision, group C; isotonic (30 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally after 30 minutes of the trauma, group D; alpha-tocopherol (30 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally, after 30 minutes of the trauma. All the rats in these groups were sacrified after 24 hours. Biparietal and bifrontal lobs were taken about 3 x 5 x 1 mm <b>tickness</b> and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 levels were studied by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Results: As {{the result of the}} statistical analysis, it is detected that although there is an increase in intercellular adhesion molecule levels in brain parenchyma after trauma, it is statistically unsignificant. However, as the traumatized group and the group given alpha-tocopherol after trauma was compared, a statistically significant decrease in intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 levels in the alpha-tocopherol given group was seen. Discussion: Alpha-tocopherol, an antioxidant agent, causes decrease in intercellular adhesion molecule levels, by decreasing inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Foam cells {{formation}} by oxidized {{low-density lipoprotein}} (oxLDL) accumulation in macrophages {{is crucial for}} development of atherosclerosis. Macrophage foam cell formation is an important process in atherosclerotic plaque development. 1 Atherosclerosis is initiated by dysfunction of endothelial cells at lesion-prone sites in the walls of arteries, which results in monocyte infiltration into the arterial intima. These cells differentiated into macrophages, which then internalize large amounts of oxidized low-density lipoprotein forming cholesterol-laden macrophages called “foam cells”, which in turn give rise to fatty streaks in the arterial wall. As the atherosclerotic lesion develops, the arterial wall <b>tickness</b> increases and oxygen diffusion into the intima is markedly reduced. 2 These hypoxic regions contain large number of foam cells revealing that these cells experience hypoxia during the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Hypoxia has been demonstrated in atherosclerosis and hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) {{has been shown to}} promote intraplaque angiogenesis and foam cells development. Adenosine is a proangiogenic purine nucleoside released from ischemic and hypoxic tissues. In this study we found that Adenosine, under hypoxia, stimulates HIF- 1 α accumulation by activating adenosine receptors. This study provides the first evidence that adenosine antagonists may be useful to block important steps in the atherosclerotic plaque development ado-induced. (1) 	Lusis, AJ. Atherosclerosis.

40|$|There {{are about}} 95. 812 ha of {{critical}} to potential critical land and about 2. 665. 829 ha of potential land in Ogan Komering Ilir regency, these land {{have not been}} cultivated for agriculture. Identification of soil/land physical dan chemical properties are {{needed in order to}} find out how these land are suitable for low land rice growth. Low land rice is choosen because this area are flooded in rainy seasson and dried in dry seasson, that why traditionally farmers cultivate their soils are based on water level (“sonor or padi lebak”). Data analysis of soil physical dan chemical properties are structure, texture, permeability, organic matter content, pH, N-total, P and K. Drainage and slope steepness are also investigated in the field. Then soil suitability for low land rice are classified based on laboratories data dan field data. The results show that soil pH, drainage, soil texture, pirite, and <b>tickness</b> of peat are as limiting factors for paddy plant. Actual land suitabilities are S 2 and S 3 Classes, if the drainage system was rehabilitated and lime was applied for increasing pH, the potential suitable classes become S 1, S 2, and S 3. Only texture could not be improved, but to minimize texture effect it could be applied organic matter. However, dominantly land in this area are potentially suitable for development and extension of paddy field and might be one of the biggest land recourse for supporting South Sumatra as food producer. ...|$|E
40|$|Type II lesions {{are common}} lesions {{encountered}} in overhead athletes with controversies arising {{in term of}} timing for treatment, surgical approach, rehabilitation and functional results. The aim of our study was to evaluate the outcomes of arthroscopic repair of type II SLAP tears in overhead athletes, focusing on the time elapsed from diagnosis and treatment, time needed to return to sport, rate of return to sport and to previous level of performance, providing an overview concerning evidence for the effectiveness of different surgical approaches to type II SLAP tears in overhead athletes. A internet search on peer reviewed Journal from 1990, first descriprion of this pathology, to 2012, have been conducted evaluating the outcomes for both isolated Slap II tear overhead athletes and those who presented associated lesions treated. The results have been analyzed according to the scale reported focusing on return to sport and level of activity. Apart from a single study, non prospective level I and II studies were detected. Return {{to play at the}} same level ranged form 22 % to 94 % with different range of technique utilized with the majority of the authors recommending the fixation of these lesions but biceps tenodesis can lead to higher satisfaction racte when directly compated to the anchor fixation. Associated pathologies such as partial or full <b>tickness</b> rotator cuff tear did not clearly affect the outcomes and complications rate. There is no consensus regarding timing and treatment for type II SLAP, especially in overhead athletes who need to regain a high level of performance...|$|E
40|$|Background: At least 15 - 20 % of all ischemic strokes are {{attributable}} to atherosclerosis [1]. We analyzed three statistical methods for 12 traditional risk factors (TRF) i. e. age, sex, arterial pressure, Intima Media <b>Tickness</b> (IMT), Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) in order to predict the presence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Methods: We studied 48 patients (27 men, mean age 52 +/- 10. 9) after a vascular screening for atherosclerosis from a metabolic syndrome cohort in a retrospective way. Fourteen patients presented carotid atheromatous plaques confirmed by a trained operator using an ultrasound system. The sensitivity and specificity of {{the combination of the}} IMT and the PWV indices with other risk factors were considered using: multiple linear regressions (MLR), support vector machines (SVM) [2] and discriminant analysis (DA). The best combinations of variables were kept for each learning machine. Results: The best sensibility and specificity were obtained using DA. This method reached a sensitivity of 95 +/- 7 % and a specificity of 73 +/- 36 % with an area under the ROC curve equal to 0. 84 +/- 0. 35. The other methods showed a sensitivity of 73 +/- 13 % for the MLR method and 53 +/- 34 % for the SVM method with an area under the ROC curve of 0. 72 +/- 0. 07 and 0. 74 +/- 0. 18 respectively. Conclusion: This preliminary study shows that carotid atherosclerotic plaques could be reliably predicted using discriminant analysis method. Additional studies are needed to confirm the statistical differences observed using this method and to predict the severity of carotid atherosclerosis...|$|E
