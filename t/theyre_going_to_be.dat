5000|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parents realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If Im just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say <b>theyre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back at midnight and they dont come back, you immediately think theyre dead and you start to worry. If theyd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just dont think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E

5000|$|Reviewing {{the first}} episodes in The Guardian Sam Wollaston noted its jumble of {{characters}} and events: [...] "Tony Jordan {{has taken a}} whole bunch of Dickens characters from their novels and put them into something else. …. Its like EastEnders meets A Christmas Carol meets Great Expectations meets Oliver Twist meets Bleak House meets Our Mutual Friend, and Ive certainly missed some out. Meets Agatha Christie, too, because heres another body - Marleys this time - coshed over the head and left lying in the snow". He added, [...] "The set is beautiful, and there are showy Dickensian performances from a starry cast. Its clever, certainly, and must have been a labour of love, unpicking all these people from their works, weaving them into something else." [...] But he had a problem [...] "with the whole exercise - starting with the characters, someone elses, and then figuring out what <b>theyre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing. Are things not better if they grow together, as one, characters, stories, style, themes etc? And the problem with these particular characters is that the new thing is never going {{to be as good as}} the thing they came from". He concluded, [...] "And Im having real problems figuring out what the bleedin ell is going on. Its clear like the fog down by the dock where Fagin lives. It - the fog - does lift a bit; by the end of the second episode (of 20! that’s a big ask), Im a bit less fuddled. And it begins to pick up momentum of its own. But I wonder how many of the viewers who set off will get this far".|$|E

The film had the third-biggest opening 4th of July weekend after Transformers and Spider-Man 2. Hancock was Will Smiths fifth film to open on a 4 July weekend and was his most successful opening to date. The film was also Smiths eighth film in a row to take top placement in the American and Canadian box office and the twelfth film in Smiths career to lead the box office.

5000|$|Part of the {{inspiration}} for the episode came from the Shakespeare play Richard III, most notably, the interaction between Richard and Lady Anne.

5000|$|A {{distinguished}} female contract {{killer in}} the world of assassins, and a former acquaintance of John. About the character of Ms. Perkins, Palicki said, [...] "Ms. Perkins is what you think the quintessential assassin would be. She’s cold, heartless, conniving, badass and I think that she has fun with what she does. She enjoys it. I think that she’d clearly do it for a dollar. Ultimately in the film she’s doing it for four million, so its a little different." [...] Originally the character of Perkins was envisioned as a man, but the decision was reversed during a brainstorming session and the desire to create [...] "an authentic female action character." [...] Leitch stated, [...] "You believe this woman could come in and give John Wick a run for his money," [...] so Stahelski, Leitch and Iwanyk changed it and offered the role to Palicki. Palicki spoke most highly of working with Reeves and the inclusion of stunt work on her part, to which she stated, [...] "Chad wanted to make sure I would <b>be</b> willing <b>to</b> do my own stuff in the huge fight sequence that I have with Keanu—and I was all game." [...] Palicki spent months of training learning Judo and Jujutsu. After the films release Palicki revealed background information, [...] "I also think we talked about a backstory. Its likely Perkins and Wick had a history as well, before his marriage. She may have a personal vendetta as well as the money. I think theres an enjoyment on multiple levels." [...] On what she hopes for with regard to the fan response, [...] "Its a lot of fun. <b>Theyre</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> want to see what happens next. Most importantly, I hope they’re rooting for John Wick the way that I did when I read the script." ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Ving {{construction}} occurs only 36 {{times in}} the 1, 000, 000 -word Great Britain component of the ICE corpus. Yet, its context of use is multifaceted. The <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> part may express intentionality (“When you go <b>to</b> Italy <b>are</b> you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing art”), expectation/probability (“And these little cartilages at the back actually move the vocal folds when they <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vibrating”) or something in between these two notions (“Could you just play the notes that I <b>'m</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> doing”). The be Ving part may encode a durative event (“You <b>'re</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transcribing all of this are you”; “are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eating at your parents’ or here”), a repeated event (“And I said well I think Rebecca <b>'s</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> into her M Phil lectures”) or a punctual event (“And I <b>was</b> just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> telling people what <b>to</b> do which <b>was</b> fine”).
