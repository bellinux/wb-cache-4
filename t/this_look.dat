5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined <b>this</b> <b>look</b> before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For <b>this</b> <b>look</b> she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am afraid,' said Mr Pecksniff, pausing at the door, {{and giving}} {{his head a}} melancholy roll, 'I am afraid that <b>this</b> <b>looks</b> artful. I am afraid, Mrs Lupin, do you know, that <b>this</b> <b>looks</b> very artful!' ...|$|R

"The {{first night}} I saw dailies," [...] replied art {{director}} Wallace, [...] "projected on a bedsheet in the producer's ratty apartment… My jaw dropped and I sat up so straight I {{cast a shadow}} with my head. <b>This</b> <b>looked</b> like a zillion dollars. <b>This</b> <b>looked</b> like a real movie." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the next}} scene, Gaga and her eye-patch wearing boyfriend are reading {{magazines}} {{on a sofa}} in a tea room. Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and shoulder pads. The Guardian compared <b>this</b> <b>look</b> with that of Minnie Mouse. She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with white powder concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone corkscrew wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.|$|E
5|$|The Zelda team, however, had {{exhausted}} its {{ideas for}} this style and format. Aonuma hated the demo, finding it derivative of past Zelda games. The team explored other directions until designer Yoshiki Haruhana created a cartoonish {{drawing of a}} young Link that caught their eye. Design manager Satoru Takizawa drew up an enemy Moblin in a similar style, and the team seized on the new gameplay and combat possibilities afforded by the stylized cartoon aesthetic. To achieve <b>this</b> <b>look,</b> they used cel shading on 3D models, giving the look of an interactive cartoon. The developers built the game with Alias/Wavefront's Maya 3D tool and a custom game engine.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had bothered him with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto <b>this</b> <b>look</b> in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E

25|$|To see <b>this,</b> <b>look</b> at {{the set of}} {{invertible}} square matrices of a given dimension, over a given field. Now it {{is straightforward}} to verify closure, associativity, and inclusion of identity (the identity matrix) and inverses. However, matrix multiplication is not commutative, therefore this group is nonabelian.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>look</b> {{was unusual}} in that no special idents were {{produced}} for events or programmes. However, a way {{used to promote}} the third series of Little Britain was for the shows announcer, Tom Baker to provide the continuity announcements for the evening over the normal idents.|$|E

25|$|Newsround updated {{its opening}} in May 1987, with {{computer}} graphics, although <b>this</b> <b>look</b> was originally planned for January 1987. In September 1990, a space look was introduced. The multi-coloured look appeared in January 1994, with further updates {{taking place on}} 1 September 1997, 11 February 2002, 30 May 2006, and 13 October 2006.|$|E
25|$|For the 1996 playoffs, {{they became}} {{the first team to}} wear black socks with the black shoes, similar to the University of Michigan and the Fab Five which started the trend in college earlier in the decade. Since, many teams have <b>this</b> <b>look</b> in both the regular season and playoffs.|$|E
25|$|During the {{successful}} first run of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Philbin popularized the monochromatic look in men's formal wear that emphasizes color rather than pattern in ties and dress shirts. His look was a suit, {{shirt and tie}} coordinated in solid, slightly varying shades of the same, usually dark or muted, color. A Van Heusen clothing line based on <b>this</b> <b>look,</b> called Regis, was short-lived.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the line, Macy's New York {{department}} store created a section called Madonnaland in 1985. It {{was established to}} coincide with her Radio City Music Hall concerts as part of The Virgin Tour. They sold clothing and jewelry resembling those worn by the singer {{at the time and}} held a look-alike contest in the store. <b>This</b> <b>look</b> would later inspire the Material Girl collection.|$|E
25|$|Lolita {{fashion is}} a very {{well-known}} and recognizable style in Japan. Based on Victorian fashion and the Rococo period, girls mix in their own elements along with gothic style to achieve the porcelain-doll look. The girls who dress in Lolita fashion try to look cute, innocent, and beautiful. <b>This</b> <b>look</b> is achieved with lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.|$|E
25|$|Accompanying <b>this</b> <b>look,</b> static {{captions}} of {{the logo}} fully formed were used, alongside slides {{with the day}} written {{to the right of}} the BBC logo. Other slides were used featuring the '2' and BBC logo to the left of the screen with grey and white stripes on the right, which occasionally also featured the days of the week on them. A device used to switch between them was a large numeral 2, which would rotate to reveal one of these slides. These were filmed from the BBC2 NODD room and broadcast live.|$|E

25|$|Generally, in the Middle Ages {{the breasts}} were {{minimized}} in dresses with straight bodices, full skirts and high necklines, designed primarily for function rather than emphasis on form. Late medieval dresses are fitted precisely and snugly {{to the body}} and function as breast support. Depictions of women in 14th- and 15th-century art show a high, rounded breast silhouette on women old and young, full-busted and small. <b>This</b> <b>look</b> is not possible without support. The 15th-century ideal form was small-breasted and full-figured, symbolizing abundance of fertility.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2005, a new post-6:00p.m. {{advertising}} style was developed for older audiences, which used a much simpler logo and sleeker packaging with barely any gross-out tactics. In the spring of 2006, the simple logo first appeared on YTV's promos and even appeared on credits of newer original programming. In 2007, <b>this</b> <b>look</b> was adopted for the entire channel. In September 2009, the logo was changed slightly: it featured new colours, and the background was simplified. Variations to the bumpers were reduced. Instead, there are large, opaque digital on-screen graphics telling viewers which programs are coming next, and promotions of the programs. In September 2012, the logo was changed aesthetically.|$|E
25|$|Running {{alongside}} <b>this</b> <b>look,</b> interlude {{films were}} {{often used in}} the lengthy breaks between programmes. Due {{to the nature of}} television at the time, which was mainly based on live performances rather than pre-recorded material, programmes had an unknown length and as a result could easily finish several minutes before the beginning of the next advertised programme. The interlude films were used to fill the gaps and consisted of films of ideological settings or old industries, such as a farmer using a traditional plough. These films had no beginning or end and so could be of any specified length. With the subsequent rise of video tape and pre-recorded programmes, the interludes were less and less necessary.|$|E
