40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} actual {{situation}} in <b>tertiary</b> perinatal <b>care</b> in the Netherlands with the objectives {{laid down in}} the 2001 decree on perinatal care by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. DESIGN: Descriptive, retrospective. METHOD: Data on <b>tertiary</b> perinatal <b>care,</b> the transfer or refusal of women with very endangered pregnancies and the personnel of obstetric high care (OHC) units in 2006 were compared with the targets laid down in the planning decree on perinatal care and in {{a report by the}} Dutch Health Council from 2000. Parameters of <b>tertiary</b> perinatal <b>care</b> output were the number of admissions, and the number of beds in OHC units and neonatal intensive care units (NICU). RESULTS: In 2006, 128 of the 250 beds intended for OHC had been obtained. The degree of capacity utilisation was 94 %, while the norm is 80 %. 312 women were transferred due to lack of capacity of OHC units and NICU. The number of staff, specialised physicians as well as nurses, was considerably lower than the planned capacity. But training for obstetric perinatologists and OHC nurses was given. CONCLUSION: The targets for the number of beds for <b>tertiary</b> obstetric <b>care</b> and associated medical personnel have not been achieved as yet. As a consequence, the number of transfers is still too high. The funding of OHC units is not attuned to the complexity of <b>tertiary</b> perinatal <b>care.</b> Closer supervision of the execution of the planning decree and an adequate financing system are needed to achieve the objectives of the planning decree in the next 3 years...|$|R

40|$|Destaye Shiferaw Alemu, Alemayehu Desalegn Gudeta, Ayanaw Tsega Ferede, Haile Woretaw Alemu Department of Optometry, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Gondar University, Gondar, Ethiopia Background: Refractive {{errors are}} {{the second and}} third leading cause of visual {{impairment}} and blindness in Ethiopia, respectively. The situation is worse where accessing spectacles, which are the only management option in developing countries, is a major issue. Gondar University Hospital <b>Tertiary</b> Eye <b>Care</b> and Training Center is the only referral eye care center, and it lacks published evidence on the prevalence and degrees of refractive errors (myopia and hyperopia). Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the prevalence and degrees of myopia and hyperopia at Gondar University <b>Tertiary</b> Eye <b>Care</b> and Training Center. Materials and methods: Records of 1, 921 patients presented to refraction service at Gondar University Hospital <b>Tertiary</b> Eye <b>Care</b> and Training Center from January 2010 to January 2014 were reviewed. All cases of refractive errors (with visual improvement of at least one line) were converted into spherical equivalents (SE = sphere + &frac 12; cylinder). Myopia was defined as SE ≤ – 0. 25 D and hyperopia ≥ + 0. 25 D. Results: The study comprised of 61. 1 % males and 38. 9 % females; the patients had an average age of 40 ± 17 years. The overall prevalence of refractive errors (myopia and hyperopia) was 76. 3 % (95 % confidence interval: 75 %– 77 %). Myopia was present in 34. 5 % patients and hyperopia in 38. 3 %. Low-degree hyperopia (86 %) and low-degree myopia (49. 5 %) were the most frequent refractive errors. Conclusion: Myopia and hyperopia are major reasons for patients to visit Gondar University Hospital <b>Tertiary</b> Eye <b>Care</b> and Training Center. Low-degree myopia and hyperopia were the most common refractive errors. Stocking appropriate power lenses is needed at this <b>tertiary</b> eye <b>care</b> center in order to alleviate this problem in Ethiopia.
