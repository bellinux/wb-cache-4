25|$|According to a later legend, the {{sanctuary}} was erected by Emperor Leo I the Thracian (r. 457–474) {{because of a}} miracle that occurred {{when he was still}} a soldier. Before entering the City, Leo met a blind man who asked him to give him water. A female voice ordered the future Emperor to wet the eyes of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> <b>man</b> with water from a nearby swamp. The same voice added that she had chosen that very place to be worshiped and that he would one day receive the crown to the empire. Leo followed her order and at once <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> <b>man</b> recovered his eyesight. After his accession to the throne, the Emperor erected a magnificent church on this place. This legend is possibly a later invention of the monks of {{the sanctuary}}. It is possible that, before the Justinian's building was erected, a small monastery had already existed there.|$|E

60|$|Browning's {{conception}} of the Universe can hardly be better expressed than in the old and pregnant fable about <b>the</b> five <b>blind</b> <b>men</b> who went to visit an elephant. One of them seized its trunk, and asserted that an elephant {{was a kind of}} serpent; another embraced its leg, and was ready to die for the belief that an elephant was a kind of tree. In the same way to the man who leaned against its side it was a wall; to the man who had hold of its tail a rope, and to the man who ran upon its tusk a particularly unpleasant kind of spear. This, as I have said, is the whole theology and philosophy of Browning. But he differs from the psychological decadents and impressionists in this important point, that he thinks that although <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> <b>men</b> found out very little about the elephant, the elephant was an elephant, and was there all <b>the</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>blind</b> <b>men</b> formed mistaken theories because an elephant is a thing with a very curious shape. And Browning firmly believed that the Universe was a thing with a very curious shape indeed. No blind poet could even imagine an elephant without experience, and no man, however great and wise, could dream of God and not die. But there is a vital distinction between the mystical view of Browning, that <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> <b>men</b> are misled {{because there is so much}} for them to learn, and the purely impressionist and agnostic view of the modern poet, that <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> <b>men</b> were misled because there was nothing for them to learn. To the impressionist artist of our time we are not <b>blind</b> <b>men</b> groping after an elephant and naming it a tree or a serpent. We are maniacs, isolated in separate cells, and dreaming of trees and serpents without reason and without result.|$|R

40|$|As I {{started my}} {{conversation}} with the vast literature on collaboration, I {{was reminded of the}} fable of <b>the</b> <b>blind</b> <b>men</b> describing an elephant where each man described characteristics of a different part without an overall view of the whole: thus an elephant was deemed to be like a rope (tail), fan (ear), tree trunk (leg), spear (tusk) and wall (stomach).
