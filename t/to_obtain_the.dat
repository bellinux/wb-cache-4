5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish the poems in 1772, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> permission of the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E

5|$|Many metals are geologically most {{abundant}} as ionic compounds within ores. <b>To</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> elemental materials, these ores are processed by smelting or electrolysis, in which redox reactions occur (often with a reducing agent such as carbon) {{such that the}} metal ions gain electrons to become neutral atoms.|$|E

5|$|The intensities of the {{reflections}} observed in X-ray diffraction {{give us the}} magnitudes |F(q)| but not the phases φ(q). <b>To</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> phases, full sets of reflections are collected with known alterations to the scattering, either by modulating the wavelength past a certain absorption edge or by adding strongly scattering (i.e., electron-dense) metal atoms such as mercury.

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> desired oligonucleotide, the {{building}} blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15–25 bases in length.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions.

For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. <b>To</b> <b>obtain</b> <b>the</b> pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
