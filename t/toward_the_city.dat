5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks {{the lake to}} the east. The route {{gradually}} descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming. Once in Fleming, NY38 runs along the lakeshore and serves {{a long line of}} lakeside homes as it passes by a series of fields to the west. The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by way of a traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Auburn.|$|E
5|$|North of Ann Arbor, {{the freeway}} runs through {{woodlands}} and near several lakes. In {{the community of}} Whitmore Lake, US23 crosses into Livingston County near the city's namesake body of water. East of Brighton, the freeway intersects I-96 and continues north to an intersection with M-59 south of Hartland. The highway turns northeasterly by Runyon Lake and runs <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Fenton. The trunkline passes through town and bends back toward the northwest, running between lakes Ponemah and Fenton. Continuing north, the environment around US23 transitions to rural farm fields as the freeway approaches {{the south side of}} the Flint area.|$|E
5|$|The overlap {{comes to}} an end near the hamlet of Gee Brook, where NY41 splits from NY26 and veers northwestward into a rural valley {{surrounding}} a small stream that gives the hamlet of Gee Brook its name. NY41 crosses through the northeastern corner of the town of Freetown and the southern portion of the town of Solon {{on its way to the}} town of Cortlandville, where it intersects I-81 and US11 west of the village of McGraw. US11 and NY41 come together here and parallel I-81 westward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Cortland. Just east of the city line, I-81 veers north to avoid downtown Cortland while US11 and NY41 continue west across the Tioughnioga River and into the city.|$|E

5|$|The British commanders, Jeffery Amherst and James Abercromby {{drew up a}} plan {{to assault}} the French at Louisbourg, which {{is located on the}} Atlantic coast of Cape Breton Island, north of Halifax. The French {{garrison}} consisted of only 800 men, while the British force had 13,142 troops supported by 23 ships of the line and 13 frigates. On June 8, 1758, the attack on the fort began. Montgomery landed on the beach under heavy fire and ordered his troops to advance with fixed bayonets. The outer French defenses withdrew back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> Montgomery's unit {{and the rest of the}} British force chased the French back to a point just outside the Fort's guns. At this point, the British prepared to besiege the city. Due to bad weather, artillery and other materials needed for the siege took several weeks to arrive onshore. Montgomery had his men dig entrenchments and build breastworks, also ordering his men stay alert to the possibility of a French attack. On July 9, the French attempted a breakout, but it failed. On July 26, following a series of actions resulting in the destruction of most their fleet, the French surrendered. General Amherst was impressed by Montgomery's action during the siege, and promoted him to lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|The highway crosses into Kalkaska County at Barker Creek and {{continues}} eastward to Kalkaska. There, M-72 meets US131/M-66 (Cedar Street) {{on the north}} side of downtown, and M-72 turns south along Cedar Street and forms another triple concurrency through downtown. South of town, the highway crosses the Boardman River again, and M-72 turns east again headed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Grayling. M-66 follows M-72 to cross a set of railroad tracks that belong to the Great Lakes Central Railroad before leaving to follow its path to Lake City. M-72 crosses the Manistee River at the Kalkaska–Crawford county line and passes the northern shore of Lake Margrethe west of town in the Camp Grayling military reservation. North of the camp gate, M-72 joins M-93 into downtown Grayling. Together they meet James Street, which carries Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). M-93 turns north to follow BL I-75 out of town, and M-72 turns south to follow it through downtown. At South Down River Road, M-72 turns east again to leave Grayling, crossing I-75 in the process. There is no direct access to I-75 from M-72. Instead traffic is directed to follow BL I-75 in either direction to get to the freeway.|$|E
