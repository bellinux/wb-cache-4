5|$|When the {{initiating}} computer {{sends the}} complete instructions, or job, for processing to the controller, the controller splits the task up into <b>these</b> <b>small</b> instruction packets, known as tasks. The {{design of the}} Xgrid system consists of <b>these</b> <b>small</b> packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the results. The controller assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the initiating computer.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). <b>These</b> <b>small</b> crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
5|$|Most {{high-strength}} steel alloys (for example, 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Even in <b>these</b> <b>small</b> portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used {{each year in}} stainless steels, tool steels, cast irons, and high-temperature superalloys.|$|E

5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose of <b>these</b> <b>small</b> underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|The outer Solar System dwarf planet Haumea has two known moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka, {{named after}} Hawaiian goddesses. <b>These</b> <b>small</b> moons were {{discovered}} in 2005, from observations of Haumea made at the large telescopes of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Although many non-sessile {{bivalves}} {{use their}} muscular foot to move around, or to dig, {{members of the}} freshwater family Sphaeriidae are exceptional in that <b>these</b> <b>small</b> clams climb about quite nimbly on weeds using their long and flexible foot. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum), for example, climbs around on water weeds {{at the edges of}} lakes and ponds; this enables the clam to find the best position for filter feeding.|$|E

5|$|As rain {{continued}} to fall, the slightly acidic rainwater dissolved the limestone. As limestone wore away, the groundwater {{came into contact}} with the land surface and created a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, weathering of the limestone created slight valleys and plateaus in some areas. These plateaus rise and fall only a few inches, but on the subtle South Florida topography <b>these</b> <b>small</b> variations affect both the flow of water and the types of vegetation that can take hold.|$|E
5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a tail-piece. <b>These</b> <b>small</b> artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books of Emily Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in <b>these</b> <b>small</b> collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E

5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of <b>these</b> <b>small</b> landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of the VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Ronald Lockley (1903–2000), {{among many}} studies of birds in over fifty books, pioneered {{the science of}} bird migration. He made a twelve-year study of shearwaters such as the Manx shearwater, living on the remote island of Skokholm. <b>These</b> <b>small</b> seabirds make {{one of the longest}} migrations of any bird—10,000 kilometres—but return to the exact nesting burrow on Skokholm year after year. This {{behaviour}} led {{to the question of how}} they navigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the remiges (and alulae) of nestling hoatzins is much delayed compared to the {{development of}} these feathers in other young birds, presumably because young hoatzins are equipped with claws on their first two digits. They use <b>these</b> <b>small</b> rounded hooks to grasp branches when clambering about in trees, and feathering on these digits would presumably interfere with that functionality. Most youngsters shed their claws sometime between their 70th and 100th day of life, but some retain them— though callused-over and unusable— into adulthood.|$|E

5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae. Earlier still is Scelidosaurus, from Early Jurassic England, which lived about 190Mya. Interestingly, it possessed {{features}} of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus from Arizona was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. <b>These</b> <b>small,</b> lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{elements}} of the division—the 3rd/10th Baluch Regiment—crossed the Marano River on the eastern border {{on the night of}} the 17th, with the 1st/9th Gurkha Rifles moving through them to attack Points 343 and 366 near Faetano. <b>These</b> <b>small</b> hills—just behind the river—were held by two battalions of the 993rd Grenadier Regiment. The first—Point 343—was taken at 05:00, but the force occupying Point 366 had to fall back after running low on ammunition. Rifleman Sher Bahadur Thapa was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for holding the crest of the hill single-handed for two hours, allowing two companies to withdraw in safety, before being killed whilst trying to rescue another wounded Gurkha.|$|E
5|$|<b>These</b> <b>small</b> {{whales are}} also {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic whales and calves. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Whales lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. This however means less room around the breathing hole as the ice slowly closes the gap. When out at sea, whales dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas. Polar bear attacks on belugas and narwhals are usually successful in winter, but rarely inflict any damage in summer.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA interference. RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and <b>these</b> <b>small</b> RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein. RNA interference has {{an important role in}} defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences– viruses and transposons. It also influences development.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest do {{not form}} {{permanent}} pair bonds {{and during the}} mating season, or rut, the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. <b>These</b> <b>small</b> territories are about 3000 m2, with up to 300 territories per km2. The males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into season. The males use grunts and distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed {{at the end of}} the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness. This usually occurs between May and July, and birthing usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. Wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously.|$|E
5|$|With no aid {{possible}} from the shore, night fell on 14January {{with most of the}} crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and not one of <b>these</b> <b>small</b> craft survived the passage.|$|E
