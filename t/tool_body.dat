The transmitters generate a pattern of sound waves at varying operating frequencies into the down hole formation. The signal path leaves the transmitter, passes through the mud column, travels along the borehole wall and is collected at multiple receivers spaced out along the <b>tool</b> <b>body.</b> The {{time it takes for}} the sound wave to travel through the rock is dependent on a number of properties of the existing rock, including formation porosity, lithology, permeability and rock strength. Different types of pressure waves can be generated in specific axis, allowing geoscientists to determine anisotropic stress regimes.

5000|$|Typically, an MFL tool {{consists}} {{of two or more}} bodies. One body is the magnetizer with the magnets and sensors and the other bodies contain the electronics and batteries. The magnetizer body houses the sensors that are located between powerful [...] "rare-earth" [...] magnets. The magnets are mounted between the brushes and <b>tool</b> <b>body</b> to create a magnetic circuit along with the pipe wall. As the tool travels along the pipe, the sensors detect interruptions in the magnetic circuit. Interruptions are typically caused by metal loss and which in most cases is corrosion and the dimensions of the potential metal loss is denoted previously as [...] "feature." [...] Other features may be manufacturing defects and not actual corrosion. The feature indication or [...] "reading" [...] includes its length by width by depth as well as the o'clock position of the anomaly/feature. Mechanical damage such as shovel gouges can also be detected. The metal loss in a magnetic circuit is analogous to a rock in a stream. Magnetism needs metal to flow {{and in the absence of}} it, the flow of magnetism will go around, over or under to maintain its relative path from one magnet to another, similar to the flow of water around a rock in a stream. The sensors detect the changes in the magnetic field in the three directions (axial, radial, or circumferential) to characterize the anomaly. The sensors are typically oriented axially which limits data to axial conditions along the length of the pipeline. Other designs of smart pigs can address other directional data readings or have completely different functions than that of a standard MFL tool. Often times an operator will run a series of inspection tools to help verify or confirm MFL readings and visa versa. An MFL tool can take sensor readings based on either the distance the tool travels or on increments of time. The choice depends on many factors such as the length of the run, the speed that the tool intends to travel, and the number of stops or outages that the tool may experience.|$|E

5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in all sizes and in several styles, depending on the application. ¼" [...] drive wrenches are commonly available in both inline (the user holds the tool like a screwdriver, with the output on the end) and pistol grip (the user holds a handle which is {{at right angles to}} the output) forms, and less commonly in an angle drive, which is similar to an inline tool but with a set of bevel gears to rotate the output 90°. ⅜" [...] impacts are most commonly available in pistol grip form and a special inline form known as a [...] "butterfly" [...] wrench, which has a large, flat throttle paddle {{on the side of the}} tool which may be tilted to one side or the other to control the direction of rotation, rather than using a separate reversing control, and shaped to allow access into tight areas. Regular inline and angle ⅜" [...] drive impact wrenches are uncommon, but available. ½" [...] drive units are virtually only available in pistol grip form, with any inline type being virtually impossible to obtain, due to the increased torque transmitted back to the user and the greater weight of the tool requiring the larger handle. ¾" [...] drive impact wrenches are again essentially only available in pistol grip form. 1" [...] drive tools {{are available in}} both pistol grip and [...] "D handle" [...] inline, where the back of the tool has an enclosed handle for the user to hold. Both forms often also incorporate a side handle, allowing both hands to hold the tool at once. 1¼" [...] and larger wrenches are usually available in [...] "T handle" [...] form, with two large handles on either side of the <b>tool</b> <b>body,</b> allowing for maximum torque to be applied to the user, and giving the best control of the tool. Very large impact wrenches (up to several hundred thousand foot-pounds of torque) usually incorporate eyelets in their design, allowing them to be suspended from a crane, lift, or other device, since their weight is often more than a person can move. A recent design combines an impact wrench and an air ratchet, often called a [...] "reactionless air ratchet" [...] by the manufacturers, incorporating an impact assembly before the ratchet assembly. Such a design allows very high output torques with minimal effort on the operator, and prevents the common injury of slamming one's knuckles into some part of the equipment when the fastener tightens down and the torque suddenly increases. Specialty designs are available for certain applications, such as removing crankshaft pulleys without removing the radiator in a vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Our {{premise is}} that actions of {{manipulation}} are represented at multiple levels of abstraction. At the high level a grammatical structure represents symbolic information (objects, actions, <b>tools,</b> <b>body</b> parts) and their interaction in a temporal sequence, and at lower levels the symbolic quantities are grounded in perception. In this paper we create symbolic high-level representations {{in the form of}} manipulation action tree banks, which are parsed from annotated action corpora. A context free grammar provides the grammatical description for the creation of the semantic trees. Experiments conducted on the tree banks show that they allow to 1) generate so-called visual semantic graphs (VSGs), 2) compare the semantic dis-tance between steps of activities and 3) discover the underlying semantic space of an activity. We believe that tree banks are an effective and practical way to organize semantic structures of manipulation actions for humanoids applications. They could be used as basis for 1) automatic manipulation action understanding and execution and 2) reasoning and prediction during both observation and execution.
