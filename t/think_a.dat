5|$|Although some {{scholars}} mention {{a possibility of}} future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most <b>think</b> <b>a</b> more likely outcome is that English will continue {{to function as a}} koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world. English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world. Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.|$|E
5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of people felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

Of the experience she said, I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of females struggle with the way they look, and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's {{a big deal to}} be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E

5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>a</b> {{strong case}} can be made that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not <b>think</b> <b>a</b> noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' newfound {{credentials}} and financial security {{gave him the}} opportunity to travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York he met with Karl Germer, the head of the O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Ma√±ana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker Than You <b>Think,</b> <b>a</b> novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery Rocket to the Morgue (1942).|$|E

He also expressed certainty in victory and described meeting with people who had been injured in the violence. Meanwhile, a truck carrying 60,000 copies of The Zimbabwean newspaper into Zimbabwe from South Africa was hijacked and burned, destroying the newspapers on board.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} voting in the United States. Even though most {{people say that}} voting is important, and a good {{practice}} for them to do, every year a sub-optimal percentage of Americans turn up to vote, especially in presidential elections (only 51% in the 2000 election). One vote may feel very small {{in a group of}} millions, so people may not <b>think</b> <b>a</b> vote is worth the time and effort. If too many people think this way, there is a small percentage of voter turnout. Some countries enforce compulsory voting to reduce this effect.|$|E

25|$|Of course these {{movements}} exercised tremendous {{pressure on the}} British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses.... Non-cooperation dragged {{them out of the}} mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance.... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to <b>think</b> <b>a</b> little in terms of India as a whole.... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.|$|E
25|$|Section 3 bars Congress from {{changing}} or modifying Federal law on treason {{by simple}} majority statute. Treason is also defined in this section. It's not enough merely to <b>think</b> <b>a</b> treasonous thought, {{there must be}} an overt act of making war or materially helping those at war with the United States. Accusations must be corroborated by at least two witnesses. Congress is a political body and political disagreements routinely encountered should never be considered as treason. This allows for nonviolent resistance to the government because opposition is not a life or death proposition. However, Congress does provide for other less subversive crimes and punishments such as conspiracy.|$|E
25|$|Anxious that Napoleon might {{suddenly}} show up, Schwarzenberg ordered Wittgenstein and Wrede {{to attack}} the city at once. G√©rard held out on the east bank of the Seine until 11:00 am when he withdrew into Troyes. The Allies fought {{their way into the}} suburbs but were stopped at the city walls. They brought up howitzers and began shelling Troyes. During a lull in the bombardment the French garrison slipped out and joined MacDonald's retreating army. Oudinot did not <b>think</b> <b>a</b> strong rearguard was needed in La Chapelle-Saint-Luc. Consequently, the Bavarian cavalry suddenly appeared behind Kellermann's cavalry, throwing it into panic. Luckily for the French, when VI Cavalry Corps stampeded their infantry held steady, but 400 prisoners were swept up by the Allies.|$|E
