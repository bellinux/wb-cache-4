60|$|The water {{cuts the}} {{alluvial}} {{banks of the}} 'lower' river into deep horseshoe curves; so deep, indeed, that in some places {{if you were to}} get ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and walk across the neck, half or three quarters of a mile, you could sit down and rest a couple of hours while your steamer was coming around the long elbow, at a speed of ten miles an hour, to take you aboard again. When the river is rising fast, some scoundrel whose plantation is back in the country, and therefore of inferior value, has only to watch his chance, cut a little gutter across the narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the water into it, and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has happened: to wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession of that little ditch, and placed the countryman's plantation on its bank (quadrupling its value), and that other party's formerly valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on a big island; the old watercourse around it will soon shoal up, boats cannot approach within ten miles of it, and down goes its value to a fourth of its former worth. Watches are kept on those narrow necks, at needful times, and if a man happens to be caught cutting a ditch across them, the chances are all against his ever having another opportunity <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1611, Sir Thomas Dale, {{according}} to a method he had learned while campaigning in Holland, <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> across <b>a</b> portion of land behind town connecting {{two parts of the}} James River. It became known as [...] "Dale's Dutch Gap". It was a way to protect the rear of the town from possible attack and shorten the distance upriver. This length of the James River had broad, meandering stretches between Drewry's Bluff, where the river turns east into the coastal plain, and the confluence of the Appomattox River with the James below Bermuda Hundred.|$|R

5000|$|Originally Morse {{decided to}} lay the wire underground, and asked Ezra Cornell {{to lay the}} line using a special cable-laying plow that Cornell developed. Wire began to be laid in Baltimore on October 21, 1843. Cornell's plow was pulled by eight mules, and <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> two inches wide and twenty inches deep, laid a pipe with the wires, and reburied the pipe, in an {{integrated}} operation. [...] But the project was stopped after 15 km of wire was laid because the line was failing. Morse learned that Cooke and Wheatstone in England were now using poles for their lines, {{and he decided to}} follow that lead.|$|R

[14] [...] "Duhamel, {{botanist}} of {{the last}} century, tells us that, wishing to preserve a field of good land from the roots of an avenue of elms which were exhausting it, he <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>ditch</b> between the field and avenue to intercept the roots. But he saw with surprise those of the roots which had not been cut, go down behind {{the slope of the}} ditch to keep out of the light, go under the ditch, and into the field again."
