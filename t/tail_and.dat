40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} current state of {{knowledge}} about cometary plasma (type I) <b>tails</b> <b>and</b> ionospheres. Observational statistics for type I tails are examined along with spectroscopic observations of plasma tails, identified ion species in such <b>tails,</b> <b>and</b> the morphology of cometary plasma <b>tails</b> <b>and</b> ionospheres. Evidence for a strong interaction between comets and the solar wind is evaluated on the basis of observations of plasma-tail orientations, large accelerations of <b>tail</b> structures, <b>and</b> correlations between disturbances in type I <b>tails</b> <b>and</b> solar-wind or geomagnetic disturbances. The use of comets as solar-wind probes is discussed, the nature of comet-solar-wind interactions is investigated, and ionization sources for cometary gases are considered. Hydrodynamic models of comet-solar-wind interaction are summarized, and the structure and ion chemistry of cometary ionospheres are studied. Observations suggesting that significant magnetic fields are associated with comets are briefly reviewed and interpreted...|$|R
5|$|Both {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts. Although the lesser striped swallow has white underparts with dark streaking, it is larger, has a deeply forked <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> a very different plumage, with dark blue upperparts, a red rump and a chestnut head.|$|E
5|$|C. f. funereus, the {{nominate}} form, {{is known}} as the eastern yellow-tailed black cockatoo. It is found from Berserker Range in central Queensland, south through New South Wales, and into eastern Victoria. It is distinguished by its overall larger size, longer <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> wings, and larger bill and claws.|$|E
5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized skin from the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, though there is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily {{identifiable}} dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and <b>tail,</b> <b>and</b> four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{examination}} of the fossil on March 6, 1999 it had already become clear to Currie that {{the left and right}} feet mirrored each other perfectly and that the fossil had been completed by using both slab and counterslab. He also noticed no connection could be seen between the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> the body. In July 1999, Currie and the Czerkases brought the fossil to the High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility of the University of Texas (Austin) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make CT scans. Rowe, having made the scans on July 29, determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments, showing the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> the lower legs, were not part of the larger fossil. He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that there was a chance of the whole being a fraud. During a subsequent discussion Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private.|$|E
5|$|Early species had long, fully toothed {{jaws and}} long tails, while later forms had a highly reduced <b>tail,</b> <b>and</b> some lacked teeth.
