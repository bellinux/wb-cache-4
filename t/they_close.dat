5|$|The steel casket {{containing}} the gold is traced {{by the police}} allowing them to track down Diabolik's hideout. <b>They</b> <b>close</b> in on Diabolik, who is melting the gold and turning it into ingots. Because the police are shooting at him, Diabolik is unable to control the heating of the gold, and the whole cavern ends up being covered in molten gold. Again, Diabolik {{is believed to be}} dead, with his heat-proof suit now covered in solidified gold. The police seal off the cavern intending to recover the gold later. Eva is allowed to pay her respects to Diabolik, who winks at her.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{strategic}} threat changed dramatically during the period that Zeus was being developed. Originally expected to face only a few dozen ICBMs, a nationwide defense was feasible, although expensive. In 1957, growing fears of a Soviet sneak attack led it to be repositioned {{as a way to}} protect Strategic Air Command's bomber bases, ensuring a retaliatory strike force would survive. But when the Soviets claimed to be building hundreds of missiles, the US faced the problem of building enough Zeus missiles to match them. The Air Force suggested <b>they</b> <b>close</b> this missile gap by building more ICBMs of their own instead. Adding to the debate, a number of technical problems emerged that suggested Zeus would have little capability against any sort of sophisticated attack.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Donna, {{neither one}} {{aware of the}} other's involvement, both {{investigate}} Adipose Industries, which is marketing a special diet pill {{to the people of}} London. They find that the pill's slogan, The Fat Just Walks Away, is literal. The pills use latent body fat to parthenogenetically create small white aliens called Adipose that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until <b>they</b> <b>close,</b> the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic screwdriver to create a diversion and escape.|$|E

25|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that underwater noise pollution can affect oysters as <b>they</b> <b>close</b> their shells when exposed to low frequencies of sounds in experimental conditions. Oysters rely on hearing waves and currents to regulate their circadian rhythms, and perception of weather events—such as rain—may induce spawning. Cargo ships, pile drivers, and explosions conducted underwater produce low frequencies that may be detected by oysters.|$|E

25|$|Telescopic rods {{are popular}} among surf fishermen. Carrying around a 12 or 14ft surf fishing rod, even in two pieces, is cumbersome. The shorter the {{sections}} the shorter <b>they</b> <b>close,</b> the more eyes they have, {{and the better}} the power curve is in them. More eyes means better weight and stress distribution throughout the parabolic arc. This translates to further casting, stronger fish fighting abilities, and less breaking of the rod.|$|E
25|$|Rotating-sector gates. Some {{of these}} work very like {{traditional}} swinging gates, but with each gate {{in the form}} of a sector of a cylinder. <b>They</b> <b>close</b> by rotating out from the lock wall and meeting in the centre of the chamber. Water is let in or out by opening the gates slightly: there are no paddles or other lock gear. The lock at Limehouse Basin, which gives access to the River Thames, is an example. A dramatically large one can be seen at the Maeslantkering (huge flood gates) near Rotterdam. There is a different type at the sea lock on the Ribble Link: this is a rising sector gate, which has a horizontal axis: the gate drops to the bed of the river to allow boats to pass.|$|E
500|$|The {{papillary}} muscles {{extend from}} {{the walls of the}} heart to valves by cartilaginous connections called chordae tendinae. These muscles prevent the valves from falling too far back when <b>they</b> <b>close.</b> During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. This creates tension on the chordae tendineae, helping to hold the cusps of the atrioventricular valves in place and preventing them from being blown back into the atria.|$|E

500|$|Large ground-dwelling beetles such as Carabidae, the {{rhinoceros}} beetle and the longhorn beetles {{defend themselves}} using strong mandibles, or heavily sclerotised (armored) spines or horns to deter or fight off predators. Many species of weevil that feed {{out in the}} open on leaves of plants react to attack by employing a drop-off reflex. Some combine it with thanatosis, in which <b>they</b> <b>close</b> up their appendages and [...] "play dead". The click beetles (Elateridae) can suddenly catapult themselves out of danger by releasing the energy stored by a click mechanism, which consists of a stout spine on the prosternum and a matching groove in the mesosternum.|$|E
500|$|Wellek and Warren– disapproving of {{contemporary}} histories of literature– opine that {{a history of}} literature is possible and {{should be based on}} elements intrinsic to works. Such a history should describe the development of [...] "he process of interpretation, criticism, and appreciation" [...] or trace the development of works in small and large groups before tying it to universal literature. This [...] "historical evolution" [...] of related yet individual events they tie to [...] "variable schemes of values" [...] which must be [...] "abstracted from history itself." [...] They suggest numerous ways in which this can be accomplished, including identifying the development of values, traits, forms, themes, and motifs. Periodization, they write, should not be based on chronological boundaries, but a [...] "time section dominated by a system of literary norms, standards, and conventions, whose introduction, spread, diversification, integration, and disappearance can be traced" [...] which must be extracted from history, with boundaries marked by both internal and external changes. <b>They</b> <b>close</b> the chapter by stating that existing methods are [...] "clumsy" [...] and that a new ideal and methods of literary history is necessary.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Will Be" [...] {{was shot in}} New York City on 18 December 2008, and {{features}} Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford {{as one of the}} characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that [...] "Chace went to London a couple months ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [...] hit it off and talk {{every once in a while}} and have become fast friends. A couple weeks ago Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes." [...] In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as <b>they</b> <b>close</b> in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Homosexuality is {{addressed}} in Catholic moral theology under two forms: homosexual orientation {{is considered an}} [...] "objective disorder" [...] because Catholicism views it as being [...] "ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil", but not sinful unless acted upon. Homosexual sexual activity, by contrast, {{is viewed as a}} [...] "moral disorder" [...] and [...] "homosexual acts" [...] are viewed as [...] "contrary to the natural law. <b>They</b> <b>close</b> the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{process begins}} with prayer. A {{statement}} {{of the problem is}} made, and the transgression discussed. Family members are expected to work problems through and cooperate, not [...] "hold fast to the fault". One or more periods of silence may be taken for reflection on the entanglement of emotions and injuries. Everyone's feelings are acknowledged. Then confession, repentance and forgiveness take place. Everyone releases (kala) each other, letting go. They cut off the past (oki), and together <b>they</b> <b>close</b> the event with a ceremonial feast, called pani, which often included eating limu kala or kala seaweed, symbolic of the release.|$|E

2500|$|If prey {{concentrations}} reach {{very high}} levels, the herrings adopt a method called [...] "ram feeding". They swim with their mouth {{wide open and}} their opercula fully expanded. Every several feet, <b>they</b> <b>close</b> and clean their gill rakers for a few milliseconds (filter feeding). In the photo on the right, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. The fish all open their mouths and opercula wide {{at the same time}} (the red gills are visible—click to enlarge).

2500|$|A {{group of}} mostly desert plants called [...] "CAM" [...] plants (Crassulacean acid metabolism, after the family Crassulaceae, which {{includes}} the species in which the CAM process was first discovered) open their stomata at night (when water evaporates more slowly from leaves for a given degree of stomatal opening), use PEPcarboxylase to fix carbon dioxide and store the products in large vacuoles. The following day, <b>they</b> <b>close</b> their stomata and release the carbon dioxide fixed the previous night into the presence of RuBisCO. This saturates RuBisCO with carbon dioxide, allowing minimal photorespiration. This approach, however, is severely limited by the capacity to store fixed carbon in the vacuoles, so it is preferable only when water is severely limiting.|$|E
