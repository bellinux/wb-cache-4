They classify the types of criticisms leveled at Lomborg and his arguments, and proceed to evaluate each of the reasons given for disqualifying Lomborg. They conclude that a court should accept Lomborg as a credible expert in the field of statistics, and that his testimony was appropriately restricted to his area of expertise. Of course, Professor Shoenbrod and Wilson note, Mr. Lomborg's factual conclusions may not be correct, nor his policy proposals effective, but his criticisms should be addressed, not merely dismissed out of hand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper gives performance-based {{results for}} the {{application}} of a leading recognition algorithm applied to standardized iris imagery.

This is required for federated applications in which iris data is exchanged between interoperating systems, passed across bandwidth-limited networks, or stored on identity credentials. The study gave quantitative support to the revision of the ISO/IEC 19794 - 6 standard. This paper shows the effect of compres-sion on false non-match rate and also, notably on false match rate also.

500|$|Analysis of Washington {{has focused}} on the {{decision}} in the broader context of procedural trial rights. A 2007 article in the Georgetown Law Review by Martin Hewett was critical of the decision. Hewett's main criticism was based on the Court's lack of a standard on which <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> certain evidence was [...] "material" [...] to a defendant's case. Hewett noted that in a post-Washington decision in 1973, the Court applied a [...] "case-specific" [...] decision rather than a [...] "general constitutional standard". This line of decisions, Hewett argued, led to a standard which allows a trial judge the authority to determine the [...] "actual reliability of the evidence" [...] in cases where a witness is not present. The [...] "newly-seized power" [...] was limited to the cases at hand in a manner which suggested the ambiguous calculus the Court was using was flawed. This vagueness in the standard came from cases where the [...] "situations [...] the reliability of the excluded evidence [...] could factfinder". Hewett concluded by arguing that all of these cases had diminished the protections of the jury and of the defendant's right to have his own defense.|$|E
500|$|Following the season, McGary, who {{had slipped}} from a {{projected}} 2013 first round selection to a projected 2014 second round selection, {{stated that he}} had <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> <b>whether</b> he was mentally and physically ready to pursue a professional career. McGary and teammates Robinson and Stauskas all submitted evaluation requests to the NBA Undergraduate Advisory Committee which must respond by April 14, giving the players until April 27 to make themselves eligible for the draft if they so choose. Many in the press felt he should return to [...] "rebuild his draft stock". Upon learning that he had tested positive for marijuana following the Sweet Sixteen victory over Tennessee and was facing a one-year suspension, McGary declared for the draft, following teammates Stauskas and Robinson who had declared ten days earlier. Of Michigan's prior 14 early NBA draft entrants, 10 were selected {{in the first round}} and 3 in the second. McGary was tested 18 days before the NCAA decided to reduce the automatic punishment for marijuana use to a half a season and his appeal for lenience was unsuccessful. During his two years with Michigan, the school enjoyed its winningest two-year stretch in school history marked by a total of 59 wins. McGary signed with sports agent Mark Bartelstein (along with teammate Stauskas). Bartelstein is the father of former Michigan teammate Josh Bartelstein, and agent for former teammate Tim Hardaway, Jr. Due to his continuing rehabilitation for his back, it was unclear whether McGary would attend the NBA Draft Combine. McGary and Bartlestein decided that McGary should not participate in combines at less than 100%.|$|E
