5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the right during the course correction.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Infantry Division did {{not meet}} all their D-Day {{objectives}} at Utah, partly because they had arrived <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the south, but they landed 21,000 troops {{at the cost of}} only 197 casualties. Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14,000 men, with 2,500 casualties. Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and LCTs and other vessels sunk by the enemy. German losses are unknown.|$|E

If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E

5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting spending on rail by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that spending on rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail has gone <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, Monarch {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. Following the outbreak of World War I in August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. On 8 August, Monarch was conducting gunnery practice south-east of Fair Isle when she was unsuccessfully attacked by a submarine-fired torpedo. This was probably a false alarm as the area was <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the west of the German U-boats' patrol zones to be likely. , however, has been suggested as a candidate for the attack, although the boat was sunk the following day with the loss of all hands and the truth will never be known.|$|E
5|$|The British {{commander}} at the Cape of Good Hope, Albemarle Bertie, {{had also}} been planning an operation in the Indian Ocean during 1809 and assembled a squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley with orders to blockade the French islands, probe their defences and capture them if practical. Rowley found that his small squadron was unable to engage the French frigates and that the nearest British military base, Madras in British India, was much <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> be practical for staging amphibious operations. To remedy the latter problem, Rowley seized the small French island of Rodriguez with a force of British and Indian soldiers and garrisoned it as a supply base for his ships and as a military reserve to use in landings on the French islands. The first such operation was the Raid on Saint Paul in September 1809, in which the town of Saint Paul was captured, Caroline and her prizes seized and Île Bourbon's commander Nicolas Des Bruslys driven to suicide.|$|E

5|$|The French {{attacked}} at 14:15, Minerve {{approaching the}} British line and opening {{fire on the}} central ship Ceylon. In the intervening time, the British battleline had become disorganised, with Astell <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the rear to properly support the other ships. With the British line wavering, Minerve and Victor closed with the convoy and began to exchange fire with the three merchant ships in a general action, during which Robert Hay, captain of Astell was seriously wounded. At 16:00, Bouvet in Minerve pulled ahead of the struggling convoy and turned as if to ram and board Windham. Hoping to use the soldiers aboard to drive off the French ship, Captain Stewart turned to meet her. The damage done to Windham was however so severe that {{she was unable to}} make the turn correctly and Minerve passed just ahead of her, raking Windham and causing severe damage, the soldiers on Windham responding with musket fire.|$|E
5|$|The first ironclads {{to enter}} {{service in the}} Regia Marina of the newly-unified Kingdom of Italy, Formidabile and Terribile served as {{the core of the}} fleet that was later fleshed out by the , , and es that would see action during the Third Italian War of Independence against the Austrian Navy. The war broke out in June 1866, as Italy, which had allied with Prussia, sought to take {{advantage}} of the Austro-Prussian War to seize Austrian-controlled Venice. After initially remaining in port, the Italian fleet under Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano launched an attack on the island of Lissa in mid-July; the Austrian fleet under Rear Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff sortied to mount a counterattack, which resulted in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidable, which had been badly damaged during an engagement with Austrian coastal fortifications on Lissa the day before, had withdrawn by the time Tegetthoff arrived and took no part in the battle. Terribile also played no role in the action, as she had been stationed <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the south in preparation for another attack on the island, and she arrived on the scene of the battle only after the two fleets had disengaged.|$|E
5|$|Word of Lamellerie's {{preparations}} reached Collingwood, and {{he planned}} a ruse {{to lure the}} French frigate squadron out into open water. Withdrawing all the large vessels of the blockade squadron, Collingwood kept only the 36-gun frigate HMS Hydra and the 18-gun sloop HMS Moselle in position to create {{the impression that the}} principal blockading force had been driven off. This it was hoped would draw Lamellerie into an attack on the lone ships that would allow the rest of Collingwood's squadron, hidden just beyond the horizon, to counterattack and annihilate the French squadron. However, on 23 February a strong westerly wind blew up and the main squadron, Hydra and Moselle were all blown <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the east. This was spotted by lookouts on shore and Lamellerie took the opportunity to leave port on 26 February, while the British ships were still out of position.|$|E

5|$|With the Australian and Viet Cong {{positions}} now {{too close}} to each other, O'Halloran could neither move forward nor withdraw. Artillery began to fire {{in support of the}} Australians, however it initially fell <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>to</b> the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 Platoon was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs to come forward to provide assistance, while the platoon sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 Platoon forward to reinforce 5 Platoon, and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he {{was in a position to}} extract his platoon. Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just to the right of the 5 Platoon headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 Platoon. Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire. Shortly afterwards an RPG round hit the same area, wounding McCullough.|$|E

25|$|The first {{expedition}} {{took place}} in 1836–37 and was privately funded by American Fur and the Choteaus. Nicollet departed Fort Snelling by canoe on July 29, 1836, accompanied by Chagobay, an Ojibwe chief, his nine-year-old son, and a half-French guide named Brunia. Nicollet explored the Mississippi to its source of Lake Itasca and the nearby Mississippi tributary, the St. Croix River.
