The loading level of power system is a key aspect to de-termine the amount of the damage caused by cascading failures.

This paper investigates the impact of the topology of a power grid on phase transi-tions in its robustness. Three spectral graph metrics are considered: spectral radius, effective graph resistance and algebraic connectivity. Experimental results from a model of cascading failures in power grids on the IEEE power systems demon-strate the applicability of these metrics to design/optimise a power grid topology for an enhanced phase transition behaviour of the system. ...|$|R

The economic cost of such failures is in the order <b>of</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>billion</b> dollars annually. In a power network, the cascading failure phenomenon is related to both topological properties (number and types of buses, density of transmission lines and interconnection of components) and flow dynamics (load distribution and loading level). Existing studies most often focus on network topology, and not on flow dynamics. This paper proposes a new metric to assess power network robustness with respect to cascading failures, in particular for cascading effects due to line overloads and caused by targeted attacks. The metric takes both the effect of topological features {{and the effect of}} flow dynamics on network robustness into account, using an entropy-based approach. Experimental verification shows that the proposed robustness metric quantifies a power grid robustness with respect to cascading failures. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R
