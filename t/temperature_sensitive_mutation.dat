5000|$|The colorpoint {{pattern is}} most {{commonly}} associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter {{version of the same}} color {{on the rest of the}} body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal points (dark brown), chocolate points (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>mutation</b> in one of the enzymes in the metabolic pathway from tyrosine to pigment, such as melanin; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.|$|E

Furthermore, measurement of the membrane potential has shown it to be sufficient to support the export of CoxII from the matrix. Rather, we found that newly synthesized pCoxII accumulates in the matrix of the pet ts 1402 mitochondria, because export across the inner membrane is inhibited in the pet ts 1402 mitochondria.

Extragenic suppressors of <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in pleC, a pleiotropic gene required for cell motility, formation of polar φCbK bacteriophage receptors, and stalk formation, were isolated. These suppressors, which restored motility at 37 °, simultaneously conferred a cold sensitive cell division phenotype and they were mapped to the three new cell division genes divJ, divL and divK. The cold-sensitive mutations in divL, {{and to a lesser extent}} divJ, exhibited a relatively narrow range of suppression. The cold-sensitive cell division mutation in divK, by contrast, suppressed all pleC mutations examined and behaved as a classical bypass suppressor. The direct role of this cell division gene in the regulation of motility is suggested by the observation that divK 341 mapped to the same locus as pleD 301, a pleiotropic mutation that prevents loss of motility and stalk formation. These results provide strong evidence that the cell division and developmental pathways are interconnected and they support our earlier conclusion that cell division is required for the regulation of polar morphogenesis and differentiation in C. crescentus...|$|R

We have also transfected wild type wg alleles into Drosophila tissue culture cells, which then display wg protein on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix.

The chromosomal binding sites of these two proteins were compared with those of zeste protein and two other Polycomb group proteins, Polycomb and polyhomeotic.

In parallel, the former were not degraded and the L 166 P mutant was directly degraded in vitro by proteasome-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage.

XX;tra- 2 ts mutant animals were raised at the permissive temperature so that they developed as females and were then shifted to the restrictive male-determining temperature either 1 - 2 days before or 0 - 2 h after eclosion. These animals formed vitellogenic ovaries. Likewise, mutant gonads transplanted into either normal female hosts or normal male hosts, kept at the restrictive temperature, underwent vitellogenesis. Thus, the ovarian follicle cells can mature and express their YP genes {{in the absence of}} a functional product of the tra- 2 gene. Although the gonadal somatic cells of ovary and testis may derive from the same progenitor cells, the testicular cells of XX;tra- 2 ts pseudomales did not express their YP genes nor take up YP from the haemolymph at the permissive female-determining temperature. We conclude that in the somatic cells of the gonad, the YP genes are no longer under direct control of the sex-determining genes, but instead are regulated by tissue specific factors present in the follicle cells.

40|$|NIMA is a {{cell cycle}} {{regulated}} protein kinase required, {{in addition to}} p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B, for initiation of mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans. Like cyclin B, NIMA accumulates when cells are arrested in G 2 and is degraded as cells traverse mitosis. However, it is stable in cells arrested in mitosis. NIMA, and related kinases, have an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal extension. Deletion of the C-terminus does not completely inactivate NIMA kinase activity but does prevent functional complementation of a <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>mutation</b> of nimA, showing it to be essential for function. Partial C-terminal deletion of NIMA generates a highly toxic kinase although the kinase domain alone is not toxic. Transient induction experiments demonstrate that the partially truncated NIMA is far more stable than the full length NIMA protein which likely accounts for its toxicity. Unlike full length NIMA, the truncated NIMA is not degraded during mitosis and this affects normal mitotic progression. Cells arrested in mitosis with non-degradable NIMA are able to destroy cyclin B, demonstrating that the arrest is not due to stabilization of p 34 cdc 2 /cyclin B activity. The data establish that NIMA degradation during mitosis is required for correct mitotic progression in A. nidulans...|$|E

Surprisingly, the steady-state level of Rb protein in these immortal cells was drastically decreased.

Mlc 1 p is also found at the incipient bud site in G 1 and the growing bud tip during S and G 2 phases of the cell cycle. A dominant negative GST-Mlc 1 p fusion protein specifically blocks cytokinesis and prevents Iqg 1 p localisation to the bud neck, as does depletion of Mlc 1 p.

Mlc 1 p is also shown {{to interact with the}} class II conventional myosin (Myo 1 p). All three proteins form a complex, however, the interaction between Mlc 1 p and Iqg 1 p can be separated from the Mlc 1 p/Myo 1 p interaction.

RF DNA replicated at normal rates in revertants of these dna temperature-sensitive host cells. The simplest interpretation of these observations is that none of the dna gene products tested is essential for the {{synthesis of}} the complementary DNA strand on the infecting single-stranded G 4 DNA, whereas the dnaB, dnaC, dnaE, (DNA polymerase III), and dnaG gene products are all essential for replication of the double-stranded G 4 RF DNA. The alternate possibility that {{one or more of the}} gene products are actually essential for G 4 parental RF synthesis, even though this synthesis is not defective in the mutant hosts, is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecombinant adenoviruses {{are being}} {{developed}} for gene therapy of inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis because they efficiently transduce recombinant genes into nondividing cellsin vivo. First generation recombinant adenoviruses, rendered defective by deletion of sequences spanning E 1 a and E 1 b, express low levels of early and late viral genes that activate destructive cellular immune responses. Current strategies for improving recombinant adenoviruses attempt to inactivate other essential genes through deletion and growth in new packaging cell lines or incorporation of <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> which allow propagation of the virus in available packaging cell lines at permissive temperatures. We describe in this report {{a new type of}} recombinant adenovirus that is deleted of all viral open reading frames. This recombinant (called ΔrAd), which contains only the essentialciselements (i. e., ITRs and contiguous packaging sequence), is propagated in 293 cells in the presence of E 1 -deleted helper virus. Concatamers of the monomeric vector genome were passaged and capable of transduction. The ΔrAd genome is packaged into virions that sediment at a lower density than the helper virus in cesium gradients forming the basis for a purification protocol. A fully deleted recombinant adenovirus that expresses human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was produced and used to transduce human airway epithelial cells derived from a cystic fibrosis patient. Packaging and propagation of a fully deleted adenovirus is an important step toward the development of a safer vector. Improved production and purification strategies need to be developed before this new vector system can be evaluatedin vivo...|$|R
40|$|The Vps 1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an 80 -kD GTPase {{associated}} with the Golgi apparatus. Vps 1 p appears to play a direct role in the retention of late Golgi membrane proteins, which are mislocalized to the vacuolar membrane in its absence. The pathway by which late Golgi and vacuolar membrane proteins reach the vacuole in vps 1 delta mutants was investigated by analyzing transport of these proteins in vps 1 delta cells that also contained <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>mutations</b> in either the SEC 4 or END 4 genes, which are required for a late step in secretion and the internalization step of endocytosis, respectively. Not only was vacuolar transport of a Golgi membrane protein blocked in the vps 1 delta sec 4 -ts and vps 1 delta end 4 -ts double mutant cells at the non-permissive temperature but vacuolar delivery of the vacuolar membrane protein, alkaline phosphatase was also blocked in these cells. Moreover, both proteins expressed in the vps 1 delta end 4 - ts cells at the elevated temperature could be detected on the plasma membrane by a protease digestion assay indicating that these proteins are transported to the vacuole via the plasma membrane in vps 1 mutant cells. These data strongly suggest that a loss of Vps 1 p function causes all membrane traffic departing from the late Golgi normally destined for the prevacuolar compartment to instead be diverted to the plasma membrane. We propose a model in which Vps 1 p is required for formation of vesicles from the late Golgi apparatus that carry vacuolar and Golgi membrane proteins bound for the prevacuolar compartment...|$|R
40|$|The {{mutation}} drpA 1 {{defines a}} new gene in Escherichia coli K- 12 that maps at about 5. 2 min. This mutation was obtained after enriching {{a population of}} cells for <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitive</b> dna <b>mutations</b> with the [3 H]thymidine "suicide" technique followed by screening for mutants defective in transposon Tn 5 precise excision. When growing cells carrying the drpA 1 allele were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, we showed that DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses shut off quickly, with the cessation of RNA synthesis occurring first. A recombinant plasmid between pBR 322 and an HindIII fragment from wild-type E. coli restores the growth defect in drpA 1 mutants. Using transposon Tn 5 mutagenesis of this plasmid, {{we have been able}} to correlate the presence of a 68 -kilodalton protein, as observed with the maxicell technique, with the ability of this plasmid to restore growth to drpA 1 mutants...|$|R
