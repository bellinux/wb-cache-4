5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that <b>two</b> <b>courses</b> attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any <b>two</b> <b>courses</b> that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

5|$|A {{score of}} veteran {{officers}} became teachers at his military school. Luna devised <b>two</b> <b>courses</b> of instruction, planned the reorganization, with {{a battalion of}} tiradores and a cavalry squadron, set up an inventory of guns and ammunition, arsenals, using convents and town halls, quartermasters, lookouts and communication systems. He built trenches {{with the help of}} his chief engineer, General Jose Alejandrino, and had his brother Juan design the school's uniforms (the Filipino rayadillo). He also insisted on strict discipline over and above clan armies and regional loyalties, which prevented coordination between various military units. Envisioning one united army for the Republic, clan armies and regional loyalties presented a lack of national consciousness. It was also a condition that the Spanish utilized to keep the native contingent of their armed forces within check. Soldiers of one region were used to fight revolts in other regions.|$|E
5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff of the first <b>two</b> <b>courses</b> held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted {{to the rank of}} squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation. On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and soon had them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the University of Leicester Archaeological Services {{decided to}} {{excavate}} the presumed {{location of the}} abbey's kitchens, to clarify the layout of that area of the abbey. These first excavations located both {{the north and south}} walls and a 15th–16th-century brick oven, confirming that it was indeed the kitchens. The area excavated was enlarged in 2003, with the south-west corner of the building and a second oven uncovered: this corner had not been entirely robbed of stone, with <b>two</b> <b>courses</b> of sandstone remaining. The second oven was found to contain charcoal, fragments of wheat and barley, fish-bones and hazelnuts. A drain identified in the 1930s excavation was also located, and found to contain small bones, fish-scales, and the bones of rats who had formerly lived in the drain.|$|E

5|$|Klein ISD offers {{four main}} foreign {{language}} courses: French, Spanish, German, and Latin. All {{four of these}} language courses are taught with curriculum approved by the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) and supplemented with textbooks for each course. German and Latin have four years of instruction total - starting in German/Latin 1-3 and ending with AP French/Latin Language. French, however, has five years of instruction total, French 1-4 and ending with AP French Language. Spanish, like French, has five years of instruction, but offers Spanish 1-3 and then offers AP Spanish Language and AP Spanish Culture. In the 2017-2018 school year, Klein ISD will be adding Chinese and American Sign Language to its course selection, but no classes have been held yet for these <b>two</b> <b>courses.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS {{started running}} <b>two</b> <b>courses</b> each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} the retention rate, Georgia Southern University launched the First-Year Experience (FYE) program. FYE {{is a comprehensive}} program which includes <b>two</b> mandatory <b>courses</b> (FYE 1220 : First-Year Seminar, and FYE 1410 : Global Citizens), conversations with professors, intrusive academic advising, giving early alert/midterm grades, and limiting number of withdrawals. The <b>two</b> mandatory <b>courses</b> have been offered since fall 2008. This study is {{to assess the impact}} of the <b>two</b> mandatory <b>courses</b> on academic performance of students majoring in information technology (IT). A comparison is made among the <b>two</b> mandatory <b>courses,</b> <b>two</b> general education <b>courses</b> (English and Math), and <b>two</b> information technology <b>courses.</b> Grade point averages (GPA) and the grades of six courses were extracted from the university data warehouse. Pearson correlation is used to detect the dependence between course grades and GPA. The result shows that the <b>two</b> mandatory <b>courses</b> have higher correlations with GPA than the other <b>courses</b> do. The <b>two</b> IT <b>courses</b> have higher correlations with GPA than the <b>two</b> general education <b>courses</b> do. The first course FYE 1220 is designed with a purpose of facilitating students integrated into academic environment, and the second course FYE 1410 is designed with emphasis of social integration. The result of the strong correlations validated Tinto‟s integration theory, i. e., academic integration and social integration leads to the academic success...|$|R
