5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with this at the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E
5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E

50|$|Theosophist Alice A. Bailey stated during World War II <b>that</b> Adolf <b>Hitler</b> was {{possessed by}} what she called the Dark Forces. Her {{follower}} Benjamin Creme has stated <b>that</b> through <b>Hitler</b> (and a group of equally evil men around him in Nazi Germany, together {{with a group of}} militarists in Japan and a further group around Mussolini in Italy) was released the energies of the Antichrist, which, according to theosophical teachings is not an individual person but forces of destruction.|$|R
5|$|Speer wrote <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> had a {{negative}} view of Himmler's and Alfred Rosenberg's mystical notions and Himmler's attempt to mythologise the SS. Hitler was more pragmatic, and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} operation {{plan for the}} invasion of Ireland in support of Operation Sea Lion was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along with Britain in a temporary administrative system divided into six military-economic commands, {{with one of the}} headquarters being situated in Dublin. Ireland's future position in the New Order is unclear, but it is known <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> would have united Ulster with the Irish state.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} following Hitler's death, {{a variety}} of claims have been made about Hitler's sexual orientation: that he was gay, bisexual, or asexual. Conclusive evidence is lacking, but most historians believe he was heterosexual. There {{is at least one}} claim <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> had an illegitimate child (named Jean-Marie Loret) with one of his lovers. Mainstream historians, such as Ian Kershaw, dismiss this as unlikely or impossible.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Rauschning {{claimed to}} have seen in Hitler's First World War {{military}} record an item concerning a court martial <b>that</b> found <b>Hitler</b> guilty of pederastic practices with an officer. Rauschning also claimed <b>that</b> in Munich <b>Hitler</b> {{was found guilty of}} a violation of Paragraph 175, which dealt with pederasty. No evidence of either of these two charges has been found.|$|R

5|$|Stefanie Rabatsch (née Isak; born 28 December 1887 – died unknown, after 1973) was an Austrian {{woman who}} was alleged by August Kubizek {{to have been an}} unrequited love of then-teenage Adolf Hitler. Her Jewish-sounding maiden name has been subject to {{speculation}} in this context. However, there is no evidence apart from Kubizek <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> ever had such an attachment.|$|E
5|$|The first inkling to {{the outside}} world <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> was dead came from the Germans themselves. On 1 May the radio station Reichssender Hamburg {{interrupted}} their normal program to announce that an important broadcast would soon be made. After dramatic funeral music by Wagner and Bruckner, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz (appointed as Hitler's successor in his will) announced <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> was dead. Dönitz called upon the German people to mourn their Führer, who died a hero defending the capital of the Reich. Hoping to save the army and the nation by negotiating a partial surrender to the British and Americans, Dönitz authorized a fighting withdrawal to the west. His tactic was somewhat successful: it enabled about 1.8 million German soldiers to avoid capture by the Soviets, but it came at a high cost in bloodshed, as troops continued to fight until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|American {{journalist}} H. R. Knickerbocker, who had met both Hitler and Hess, speculated <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> {{had sent}} Hess {{to deliver a}} message informing Winston Churchill of the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, and offering a negotiated peace or even an anti-Bolshevik partnership. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin believed that Hess's flight had been engineered by the British. Stalin persisted in this belief as late as 1944, when he mentioned the matter to Churchill, who insisted {{that they had no}} advance knowledge of the flight.|$|E

5|$|David John Cawdell Irving (born 24 March 1938) is an English Holocaust denier {{and author}} {{who has written}} on the {{military}} and political history of World War II, {{with a focus on}} Nazi Germany. His works include The Destruction of Dresden (1963), Hitler's War (1977), Churchill's War (1987), and Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich (1996). In his works, he argued <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it. Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann stated at {{his later}} interrogations that Heydrich told him in mid-September <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> had ordered that all Jews in German-controlled Europe {{were to be}} killed. The initial plan was to {{implement}} Generalplan Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union. However, with the entry of the United States into the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow, Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Around this time, Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel), the highest rank he achieved.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E

50|$|Werner Maser (12 July 1922 - 5 April 2007) was a German historian, {{journalist}} {{and professor at}} the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Werner was the first historian to claim <b>that</b> the <b>Hitler</b> Diaries were forgeries.|$|R
5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down. Soon afterwards he told Quisling <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> had approved {{the transfer of}} power, scheduled for 30 January. Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had been reached on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E
5|$|It {{was here}} <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> first became exposed to racist rhetoric. Populists such as mayor Karl Lueger {{exploited}} {{the climate of}} virulent anti-Semitism and occasionally espoused German nationalist notions for political effect. German nationalism had a particularly widespread following in the Mariahilf district, where Hitler lived. Georg Ritter von Schönerer became {{a major influence on}} Hitler. He also developed an admiration for Martin Luther. Hitler read local newspapers such as Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of Eastern European Jews. He read newspapers and pamphlets that published the thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustave Le Bon and Arthur Schopenhauer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 May (thirteen hours after the event), Stalin was {{informed}} of Hitler's suicide. General Hans Krebs had given this information to Soviet General Vasily Chuikov when they met at 04:00 on 1 May, when the Germans attempted to negotiate acceptable surrender terms. Stalin demanded unconditional surrender and asked for confirmation <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> was dead. He wanted Hitler's corpse found. In {{the early morning hours}} of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. Down in the Führerbunker, General Krebs and General Wilhelm Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head.|$|E
5000|$|Vansittart was {{suspicious}} of Adolf Hitler {{from the start}} and claimed <b>that</b> which <b>Hitler</b> said was [...] "for foreign consumption". He thought Hitler would start another European war {{as soon as he}} [...] "felt strong enough".|$|R
50|$|Despite {{claims made}} to the {{contrary}} during his interrogation, Kempka later admitted <b>that</b> when <b>Hitler</b> and Eva Braun locked themselves in a room of the Führerbunker to commit suicide, he was not near by; he was present after the event had occurred. By <b>that</b> time, <b>Hitler</b> and Braun's bodies had already been carried out of the study-office of the Führerbunker. There, Kempka took Eva Braun's lifeless body from Martin Bormann and carried it halfway up the exit stairs before handing it over to Günsche who carried it outside from the bunker exit {{and placed it on}} the ground of the Chancellery garden next to Hitler's corpse to be burnt.|$|R
5000|$|The view is {{vulnerable}} to a big worry for the ethical realist: projectivism may collapse into subjectivism or some variety of moral relativism. For example, it may seem <b>that</b> if <b>Hitler</b> truly felt the Holocaust {{was the right thing}} to do, the only possible projectivist response would to be <b>that</b> if <b>Hitler</b> truly thought he was doing the right thing, we might say he was wrong, but for him, it was right. But here, projectivism does not collapse into subjectivism. Where a subjectivist sees no moral disagreement (because he believes “X is right” just means “I approve of X”), the projectivist can allow for moral disagreement.|$|R
5|$|As the Soviets {{approached}} Berlin, Hitler's {{efforts to}} organise the defence {{of the city}} became ever more meaningless and futile. His last birthday, celebrated at the Führerbunker in Berlin on 20 April 1945, was the occasion for leave-taking for many top Nazis, Göring included. By this time, Carinhall had been evacuated, the building destroyed, and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere. Göring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April, the same day <b>that</b> <b>Hitler,</b> in a lengthy diatribe against his generals, first publicly admitted {{that the war was}} lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide. He also stated that Göring was {{in a better position to}} negotiate a peace settlement. In 1941—a week after the start of the Soviet invasion—Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death.|$|E
5|$|By 1941, Göring was at {{the peak}} of his power and influence, and Hitler {{designated}} him as his successor and deputy in all his offices. As the Second World War progressed, Göring's standing with Hitler and with the German public declined after the Luftwaffe proved incapable of preventing the Allied bombing of German cities and resupplying surrounded German forces in Stalingrad. Around that time, Göring increasingly withdrew from the military and political scene to devote his attention to collecting property and artwork, much of which was taken from Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Informed on 22 April 1945 <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> intended to commit suicide, Göring sent a telegram to Hitler requesting permission to assume control of the Reich. Considering it an act of treason, Hitler removed Göring from all his positions, expelled him from the party, and ordered his arrest.|$|E
5|$|In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, {{turned to}} {{producing}} paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, {{who had been}} an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects <b>that</b> <b>Hitler</b> never painted, or would want to paint, according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director of a museum and his own brother, who he re-invented as a general in the East German army.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{well-known}} story <b>that</b> Adolf <b>Hitler</b> was reportedly fond of the building. Albert Speer stated in his book Inside the Third Reich {{that he had been}} dispatched to Brussels in 1940 to study the building.|$|R
50|$|Hidden Führer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality is a {{documentary}} film {{based on the}} research of German Professor Lothar Machtan for his 2001 book The Hidden <b>Hitler</b> <b>that</b> claimed Adolf <b>Hitler</b> was a homosexual. Aired by HBO's CINEMAX Reel Life, the 90 minute documentary was directed by Fenton Bailey, Randy Barbato and Gabriel Rotello and was produced by Gabriel Rotello.|$|R
5000|$|Cats, {{like those}} on the Cats <b>That</b> Look Like <b>Hitler</b> website, {{seem to have an}} {{overwhelming}} presence on the Internet, in memes (see LOLcats) as well as various YouTube videos and related sites. Much attention has been lavished on Cats <b>That</b> Look Like <b>Hitler,</b> some for being [...] "cute" [...] and some, as mentioned above, for being [...] "offensive." [...] Nevertheless, Cats <b>That</b> Look Like <b>Hitler</b> contributes to a wide assortment of cat themed websites and content. Writer for The Times, Ben Machell, has interviewed the owners of sensational cats such as {{those on the}} site and has come up with various possible explanations for the creation and popularity of cats on the Internet, including the Cats <b>That</b> Look Like <b>Hitler.</b> Machell mentions the cat's mysterious nature and personality as a perfect target for projecting personality and emotion on, and recalls the worship of cats evident in historical records since the ancient Egyptians.|$|R
