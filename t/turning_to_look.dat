2500|$|The {{desire for}} a 'human' Jesus {{is not the only}} Biblical topic {{discussed}} in the novel. Another reference involves the story of Lot’s wife disobeying and <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The narrator of that chapter, possibly seen as Vonnegut himself, claims that he loves Lot’s wife doing so [...] "because it was so human." [...] Amanda Wicks speaks on this incorporation of Lot's wife and the narrating voice stating, [...] "Vonnegut naturally aligns himself with Lot’s wife since both occupy the role of spectators shattered by the act of witnessing." [...] The narrator's alignment with Lot's wife also creates a good pretext for the understanding of Billy Pilgrim’s psyche throughout the destruction of Dresden.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, that is you, is it?" [...] said de Lescure, just <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him, {{and then}} hurrying away. But {{before he had}} moved on five paces, he returned, and putting his pistol into his girdle, gave Adolphe his left hand, and whispered to him: ...|$|E
