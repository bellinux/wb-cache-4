5|$|At the British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs) in 1997, Our Friends in the North won {{the award}} for Best Drama Serial, ahead of other nominees The Crow Road, <b>The</b> <b>Fragile</b> Heart and Gulliver's Travels. At the same ceremony, Gina McKee won the Best Actress category. Both Christopher Eccleston and Peter Vaughan (who played Nicky's father, Felix) were {{nominated}} for the Best Actor award for their performances in Our Friends in the North, but they lost to Nigel Hawthorne {{for his role in}} <b>The</b> <b>Fragile</b> Heart. Also at the 1997 BAFTAs, Peter Flannery was presented with the honorary Dennis Potter Award for his work on the serial. Our Friends in the North also gained BAFTA nominations for costume design, sound, and photography and lighting.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the Catalan {{parliament}} {{passed a}} resolution urging development of a government plan to improve the site. A government report in 2001, re-published in 2004, included a proposal to cut down <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> Pi Vell, leaving the stump in place along with a commemorative monument, and purchase and develop the site as a public amenity.|$|E
5|$|An acute nosebleed may {{be managed}} {{with a variety}} of measures, such as packing of the nasal cavity with {{absorbent}} swabs or gels. Removal of the packs after the bleeding may lead to reopening of <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> vessels, and therefore lubricated or atraumatic packing is recommended. Some patients may wish to learn packing themselves to deal with nosebleeds without having to resort to medical help.|$|E

5|$|As a {{resident}} of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin {{was concerned about the}} impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the European Alps. At the World Economic Forum in 1990, he launched Alp Action to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage overgrazing, logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were having on <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon {{be made into a}} state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E

5|$|Ben Nevis's {{popularity}} and high-profile {{have led to}} concerns in recent decades over the impact of humans on <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> mountain environment. These concerns contributed {{to the creation of}} The , a five-year programme which aims to protect, enhance and future-proof Ben Nevis by delivering nineteen ambitious environmental projects between 2014 and 2019. The Nevis Landscape Partnership is supported by five partner organisations (John Muir Trust, Forestry Commission Scotland, The Highland Council, Scottish Natural Heritage & The Nevis Partnership) and has been made possible by Heritage Lottery Funding.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E
5|$|Lyrical themes {{found in}} Nine Inch Nails songs are largely {{concerned}} with dark explorations {{of the self}} ranging from religion, greed, fame, lust, addiction, self-deception, aging, regret, nihilism, and occasionally politics, with the latter topic often being scrutinized in Year Zero. Three of Nine Inch Nails' recordings are concept albums: The Downward Spiral, follow-up <b>The</b> <b>Fragile,</b> and the aforementioned Year Zero. With Teeth (under the working title Bleedthrough) {{was to be a}} concept album about an endless dream occurring in reality, but Reznor eventually took this idea out of the record.|$|E

To preserve <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the government of India regulates the flow of tourists. Road maintenance is entrusted to Border Roads Organisation, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a {{construction}} crane crashed at the construction site, scraping the stone {{on the east side}} of the building, but not injuring anyone. Due to <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> sandstone exterior, the damage on the rotunda was not repaired. In January 1997, construction crews finished the demolition portion of the project and finished the structural reinforcement part before they began the interior construction phase.|$|E

5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E
5|$|Cuba was {{of special}} {{importance}} to Southern Democrats, who believed their {{economic and political}} interests would be best served by the admission of another slave state to the Union. The existence of slavery in Cuba, the island's plantation economy based on sugar, and its geographical location predisposed it to Southern influence; its admission would greatly strengthen the position of Southern slaveholders, whose way of life was under fire from Northern abolitionists. Whereas immigration to Northern industrial centers had resulted in Northern control of the population-based House of Representatives, Southern politicians sought to maintain <b>the</b> <b>fragile</b> {{balance of power in}} the Senate, where each state received equal representation. As slavery-free Western states were admitted, Southern politicians increasingly looked to Cuba as the next slave state. If Cuba were admitted to the Union as a single state, the island would have sent two senators and up to nine representatives to Washington.|$|E
