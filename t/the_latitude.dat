5|$|From 1499 to 1508 {{a number}} of other expeditions were {{launched}} from Bristol to the 'New found land', the earliest being undertaken by William Weston. One of these, led by John Cabot's son, Sebastian Cabot, explored down the coast of North America until he was ‘almost in <b>the</b> <b>latitude</b> of Gibraltar’ and ‘almost the longitude of Cuba’. This would suggest that he reached as far as the Chesapeake, close to what is now Washington D.C.|$|E
5|$|In the White Sea {{region of}} Russia, all three {{assemblage}} types {{have been found}} in close proximity. This, and the faunas' considerable temporal overlap, makes it unlikely that they represent evolutionary stages or temporally distinct communities.

5|$|The climate, {{and as a}} result, {{the flora}} and fauna, of Pinkham Notch varies greatly with elevation.

25|$|The {{formulae}} in {{the previous}} sections give <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>latitude</b> in terms of <b>the</b> geodetic <b>latitude.</b> <b>The</b> expressions for the geocentric and reduced latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>latitude.</b> <b>The</b> methods available are fixed-point iteration and Newton–Raphson root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>latitude</b> as a series in terms of <b>the</b> geodetic <b>latitude</b> and then invert the series by the method of Lagrange reversion. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients {{in terms of the}} eccentricity.

5|$|Forming at 31° N, {{the storm}} formed farther north {{than any other}} Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone at the time, though, in 2000, Tropical Storm Wene formed farther to the north. The cyclone marked the first known occurrence of a mid-Pacific upper tropospheric low developing into a tropical cyclone, though Tropical Storm Fausto in 2002 redeveloped in a similar occurrence to the hurricane. The cyclone attained hurricane status at 40° N, a record for a Pacific hurricane.

5|$|The highest {{altitude}} of the Moon {{in the sky}} varies with the lunar phase and the season of the year. The full moon is highest during winter. The 18.61-year nodes cycle also has an influence: when the ascending node of the lunar orbit is in the vernal equinox, the lunar declination can {{go as far as}} 28° each month. This means the Moon can go overhead at latitudes up to 28° from the equator, instead of only 18°. The orientation of the Moon's crescent also depends on <b>the</b> <b>latitude</b> of the observation site: close to the equator, an observer can see a smile-shaped crescent moon.|$|E
