5|$|After 1261, {{new church}} {{architecture}} in Constantinople consisted mainly of additions <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> monastic churches, {{such as the}} Monastery of Lips and Pammakaristos Church, {{and as a result}} the building complexes are distinguished in part by an asymmetric array of domes on their roofs. This effect may have been in imitation of the earlier triple-church Pantokrator monastic complex.|$|E

5|$|Cryptum {{received}} mixed reviews; {{some critics}} liked the Forerunner culture and suspense that Bear created, but others disliked the characters, found the plot too slow {{and concluded that}} the novel was suited only <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> fans of the Halo series.

5|$|Despite the project's termination, the two {{companies}} continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering {{to the needs of}} the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.|$|E
5|$|Dupuy de Lôme was {{designed}} to fill the commerce-raiding strategy of the Jeune École. Considered by some the first true armoured cruiser, she was superior <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> British and Italian protected cruisers, especially in her relatively thick steel armour. She could control the engagement range with her superior speed and her heavy armament of quick-firing guns, {{all of which were}} mounted in gun turrets, in marked contrast to her intended opponents who mounted their guns in lightly protected casemates or pivot mounts.|$|E

5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Enfield Borough Council {{proposed}} a North Circular Area Action Plan, which would regenerate the area immediately around Telford Road and Bowes Road, and encourage growth.

5|$|In July 2013, a {{task force}} {{set up by the}} Mayor of London Boris Johnson {{proposed}} that long sections of the North Circular (as well as the South Circular) should be put underground in road tunnels, freeing up space on the surface to provide public space, extensive cycle routes, and better links <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> communities currently severed by the road.|$|E

It was subsequently cancelled by Secretary Hagel on 15 April 2013 who made the decision to instead create and offer a new distinguishing device <b>to</b> <b>existing</b> medals.

This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
