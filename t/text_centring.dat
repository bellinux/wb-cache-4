40|$|Debates around postcolonial theory often {{arise from}} misunderstandings owing to {{translation}} from one disciplinary context to another. This article acknowledges real material limits to <b>text</b> <b>centred</b> theory and critiques the uninspected use of hybridity as a concept/textual practice of subversion. The term has {{a range of}} meanings and does different work in different situations. Using examples from modern writing in the Pacific region, a situated dynamic of juxtaposed elements defined as 2 ̆ 7 syneretic counterpoint 2 ̆ 7 is argued for. This conflietual mix resists both hybrid amalgamation and irony, permitting an assertion of indigenous difference that simultaneously allows for modern globalised complexity...|$|R

The present article aims at focusing on some dimensions considered crucial to carry out field work using the discussion group. After a short incursion into some authors whose work has been privileging this technique of collecting information in the study of different socio-educational contexts, we develop a concise reflection about its potentialities and some of its limitations...|$|R

50|$|Then I Clouted Him Twice (Atunci i-am ars două palme/ short stories, Iaşi: Polirom, 2004) {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first, the <b>texts</b> <b>centre</b> on the {{grotesque}} side of insignificant events, and the humour tempers the dramatic intensity of situations in which we all might find ourselves. The second, autobiographical section is in fact a short novel about childhood during the communist period, in which a cruel system is presented from the viewpoint of a child. Finally, the short stories of the third section have a social and sometimes political moral, displaying a dark, dry humour, which often borders on the absurd. The book was published into German in 2009 (Dann ist mir die Hand ausgerutscht, Ludwisburg: Pop Verlag).|$|R
