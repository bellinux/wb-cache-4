On 26 August, Croatia organised the Freedom <b>Traina</b> railroad tour taking Tuđman and the bulk of Croatia's government officials, public personalities, journalists and the diplomatic corps in Croatia from Zagreb to Karlovac, Gospić, Knin and Split. Tuđman gave a speech at each of the stops. In Knin, he declared: [...] " [...] didn't even have time to collect their dirty [...] and their dirty underwear. On this day, we can say that Croatia stopped bearing its historical cross. This is not just the liberation of land, but the creation of a foundation for a free and independent Croatia for centuries to come." [...] During the final rally in Split, which drew a crowd of 300,000, Tuđman vowed to liberate Vukovar as well.|$|E

50|$|Yahshua is one {{proposed}} transliteration of {{the original}} Hebrew or Aramaic name of Jesus commonly used by individuals in the Sacred Name Movement.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare the results of the implementation, with a group of Biology and Geology teacher <b>trainas,</b> of a reflective teacher education model with those obtained through the application of “traditional” teacher education models to two other groups. The results focus on both the nature of the discours used by the teacher trainees and their supervisors, and the teaching and learning activities developed during supervised lessons. The results indicate that there is an isomorfism on both the types of discours and the types of teaching and learning activities used by the teacher trainees and their supervisors. This conclusion emphasises the importante of supervisors education by the teacher education institution...|$|R
40|$|Dimensionality {{reduction}} {{is an important}} issue in data mining and machine learning. Traina[1] proposed a feature selection algorithm to select the most important attributes for a given set of n-dimensional vectors based on correlation fractal dimension. The author used a kind of multi-dimensional “quad-tree ” structure to compute the fractal dimension. Inspired by his work, we propose a new and simpler algorithm to compute the fractal dimension, and design a novel and faster feature selection algorithm using correlation fractal dimension, whose time complexity is lower than that of <b>Traina’s.</b> The main idea is when computing the fractal dimension of (d- 1) -dimensional data, the intermediate generated results of the extended d-dimensional data is reused. It inherits the desirable properties described as in [1]. Also, Our algorithm does not require the grid sizes decrease by half as the original “quad-tree ” algorithm. Experiments show our feature selection algorithm has a good efficiency over the test dataset...|$|R
40|$|Short-term {{synaptic}} plasticity (STP) can significantly alter the amplitudes of synaptic responses {{in ways that}} depend on presynaptic history. Thus, it is widely assumed that STP acts as a filter for specific patterns of presynaptic inputs, {{and as a result}} can play key roles in neuronal information processing. To evaluate this assumption and directly quantify the effects of STP on information transmission, we consider a population of independent synaptic inputs to amodel neuron. We showusing standard information theoretic approaches that the changes in synaptic response amplitude resulting from STP interact with the related effects on fluctuations in membrane conduc-tance, such that information transmission is broadband (no frequency-dependent filtering occurs), regardless of whether synaptic depressionor facilitationdominates. Interestingly, thisbroadband transmission ispreserved in thepostsynaptic spike <b>trainas</b> longas the postsynaptic neuron’s baseline firing rate is relatively high; in contrast, low baseline firing rates lead to STP-dependent effects. Thus, background inputs that control the firing state of a postsynaptic neuron can gate the effects of STP on information transmission.

40|$|Community engaged {{learning}} (CEL) {{has been}} identified as a high impact educational practice that can have profound influence on student learning 1. Students who participate in CEL have been shown to retain, integrate and transfer information at higher rates and report higher levels of satisfaction and engagement 1. Despite the potential to provide a meaningful learning experience, CEL opportunities are not widespread at research institutions, and most examples arise from small classes in social sciences 2. Current realities of increasing class sizes coupled with decreasing resources make implementing CEL challenging. However, institutional accountability to deliver key learning outcomes, plus student demand for relevant curriculum across disciplines makes the challenge worthwhile. Creative thinking is required to modify the critical elements of successful CEL to suit broader educational needs. Based on key concepts of reciprocity, shared decision-making and mutual benefit we designed a novel CEL assignment in a 4 th year kinesiology class (3 ̆e 100 students). Briefly, student teams researched one of five priority areas identified by Wellington Dufferin Guelph Public Health (WDGPH), to write an evidence-based literature review. Based on these findings, students worked with WDGPH (ratio 1 : 20) to translate their research into practical recommendations and useful tools to advance WDGPH programming. Knowledge translation projects were highlighted during an end of semester open showcase. This presentation will provide a tangible model that can be modified to suit various teaching environments. Successes and challenges will be shared from faculty and community perspectives and top student projects will be available for participants to experience. 1) Kuh, G. D.
