30|$|Substantial {{differences}} between the topology of self-organized microtubules (where the principle of summation of pairwise forces is working) and free single microtubules, under the same bulk solution conditions, suggest that some local solution factor(s) and mechanism(s) {{may be responsible for}} the above-mentioned <b>topological</b> <b>restrictions</b> in fiber microtubules. Based on the analysis of our data, we propose that the key solution factor responsible for the set of the above-mentioned <b>topological</b> <b>restrictions</b> in fiber microtubules is the local depletion of GTP-tubulin.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} global tracking {{strategies for}} the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. It {{is well known that}} global attractivity is prohibited for continuous attitude control systems on the special orthogonal group. Such <b>topological</b> <b>restriction</b> has been dealt with either by constructing smooth attitude control systems that exclude a set of measure zero in the region of attraction, or by introducing hybrid control systems to obtain global asymptotic stability. This paper proposes alternative attitude control systems that are continuous in time to achieve exponential stability, where the region of attraction covers the entire special orthogonal group. The main contribution of this paper is providing a new framework to overcome the <b>topological</b> <b>restriction</b> in attitude controls without relying on discontinuities through the controlled maneuvers.

We then present an algorithm for MASP with D = 2 whose running time is polynomial if k = O(1). On the other hand, we prove that MASP is NP-hard for any fixed k ≥ 3 when D is unrestricted, and also NP-hard for any fixed D ≥ 2 when k is unrestricted even if each input tree is required to contain at most three leaves. Finally, we describe a polynomial-time (n/log n) -approximation algorithm for MASP...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{attitude}} tracking problem is considered using the rotation matrices. Due to the inherent <b>topological</b> <b>restriction,</b> {{it is impossible}} to achieve global attractivity with any continuous attitude control system on $SO(3) $. Hence in this work, we propose some control protocols achieve almost global tracking asymptotically and in finite time, respectively.

For finite-time tracking case, Filippov solutions and non-smooth analysis techniques are adopted to handle the discontinuities.
