60|$|As {{they got}} up, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> rattled again, {{and this time}} there {{followed}} a knocking.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> rear <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> are {{installed}} on the [...] "C" [...] pillar as a Nissan design tradition started with the 1986 Nissan Pathfinder. When the four-door Pathfinder was introduced, Nissan chose to conceal <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> {{as a part of}} the [...] "C" [...] pillar trim to visually make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with conventional <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> on <b>the</b> front <b>doors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mrs Pearson. Poirot's landlady and housekeeper. Her tasks include opening <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>handling</b> his correspondence, {{recording}} phone messages. She {{does not}} otherwise speak.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{scrambling}} sound outside <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> turned.|$|R
60|$|Philip's heart gave a great thud {{against his}} ribs, {{and he let}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> go. The door swung to.|$|E
60|$|He stood unmoving. Ursula recovered, {{her hand}} was on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> She slowly drew herself up. He seemed {{doubtful}} now.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'd {{care for}} a cup of milk," [...] he remarked, taking a tin from <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> [...] "we can manage it. No tea yet, I'm afraid." ...|$|E
50|$|The hotel {{interiors}} feature many Art Nouveau references; in the lobby, {{the staircase}} with gold-colored stained glass, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and <b>the</b> forged handrails have an interwar appearance.|$|R
50|$|Car <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> may {{protrude}} {{from the}} vehicle's exterior surface or be streamlined into the vehicle's contour. In some automobiles, especially luxury vehicles, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> may feature a key-less entry pad utilizing either a numerical code or thumb scan.|$|R
5000|$|When <b>the</b> four <b>door</b> {{version was}} introduced, Nissan chose to conceal <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> {{as a part}} of the [...] "C" [...] pillar trim to {{visually}} make it appear like a two-door truck with a camper shell, with <b>the</b> conventional <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> on <b>the</b> front <b>doors.</b> This design tradition is still used on all Nissan SUVs currently offered, including the Nissan Armada, Nissan Juke, Nissan Terrano II, and the Nissan Xterra. <b>The</b> front <b>doors</b> were slightly shortened to accommodate <b>the</b> rear <b>doors.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{said she}} saw <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> turn," [...] Lenora sobbed. [...] "I went to fetch Macdougal. He'd gone out. When I came back she was there--like that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|As she was {{speaking}} a faint rattling of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> was heard. Instantly Miss Trelawny's face brightened. She sprang up {{and went over to}} the door, saying as she went: ...|$|E
60|$|John's {{demeanor}} {{had become}} so dangerous that he broke off abruptly, and with an unostentatious movement, as of a man strolling carelessly about his private sanctum, put himself within easy reach of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trim {{levels on}} the USA version {{can be easily}} {{identified}} {{by the color of}} <b>the</b> outside <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> Base trim levels can be identified by chrome <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> whereas uplevel had painted <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> that match <b>the</b> exterior color. Japanese models all had chrome <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and European and Australian versions all had painted <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b> <b>The</b> USA <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> tradition continued until model year 2010 on the fifth generation Legacy platform, with Subaru using black plastic instead of chrome starting with 1994 Legacy lower trim levels. MY 1992 saw <b>the</b> Japanese-spec <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> changed to <b>the</b> European version of painted handles, a feature they still use on current models.|$|R
50|$|When {{leaving a}} vehicle that is {{equipped}} with a smart-key system, the vehicle is locked by either pressing a button on one of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> touching a capacitive area on a <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> or by simply walking away from the vehicle. The method of locking varies between models.|$|R
50|$|This {{version of}} the Wrangler is also notable for being the last {{production}} vehicle to use AMC-related parts. The AMC Straight-4 engine was retired after the 2006 model year, and both the AMC Straight-6 engine and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> (<b>the</b> latter of which first appeared on AMC vehicles in the 1968 model year) were retired along with this generation in 2006. Like the YJ Wrangler, the TJ Wrangler used both the AMC passenger car <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> as well as <b>the</b> larger <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> off <b>the</b> AMC-built Jeep CJ for higher-end models.|$|R
60|$|The {{footsteps}} {{came back}} without haste; <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> rattled, {{and the second}} engineer appeared in the opening, shadowy in the sheen of the skylight at his back, with his face apparently as black {{as the rest of}} his figure.|$|E
60|$|With {{an almost}} occult carefulness he turned <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> {{and opened the}} door an inch. It creaked slightly. Then he opened it another inch--then another. His heart did not beat, he seemed to create a silence about himself, an obliviousness.|$|E
60|$|He {{replaced}} the receiver quickly and sprang out of bed, {{for he had}} heard <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> turn. When the door opened he was giving a correct representation {{of a young man}} wasting no time in beginning his toilet for the day.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{recommendation}} of the Kharkiv department of Hygiene, all of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> were made of copper which was thought at that time and is now known to have antibacterial characteristics to kill microbes.|$|R
50|$|The 94-95 model years {{featured}} {{very subtle}} changes. They no longer came with chrome trim around <b>the</b> windows, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> were now painted body color, and black {{was no longer}} offered as an interior or exterior color.|$|R
6000|$|... "If Meg had four, {{the house}} wouldn't hold them, and master and missis {{would have to}} camp in the garden," [...] broke in Jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'I hope so. And manage, if you please, to {{see this}} Miss Limmer and observe {{what kind of person}} she is,' said Merton, with his hand on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle,</b> adding, 'Please ask Dr. Maitland to come here, and do you keep the {{children}} amused for a moment.' ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{the black}} figure swayed perilously towards her. She {{affected}} {{not to notice}}, not to notice the hand which seemed {{for a moment as}} though it would snatch <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> from her grasp. She passed out pleasantly and without haste. The last sound she heard was a groan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{altogether}} delightful, {{and like}} old times. This tastes right. I drink your health, dear." [...] and John sipped his tea {{with an air}} of reposeful rapture, which was of very short duration however, for as he put down his cup, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> rattled mysteriously, and a little voice was heard, saying impatiently...|$|E
50|$|The buildings, {{from their}} {{structural}} forms down to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> and light pulls, were {{designed and built}} by Wharton Esherick to create a complete artistic environment.

50|$|When {{the second}} {{generation}} Wagon R-Wide was launched in May 1999, this became the Wagon R+ in Japan as well. This updated version started sales in the European market {{in the summer of}} 2000. The main difference between the JDM Wagon R-Wide/+ and the European Wagon R+ is <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles,</b> which on JDM models were body-colored while European models received black <b>door</b> <b>handles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early in 1968 the 1600, just as {{the bigger}} 2000, was updated to meet new safety legislation. Toggle switches, a padded {{dashboard}} and padded center of the steering wheel were new inside. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>handles</b> were flush fit lifting units, while the windshield was taller with a top mounted internal rear view mirror.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} murmur. A man who sat {{only three or four}} places off from Kendricks and Julien rose silently to his feet and moved towards the door. It was as yet locked, however. From {{the other end of the}} room the lights were {{suddenly}} heightened. The faces of the men were now distinctly visible. A light in the body of the hall flared up. A man was discovered with his hand upon <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle.</b> There was a hoarse murmur of voices.|$|E
60|$|Kemp's face became white. He {{tried to}} grip <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> with both hands. For {{a moment he}} stood lugging. Then the door gave six inches. But he got it closed again. The second time it was jerked a foot wide, and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening. His throat was gripped by {{invisible}} fingers, and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself. He was forced back, tripped and pitched heavily {{into the corner of}} the landing. The empty dressing-gown was flung on the top of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so, but far otherwise. If it's shut {{we shall}} hear them at {{it when they}} come. Subject to your approval, Comrade Jackson, I have evolved the {{following}} plan of action. I always ask myself on these occasions, 'What would Napoleon have done?' I think Napoleon would have {{sat in a chair}} by his washhand stand, which is close to the door; he would have posted you by your washhand stand, and he would have instructed Comrade Jellicoe, directly he heard <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>handle</b> turned, to give his celebrated imitation of a dormitory breathing heavily in its sleep. He would then--" ...|$|E
5000|$|The AXV-V was {{extremely}} aerodynamically efficient, with [...] To achieve this while still {{being able to}} seat four people, the cabin was longer and further forward than normal.
