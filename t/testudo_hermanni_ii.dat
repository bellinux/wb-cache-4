40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the morphology and ultrastructure of the pronephros of <b>Testudo</b> <b>hermanni</b> as observed in the earlier part of its development. This paired structure appears during renal ontogenesis and originates from the first somites localised in the cephalic part of the embryo. The first pronephric evidence is noted at stage 12. The kidney is composed of large glomeruli that are devoid of a capsule and protrude into the coelomic cavity. A ciliated nephrostome provides access to short renal tubules, lined with a well-developed brush border. Two nephric ducts on the lateral sides of the embryo are connected to the tubules. The cytological characteristics of the pronephric structure suggest that it might be functional, at least in the first part of development. The pronephros of <b>Testudo</b> <b>hermanni</b> regresses after a short time around stage 18, while the mesonephros is already well differentiated. Its plesiomorphic characteristics, similar to those observed in amphibians, might be related to the phyletic position of chelonians within the reptiles. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|R

In this paper the diverse information, including notes and publications and oral information, as well as the review of material deposited in museums, collections, universities and those that have currently appeared in excavations have been grouped.

40|$|Increase of the {{fecundity}} in Hermann 's Tortoise <b>Testudo</b> <b>hermanni</b> hermanni in insular conditions: {{an opposite}} {{case of the}} insular syndrome? - The reproductive parameters of the Hermann's Tortoise <b>Testudo</b> <b>hermanni</b> were studied by radiography in Corsica (Porto-Vecchio -island population-) and in Provence (Maures Massif -mainland population-). The following parameters were measured: number of eggs per clutch, clutch frequency, annual fecundity (eggs produced per female per year) {{and size of the}} eggs. There was a significantly higher fecundity in the island area, i. e. more eggs per clutch (4 against 3), a higher clutch frequency (1. 9 against 1. 4) and a global fecundity of 7. 7 eggs/female/year as compared to 4. 2 eggs/female/year in the mainland area. This increase in fecundity did not change also after taking into account the size of the females, which were larger in the island area. Indeed, female size does not influence the size of the eggs. The observed increase in fecundity contradicts the theory of the insular syndrome which predicts a decrease in fecundity in insular conditions. This dissension {{may be the result of}} the originality of tortoises at the ecophysiological level (long lifetime herbivore species) or may partially depend on distinct local adaptations.

Although wild boars (Sus scrofa) are potential large sized predators for tortoises, the analysis of carapace morphology did not reveal injuries signs due to bites. Male tortoises could die due to up-turning, as the result of male-male combats during the mating season, to possible hyperthermia when upturned, and to predation carried out by birds particularly when upturned.
