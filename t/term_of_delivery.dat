40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} provide {{communication}} services in Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) where it lacks of end-to-end paths between the communication sources and destinations, a variety of routing schemes have been proposed. Consequently it is significant to accurately evaluate their performance to show their advantages and inferiority. At the same time, the energy is very limited in {{a large number of}} DTNs, such as sparse mobile sensor networks and emergency ad hoc networks, and it impacts the routing performance significantly. However, current related works ignore the influence of the energy constraint on the routing. In this paper, we investigate the performance of routing schemes for the energy-constrained DTNs. First, we model the two-hop relaying, epidemic routing and K-hop forwarding with energy constraint based on a continuous time Markov chain. Then, we obtain the system performance of message delivery delay and delivery cost by explicit expressions. By both simulation and numerical results, we demonstrate the accuracy of our proposed model and reveal that the energy constraint can actually avoid the message storms which are harmful to the systems in <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> cost and transmission contention.

40|$|The {{emerging}} wave {{of technology}} in human-centric devices such as smart phones, tablets, and other small wearable sensor modules facilitates pervasive systems and applications to be economically deployed {{on a large scale}} with human participation. To exploit such environment, data gathering and dissemination based on opportunistic contact times among humans is a fundamental requirement. To tackle the lack of contemporaneous end-to-end connectivity in Delay-tolerant Networks (DTNs), most current algorithms assess the probability of the contact times to gradually convey a message towards its destination. These contact-based approaches do not perform well when historical locations of nodes have mixture distribution. In this paper, we formulate routing problems in spatial and spatiotemporal domains as an online unsupervised learning problem given location data. The key insight is that nodes frequently appearing nearer the message destinations are regarded as possessing higher delivery probability even if they have low contact times. We show how to solve the formulated problems with two basic algorithms, Location-Mean and Location-Cluster, by estimating the means of historical locations to calculate delivery probability of nodes. To our best knowledge, this is the first work to tackle DTN routing problem using online unsupervised learning on geographical locations. In the context of human mobility, simulation results of the Location-Mean algorithm show that the online unsupervised learning approach given node locations achieves better routing performances in <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio, latency, transmission cost, and computation efficiency compared to the contact-based approach...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} pregnancy outcome during the bombing of Yugoslavia in the period from March 24 to June 9, 1999. Methods. A retrospective study included a total of 81 spontaneous abortion following XII gestation week, and 1448 deliveries, hospitalized in the regional hospital. The analyzed were: the incidence of spontaneous abortion, Cesarean section, post-term delivery, vaginal delivery following the previous Cesarean section within the period from March 24 to June 9, 1999, and compared to the same periods in 1998 and 2000 by the use of χ² and Kolgomorov-Smirnov tests. Results. Under the conditions of a three-month stress imposed by the bombing, significantly increased were the incidence of spontaneous abortion and vaginal delivery following the previous Cesarean section, while the incidence of Cesarean section and post-term delivery were decreased, but the incidence of perinatal outcome was paradoxically improved. The analysis of findings on admittance revealed that iterative Cesarean section was performed electively, close to the expected <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> and vaginal delivery following the previous Cesarean section mainly two weeks before that term with the admittance finding confirming a high active stage pregnancy. Conclusions. Within the bombing, statistically significantly was increased the percentage of abortions after XII gestation week, and the biological duration of pregnancy was reduced. The reduced duration of pregnancy complete with the accelerated fetal mutation (also caused by the stress) resulted in better perinatal outcome, and statistically significantly lower percentage of Cesarean section...|$|E

40|$|Objective. - Evaluate {{changes in}} {{obstetrical}} and neonatal outcome {{of women who}} delivered in maternity hospital since the 19 (th) century. Materials and Methods. - Data from a historic cohort of 1022 women who delivered between 1871 and 1874 in the hotel Dieu hospital of Marseille were compared to those from 1159 women who delivered from 2005 to 2006 in the level 3 maternity of Nord hospital of Marseille (contemporary cohort). Deliveries that had occured before 22 weeks and/or with a foetal birth weight of less than 500 g were excluded. Results. - A total of 2131 pregnancies were included: 1011 and 1120 in historic and contemporary cohort, respectively. Despite comparable mean <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> mean birth weight of neonates from historic cohort were significantly lower: 2971 g (550 - 4900 g) vs 3250 g (500 - 5375 g), respectively (p < 0. 001). Stillbirths were reported in 72 (7. 1 %) cases in historic cohort compared to nine (0. 8 %) in contemporary cohort (p < 0. 001).

40|$|An {{important}} contribution to the variability of any proteome is given by the time dimension that should be carefully considered to define physiological modifications. To this purpose, whole saliva proteome was investigated in a wide age range. Whole saliva was collected from 17 preterm newborns with a postconceptional age at birth of 178 - 217 days. In these subjects sample collection was performed serially starting immediately after birth and within about 1 year follow-up, gathering a total of 111 specimens. Furthermore, whole saliva was collected from 182 subjects aged between 0 and 17 years and from 23 adults aged between 27 and 57 years. The naturally occurring intact salivary proteome of the 316 samples was analyzed by low- and high-resolution HPLC-ESI-MS platforms. Proteins peculiar of the adults appeared in saliva with different time courses during human development. Acidic proline-rich proteins encoded by PRH 2 locus and glycosylated basic proline-rich proteins encoded by PRB 3 locus appeared following 180 days of postconceptional age, followed at 7 months (± 2 weeks) by histatin 1, statherin, and P-B peptide. The other histatins and acidic proline-rich proteins encoded by PRH 1 locus appeared in whole saliva of babies from 1 to 3 weeks after the normal <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> S-type cystatins appeared at 1 year (± 3 months), and basic proline-rich proteins appeared at 4 years (± 1 year) of age.

We studied 21 pregnancies in 12 RT patients with mean age of 29. 9 ± 5. 3 years. The mean duration of RT to 1 st pregnancy was 42 (21 - 68. 5) months and the median follow-up period was 112. 5 (138 - 165) months. The pregnancy was planned in 28. 6 % of the cases. At the time of the diagnosis of the pregnancy, all the patients were maintained on corticosteroids and cyclosporine, 14. 3 % of the patients were on mycophenolate mofetil, and 71. 4 % of the patients were on azathioprine. The high blood pressure was present before the pregnancy in 33. 3 % of the patients. During pregnancy, proteinuria appeared in 20 % of the cases, urinary tract infection in 33. 3 %, and preeclampsia in 5 %. Anemia was present in all the patients during pregnancy. The doses of cyclosporine were increased during pregnancy. The mean <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> was 37 ± 2 weeks. Premature delivery was observed in 19 % of the cases, fetal death in utero in 10 %, and abortion in 15 %.
