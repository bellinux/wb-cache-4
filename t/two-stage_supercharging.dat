2500|$|Unlike the Merlin, the Griffon was {{designed}} {{from the outset}} to use a single-stage supercharger driven by a two-speed, hydraulically operated gearbox; the production versions, the Griffon II, III, IV, and VI series, were designed to give their maximum power at low altitudes and were mainly used by the Fleet Air Arm. The Griffon 60, 70, and 80 series featured <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharging</b> and achieved their maximum power at low to medium altitudes. The Griffon 101, 121, and 130 series engines, collectively designated Griffon 3 SML, used a two-stage, three-speed supercharger, adding a set of [...] "Low Supercharger (L.S)" [...] gears to the already existing Medium and Full Supercharger (M.S and F.S) gears. Another modification was to increase the diameters of both impellers, thus increasing the rated altitudes at which maximum power could be generated in each gear. While the 101 continued to drive a five-blade propeller, the 121 and 130 series were designed to drive contra-rotating propellers. In 1946 a Griffon 101 was fitted to the Supermarine Spiteful XVI, RB518 (a re-engined production Mk.XIV); this aircraft achieved a maximum speed of 494mph (795km/h) with full military equipment.|$|E

5000|$|In the Battle of Britain the Spitfire and Hurricane planes {{powered by}} the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine were {{equipped}} largely with single stage and singlespeed superchargers. Stanley Hooker of Rolls Royce, to improve the performance of Merlin engine developed two-speed <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharging</b> with aftercooling with a successful application on the Rolls Royce Merlin 61 aero engine in 1942. Horsepower was increased and performance at all aircraft heights. Hooker's developments allowed the aircraft they powered to maintain a crucial advantage over the German aircraft they opposed throughout World War II despite the German engines being significantly larger in displacement. [...] Two-stage superchargers were also always two-speed. After the air was compressed in the low-pressure stage, the air flowed through an intercooler radiator where it was cooled before being compressed again by the high-pressure stage and then possibly also aftercooled in another heat exchanger. Two-stage compressors provided much improved high altitude performance, as typified by the Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 powered Supermarine Spitfire Mk IX and the North American Mustang.|$|E

5000|$|In {{answer to}} a request from the British Air Ministry for a high-altitude Merlin for the Wellington VI bomber, a Rolls-Royce team under the {{direction}} of Stanley Hooker developed a Merlin with <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharging,</b> which became the Merlin 60-series, the first engine being run in March 1941, and first flown in July the same year, this engine, after the Wellington VI was canceled, was instead introduced on the Spitfire IX as the Merlin 61 and was later produced by Packard as the V-1650-3 and became known as the [...] "high altitude" [...] Merlin destined for the P-51, the first two-stage Merlin-Mustang conversion flying with a Merlin 61 as the Mustang X in October 1942, the production V-1650-3 engined P-51B (Mustang III) entering service in 1943. The two-speed, two-stage supercharger section of the two-stage Merlins and V-1650-3 featured two separate impellers on the same shaft that were normally driven through a gear train at a ratio of 6.391:1. A hydraulic gear change arrangement of oil-operated clutches could be engaged by an electric solenoid to increase this ratio to 8.095:1 in high speed blower position.|$|E
50|$|In late 1944, the Bureau of Ships {{consulted}} {{with a group}} of submarine officers chaired by COMSUBPAC Admiral Charles A. Lockwood on specifications for a future submarine. Several designs were considered. The submarine officers wanted a deeper test depth, more torpedo tubes, and a higher speed, but got only part of what they wanted. The final design merged ambition with realism. Known as Design B, it was developed by May 1945. It was to be 336 ft long, 1960 long ton t surfaced displacement (2990 long ton t submerged), with larger engines (12-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse with <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharging)</b> for a speed of 22.5 kn surfaced. Armament was to be twelve 21 in torpedo tubes (six forward, six aft), with six short 21 in external torpedo tubes in the superstructure for the Mark 27 acoustic homing anti-escort torpedo. The external tubes would be arranged with three each firing to port and starboard. Test depth would be increased to 500 ft. The wind-down of submarine production in 1945 brought an end to this project. Had SS-551 through SS-562 not been cancelled, it is possible they would have been built to the new design.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} design of the {{supercharging}} system for a strongly downsized engine, to be installed on a sport car. Design is supported by cfd- 1 d engine simulations, using an experimentally calibrated model. The goal of the supercharging system is to deliver the required values of boost pressure at steady operating conditions, and to maintain or improve the full size engine response during acceleration (one of the most critical issues for downsized engines). Two options have been considered: 1) two-stage turbocharging, with two small turbochargers as a high-pressure stage, and one big turbo as low pressure stage (referred to as "TRITURBO"; 2) <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharging</b> made up of one low pressure stage turbocharger and one electric supercharger (referred to as "E-SUPER"). It was found that both configurations not only allow the downsized engine to comply with the performance targets at wide open throttle, steady conditions, but they are also able to improve the transient response in comparison to the full size engine. TRITURBO is less expensive than E-SUPER, but also less fuel efficient and more difficult to install on the vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{supercharging}} system {{investigated in}} this study is made up of a traditional turbocharger, coupled with a Roots-type positive displacement compressor. An electrically actuated clutch allows the compressor to be disengaged from the engine at high speed and under partial load steady operations (such as the ones occurring in a driving cycle). This concept of supercharging has been applied to the downsizing of a reference engine (a 2. 5 litre, turbocharged, four cylinder, high speed DI Diesel engine), without penalization on the maximum brake power (110 kW) and transient response. For such a purpose, a “paper” engine has been theoretically characterized. The gross engine parameters have been optimised by means of 1 -D numerical simulations, using a computational model previously validated against experiments. Performances of the reference and the downsized engine have been compared, considering both steady and transient operating conditions, full and partial load. The <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharging</b> system allows the “paper” engine to provide higher values of torque at low engine speed and full load, and to perform slightly better in terms of transient response. Furthermore, when considering operating conditions occurring in the European Driving cycle (Roots compressor disengaged), the downsized engine shows lower fuel consumption (from 6 to 24 %), and lower pollutant emissions...|$|E

500|$|In 1940, after {{receiving}} a request in March of that year from the Ministry of Aircraft Production for a high-rated (...) Merlin for use as an alternative engine to the turbocharged Hercules VIII used in the prototype high-altitude Vickers Wellington V bomber, Rolls-Royce started experiments {{on the design of}} a <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharger</b> and an engine fitted with this was bench-tested in April 1941, eventually becoming the Merlin 60. The basic design used a modified Vulture supercharger for the first stage while a Merlin 46 supercharger was used for the second. A liquid-cooled intercooler on top of the supercharger casing was used to prevent the compressed air/fuel mixture from becoming too hot. Also considered was an exhaust-driven turbocharger but, although a lower fuel consumption was an advantage the added weight and the need to add extra ducting for the exhaust flow and waste-gates, meant that this option was rejected in favour of the <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharger.</b> [...] Fitted with the <b>two-stage</b> two-speed <b>supercharger,</b> the Merlin 60 series gained 300 horsepower (224kW) at [...] over the Merlin 45 series, at which altitude a Spitfire IX was nearly [...] faster than a Spitfire V.|$|R
5000|$|The {{genesis of}} the P.111 was in 1938, when the Regia Aeronautica awarded a {{contract}} to Piaggio to construct the prototype of a three-seat, twin-engine, high-speed, high-altitude bomber with a pressurized cabin.

50|$|The {{benefits}} of a <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharger</b> eventually became so clear that Allison did make some efforts in this direction. Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger in various configurations to the existing engine-mounted supercharger and carburetor. Early versions of these <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharger</b> engines were used on the P-63. No intercooler, aftercooler, or backfire screen (flame trap) were incorporated into these two-stage V-1710 engines (except for the V-1710-119 used on the experimental P-51J, which had an aftercooler). The two-stage Merlin engines had all of these features, which were designed to prevent detonation from charge heating and backfire into the supercharger. The G-series V-1710s installed on the F-82 E/F/G models had only anti-detonation injection (ADI) {{to deal with these}} problems, and not surprisingly had severe reliability and maintenance problems. In one record, it was stated that the F-82 required 33 hours of maintenance for each hour of flight.|$|R

He helped Stanley Hooker to design and develop the Merlin <b>two-stage</b> <b>supercharger</b> used in the Merlin 60-series.|$|R
