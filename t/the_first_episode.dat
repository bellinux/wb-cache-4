5|$|After Stuart Urban {{left the}} {{production}} and the decision {{had been made to}} re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>episode</b> should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>episode</b> because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play.

5|$|Even {{though this}} episode aired {{as the last}} episode of the first season, it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>episode</b> in {{production}} and {{was intended to be}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>episode</b> to air from the half-hour show. The series is a spin-off from The Tracey Ullman Show in which the family already appeared in a series of animated one-minute shorts. The characters were already created, but had to be further developed in order to carry a half-hour show. The episode was therefore meant as an introduction to the characters. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and writer/producer Sam Simon (of such television series as Cheers) wrote the script for the episode. Both Groening and Simon are credited with developing the series along with executive producer James L. Brooks. The name of Ms. Botz was based on a real person that once babysat Groening.|$|E
