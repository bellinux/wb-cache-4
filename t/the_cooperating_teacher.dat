Through {{an examination of}} the identity of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher,</b> this study interrogates the relationships that exist between the pedagogical and the practical in pre-service teacher education, specifically within the phenomenon of student teaching. An investigation of the lifeworld of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher,</b> exclusively through her use of language, reveals the experience of living one's expectations for another (the student teacher). Through a close examination of the identity of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> as mentor, a complex and dynamic relationship between two people is revealed, comprised of a myriad of power implications. To understand {{what it means to be}} a cooperating teacher is to understand the meaning structures that have come to restrict, challenge, or question the nature of mentoring and, consequently, student teaching. This study takes investigative and analytical methodologies towards a more nuanced approach to performing research, specifically through Mark Vagle's post-intentional phenomenology, Gunther Kress's multimodal discourse analysis, Norman Fairclough's critical discourse analysis, and critical arts-based research in the style of Postcolonial activist artist, Jean Michel Basquiat.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{in the field of}} teacher education has recognized <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> as the most important member of the professional team which supervises the clinical laboratory experience of the student teacher. In fact, various educators have noted that no single individual has so direct an influence as <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> in shaping the attitudes, skills, and ideas of a prospective teacher. In spite of the recognition given to the significant role <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> plays in the daily supervision of the student teacher, information is still missing on the identification and validation of important tasks or competencies necessary for <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> to perform. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify specific competencies of secondary school cooperating teachers, to determine the degree of importance of these competencies, and to analyze the differences in perceptions regarding the most important competencies. Respondents in the study were cooperating teachers, student teachers, and university supervisors associated with student teaching programs at The University of Arizona during the 1978 - 79 academic year. The study was conducted in the following manner: (1) A search of the literature was completed to locate lists of existing cooperating teacher competencies. (2) A list of cooperating teacher competencies published in 1966, by the Association of Teacher Educators was adopted as a starting point for competency identification. (3) A jury of eleven experts critiqued the original 35 competencies for appropriateness and clarity. These experts also offered suggestions for additional competencies. (4) The list of competencies was then revised to include new competencies, strengthen each existing competency, eliminate duplication, and correct grammatical inconsistencies. (5) To insure content validity, the list was next critiqued by two research specialists, who examined the competencies for appropriateness, clarity, and completeness. (6) Revised once again, the final list served as the data gathering instrument for this study. All 32 competencies identified in this study were validated. The most crucial competency identified as necessary/most important for <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> was a human relations competency, that of maintaining communication. In fact, those competencies considered to be more directly related to maintaining interpersonal human relations and those more closely related to classroom interactions were perceived by all groups as more important for <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> than were other competencies. Consistently, cooperating teachers viewed competencies as more important than did student teachers. As a result of their perceptions, university supervisors placed themselves in a middle position with perceptions overlapping those of both cooperating teachers and student teachers. Experience in teaching and subject matter specialization had little effect on perceptual differences regarding competencies. Experience in supervision and amount of graduate study did not impact on perceptual differences at all. Integrating these competencies into teacher education inservice programs would necessitate determining the following: (1) perceived need for developing each competency; (2) current level of competency integration; (3) instructional methods for facilitating competency achievement; (4) criteria for assessing achievement of competencies.

40|$|Collaboration is {{becoming}} increasingly important {{in the realm of}} education (Novoa, 2004). For instance, as soon as training is undertaken, the future teacher must develop an ability to cooperate in a pedagogical context. However, in order to learn to make a relevant contribution to a teaching team’s undertakings and to provide innovative suggestions in pedagogical matters (Gouvernement du Québec, 2001), the student teacher needs solid backing from <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher.</b> A student teacher’s willingness to reflect on and to question his own teaching practices will create a much more promising learning context (Portelance & Durand, 2006). Reciprocally, <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> will make a positive contribution to the student teacher by accepting that his positions be questioned and even altered (Johnston, Wetherill & Greenebaum, 2002). It is the dynamics of sharing of knowledge and know-how in this partnership that retains our interest. From 2004 to 2007, the researchers carried out a study of the subject by examining four practicum sessions at high school level in a number of Quebec schools. To gather data, the researchers used written questionnaires, individual interviews, as well as recordings of conversations between student teachers and their cooperating teachers.

However, the level of support given varied from the roles expected. This study focuses on the roles of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> as perceived by the pre-service teachers and the cooperating teachers themselves. A case study with embedded cases of seven pre-service teachers and six cooperating teachers at three secondary schools was employed using interviews for data collection. The findings of this study confirmed the different levels of support given to the pre-service teachers with regard to their use of ICT during field experience. Results indicated that both pre-service teachers and cooperating teachers have identified specific roles that each must engage in to strengthen their relationship. These roles include having <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> as a role model, evaluator, mentor and peer to the pre service teachers. This study was limited in that it was designed as a case study, and thus, limits the generalizability of the findings to other contexts. Therefore, further research into the practice of a larger sample of Malaysian pre service teachers and cooperating teachers may reveal variations of practice as well as enabling greater confirmation and generalisation of these findings. Although the cooperating teachers in general, do not use the ICT in their teaching, it is recommended that they support and give the opportunity to the pre-service teachers to enhance their ICT knowledge and skill.

This study was concerned with the development of a model for the supervision of preservice teachers based upon a partnership between universities and public schools. The result is the creation of an environment for field experiences that reflects current educational theory and practice. The process for developing the model involved {{a review of the literature}} concerning (a) the amount of influence <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> and the university supervisor exert upon the student teacher; (b) the expectations and problems experienced by <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> and the university supervisor regarding the purposes and objectives of the clinical experience; (c) the role and expectations of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> and the university supervisor; and (d) the current and proposed training and selection practices for cooperating teachers and university supervisors. A related review was devoted to discussions and examples of models demonstrating collaborative partnerships between universities and public schools, rooted in a shared knowledge base, that reflect ideal environments for preservice field experiences. Common themes were then obtained from the analysis of literature and a theoretical model for the supervision of preservice teachers was developed. The model encouraged the cultivation of a cadre of cooperating teachers who assume supervisory responsibilities under the guidance of university faculty. An emphasis on collaborative planning, active involvement, competent leadership, and adequate funding was integrated throughout the development of the phases of the model. The six phases of the model are: initiation/collaboration, planning, development of a knowledge base, redefinition of major roles, strategy, and assessment and evaluation. Several conclusions concerning the implementation of the model for the supervision of preservice teachers were drawn from the study. Cooperating teachers, educated in the supervision of student teachers, will be prepared to help student teachers become teachers. Furthermore, the improvement of the supervision of preservice teachers is the joint responsibility of universities and public schools engaged in the development of classroom environments in which their exists a meaningful articulation between college-based and field-based experiences.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a {{proposed}} in-service program for <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> who supervise student <b>teachers.</b> Forty-one <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> for <b>the</b> Home Economics Education Department of Oregon State University rated the competencies of a good supervisor of student teachers. Also, 17 heads of home economics teacher education departments in universities and colleges suggested what preparation and on-going help <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> should have. An analysis of the data revealed that the department heads believe a formal graduate course in supervision was a necessity. In addition, seminars or workshops at regular intervals were also deemed important for updating. It was learned the majority of the respondents had never had a course or in-service training in supervision other than <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> seminars and a large number felt themselves deficient in many areas. It was found a number of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> experience common problems, such as: methods of evaluation, techniques in developing ability within the student teacher to express and use her own ideas, need for a class on supervision, ways of being more helpful in general to the student teacher, how to effectively guide the student teacher without doing too much for them and help the student teacher build self-confidence. The respondents were asked to rate 30 competencies of <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers.</b> Twenty-nine competencies were rated by <b>the</b> majority of <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> as being "important" or "very important. " Using the data in the study, a proposed in-service program was outlined and methods by which it could be taught...|$|R
40|$|Professional Developments Schools are {{innovations}} in which universities are joined with public {{schools for the}} following purposes: to improve the education of teacher candidates, to provide professional development for current educators, to improve student learning, and to improve educational practices through research and collaboration. Commonly, in a professional development school, teacher candidates are immersed in one school setting. This 2 -year study used qualitative research when analyzing the reflective journals of ten teacher candidates in one rural, elementary, public school setting. All teacher candidates {{included in this study}} were from one teacher preparatory institution that is part of a state-wide system. <b>Cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> matched with teacher candidates were tenured faculty with prior experience in serving as mentors to <b>teacher</b> candidates. <b>Cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> had taught on average 10. 36 years in the grade that they were providing instruction and 19. 8 years in their teaching careers.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the teaching experiences of six elementary preservice teachers (EPTs), three with high mathematics anxiety and three with low mathematics anxiety, during their student teaching semester. The EPTs were selected from an initial pool of 121 EPTs who took the Abbreviated Mathematics Anxiety Scale. The cases were compared in a cross case analysis to highlight mathematics teaching experiences among EPTs. Data sources included EPT and researcher journal entries, interview transcripts, pre-lesson surveys, field notes, lesson plans, and artifacts of observed lessons. Data were coded using Shulman’s content knowledge, Graeber’s mathematics pedagogical content knowledge, and mathematics anxiety characteristics. ^ Findings revealed both similarities and differences across EPTs as related to four major categories: (a) planning and resources used, (b) role of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher,</b> (c) content knowledge, and (d) pedagogical content knowledge. All EPTs used mostly direct instruction and relied on the course textbook and their respective cooperating teacher as their primary resources for planning. Additionally, across participants, <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teacher</b> influenced EPTs’ perceptions of students and teaching. Also, EPTs with high mathematics anxiety were weaker with respect to content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. Findings suggest a need to re-design methods courses to address improving the pedagogical content knowledge of EPTs with mathematics anxiety. Findings also suggest a need to develop content specific mathematics courses for EPTs to improve their content knowledge. Future studies could include a longitudinal study to follow highly anxious EPTs who take content specific elementary mathematics courses to observe their content knowledge and mathematics anxiety. ...|$|E
40|$|Students at West Virginia University {{pursuing}} teaching {{certification in}} special education {{in the areas of}} mental retardation, learning disabilities, or behavior disorders complete a practicum experience. As many of the students are off-campus in rural areas and are employed full-time in teaching positions, a heavy demand was created for non-traditional practicum experiences. Development of on-the-job practicum experiences ameliorated the situation, but in turn created a need for supervision that could not be met by existing faculty resources. A program was developed to train <b>cooperating</b> master <b>teachers</b> as practicum supervisors, capitalizing on their years of training and experience and their knowledge of administrative policies, available resources, and contact persons.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contained three {{articles that}} explored teacher preparation in Agricultural Education. The first article was a descriptive-correlational study; it described {{the relationship between}} pre-service teachers 2 ̆ 7 performance on PRAXIS II (initial teacher licensing examination) and their performance on college academic measures. The study utilized existing records from the Department Agricultural Education and studies at Iowa State University. Professional education GPA explained significant variability in principles of learning and teaching (PLT) scores. Males scored higher than females on the Agriculture content (AgC) test. Agriculture GPA did not explain significant variability in AgC scores. Additional research should be conducted to determine whether similar results would be obtained with other licensure areas. Further research should explore the relationship between gender and performance on the AgC test of the PRAXIS II examination;The second article described agricultural education <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> 2 ̆ 7 supervision behaviors as they supervised Agricultural Education student teachers. The study determined {{the extent to which}} <b>cooperating</b> agricultural education <b>teachers</b> used selected supervision models. The relationships between maturity characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> and their choices of a supervision model were also examined. Results showed that <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> commonly used clinical, contextual, and conceptual supervision models. They also commonly used nondirective and directive informational styles from the developmental supervision model. Maturity of <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> was not related to their choices of structured or unstructured models of supervision;The third article was a survey study; it described Agricultural Education student teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions and preferences of the type of supervision they experienced from their student teaching supervisors. The results revealed that student teachers perceived both their <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> and university supervisors to engage in contextual and clinical supervision practices. Most <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> were also perceived to use the non-directive style of developmental supervision while most university supervisors were perceived to use collaborative style. Most student teachers felt that supervision practices from all supervision models were important to them. Of the developmental supervision styles, most student teachers preferred the collaborative supervision style.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} the structured observation of student teaching affects student teacher performance. A Structured Observation Scale (SOS), as an instrument for student teaching classroom observation, and a Satisfaction Scale (SS), to assess <b>the</b> satisfaction of <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> student teachers, and university supervisors with the observation techniques, were developed using the Delphi technique. Criterion statements were submitted to a Delphi panel of <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> and university supervisors. The study was organized as a posttest-only control group design. The two-way analysis of variance and the Student's "t" test were utilized as the statistical tools. A total of 30 randomly selected secondary student teachers composed the sample of this study. Thirty-seven <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> 300 pupils, and 17 university supervisors also participated in this research. <b>The</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>the</b> university supervisors in the experimental group used the SOS every time they made an official observation of a student teacher, while the control group used the traditional observation techniques. The student teacher performance was evaluated on the Purdue Teacher Evaluation Scale (PTES) prior {{to the end of the}} student teaching program. Satisfaction with supervisory observation was assessed on the Satisfaction Scale. A high reliability coefficient of both the SOS (r = + 0. 96) and the SS (r = + 0. 95) was found. The content validity of the SOS and the SS was confirmed by consensus of Delphi panel members. The student teachers in the experimental group performed significantly better than those in the control group based on the PTES scores. A significant difference existed between the secondary school pupils and the university supervisors in rating of the control group of student teachers. However, there were no significant differences among the rater groups in the experimental group. Interaction between the treatment and the raters was significant with ordinal interaction among <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers,</b> pupils, and student teachers; and disordinal interaction occurred between student teachers and university supervisors. Student teacher performance was compared between the control group and the experimental group based on the rating of each rater group. Significant differences were found on total score of the PTES as rated by <b>the</b> <b>cooperating</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>the</b> pupils, with the total means of the experimental group being greater than the control group. Neither student teachers nor university supervisors evaluated the experimental group significantly different than the control group in student teaching performance. It was concluded from analysis of overall satisfaction with classroom observation techniques that significant differences existed with the mean score of the control group being greater than the experimental group...|$|R
