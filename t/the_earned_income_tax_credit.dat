2500|$|In the United States, {{earned income}} tax credit rates, also known as EITC or EIC, vary by state—some are {{refundable}} while other states do not allow a refundable tax credit. The federal EITC program has been expanded by a number of presidents including Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. In 1986, President Reagan described the EITC as [...] "the best anti poverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress." [...] The ability of <b>the</b> <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> to deliver larger monetary benefits to the poor workers than an {{increase in the minimum wage}} and at a lower cost to society was documented in a 2007 report by the Congressional Budget Office.|$|E
2500|$|A {{refundable}} {{tax credit}} is a mechanism whereby {{the tax system}} can reduce the tax owed by a household to below zero, and result in a net payment to the taxpayer beyond their own payments into the tax system. Examples of refundable tax credits include <b>the</b> <b>earned</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> and the additional child tax credit in the US, and working tax credits and child tax credits in the UK. Such a system is slightly different from a negative income tax, in that the refundable tax credit is usually only paid to households that have earned at least some income. [...] This policy is more targeted against poverty than the minimum wage, because it avoids subsidizing low-income workers who are supported by high-income households (for example, teenagers still living with their parents).|$|E

In what {{is probably the best}} evaluation of that program to date, Hotz et al. (2006) examined the impact of a substantial liberalization of the EITC during the period 1991 – 2000 for welfare recipients with two or more children.

5000|$|Throughout American {{history the}} {{enactment}} of direct spending social welfare programs has caused debate, controversy and resistance. However, history shows that the tax expenditures associated with the hidden welfare state have been fairly easy to enact. They have been enacted at a steady rate and have not {{been the result of}} social movements or mass protest. A reason tax expenditures have been able to be enacted without much debate is simply because many people did not know about them. These items {{were not included in the}} governments until after 1969. As Edward Berkowitz explains, [...] "people who wanted to know the value of, say, the mortgage deduction needed to do the calculations themselves, making an esoteric subject that much more arcane." [...] Moderate and conservative members of United States Congress have been the main people behind many of the tax expenditures that make up the hidden welfare state, which is ironic because they are usually seen as antagonistic to new social programs. Christopher Howard points out that [...] "the tax expenditure for corporate pensions had probably the quietest start of any major social program in contemporary welfare state. It was approved without debate late one night as Congress worked out the details of the Revenue Act of 1926." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Earned</b> <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> was created during the debates over the Family Assistance Plan.
