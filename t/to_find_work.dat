5|$|In 1906 72 {{percent of}} Christian Scientists in the United States were female, against 49 {{percent of the}} population. The church was {{attractive}} to women because it offered professional opportunities when {{it was difficult for}} women <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>work</b> outside the home.

Joy Lauren, who portrayed Bree's daughter, Danielle, and Lyndsy Fonseca, who played Katherine's daughter, Dylan, also left the main cast, although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star. Because the fourth season ended leaving Mike's whereabouts unknown, James Denton's return to the series was questioned during hiatus. Denton stated in May2008 that producers would not make a decision on his character until mid-June and that he was preparing <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>work</b> in case his contract was terminated.

Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint {{employed}} forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin planchets {{to make sure they}} were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.|$|E

The family was forced to return to Germany in 1928, when the Chinese Civil War broke out. During World War II, Hartmann's younger brother, Alfred, also joined the Luftwaffe, serving as a gunner on a Junkers Ju 87 in North Africa. He was captured by the British and spent four years as a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost their jobs, and while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>work</b> as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
