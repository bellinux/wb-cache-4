5|$|The {{violence}} {{which had}} plagued Honiara and the islands {{since the late}} 1990s had a devastating impact on the economy {{due to the fact}} that virtually all tourist organisations around the world specifically warned tourists wishing to visit the islands <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>away,</b> especially in 2002 and 2003 at the peak of the troubles.

40|$|The Indian Ocean {{is famous}} for its {{well-documented}} Jewish and Islamic trading networks of the medieval and early modern periods. Social networks that eased the challenges of cross-cultural trade have a much longer history in the region, however. The great distances covered by merchants and the seasonality of the monsoons left few alternatives <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>away</b> for prolonged periods of time, and shipwreck, piracy, and the slave trade caused people to end up on coasts far away from home. Networks of merchants developed in the Indian Ocean region that depended on a degree of social cohesion. This article draws up a map of selected merchant communities in the western Indian Ocean, and argues that geographical origin, ethnicity, and religion may have been different ways of establishing the necessary infrastructure of trust...|$|R
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>away</b> from all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E

5|$|Poisonous {{sausages}} containing toad meat {{are being}} trialled in the Kimberley (Western Australia) {{to try to}} protect native animals from cane toads' deadly impact.

Researcher David Pearson says trials run in laboratories and in remote parts of the Kimberley region of WA are looking promising, although the baits will not solve the cane toad problem altogether.|$|E
