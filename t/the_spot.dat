5|$|If a {{laser beam}} is swept quickly across a distant object, <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> of light can move faster thanc, {{although}} the initial movement of <b>the</b> <b>spot</b> is delayed {{because of the time}} it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedc from the laser to the various positions of <b>the</b> <b>spot.</b> Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time. In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to recognize <b>the</b> microarray image <b>spots.</b> <b>The</b> approach {{is based on the}} detection of wavelet modulus maxima in the microarray images.

Then, the intensities within the contour of <b>the</b> <b>spots</b> can be obtained with low error rate. The test results on example image show this is an effective approach, especially for those spots with low intensities...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>spotted</b> sunfish {{has been}} shown to have {{potential}} as an indicator species. Spotted sunfish select habitats with high complexity and depth.

Though <b>the</b> <b>spotted</b> sunfish itself is not threatened, managing for this fish benefits the entire aquatic community.

40|$|AbstractThree {{competing}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed for the cortical representation of <b>the</b> blind <b>spot.</b> These are: (i) the regions surrounding <b>the</b> blind <b>spot</b> maintain their spatial values; (ii) the opposite sides of <b>the</b> blind <b>spot</b> are represented adjacently at the cortex, so that <b>the</b> blind <b>spot</b> is “sewn-up”; and (iii) <b>the</b> blind <b>spot</b> is sewn-up with compensation occurring in the immediate surround of <b>the</b> blind <b>spot,</b> so that spatial values are distorted only in the immediate surround of <b>the</b> blind <b>spot.</b> To distinguish between these hypotheses we used a two-dot alignment task, with the two dots straddling <b>the</b> blind <b>spot</b> at varying dot separations. Thresholds in the two-dot alignment task are limited by the cortical separation of the two dots. When thresholds for alignment across <b>the</b> blind <b>spot</b> are compared with thresholds over intact retina at the same eccentricity, the three hypotheses predict: (i) no change in thresholds; (ii) a lowering of thresholds; and (iii) a lowering of thresholds but only at separations slightly greater than the diameter of <b>the</b> blind <b>spot.</b> Thresoolds across <b>the</b> blind <b>spot</b> were closely similar to thresholds across intact retina. The results do not support a sewing-up (with or without compensation) of <b>the</b> blind <b>spot.</b> Rather, our {{results are consistent with}} a preservation of spatial values around <b>the</b> blind <b>spot...</b>|$|R
