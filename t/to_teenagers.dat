5|$|Globally, condoms are {{the most}} common method of birth control. Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane, or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or polyurethane. Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available <b>to</b> <b>teenagers</b> does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere {{from the}} idea of a teenager's coming out after hearing that his friend's son had come out to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out <b>to</b> <b>teenagers</b> in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E
