She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} part of {{the south}} nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from medieval times; the north doorway and tracery (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged {{by the addition of}} a south porch and a second nave to the north. An arcade (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are St Beuno's, Aberffraw and St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> of a benefactor.|$|E
5|$|Until 1996, the {{domestic}} situation during Unas' reign {{was thought to}} have been disastrous, based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine. This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure, who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty. In addition, research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers, nomads distinguished by their specific hair-style, rather than Egyptians. Thus, these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} a nave with a north aisle and vestry, a Perpendicular Gothic west tower, a chancel and a south porch. The nave was rebuilt {{in the late}} 15th or early 16th century to meet a tower of {{approximately}} the same age; it is often dated to 1521, but appears to be built on older foundations. The southern side of the nave contains what are probably thirteenth-century buttresses {{and a pair of}} Perpendicular Gothic windows. The north aisle was originally built in the 13th century, and rebuilt by H.J. Underwood in 1890; the vestry was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in 1846 to designs by Chamberlain, through <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> of the curate, Alexander Penrose Forbes. The church has been reroofed at least twice, in 1825 and 1897.|$|E

5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of <b>the</b> <b>generosity</b> and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I argue that {{foundational}} to attaining Cartesian generosity, {{both as a}} passion and as a virtue are the clear and distinct perceptions of mind, God, and body. I challenge Lisa Shapiro???s account of generosity, and her suggestion that <b>generosity</b> regulates <b>the</b> passions expressed in the meditations. Unlike Shapiro I attend closely to the distinction between <b>the</b> passion of <b>generosity</b> and <b>the</b> virtue of <b>generosity,</b> and how to acquire these different states of the soul. I propose that <b>the</b> passion of <b>generosity</b> cannot be aroused in the soul until after the meditations have been completed and the full inventory of clear and distinct perceptions attained. 1 interpret the meditations as orienting the meditator towards attaining virtue; by putting her {{in a position to}} attend frequently to the nature of free will after the six meditations have been completed. I interpret this frequent attendance to the will as a ???Seventh Meditation,??? which arouses <b>the</b> passion of <b>generosity.</b> After <b>the</b> passion has been attained, <b>the</b> virtue of <b>generosity</b> can then be acquired through self-cultivation, which instills generosity as a habit of the soul. <b>The</b> virtue of <b>generosity</b> is what allows one to gain mastery of the passions, and I provide an account of how this can be done through a process of reconditioning the passions...|$|R
