2500|$|Most {{vibration}} {{testing is}} {{conducted in a}} 'single DUT axis' at a time, even though most real-world vibration occurs in various axes simultaneously. [...] MIL-STD-810G, released in late 2008, Test Method 527, calls for multiple exciter testing. The vibration <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> used to attach the DUT to the shaker table must be designed for the frequency range of the vibration test spectrum. Generally for smaller fixtures and lower frequency ranges, the designer targets a fixture design that is free of resonances in the test frequency range. This becomes more difficult as the DUT gets larger and as the test frequency increases. In these cases multi-point control strategies can mitigate some of the resonances that may {{be present in the}} future. Devices specifically designed to trace or record vibrations are called vibroscopes.|$|E
50|$|Test {{fixtures}} {{can be set}} up {{in three}} ways: in-line setup, delegate setup, and implicit setup. In-line setup is where the developer creates the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in the same method {{as the rest of the}} test and is the simplest <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> to create but can lead to duplication if multiple tests need to use the same initial data. Delegate setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a separate standalone helper method that can be accessed by multiple test methods. Implicit setup is where the developer places the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> in a setup method which is used to set up multiple test methods. This is different from delegate setup in that the overall setup of multiple tests is in a single setup method where the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> gets created instead of each test method having its own setup procedures and linking to an external <b>test</b> <b>fixture.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{frequency}} limitation {{arising from the}} calibration of asymmetric and symmetric <b>test</b> <b>fixtures</b> has been investigated. For asymmetric <b>test</b> <b>fixtures,</b> a new algorithm based on the thru-short-match (TSM) method is outlined. It is found that the conventional TSM method {{does not have any}} inherent frequency limitation, but using the same procedure with an unknown match may lead to the said problem. This limitation can be avoided by using a different algorithm. The various calibration methods for symmetric <b>test</b> <b>fixtures</b> using known standards are also discussed and the origin of the frequency limitation is identified. Several ways in avoiding the problem are proposed. There is good agreement between the theories and experimental data...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} phase {{uncertainty}} arising in calibration of the <b>test</b> <b>fixtures</b> is investigated in this paper, It is {{shown that the}} problem exists no matter what kinds of calibration standards are used. It is also found {{that there is no}} need to determine the individual S-parameters of the <b>test</b> <b>fixtures.</b> In order to eliminate the problem of phase uncertainty, three different precise (known) reflection standards or one known reflection standard plus one known transmission standard should be used to calibrate symmetrical <b>test</b> <b>fixtures.</b> For the asymmetrical cases, three known standards, including at least one transmission standard, should be used. The thru-open-match (TOM) and thru-short-match (TSM) techniques are the simplest methods, and they have no bandwidth limitation. When the standards are imprecise (unknown), it is recommended to use any suitable technique, such as the thru-reflect-line, line-reflect-line, thru-short-delay, thru-open-delay,line-reflect-match, line-reflect-reflect-match, or multiline methods, to accurately determine the values of the required calibration terms and, in addition, to use the TOM or TSM method with the same imprecise standards to resolve the phase uncertainty...|$|R

5000|$|The company {{devised a}} method for {{applying}} strain gage testing to determining the stresses placed on circuit boards by the {{hundreds or thousands of}} test probes used to make electrical contact therewith. [...] This is useful because each test probe (a.k.a. [...] "pogo pin") exerts several ounces of force on the DUT (Device Under Test). When the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> has thousands of test probes, the sum of the individual probe forces can reach hundreds of pounds. Such force is sufficient to deform the DUT (a printed circuit board, for example) {{to the point where the}} attached inflexible electronic component packages (such as Ball Grid Arrays) may fracture, or their solder joints may fail. Strain gage testing can reveal areas on the DUT where these net forces are excessive when the DUT is clamped into the <b>test</b> <b>fixture,</b> thus showing where supports must be added to the opposite side of the <b>test</b> <b>fixture</b> to counteract the test probe forces. Where a support counteracts the test probe forces, the test probe force is converted from a deformative force distorting the DUT to a compressive force, squeezing the DUT circuit board without deforming its generally planar shape.|$|E
