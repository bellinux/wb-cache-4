"Project Design Statement (PDS) for 12 - 44 Fire Protection Upgrade"-This commitment {{is a new}} <b>commitment.</b> <b>The</b> draft fire SAR/BIO module, coupled with several weapon-specific HARs, indicated the need to establish UV-activated deluge capability {{for a number of}} areas at the Pantex Plant involved in the assembly and disassembly of nuclear explosives. For the majority of affected facilities, the ongoing project to upgrade the capability and reliability of the fire detection and suppression systems has been expanded to include UV detection as the actuator of deluge systems. In this manner, the speed of detection and actuation can be rapid enough to prevent propagation of a fire. Rapid detection and suppression activation would prevent all fire scenarios except those initiated in very close proximity from potentially causing a thermal reaction in the high explosive of a nuclear weapon. However, the Building 12 - 44 cells were not encompassed by the current upgrade and a separate project will be required. As a result, the Department developed the enclosed PDS to initiate upgrading the fire detection and suppression system in Building 12 - 44 to provide UV-activated deluge capability. The completion of the physical modifications to Building 12 - 44 are expected to be completed December 2002 as stated within Commitment 4. 3. 9.

We show that price and volume effects in the energy market are ambigous under {{a wide range of}} alternative levels of <b>the</b> purchaser <b>commitment.</b> We calibrate our model to data for the Norwegian economy. Simulations shows a downward movement in energy prices as the government starts increasing the level of <b>the</b> purchaser <b>commitment.</b> This implies that the producer of ordinary energy pays for the restriction in the market while energy consumption and consumer surplus increases. When <b>the</b> purchaser <b>commitment</b> increases <b>above</b> a certain level, the purchaser price increases and the volume effect is negative.

40|$|In {{our study}} we address the {{detection}} of uncertain GHG emission changes (also termed emission signals) under the Kyoto Protocol. The question to be probed is "how well {{do we need to}} know net emissions if we want to detect a specified emission signal after a given time?" No restrictions exist as to what concerns the net emitter. However, for data availability reasons and because of the excellent possibilityof inter-country comparisons, the Protocols Annex I countries are used as net emitters. Another restriction concerns the exclusion of emissions/removals due to land-use change and forestry (LUCF) as the reporting of their uncertainties is only soon becoming standard practice. Our study centers on the preparatory detection of emission signals, which should have been applied prior to/in negotiating the Kyoto Protocol. Rigorous preparatory signal detection has not yet been carried out, neither prior to the negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol nor afterwards. The starting point for preparatory signal detection is that the Annex I countries under the Kyoto Protocol comply with with their emission limitation or reduction commitments. Uncertainties are already monitored. However, monitored emissions and uncertainties are still dealt with in isolation. A connection between emission and uncertainty estimates for the purpose of an advanced country evaluation has not yet been established. We apply four preparatory signal detection techniques. These are the Critical Relative Uncertainty (CRU) concept, the Verification Time (VT) concept, the Undershooting (Und) concept, and the Undershooting and Verification Time (Und&VT) concepts combined. All of the techniques identify an emission signal and consider the total uncertainty that underlies the countries emissions, either in <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> year/period or in both the base year and <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> year/period. <b>The</b> techniques follow a hierarchical order in terms of complexity permitting to explore their robustness. The most complex technique, the Und&VT concept, considers in addition to uncertainty (1) the dynamics of the signal itself permitting to ask for the verification time, the time when the signal is outstripping total uncertainty; (2) the risk (probability) that the countries true emissions in <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> year/period are <b>above</b> (below) their true emission limitation or reduction commitments; (3) the undershooting that is needed to reduce this risk to a prescribed level; and (4) a corrected undershooting/risk that accounts for detectability, i. e., that fulfills a given commitment period or, equivalently, its maximal allowable verification time. Our preparatory signal detection exercise exemplifies that the negotiations for the Kyoto Protocol were imprudent because they did not consider the consequences of uncertainty, i. e., (1) the risk that the countries true emissions in <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> year/period are <b>above</b> their true emission limitation or reduction commitments; and (2) detectable targets.

40|$|This thesis {{has four}} primary aims. Firstly, I develop {{an account of}} Adorno’s {{critique}} of Kant and Hegel’s philosophy. I argue that the role and structure of judgement is key to his critical analysis. Adorno's discussion of their metaphysics, epistemology revolves around an immanent critique of judgement. This critique reveals, in the dialectical sense, the irreducibility of the 'negative moment' within judgement. This critical exposition grounds the second aim of the thesis. Analysis of Kant and Hegel's philosophies enables us to discern {{a number of key}} concepts in Adorno's own thought, concepts which will help us to understand his notion of negativity. In particular, his dialectical critique produces a constellation of critical - or negative - dialectical concepts: conceptless [begriffslose], non-identity [Nichtidentität], mediation [Vermittlung]. The generation of these concepts and their elucidation provides the basis for the third aim: to give a textually viable and philosophically fruitful explanation of key commitments in Adorno’s negative dialectics. I argue that negative dialectics does not amount to a system, a standpoint, or even a set of principles. Rather, it is a critical activity. <b>The</b> <b>commitments,</b> which revolve around the constellation of concepts outlined above, indicate a critical sensitivity to the limits of epistemology and metaphysics and the problem that these limits pose for judgement. Finally, I develop the resources to answer Michael Rosen’s claim that Adorno’s rejection of Hegelian determinate negation leaves his dialectics without any dynamic force. Drawing upon aesthetics, we can better understand the dynamics of negative dialectics. Aesthetic engagement with artworks not only demonstrates an appropriate orientation of philosophy to material, it is also an appropriate medium through which we can gain a clearer understanding of <b>the</b> philosophical <b>commitments</b> elucidated <b>above.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{evaluation}} criteria {{to measure the}} efficiency of a state’s economic policy in terms of integra-tion processes in the European Union were determined in the Europe 2020 Strategy endorsed by the European Council in June 2010. According to the Strategy, the European Union has committed to seek progress {{in the fields of}} employment, investment in R&D, climate change and energy, education, and poverty reduction. With a view to assessing the economic impact of <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>commitments</b> by <b>the</b> European Union vis-a-vis small European Union countries, this article provides an evaluation of the three objectives of the Europe 2020 Stra-tegy – employment, education, and investment in R&D – and their impact on the economic growth in smaller countries of the European Union. This article concludes that many of the smaller European Union countries choose not to be ambitious enough in their national objectives of employment, education, and investment in R&D areas under the Europe 2020 Strategy and, during the 2011 – 2020 period, they show on average a 4. 8 % lower annual GDP growth than it could potentially be, i. e. they abandon far-reaching ambitious targets...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether and how climate strength and quality are related to employee <b>commitment</b> <b>above</b> and beyond individual climate perceptions. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 48 work units in organizations from different branches of industry. A total of 419 employees completed a questionnaire. Findings - Climate quality was related to <b>commitment</b> <b>above</b> and beyond individual climate perceptions. However, this concerned the climate dimensions of cooperation and innovation, but not reward. Climate strength moderated the relationship between individual cooperation and innovation perceptions, and commitment. Research limitations/implications - This study emphasizes the importance of group-level perceptions as related to employee <b>commitment.</b> Because of <b>the</b> cross-sectional design, conclusions about the causal order of the variables cannot be drawn. Practical implications - If organizations want to increase employees' commitment they should put the more skeptical employees in positive work environments, thus, in units of higher cooperation and innovation quality. Social implications - People are sensitive to the evaluative tone of their social environment. Originality/value - The paper is the first to examine the combined relationships of individual climate perceptions, climate-strength, and climate quality with employee commitment...|$|R

The present experiments examined the role of <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse in <b>the</b> larval-pupal reprogramming of these cells. <b>The</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse did not overtly affect the muscles and motoneurones, but it switched their hormonal responsiveness; before <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse, exposure to ecdysteroids in the presence of JH had no effect on the larval cells, whereas after <b>the</b> <b>commitment</b> pulse <b>the</b> same treatment caused regression and death.
