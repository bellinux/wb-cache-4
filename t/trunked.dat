Hertha originally had three stacks, and during the modernization they were <b>trunked</b> into two funnels. The refit was finished by 1909, at which point Hansa became a cadet training ship. From 1911 to 1912, Günther Lütjens served aboard Hansa as commander of the naval cadets that trained on the ship. Lütjens went on to command the task force composed of Bismarck and Prinz Eugen in World War II. In early January, Hansa cruised into the Atlantic and visited Bermuda.|$|E

The system is uses Terrestrial <b>Trunked</b> Radio {{and allows for}} a common public safety network for all emergency agencies.

In addition to lack of interoperability with paramedics and fire fighters, none of the systems are encrypted, forcing police officers to rely heavily on GSM-based mobile telephones for dispatch communication when transmitting sensitive information.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] To {{explore the}} {{differences}} in bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscle activation between chronic stroke pa-tients and healthy controls, this study investigated the symmetry index and cross-correlation of <b>trunk</b> muscles during <b>trunk</b> flexion and extension movements. This study also assessed {{the differences in}} <b>trunk</b> reposition error between groups and the association between <b>trunk</b> reposition error and bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscle activation. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen stroke patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects participated. Bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscle activations were collected by electromyography during <b>trunk</b> flexion and extension. <b>Trunk</b> reposition errors in <b>trunk</b> flexion and extension directions were recorded by a Qualisys motion capture system. [Results] Compared with the healthy controls, the stroke patients presented lower symmetrical muscle activation of the bilateral internal oblique and lower cross-correlation of abdominal muscles during <b>trunk</b> flexion, and lower symmetry index and cross-correlation of erector spinae in <b>trunk</b> extension. They also showed a larger <b>trunk</b> extension reposition error. A smaller <b>trunk</b> reposition error was associated with higher cross-correlation of bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscles during <b>trunk</b> movements in all subjects. [Conclusion] <b>Trunk</b> muscle function during symmetrical <b>trunk</b> movements and <b>trunk</b> reposition sense were impaired in the chronic stroke patients, and <b>trunk</b> position sense was associated with <b>trunk</b> muscle functions.

5|$|The Terrestrial <b>Trunked</b> Radio {{network has}} three {{components:}} the core net, {{which is a}} centralized computer center based on an Internet Protocol structure; the transmission net, which connects the core net, the radio net and other connection points with high-capacity lines; and the radio net, which consists of base stations with antennas in masts, on buildings and in some tunnels. The network is controlled by Motorola. In case a base station no longer can communicate with the core net, the base station can still relay communication within its range. Should the base station fall out or operations occur in areas without coverage, the terminals can communicate directly with each other.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from the 1925 cruise, the ship was modernized at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She had her twelve old coal-fired boilers replaced with four oil-fired models, which were <b>trunked</b> into a single larger funnel. She also had more deck armor added {{to protect her from}} plunging fire, and a short tripod mast was installed in place of the aft cage mast. The modernization was completed in November 1926, after which Arkansas conducted a shakedown cruise in the Atlantic. She returned to Philadelphia, where she ran acceptance trials before she could rejoin the fleet. On 5 September 1927, Arkansas was present for ceremonies unveiling a memorial tablet honoring the French soldiers and sailors who died during the Yorktown campaign in 1781.|$|E

In June 1924, Florida was taken out of service for a {{modernization}} at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in sponsons, were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were <b>trunked</b> into one stack.

40|$|Although <b>trunk</b> muscle {{function}} {{has been}} suggested to be a determinant of judo performance, its contribution to high-level performance in this sport has been poorly studied. Therefore, several tests {{were used to assess}} the differences in <b>trunk</b> muscle function between 11 international and 14 national level judo practitioners (judokas). <b>Trunk</b> strength and endurance were assessed using isokinetic tests and core stability was assessed using two protocols: 1) sudden loading, to assess <b>trunk</b> responses to unexpected external perturbations; 2) stable and unstable sitting, to assess the participants' ability to control <b>trunk</b> balance. No differences between groups were found for <b>trunk</b> flexor isokinetic strength, <b>trunk</b> responses against lateral and posterior loading and <b>trunk</b> control while sitting. However, international level judokas showed significantly higher <b>trunk</b> extensor isokinetic strength (p < 0. 05) and lower <b>trunk</b> angular displacement after anterior <b>trunk</b> loading (p < 0. 05) than national level judokas. Few and low (r < 0. 512) significant correlations were found between strength, endurance and stability parameters, which suggests that <b>trunk</b> strength and endurance are not limiting factors for <b>trunk</b> stability in competitive judokas. These results support the importance of <b>trunk</b> extensor strength and <b>trunk</b> stability against forward perturbations in elite judo performance...|$|R

50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex <b>trunk</b> circuit, {{outgoing}} <b>trunks</b> are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each <b>trunk</b> circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for <b>trunks</b> {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its <b>trunk</b> link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle <b>trunks</b> in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the <b>trunk</b> link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle <b>trunk</b> and then connect to that <b>trunk</b> through the <b>trunk</b> link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle <b>trunks.</b> This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a <b>trunk</b> group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R
50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} junctor {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} <b>trunk</b> junctor switches in the <b>trunk</b> link frame (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to <b>trunk</b> circuits. The basic design of the TLF has ten junctor switches with their horizontal multiples split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred <b>trunk</b> links to the ten <b>trunk</b> switches. The banjo wiring of the <b>trunk</b> switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each <b>trunk</b> switch to connect sixteen <b>trunks</b> to its twenty <b>trunk</b> links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 <b>trunk</b> concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of deconcentration eventually turned out to provide too few <b>trunk</b> appearances for the variety of <b>trunk</b> types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C <b>trunk</b> switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|R

Results: Participants obtained a median score of 61 out of 100 on the <b>Trunk</b> Control Test and 11 out of 23 for the <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale. Twelve participants (24 %) obtained the maximum score on the <b>Trunk</b> Control Test; no subject reached the maximum score on the <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale.
