5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the early years of}} the legacy. This bequest was {{administered}} by the Corporation of London in around 1460 and a small college was founded next to Guildhall Chapel, also using the library facilities in the chapel. Despite the fact that this continued for over 70 years, the earliest certain evidence of the existence of Carpenter's Children can only be traced back to 1536, and thus it isn't clear who these boys were, what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> and where they lived. In 1547, under the Chantries Act the Guildhall Chapel and Library were forfeited. The funding for the four boys was also discontinued. The Corporation of London remained in control of Carpenter's estate and accounts from the next 300 years show that the money continued to be spent on children's benefits such as providing new coats to every child or providing them with access to education.|$|E

Reading is useful for language acquisition. Provided that the students more or less understand, what they read, the more they read, the better they get at it One of the techniques used in teaching reading is summarizing. Summarizing is the process of identifying the most salient information. In this technique, the students must make summary using their own language based on the text. The formulation of the research problem were: 1) How is the students’ reading achievement before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> using summarizing? 2) How is the students’ reading achievement after <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> using summarizing? 3) Is there any significant effect before and after <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> by using summarizing?

5|$|The new {{religious}} orders {{that became a}} major feature of Scottish monastic life in this period also brought new educational possibilities {{and the need to}} train larger numbers of monks. Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had almonry schools, charity schools using funds from the almoner to provide a type of bursary to educate young boys, who might enter the priesthood. At the Cluniac Paisley Abbey, secular chaplains were employed as schoolmasters. Some monasteries, including the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, Sweetheart Abbey and Beauly, opened their doors to a wider range of students to teach the sons of gentlemen. St Andrews, which was both the seat of a bishop and the site of a major Augustinian foundation, had both a grammar school, under the archdeacon, and a song school, under the priory. The foundation of over 100 collegiate churches of secular priests between 1450 and the Reformation would have necessitated the training of large numbers of choristers. Sometimes, as at Lochwinnoch, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> both music and grammar. Dominican friars were noted for their educational achievements and were usually located in urban centres, probably teaching grammar, as at Glasgow and Ayr. The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns.|$|E

English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Hj. Ida Isnawati, M. Pd. Keyword: Small Group Interaction, Teaching Speaking, SMPN 3 Kedungwaru There {{are many}} kinds of {{techniques}} of teaching speaking that can be used. One of them used in teaching speaking is small group interaction. With this technique, student didnot feel bored and they interested {{in the classroom and}} also can build effective teams and teams work. In this technique, the students are divided into some groups consisting students who have different achievement. Students from different group who get the same topic will discuss together in group. After that, they have to describe one of the pictures in front of other group. The formulations of the research problem were: 1) How is student’s speaking ability before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction in descriptive text? 2) How is student’s speaking ability after <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction in descriptive text? 3) Is there any significant differences between student’s speaking ability before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction in descriptive text and after <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> by using small group interaction?

40|$|Keywords: Effectiveness, Story Telling Technique, Speaking Ability. There {{are many}} {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to teaching English in Junior High School. One of them is using story telling. By using story telling, the teacher can motivate the students to speak based on the story that they have read. Story telling gives students an opportunity to speak at length. Story telling also helps develop oral language proficiency as well as reading comprehension. Storytelling allows students to give knowledge about important aspects of story beginnings and endings, settings, characters, and plot lines. Problem of the research are: (1) How is the students’ ability in speaking before <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> by using story telling technique? (2) How is the students’ ability in speaking after <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> by using story telling technique?
