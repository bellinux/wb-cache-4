5|$|Horny. I'm feeling really horny about it. And very smug … I'm in that mode now, so {{hopefully}} I'll stay {{in it for}} a while … I've got a {{few more}} things planned—at least a couple more albums, some EPs, <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Some more dance-y things I did about 10 years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. They're all pretty much ready to go.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the turning}} points in Zev Aelony’s life {{occurred}} around {{the age of}} 18, when his family was invited to a Minneapolis picnic because of his father’s work with the refugees. Jewish refugees from Europe and Japanese-Americans {{who had been in}} the detention camps out west attended the picnic. Zev Aelony was shocked to meet kids who came out of concentration camps in the United States, a place where he believed <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> did not occur.|$|E

Going through the playoffs and having that experience has probably given me more confidence. I understand {{there is going to be}} a lot more responsibility on my shoulders with this, but it's something I'm ready for, I feel very comfortable with it and I'm just excited to get things going." ...|$|E
500|$|Post-match {{analysis}} showed that referee Oliver had erroneously awarded the corner kick from which Gillingham's goal had been scored, as the ball had in fact come off Barcham and therefore a goal kick should instead have been awarded to Shrewsbury. [...] Paul Simpson referred to this in his post-match comments, but said that [...] "if we look at <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> we will be clutching at straws". [...] Mark Stimson highlighted the financial benefits of his team's promotion, noting that large crowds would be expected for matches in League One against Leeds United, Norwich City and Southampton.|$|E

500|$|In their 2002 book Different Games, Different Rules, Haru Yamada and Deborah Tannen {{recalled}} {{teaching a}} class in London, where a student construed [...] "have a nice day" [...] to be insincere. The student said that Americans [...] "say <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with this big fake smile on their face, and they don't really mean it". Not having {{the context of the}} metaphor, the student took the phrase literally and was unable to discern the intended cordiality. Conversely, when Americans visit stores in Britain where the salespeople engage not in [...] "have a nice day" [...] salesmanship, Americans regard British as lacking customer service.|$|E

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E

In 2008, she opened the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and {{performed}} concerts in China, America and Australia featuring songs from her 40-year career. To further celebrate 40 years since her first performance on a West End Stage, in October 2008 Paige released a picture-based autobiography titled Memories. The book took around eight months to compile; [...] "Since Evita I suppose, I had kept a yearbook. My parents always kept cuttings and <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> for me.

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Gates said: [...] "I agree {{with people like}} Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for {{creation}} myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [...] I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite these partnerships, PewDiePie {{maintains}} that he conducts very few promotions {{and works with}} few brands. Additionally, PewDiePie posted on Reddit, [...] "I make more than I need from YouTube", adding, [...] "with that freedom, but also to respect my fans for making that possible, I don't end up doing many endorsements." [...] On this topic, PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when {{a large chunk of}} people misinterpret a component of his character; he states, [...] "if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it. <b>Things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> can bring me down.

500|$|In his {{response}} to the controversy generated by the removal of Confederate monuments as highlighted by the August, 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Barkley stated, [...] "I’ve never thought about those statues a day in my life. I think if you asked most black people to be honest, they ain’t thought a day in their life about those stupid statues. What we as black people need to do: We {{need to worry about}} getting our education, we need to stop killing each other, we need {{to try to find a}} way to have more economic opportunity and <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Those things are important and significant.

500|$|According to guitarist Marty Friedman, it {{took the}} band a year to prepare the record [...] "from note one to mixing". A lot of the {{material}} was written during the tour {{and some of it}} afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn't rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: [...] "Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions to do <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and it backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs." ...|$|E
500|$|Campaign {{magazine}} listed [...] "Cog", {{along with}} Balls for the Sony BRAVIA line of high-definition televisions, {{as one of}} the most-imitated commercials in recent times. Among the pieces believed to draw inspiration from [...] "Cog" [...] are a 2003 piece for breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs, Nearness for the Oslo School of Architecture and Design, a 30-second animated advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup, an advertisement for BBC Radio Merseyside football coverage, and the 2007 Tipping Point, advertising Guinness stout. When asked about the similarities between [...] "Cog" [...] and [...] "Tipping Point", Paul Brazier, executive creative director at the advertising agency behind Tipping Point, replied: [...] "I knew the ad was similar in places, but as an executive creative director, {{you have to look at}} <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and make a decision. The fact the TV ad was only part of a huge internet campaign meant that I thought it wasn’t that near [...] "Cog"." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} [...] "In the Presence of Enemies" [...] was {{inspired}} by a Korean manhwa named Priest, as Petrucci explains that not being a manga fan, precisely, [...] " [...] I like it though. This one, I just stumbled upon and I really liked the content. It inspired me to take a different approach lyrically. You have to keep things interesting for yourself when writing new material so I just took this and ran with it. [...] Those types of lyrics are fun to write, you know? The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master. And the story ends up really being the darkness within and goes through the different phases where he has to fight demons and <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
