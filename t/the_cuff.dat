5|$|Phleps was posthumously {{awarded the}} Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross on 24 November 1944, which was {{presented}} to his son, SS-Obersturmführer (First Lieutenant) Dr.med. Reinhart Phleps, a battalion doctor serving in the 7th SS Division. Soon after his death, the 13th Gebirgsjäger Regiment of the 7th SS Division was given <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> title Artur Phleps in his honour. Phleps was married; his wife's name was Grete {{and in addition to}} their son Reinhart, they had a daughter, Irmingard. One of Phleps' brothers became a doctor, and the other was a professor at the Danzig technical university, now Gdańsk University of Technology.|$|E
50|$|The NCO wore {{coloured}} {{stripes on}} both lower sleeves if <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> were horizontal, or chevrons if <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> were pointy. Except for the adjudant, the NCO did not wear epaulettes, except {{if they were}} part of an élite régiment.|$|R
50|$|While an {{individual}} is undergoing ECP, he/she has pneumatic cuffs {{on his or her}} legs and is connected to telemetry monitors that monitor heart rate and rhythm. The most common type in use involves three cuffs placed on each leg (on the calves, the lower thighs, and the upper thighs (or buttock)). <b>The</b> <b>cuffs</b> are timed to inflate and deflate based on the individual's electrocardiogram. <b>The</b> <b>cuffs</b> should ideally inflate at the beginning of diastole and deflate at the beginning of systole. During the inflation portion of the cycle, <b>the</b> calf <b>cuffs</b> inflate first, then <b>the</b> lower thigh <b>cuffs</b> and finally <b>the</b> upper thigh <b>cuffs.</b> Inflation is controlled by a pressure monitor, and <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> are inflated to about 200 mmHg.|$|R
50|$|Just as when Houdini {{performed}} <b>the</b> original Mirror <b>Cuff</b> Challenge, Walker {{did not see}} how <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> locked or unlocked, {{he did not see}} or {{handle the}} key used to secure the restraints, nor were <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> removed once they had been locked in place. To do so would have been to accept defeat.|$|R
5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The {{back of the}} trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the mechanism by which it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears {{to the back of}} the trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, bronchial intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. <b>The</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cuff</b> {{stabilizer}} is used {{to assist}} snug cuff application and to prevent <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> from shifting during use. Cuff shifting can interfere with the surgical site and may result in loss of arterial occlusion. Generally, tie ribbons are used as the stabilizer, {{as shown in the}} top figure to the left. However, some newer cuffs use releasable application handles as the stabilizer, as shown in bottom figure to the left. Releasable application handles allow more consistent cuff application, faster cuff removal, and maintain <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> in a stable position on the limb during use.|$|E
50|$|In {{its basic}} (standard) version, the {{laryngeal}} tube {{is made up}} of a tube with a larger balloon <b>cuff</b> in <b>the</b> middle (oropharyngeal <b>cuff)</b> and a smaller balloon <b>cuff</b> at <b>the</b> end (oesophageal <b>cuff).</b> <b>The</b> tube is kinked at an angle of 30-45° in the middle; the kink is located in <b>the</b> larger <b>cuff.</b> There are two apertures, located between <b>the</b> two <b>cuffs,</b> through which ventilation takes place. Both cuffs are inflated through a single small lumen line and pilot balloon. <b>The</b> <b>cuffs</b> are high-volume, low-pressure cuffs with inflating volume ranging from 10 ml (size 0) to 90 ml (size 5). A large bore syringe, which is marked with the required volume for each size, is used to inflate <b>the</b> <b>cuffs.</b> A cuff inflator can also be used, in which case <b>the</b> <b>cuffs</b> should be inflated to a pressure of 60 cm H2O. Three black lines on the tube indicate the depth of insertion when aligned with the teeth.|$|R

40|$|A {{silicone}} rubber double-tube, seven-lumen nerve cuff {{was designed and}} fabricated. In vivo studies were done to test its feasibility for peripheral nerve repair. The right sciatic nerve was transected at the mid-thigh level in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The proximal and distal stumps were inserted into both ends of <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> to form a 5 mm gap between stumps in sixteen animals for 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks implantation periods. The gap was successfully bridged by regenerating nerve tissue in <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs at all four post-implantation periods. Histological studies showed that the regenerating axons formed between one and seven nerve bundles as they regenerated across the gap in <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs. Each of these nerve bundles infiltrated a lumen in <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff.</b> <b>The</b> spatial arrangement or orientation of these nerve bundles inside <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuffs</b> {{was determined by the}} pattern of holes in <b>the</b> <b>cuffs.</b> <b>The</b> histologic structure of these nerve bundles showed a two zone reorganization with an outer peripheral zone constituted mainly of connective tissue and numerous blood vessels and an inner central zone which contained mostly axons in different stages of maturation. A marked difference between <b>the</b> experimental seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs and control {{silicone rubber}} single-lumen cuff repairs and end-to-end anastomosis repairs was evident in the distal stump 2 ̆ 7 s reorganization. In <b>the</b> control single-lumen <b>cuff</b> and end-to-end repairs, the nerve regenerated through the distal stump forming one central, large nerve bundle. In <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs, <b>the</b> regenerating axons formed several much smaller nerve bundles whose orientation followed the same pattern as seen at the middle of the repair site in <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuffs.</b> Regenerated axon populations at middle and distal repair regions were comparable in <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuffs</b> to that seen in the single-lumen controls in spite of a 2. 5 x reduction in total cross-sectional area in <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> vs. single-lumen cuff. This indicated higher densities of regenerated axons in <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs as compared to <b>the</b> single-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs. At 16 and 24 weeks post-operatively, integrated compound action potential area ratios were comparable among <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs and <b>the</b> single-lumen and end-to-end repair controls. At 16 and 24 weeks, functional recovery assessments, from video recordings of the animals with <b>the</b> seven-lumen <b>cuff</b> repairs, were closer to normal control rats than the assessments obtained from animals with the single-lumen and end-to-end repairs...|$|R
25|$|In {{personalized}} tourniquet instruments, {{the internal}} electrical pump, pressure display, and pressure regulator are combined {{in a single}} instrument in which a microprocessor continuously monitors and compensates for changing levels of pressure in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> bladder. Regulation does not rely on mechanical (pressure) forces to turn valves off and on. Instead, the microprocessor can detect extremely small changes in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> pressure and automatically regulate the flow of gas to control the pressure.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} types of cufflinks that may be worn with black tie. The most formal and {{decorative}} are the double-panel type, which dress both sides of <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> and are connected by a chain or link of metal; this model conceals the mechanism by which <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> is secured. The most common, and least decorative, are the swivel bar type; whilst these are acceptable, they leave the inner side of the cuffs and mechanism exposed which is incongruous with formal dress.|$|E
25|$|In the bespoke (custom-made) {{industry}} where each shirt {{is made from}} an individually drafted pattern, these sizing problems are avoided, though there are still different ways of making the shirt fit.

25|$|The {{pressure}} regulator adjusts and controls the gas pressure in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> bladder. Older, non-computerized tourniquet systems utilize valves {{that attempt to}} respond mechanically to changes in pressure. For example, if pressure in <b>the</b> <b>cuff</b> bladder falls, a valve may open to allow more gas to enter the regulator from the gas source; if pressure exceeds a certain level, the pressure may force a release valve to open and expel gas into the environment. Sometimes, the pressure levels at which these two valves turn on and off are quite different and cuff pressure may fluctuate within a certain range {{above and below the}} selected pressure. Due to the sensitive mechanical components of these systems, {{it is very important to}} follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding frequent testing, and calibration and to perform these checks before each surgical procedure as recommended. In general, tourniquet systems with mechanical regulators are now considered to be inaccurate, unreliable, and are not suitable for incorporation with modern tourniquet safety features.|$|E
