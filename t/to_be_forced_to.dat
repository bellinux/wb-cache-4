5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious {{as the model for}} the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response was a massive invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Dingle, who {{had been}} a member of the Oxford Officers Training Corps, was gazetted second {{lieutenant}} in the 6th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, which took part in the Suvla Bay Landing of the Gallipoli Campaign on 6 August 1915. His battalion took Scimitar Hill on 9 August, with great loss of life, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> make a tactical withdrawal. On 21 August, the Battle of Scimitar Hill ensued, a disaster for Britain and her allies: Dingle was killed the following day, defending a trench that had earlier been captured. He is commemorated on the Helles Memorial to the missing dead.|$|E

Meanwhile, the remaining employees are going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> work on a Saturday. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) proposes that they work late on Friday, so {{they do not have to}} come in the next day. Once Jim and his co-workers finish working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly places the blame on Jim.|$|E

5|$|The 1704 {{campaign}} lasted considerably {{longer than}} usual as the Allies sought to wring out maximum advantage. Realising that France was too powerful <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> make peace by a single victory, however, Eugene, Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves. For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along {{the valley of the}} River Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself. Trier was taken on 27 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end.|$|E
5|$|With {{the truce}} and the {{recognition}} {{that he would not}} conquer Denmark, Harald turned his attention to England. England had belonged to Harthacnut, the son of Cnut the Great, until he died childless in 1042. Harald based his claim to the throne of England on an agreement made between Magnus and Harthacnut in 1038, which stated that if either died, the other would inherit the throne and lands of the deceased. When Harthacnut died, Magnus assumed the crown of Denmark and considered himself the lawful heir to Harthacnut. While Edward the Confessor had himself crowned English king in his absence, Magnus had planned to invade England in 1045, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> turn his fleet towards Denmark due to an uprising by Sweyn Estridsson. Although the threat was temporarily averted by Magnus's death in 1047, Edward's negotiations with his enemies throughout the 1050s gave Harald (as well as Sweyn Estridsson and William of Normandy) an impression that he was a possible heir to Edward. When Edward died in January 1066, he was to Harald's dismay succeeded by Harold Godwinson, a son of one of Edward's advisors.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{broke out}} again in 1967, as the Turkish Cypriots pushed for more freedom of movement. Once again, the {{situation}} was not settled until Turkey threatened to invade {{on the basis that}} it would be protecting the Turkish population from ethnic cleansing by Greek Cypriot forces. To avoid that, a compromise was reached for Greece <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> remove some of its troops from the island; for Georgios Grivas, EOKA leader, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> leave Cyprus and for the Cypriot government to lift some restrictions of movement and access to supplies of the Turkish populations.|$|E

However, their employment also meant language difficulties and it was not unusual for officers and crew <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> resort to communication by sign language.|$|E

25|$|In his 1944 book Money, Manipulation and Social Order, Fahey turned {{towards the}} subject of {{economic}} reform. In this book he attacked gold standard economies, which he felt were debt-driven. Drawing on the ideas of Frederick Soddy, with whom he was in regular correspondence, Fahey wanted banks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> balance all loans with holding of currency. Although he was not directly linked to such contemporary movements as Social Credit or Guild socialism, Fahey certainly shared elements of their economic ideas. He had previously written {{in support of the}} views of An Ríoghacht – which advocated an Irish monetary system completely independent of the United Kingdom – in an article for the journal Hibernia in 1938.|$|E

Dagny is confronted by Ellis Wyatt, a Colorado oil man angry <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover Francisco d'Anconia, who presents a façade of a playboy grown bored with the pursuit of money. He reveals that a series of copper mines he built are worthless, costing his investors (including the Taggart railroad) millions.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} deal eliminated some of {{the spending}} cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015. This did not decrease federal spending; instead, by {{reducing the amount of}} spending cuts the government was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> make by the sequester, it actually increased government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker John Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester – $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, owner Jay Zucker of Tucson Baseball LLC {{announced}} {{the sale of}} the Tucson Sidewinders, the Toro's successor, to SK Baseball LLC for $15 M. The team was moved to Reno, Nevada after the 2008 season. At the time, the Reno Silver Sox of the Golden Baseball League (which began as the Mesa Miners in 2005) were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> leave Reno when the Sidewinders move into town. The Silver Sox franchise was sold by the league to Tucson Baseball LLC, but the team's history (including Reno's 2006 GBL Championship) did not go with them. There were original reports of a possible relocation to Carson City, Nevada, but the team instead moved to Tucson. The Silver Sox team name is now associated with the Arizona Winter League team from Saskatchewan. The new PCL team has since become the Reno Aces.|$|E

25|$|While {{this meant}} that Redden (along with Scott Gomez of the Montreal Canadiens, {{who was in a}} similar situation) would still have been paid his {{prorated}} 2012–13 salary despite not playing, the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) was concerned that for Redden and Gomez <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> spend an entire year away from hockey would adversely affect their ability to find employment elsewhere in the NHL during the 2013 off-season, even at a much reduced salary. On January 15, in order to avoid this process, the CBA was revised to allow teams to use one of their two compliance buyouts {{prior to the start of}} the shortened 2012–13 season, with the provision that the players bought-out in such a way would still be paid their prorated but otherwise full 2012–13 salaries (which would still count against the 2012–13 cap), and with the buyout of the subsequent years otherwise proceeding as originally intended.|$|E
25|$|The most vexed {{issues of}} {{independent}} Malaysia were {{education and the}} disparity of economic power among the ethnic communities. The Malays felt unhappy with {{the wealth of the}} Chinese community, even after the expulsion of Singapore. Malay political movements emerged based around this. However, since there was no effective opposition party, these issues were contested mainly within the coalition government, which won all but one seat in the first post-independence Malayan Parliament. The two issues were related, since the Chinese advantage in education played a large part in maintaining their control of the economy, which the UMNO leaders were determined to end. The MCA leaders were torn between the need to defend their own community's interests and the need to maintain good relations with UMNO. This produced a crisis in the MCA in 1959, in which a more assertive leadership under Lim Chong Eu defied UMNO over the education issue, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> back down when Tunku Abdul Rahman threatened to break up the coalition.|$|E
25|$|One {{historical}} {{problem with}} the U.S. system was known as job lock, in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces {{the flexibility of the}} labor market. Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly COBRA and HIPAA, has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use experience rating and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face job lock not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> stay in their current job.|$|E
