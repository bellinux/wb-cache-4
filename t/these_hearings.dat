5|$|During <b>these</b> <b>hearings</b> ministers, {{assisted}} by senior public servants, answer questions put {{to them by}} any Senator {{that relate to the}} operations and expenditure of departments and agencies that receive federal government funding. In such hearings, ministers from the House of Representatives are represented by a minister who is also a Senator.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations {{between him and his}} aides. The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> culminated in votes for impeachment. On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E
50|$|Hearings {{were held}} in 13 {{communities}} around New Brunswick in October and early November 2012.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the {{four types of}} congressional committee hearings: legislative, oversight, investigative, and confirmation. Hearings may be held on Capitol Hill or elsewhere (e. g., a committee member's district or state, or a site related {{to the subject of}} the hearing). <b>These</b> latter <b>hearings</b> are often referred to as field hearings...|$|R
5|$|There was no {{official}} outcome from <b>these</b> <b>hearings,</b> but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill {{which included a}} provision that specifically would not allow a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position. Rather than remove Magoon {{from one of his}} positions, he was named to become vice governor-general of the Philippines. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before it could take effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|John de Vere was {{the only}} son of Alphonse de Vere, and Jane, {{daughter}} of Sir Richard Foliot. Alphonse was a younger son of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford and apparently died shortly before 20 December 1328, when a writ was issued for inquisitions post mortem into the land that he held direct from the King. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> established that Alphonse's next heir was his son John, then aged 15 years and more. The manors concerned were Aston Sandford, Buckinghamshire, Westwick by St Albans and Great Hormead, Hertfordshire, as well as property at Beaumont and Althorne in Essex.|$|E
5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and analysis by the committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E

50|$|Valachi {{testified in}} vivid and minute detail on his day-to-day life in {{organized}} crime in a first-time-ever public account {{of life as}} a soldier of La Cosa Nostra, including its rites of initiation. <b>These</b> televised <b>hearings</b> brought home to average Americans the savage violence and intimidation routinely used by the Mafia to further and protect its criminal enterprises.|$|R
25|$|Summary {{trials are}} ad hoc {{hearings}} used {{to dispense with}} minor service offenses. The Presiding Officer will have little formal legal training and is generally the service member's Commanding Officer. In this respect, <b>these</b> <b>hearings</b> {{are similar to the}} former lay magistrates' courts.|$|E
25|$|On March 16, 2007, at <b>these</b> <b>hearings</b> {{about the}} disclosure, Waxman read a {{statement}} about Plame's CIA career that had been cleared by CIA director Gen. Michael V.

25|$|From time to time, boards or {{panels are}} commissioned, {{either by the}} federal {{government}} or the government of one of the provinces, to conduct hearings into the public’s views on matters of policy. Some of <b>these</b> <b>hearings</b> have dealt largely, or even primarily, with official languages policy, and the responses that they have collected provide snapshots into the state of public opinion at particular points in time.|$|E

2500|$|<b>These</b> non-public <b>hearings</b> were {{conducted}} as [...] "a formal review {{of all the}} information related to a detainee to determine whether each person meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy combatant." [...] The first CSRT hearings began in July 2004. Redacted transcripts of hearings for [...] "high value detainees" [...] were posted to the Department of Defense (DoD) website.

25|$|By 1920, Arcelay {{abandoned}} {{her career as}} an educator and together with Lorenza Carrero founded a needlework workshop which evolved into a needlework factory. Her company employed many local women, who had no other means to sustain themselves economically. She was also an activist who defended the island's needlework industry in many public hearings. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> were held in Puerto Rico, and in New York City and Washington, D.C..|$|E
25|$|In March 1917, federal representatives held hearings, {{attended}} by around 100 Choctaws, {{to examine the}} needs of the Mississippi Choctaws. Some of the congressmen who presided over the hearings were: Charles D. Carter of Oklahoma, William W. Hastings of Oklahoma, Carl T. Hayden of Arizona, John N. Tillman of Arkansas, and William W. Venable of Mississippi. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> resulted in improvements such as improved access to health care, housing, and schools.|$|E
25|$|Organizers also {{investigated}} the legal implications of veterans publicly admitting to criminal acts {{which they had}} witnessed or participated in. With legal advice from the Center for Constitutional Rights, the organizers were assured that the armed forces could not charge or try veterans for crimes committed while they were on active duty. The veterans giving testimony were also instructed not to reveal the specific names of others involved in war crimes. The goal of <b>these</b> <b>hearings</b> was not to indict individual soldiers, but instead to expose the frequency of criminal behavior {{and its relationship to}} U.S. war policy.|$|E
50|$|Almost 10 {{years after}} the first public vote, the Gaston County Board of County Commissioners held public {{hearings}} in Cherryville, Tryon School district, and Bessemer City to gauge support for the proposed Northwest High School.

25|$|Many {{opinions}} and explanations appeared as other sources attempted {{to explain the}} causes. Public opinion polls have shown that an equal percentage of people believed that the riots were linked to communist groups versus those that blamed social problems like unemployment and prejudice. Those opinions concerning racism and discrimination emerged only three years after hearings conducted by a committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights took place in Los Angeles to assess the condition of relations between the police force and minorities. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> were also intended to make a ruling on the discrimination case against the police for their alleged mistreatment {{of members of the}} Nation of Islam. These different arguments and opinions still prompt debates over the underlying causes of the Watts riots.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{admitted}} to the United States, Utah was initially unsuccessful in having its elected representatives and senators seated in the United States Congress. In 1898, Utah elected general authority B.H. Roberts to the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat. Roberts, however, was denied a seat there because he was practicing polygamy. In 1903, the Utah legislature selected Reed Smoot, also an LDS general authority but also a monogamist, as its first senator. From 1904 to 1907, the United States Senate {{conducted a series of}} Congressional hearings on whether Smoot should be seated. Eventually, the Senate granted Smoot a seat and allowed him to vote. However, the hearings raised controversy as to whether polygamy had actually been abandoned as claimed in the 1890 Manifesto, and whether the LDS Church continued to exercise influence on Utah politics. In response to <b>these</b> <b>hearings,</b> President of the Church Joseph F. Smith issued a Second Manifesto denying that any post-Manifesto marriages had the church's sanction, and announcing that those entering such marriages in the future would be excommunicated.|$|E
500|$|Between December 2001 and April 2002, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services held {{multiple}} hearings {{about the}} Enron scandal and related accounting and investor protection issues. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> and the corporate scandals that followed Enron {{led to the}} passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on July 30, 2002.

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1927, there is {{evidence}} that public hearings were indeed held; among them, hearings to assess the expansion of the radio broadcast band. At <b>these</b> early <b>hearings,</b> the goal of having a broad range of viewpoints presented was evident, as not only broadcasters, but also radio engineers and manufacturers were in attendance. Numerous groups representing the general public appeared at the hearings as well, including amateur radio operators and inventors as well as representatives of radio listeners' organizations.

25|$|Due to {{security}} problems with holding pre-trial hearings in Baghdad, {{the case was}} transferred to Germany. On August 23, Graner appeared before military judge Colonel James Pohl at a high-security Army base {{in the city of}} Mannheim in southwest Germany. On that day, Article 39a <b>hearings</b> were held. <b>These</b> preliminary <b>hearings</b> usually function as an arraignment and allow the judge to hear and decide on motions made by the prosecutor and the defense. Graner appeared with Specialist Megan Ambuhl, along with his civilian attorneys and appointed military defense lawyers.|$|R
5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates <b>hearings.</b> <b>These</b> second <b>hearings</b> are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|R
500|$|<b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> {{would take}} place from November 15 through January 16, 1991. They were held in the Hart Senate Office Building's largest hearing room. They were {{broadcast}} live in their entirety by C-SPAN, with CNN and the network news programs showing segments of the testimonies. At {{the opening of the}} hearings, as The Washington Post would later write, [...] "the senators sat dourly alongside one another in a long row, a visual suggestive of co-defendants in a rogues' docket." [...] Overall, McCain would later write, [...] "The hearings were a public humiliation." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1954, McCarthy {{was also}} under {{attack in the}} Army–McCarthy hearings. <b>These</b> <b>hearings</b> were {{televised}} live on the new American Broadcasting Company network, allowing the public to view first-hand McCarthy's interrogation of individuals and his controversial tactics. In one exchange, McCarthy reminded {{the attorney for the}} Army, Joseph Welch, that he had an employee in his law firm who had belonged to an organization that had been accused of Communist sympathies. In an exchange that reflected the increasingly negative public opinion of McCarthy, Welch rebuked the senator: [...] "Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?" ...|$|E
500|$|The small Republican {{majority}} in the Senate made Irreconcilable votes necessary to Lodge's strategy, and he met with Borah in April 1919, persuading him {{to go along with}} the plan of delay and reservations as the most likely to succeed, as it would allow the initial popular support for Wilson's proposal to diminish. Neither senator really liked or trusted the other, but they formed a wary pact to defeat the treaty. Lodge was also chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he delayed the treaty by convening a lengthy series of hearings, presiding over a committee packed with Irreconcilables, including Borah. As <b>these</b> <b>hearings</b> continued in the summer of 1919, Wilson undertook a speaking tour by train to get the public to press the Senate for ratification, a tour that ended in his collapse. [...] In the months that followed, an ailing Wilson refused any compromise.|$|E
