5|$|Madgwick officially {{took office}} on 1 July 1967. As chairman, Madgwick took a {{somewhat}} hands-off approach to directing the organisation, preferring to provide his opinion {{as to how}} <b>things</b> <b>should</b> operate, then deferring to his administrators {{to decide what to}} do. Madgwick considered his position as similar to a university president, with managers and producers equivalent to professors and researchers. He bought a home in Mosman to be closer to the ABC's main Broadcast House in Sydney. Madgwick tried to make himself available by walking around the offices and facilities and amiably conversing with all ABC employees. He was subsequently described as the most popular chairman {{in the history of the}} organisation. Madgwick was given a second term as chairman in 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how <b>things</b> <b>should</b> go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that <b>things</b> <b>should</b> not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
60|$|I {{had never}} heard Pierre Laurens speak so decidedly, and with such an {{assumption}} of authority, as at this time, and surprise silenced me that the little lad should have taken {{it upon himself to}} say this <b>thing,</b> <b>should,</b> or that <b>thing</b> <b>should</b> not be, when, without having actually done so in words, I claimed to be the leader of the company.|$|R

5|$|Manuel Belgrano had a vast {{intellectual}} {{awareness of}} most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of the common good, which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of the common good, as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E
25|$|They're both {{leaders and}} there's {{a lot of}} {{conflict}} between them. They are very supportive of one another when operating against a third party, but they also disagree with how <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be handled {{when it comes to}} crises. Medusa is monarchy; She-Hulk is democracy. Medusa is the right of queens and She-Hulk is the rule of law. She-Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa. It's the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil.|$|E
25|$|Van Stipriaan further {{reports that}} other tales {{describe}} river travellers (usually men) chancing upon the spirit. She is inevitably grooming herself, combing her hair, and peering {{at herself in}} a mirror. Upon noticing the intruder, she flees {{into the water and}} leaves her possessions behind. The traveller then takes the invaluable items. Later, Mami Wata appears to the thief in his dreams to demand the return of her <b>things.</b> <b>Should</b> he agree, she further demands a promise from him to be sexually faithful to her. Agreement grants the person riches; refusal to return the possessions or to be faithful brings the man ill fortune.|$|E

25|$|Two <b>things</b> <b>should</b> {{be noted}} {{about the second}} {{complete}} draft of Das Rheingold. Firstly, the full score of the Prelude (in ink) and the instrumentation draft of {{the remainder of the}} opera (in pencil) together constitute a single manuscript (WWV 86A Musik III). In WWV this is called a Partiturerstschrift, a term usually reserved for Wagner's full scores: strictly speaking only the section in ink is a Partiturerstschrift. Secondly, the manuscript is fragmentary: thirty-three measures are missing, which include the closing measures of the Prelude and the opening measures of Scene 1. As ink is used before this lacuna and pencil after it, it is generally assumed that Wagner switched from one medium to the other at the entrance of the voices (i.e. the first measure of Scene 1); but until and unless the missing sheets are recovered, this must remain an assumption.|$|E
25|$|Balance {{sheets and}} Profit and Loss {{statements}} served one major purpose, {{if not the}} only one, for Ivar and that was {{they had to be}} helpful in his fund raising efforts. Often they were just pure fantasy to be revised at will to please investors. He also frequently treated the assets of corporations he controlled as if they were his own. However, <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be seen {{in the context of the}} time. IBM, for example, consolidated all its accounts in one named Plant, Property, Equipment, Machines, Patents and Goodwill. American Can doubled its reported net earnings in 1913 by claiming only $1 million of depreciation after having claimed $2.5 million the previous year. Many companies set up arbitrary reserves in good times to be used in bad years and few holding companies published consolidated financial statements.|$|E
500|$|According to Wall, Perl has two slogans. The {{first is}} [...] "There's {{more than one}} way to do it", {{commonly}} known as TMTOWTDI. The second slogan is [...] "Easy <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be easy and hard <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be possible".|$|E

It {{is hard to}} understand what sense the military saw in the trawling operation.

500|$|Torns {{background}} plot {{established an}} omnipotent being, dubbed [...] "the Architect," [...] {{as the ultimate}} creator of the game's universe. The Architect created a number of god-like beings, who in turn created the world [...] "Torn". The gods eventually divided into three separate factions, each pursuing a different philosophy. One faction worshipped Chaos, believing in constant alteration of the world, while another worshipped Order, believing that all <b>things</b> <b>should</b> remain unchanged; between these two was a third faction, which promoted balance between chaos and order.|$|E

500|$|Priber {{attempted}} to organize Cherokee society {{in accordance with}} early 18th-century European idealism. [...] He promoted the idea that all <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be held in common, including wives and children. Claiming the English were fraudulent and greedy, he suggested moving the Cherokee capital to modern-day Alabama, {{where it would be}} closer to the French colonial territory of La Louisiane. [...] The English tried to arrest Priber in 1739, but were prevented by the Cherokee. He was finally captured by the Creek people in 1743 and turned over to South Carolina authorities.|$|E
500|$|In 1798, Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge jointly {{published}} Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems, {{a collection}} of verses each had written separately. The book became hugely popular and was published widely; it is generally considered a herald of the Romantic movement in English literature. In it, Wordsworth aimed to use everyday language in his compositions {{as set out in}} the preface to the 1802 edition: [...] "The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men, and at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Daenerys {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode where the three dragons burn part of the Masters' fleet, Sapochnik credited VFX supervisor Joe Bauer and producer Steve Kullback for post-production work: [...] "For this sequence David and Dan said that what they wanted to see was a 'demonstration' of what's to come. So I tried to approach it in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action. He based the dragon shots on wildlife footage, allowing them to break the frame: [...] "These <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be so big and fast it's hard to keep up with them." [...] To insert Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) into the scene, she rode a [...] "multi-directional, computer-controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like the upper shoulders of the dragon"; Clarke was filmed separately in Belfast, Northern Ireland.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the book's seventeen-year gestation, Joyce {{stated that}} with Finnegans Wake he was {{attempting}} to [...] "reconstruct the nocturnal life", and that the book was his [...] "experiment in interpreting 'the dark night of the soul'." [...] According to Ellmann, Joyce stated to Edmond Jaloux that Finnegans Wake would be written [...] "to suit the esthetic of the dream, where the forms prolong and multiply themselves", and once informed a friend that [...] "he conceived of his book as the dream of old Finn, lying in death beside the river Liffey and watching the history of Ireland and the world – past and future – flow through his mind like flotsam on the river of life." [...] While pondering the generally negative reactions to the book Joyce said: I can't understand some of my critics, like Pound or Miss Weaver, for instance. They say it's obscure. They compare it, of course, with Ulysses. But the action of Ulysses was chiefly during the daytime, and the action of my new work takes place chiefly at night. It's natural <b>things</b> <b>should</b> not be so clear at night, isn't it now? ...|$|E
500|$|Nagle {{credited}} {{herself with}} [...] "dragging the Jockey Club {{into the twentieth}} century". She said: [...] "This {{was a matter of}} principle. I am a feminist. I believe in equal rights for women. <b>Things</b> <b>should</b> be decided by ability, not sex". [...] At odds with Nagle's view, in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that [...] "No doubt there are occupations, such as boxing, which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women", and Lord Denning had gone on to say that [...] "It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman, like that of a jockey or speedway-rider"; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972. When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse, Nagle replied: [...] "My dear man, it used to be said women couldn't stand up to three-day-eventing. Now they're beating the men regularly– and the same will happen in racing. Give them time." [...] Her endeavours led to her being described as [...] "the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing" [...] in Stud & Stable Magazine and [...] "Racing's Emily Pankhurst".|$|E
500|$|Plato {{was called}} by {{biologist}} Ernst Mayr [...] "the great antihero of evolutionism," [...] because he promoted belief in essentialism, which is {{also referred to as}} the theory of Forms. This theory holds that each natural type of object in the observed world is an imperfect manifestation of the ideal, form or [...] "species" [...] which defines that type. In his Timaeus for example, Plato has a character tell a story that the Demiurge created the cosmos and everything in it because, being good, and hence, [...] "...free from jealousy, He desired that all <b>things</b> <b>should</b> be as like Himself as they could be." [...] The creator created all conceivable forms of life, since [...] "...without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, {{if it is to be}} perfect." [...] This [...] "principle of plenitude"—the idea that all potential forms of life are essential to a perfect creation—greatly influenced Christian thought. However some historians of science have questioned how much influence Plato's essentialism had on natural philosophy by stating that many philosophers after Plato believed that species might be capable of transformation and that the idea that biologic species were fixed and possessed unchangeable essential characteristics did not become important until the beginning of biological taxonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
