5|$|The {{blast furnace}} {{used at the}} Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter differs from most other lead blast {{furnaces}} in {{that it has a}} double row of tuyeres rather than the single row normally used. The lower shaft of the furnace has a chair shape with the lower part of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> being narrower than the upper. The lower row of tuyeres being located in the narrow part of <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> This allows the upper part of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> to be wider than the standard.|$|E
5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from <b>the</b> <b>Shaft</b> of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. <b>The</b> <b>Shaft</b> of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into a harness when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After a {{concrete}} lining sealed <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> <b>the</b> cooling brine was {{stopped and the}} frozen ground allowed to thaw. Grout, a thin cement mixture, was pumped at high pressure through holes bored through <b>the</b> <b>shaft's</b> concrete lining into the water-bearing strata. When it set, most of the water leaking into <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> was stopped and the ground around {{the upper part of}} <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> was stabilised.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{designs of}} harness saddle have a groove in the top, into which fits a chain that is hooked to <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b> <b>The</b> belly band also hooks onto <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> from beneath.|$|R
50|$|Underground mining {{began in}} 1879 with the sinking and {{development}} of three main <b>shafts</b> to access <b>the</b> reef: <b>the</b> Hart <b>Shaft,</b> <b>the</b> Main <b>Shaft</b> and <b>the</b> Grubb <b>Shaft.</b>|$|R
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch between <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, {{the penis}} is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the glans (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the glans and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora), the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the labia minora) and the vestibular or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the glans and the body may also be referred to as <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> (or external shaft) because, like <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> as a whole, it supports the glans, and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>Shaft</b> Grave era, a new {{and more}} {{imposing}} type of elite burial emerged, the Tholos: large circular burial chambers with high vaulted roofs and a straight entry passage lined with stone.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parallel}} misalignment can {{be further}} divided up in horizontal and vertical misalignment.

5000|$|Shaft tugs, or just tugs. Loops {{attached}} to the back band to hold up <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> of a vehicle in van or fine harness (not needed in cart harness, which attaches to hooks on <b>the</b> <b>shafts).</b> Two types: ...|$|R
5000|$|Earlier {{submarines}} carried four high-speed {{electric motors}} (two per shaft), {{which had to}} be fitted with reduction gears to slow their outputs down to an appropriate speed for <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b> This reduction gearing was very noisy, and made the submarine easier to detect with hydrophones. Eighteen late Balao-class submarines received low-speed double armature motors which drove <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> directly and were much quieter, but this improvement was not universally fitted until the succeeding [...] The new direct drive electric motors were designed by the Bureau of Ships' electrical division under Captain Hyman G. Rickover, and were first equipped on [...] [...] As the diesel engines were not directly connected to <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> <b>the</b> electric motors drove <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> all <b>the</b> time.|$|R
5|$|Both {{principal}} façades, East and West, {{are dominated}} by massive clockfaces. The Zytglogge's first clockface was likely located on the plinth, but was moved up {{to the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> during the tower's 15th-century reconfiguration.|$|E
5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
5|$|Stela 2 {{was found}} in centre of the West Plaza. The butt of this stela {{was found in}} its {{original}} location, although <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> has broken and fallen backwards. Stela 2 {{does not appear to}} have had any sculpted designs or text. It was associated with Altar 1.|$|E
5000|$|Back band. A strap {{going through}} the harness saddle to join the belly band either side. Takes the weight of <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> or pole. In cart harness it is {{replaced}} by a chain running in a groove in the harness saddle, hooked to <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> either side.|$|R
50|$|The {{excavated}} material is usually transported {{by means of}} leather bags up <b>the</b> vertical <b>shafts.</b> It is mounded around <b>the</b> vertical <b>shaft</b> exit, providing a barrier that prevents windblown or rain driven debris from entering <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b> These mounds may be covered to provide further protection to the qanat. From <b>the</b> air, these <b>shafts</b> look like a string of bomb craters.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} stresses are induced in <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{disasters}} in Leigh included {{the explosion of}} firedamp which caused the deaths of 38miners at Bedford Colliery on 13 August 1886. There were several accidents at Bickershaw Colliery, but the most serious was in 1932, when 19men were drowned in the sump {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> after an overwind of the cage.|$|E
50|$|The {{propulsion}} of the Balao-class submarines {{was generally}} {{similar to that}} of the preceding Gato-class. Like their predecessors, they were true diesel-electric submarines: their four diesel engines powered electrical generators, and electric motors drove <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b> There was no direct connection between the main engines and <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
25|$|For two-shaft designs, an {{accessory}} drive {{will be taken}} from <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>shaft,</b> i.e. <b>the</b> outer and shorter of <b>the</b> two concentric <b>shafts.</b> This shaft comes up to speed more quickly when the engine is started. The drive and accessory gearboxes may also be split in two, one driven from each engine shaft, so as to distribute their loads. The engine-critical systems, including the starter drive, are arranged on <b>the</b> high-pressure <b>shaft,</b> with aircraft systems on <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> high-pressure <b>shaft</b> also rotates faster than <b>the</b> low-pressure <b>shaft,</b> which may influence the distribution of accessories.|$|R
50|$|The F23 has two gearsets on each {{of three}} {{parallel}} <b>shafts</b> - <b>the</b> input <b>shaft,</b> <b>the</b> output <b>shaft,</b> and <b>the</b> intermediate <b>shaft.</b> This three-shaft (also called three-axis) design results {{in a very short}} axial length for better packaging. There are three separate shift fork shafts, which hold three shift forks to activate the synchronizer rings for the two gearsets {{on each of}} <b>the</b> three gear <b>shafts.</b> <b>The</b> shift forks are activated by a cable system. The clutch release bearing is operated by a concentric slave cylinder that surrounds <b>the</b> input <b>shaft</b> in <b>the</b> clutch housing. A concentric slave cylinder allows more linear clutch feel than an external lever-actuated clutch and release bearing. <b>The</b> input <b>shaft</b> carries <b>the</b> 3rd and 4th gear synchronizer, <b>the</b> intermediate <b>shaft</b> carries <b>the</b> 1st and 2nd gear synchronizer, and <b>the</b> output <b>shaft</b> carries <b>the</b> 5th and reverse gear synchronizer. The aluminium case contains a conventional final drive gearset.|$|R
5|$|The Butter Cross in Dunster {{within the}} English county of Somerset is a Grade II* listed {{building}} and ancient monument. The cross was originally erected {{in the late}} 14th or early 15th century in the main street, and was moved to its current site in the late 18th or early 19th century. Although {{the head of the}} cross is missing, <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and socket stone are original. The cross is in the care of English Heritage and is managed by the National Trust.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} this settlement {{is thought to be}} <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of a stone cross dating from the early 9th century that was found in Sheffield in the early 19th century. This shaft may be part of a cross removed from the church yard of the Sheffield parish church (now Sheffield Cathedral) in 1570. It is now kept in the British Museum.|$|E
5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large olecranon, the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.|$|E
5000|$|Morton {{decommissioned}} at Pearl Harbor on 22 November 1982. Her {{name was}} struck from the Navy List on 7 February 1990 {{and the ship}} was sold to Southwest Recycling, Inc., Terminal Island, Calif., for scrapping on 17 March 1992. During the scrapping process, the commercial diving crew responsible for removing <b>the</b> struts, <b>shafts</b> and wheels of the Morton set the current (as of 2007) world record for the thickest piece of steel cut underwater {{by means of an}} ultra-thermic torch. While cutting <b>the</b> starboard <b>shaft,</b> it was discovered that <b>the</b> Morton's <b>shafts</b> deviated from <b>the</b> blueprints provided to Southwest Marine & Recycling. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> were to have a wall thickness of two inches (2.0"); however, upon being cut, <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> were found to be almost completely solid, consisting of a wall of 19.2" [...] inches around a 2.0" [...] hollow cylinder. It is believed <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> deviated from specifications because of material shortages, requiring use of an inferior alloy, but this has not been confirmed.|$|R
2500|$|While the Tiara series were {{basically}} traditional boxer engines, {{they did have}} some unique features. The engines had high rotational speeds, [...] was used to reduce propeller speed, with the camshaft forming an extension of <b>the</b> propeller <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> propeller <b>shaft</b> featured <b>the</b> Hydra-Torque drive to reduce <b>the</b> <b>shaft's</b> vibrations. <b>The</b> engines were available with four, six- and eight-cylinders. All were fuel-injected, with turbocharging being optional.|$|R
50|$|Technically {{the early}} mine {{had to contend}} with sand and the Saara tectonic fault. <b>The</b> first <b>shaft,</b> <b>the</b> 1856 Barbara <b>shaft</b> was {{abandoned}} at 30m. <b>The</b> second <b>shaft,</b> <b>the</b> Concordia <b>shaft</b> was renamed <b>the</b> Guido <b>shaft.</b> Exploratory mining at 80m was abandoned due to faulting. At 117m water was struck. Financial assistance was received from the Upper Silesian Railway Association Oberschlesische Eisenbahn Gesellschaft. Guido was drained, and a new <b>shaft,</b> <b>the</b> Railway <b>shaft</b> was dug- <b>the</b> 170m level was exploited using shortwall excavation. The workings were bought in 1887 by the Prussian Finanzamt- and merge with the Queen Louisa Mine. Guido and Railway were deeped to 320m, the 170m had been worked out.In 1912 the Guido mine was merged with the newly built Delbrück mine (Makoszowy Coal Mine-post 1945) and coking plant. Silesia was partitioned in 1922, and the Delbrück mine (with “Guido” mine) was made over to Prussian Preussag mining company. In 1928, <b>the</b> Guido <b>shaft</b> was closed down and <b>the</b> Railway <b>shaft</b> became transporting <b>shaft</b> for <b>the</b> crew and materials.|$|R
5|$|The market {{cross in}} Bath Street {{dates from the}} 15thcentury, with the shelter having been rebuilt in 1834. It has a central {{octagonal}} pier, a socket raised on four steps, a hexagonal shelter with six arched four-centred openings, shallow two-stage buttresses at each angle, and an embattled parapet. <b>The</b> <b>shaft</b> is crowned by an abacus with figures in niches, probably from the late 19thcentury, although the cross is now missing. It was rebuilt by Thomas, Marquis of Bath. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument (Somerset County No21) and GradeII* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The third kingdom royal {{necropolis}} {{was discovered}} beneath palace Q (the western palace); it contains many hypogea but only three were excavated. Those tombs were natural caves in {{the bedrock of}} the palace's foundation; they all date to the 19th and 18th centuries BC and had a similar plan consisting of an entrance shaft, burial chambers and a dromos connecting <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> to the chamber.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of burial {{during this}} period was inhumation. The {{earliest}} Mycenaean burials were mostly in individual graves {{in the form of}} a pit or a stone-lined cist and offerings were limited to pottery and occasional items of jewellery. Groups of pit or cist graves containing elite members of the community were sometimes covered by a tumulus (mound) in the manner established since the Middle Helladic. It has been argued that this form dates back to the Kurgan culture; however, Mycenaean burials are in actuality an indigenous development of mainland Greece with <b>the</b> <b>Shaft</b> Graves housing native rulers. Pit and cist graves remained in use for single burials throughout the Mycenaean period alongside more elaborate family graves. <b>The</b> <b>shaft</b> graves at Mycenae within Grave Circles A and B belonging to the same period represent an alternative manner of grouping elite burials. Next to the deceased were found full sets of weapons, ornate staffs as well as gold and silver cups and other valuable objects which point to their social rank.|$|E
