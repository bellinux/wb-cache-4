40|$|This article {{examines}} antecedents and consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> level <b>of</b> standardized information technology (IT) versus customized IT in self-managing teams (SMTs) {{in a financial}} services institution. Linkages between specified antecedents and <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> levels <b>of</b> standardized and customized IT were investigated using data collected from bank employees and in-company databases. The authors find positive individual-level effects of tolerance of self-management, ease of use, and innovativeness on <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> level <b>of</b> standardized IT and positive individual-level effects of tolerance of self-management and perceived usefulness on <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> level <b>of</b> customized IT. These findings suggest that discriminating between different types of IT creates a better understanding <b>of</b> IT <b>adoption</b> in SMTs. A similar investigation of the IT adoption-service performance relationships shows that <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> level <b>of</b> customized IT rather than of standardized IT has a crucial impact on service performance {{both in terms of}} customer satisfaction and productivity...|$|R

We find the relationship to be inverse-U shaped, suggesting social effects are positive when there are few adopters in the network, and negative when there are many. We also find <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> decisions <b>of</b> farmers who have better information about the new crop are less sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>adoption</b> choices <b>of</b> others. Finally, we find that adoption decisions are more correlated within family and friends than religion-based networks, and uncorrelated among individuals of different religions.
