5000|$|Tax codes {{followed}} by the letter L represent the size of <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> personal <b>allowance</b> on earnings. This is {{the total amount of}} money, per year, one can earn <b>tax</b> <b>free.</b> The number attached to them represents <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> earnings divided by 10. In the tax year 2013/2014 the standard <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> <b>allowance</b> on income is £9440, which means the standard code, and the emergency tax code is 944L. [...] Persons over 65 and 75 have an increased personal allowance.Tax <b>free</b> Personal <b>allowances</b> can only be taken once across earnings. A second job or a job with a pension is taxed at a basic rate of 20%, or the tax allowance can be split across both sources of income.Non-standard codes are used when usual <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> do not apply. Where no allowances exist, code BR is used to tax at basic rate (20%), and code D0 is used to tax at higher rate (40%). If no tax is to be collected, code NT is used. If tax has to be collected on an income above PAYE earnings, a K code is used. This works as equivalent to a negative tax allowance.|$|R

50|$|The {{state income}} tax has two income {{brackets}} (base and top). In 2017 income from DKK 43442 to DKK 479600 is taxed at 5.83% and income above DKK 479600 is taxed an additional 15%. Other taxes include Municipal income tax, currently in the range 23% - 28%, though on average 24.09%, and a state tax, {{in the range of}} 8% - 15%. A Health contribution tax (3% (2016);2% (2017);1% (2018);0% (2019)) apply on all income above the <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> <b>allowance</b> in year 2014, though from there the health contribution is getting merged with the regular income tax by one percent per year. From 1 January 2019 there will be no health tax as it will then have been phased out, by then being part of the income taxes that everyone pays. Under the Danish tax system, it is possible for a high-wage earner to pay up to 51.5% of their total income after gross tax, giving a total of 57% of total income.|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{carbon tax}} in Australia, {{which is scheduled}} to be implemented from 1 July 2012, has become a controversial issue to the policy makers and people regarding its potential effects on the economy and society. Therefore, this paper analyses the various effects of the carbon tax with particular attention on Australian income distribution, employment and international competitiveness. The carbon tax will increase the inequality between the poor and the rich, as the poor will be adversely affected because of increased price of almost all essential items even {{in the presence of the}} government support program; regional disparity is also likely to increase. Employment will be reduced especially in coal, mining, steel, automotive and other manufacturing industries which will cause the shrinkage of GDP. The international competitiveness of Australian industries will also be reduced, as these industries will suffer because of higher production cost compared to foreign competitors. Some policy options such as reduction of VAT, a <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> <b>allowance</b> for essential use of energy, a lower carbon tax rate, border tax adjustments, permanent financial support to the poor may be considered to reduce the regressive effects. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{assesses the}} fiscal effects of (re-) {{introducing}} the general wealth tax {{for the public}} budget of the German federal state Hessen. In order to increase public spending in crucial areas such as education, research, child care and infrastructure, a structural increase in tex revenue is needed. (Re-) introducing a federal wealrh tax is an attractive option both with regard to revenue and redistributive aspects. Such a tax that obeys the criteria set by the federal constitutional court by taxing all kinds of wealth in an equitable manner could indeed generate substantial revenue. The version most often discussed with a tax rate of one percent and a basic <b>tax</b> <b>free</b> <b>allowance</b> of 500. 000 euro would yield 1. 2 billion euro for the federal state of Hessen. The revenue {{could be used to}} increase public investment and to generate public employment in schools and universities. A careful estimate for the number of jobs created is in between 6. 000 and 10. 000 depending on the exact kind of job. The expenditure programme would additionally generate benefical macroeconomic effects. GDP in Hessen would increase by about 0. 6 percent and employment (including the jobs created in the public sector) by about 18. 000 jobs. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{first two}} {{phases of the}} EU-ETS were {{characterized}} by a profit increase, which was primarily due to <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> given through grandfathering. To avoid these windfall profits and to decrease leakage, two major modifications have been implemented for the third phase: electric companies no longer receive <b>free</b> <b>allowances,</b> while energy intensive and trade exposed sectors are granted <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> that are calculated based on firm production capacity. This paper theoretically shows {{a new type of}} profit increase in sectors that are not exposed to international competition. This paper also illustrates the profit increase for the third phase of the EU-ETS and shows that profits in the electricity sector may increase by approximately 2 % when <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> are given to the other sectors...|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{quantify}} the impact of a rate structure which includes a <b>free</b> <b>allowance</b> on residential water consumption.

40|$|Firms {{subject to}} cost-of-service {{regulation}} cannot withhold windfall profits associated with <b>free</b> emissions <b>allowances.</b> This paper examines {{the efficiency and}} distributional impacts of two approaches to transfer <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> to consumers: output subsidies and lump-sum payments. We employ an empirically calibrated model of the U. S. economy that features regulated monopolies in the electricity sector and many heterogeneous households. Under a carbon dioxide cap-and-trade policy, we find that using <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> to subsidize regulated electricity prices increases aggregate welfare costs by 40 - 80 percent relative to lump-sum transfers. These inefficiencies are disproportionately borne by households in the tails of the income distribution...|$|R

40|$|The {{allocation}} of <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> for firms {{belonging to the}} carbon leakage list of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) was found to lead to substantial overcompensation, which is why some stakeholders recently {{have called for a}} phasing out of <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> in the near term. This paper analyzes the consequences of phasing out <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> in a dynamic two-period model when one group of countries unilaterally implements climate policies such as an emissions trading scheme. A carbon price induces firms to invest in abatement capital, but may also lead to the relocation of some firms. The social planner addresses the relocation problem by offering firms transfers, i. e. <b>free</b> <b>allowances,</b> conditional on maintaining the production in the regulating country. If transfers are unrestricted in both periods, then the social planner can implement the first best by setting the carbon price equal to the marginal environmental damage and using transfers to prevent any relocation. However, if transfers in the future period are restricted, it is optimal to implement a declining carbon price path with the first period price exceeding the marginal environmental damage. A high carbon price triggers investments in abatement capital and thus creates a lock-in effect. With a larger abatement capital stock, firms are less affected by carbon prices in the future and therefore less prone to relocate in the second period where transfers are restricted...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} how to {{allocate}} pollution permits is critical for the political sustainability of any cap-and-trade system. Under the objective of offsetting firms' losses resulting from the environmental regulation, we argue that the criteria for allocating <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> must account {{for the type of}} abatement technology: industries that use process integrated technologies should receive some <b>free</b> <b>allowances,</b> whereas those using end-of-pipe abatement should not. In the long run, we analyze the interaction between the environmental policy and the evolution of the market structure. In particular, a reserve of pollution permits for new entrants may be justified when the industry uses a process integrated abatement technology.

40|$|In {{the third}} trading period (2013 - 2020) of EU ETS, around {{two thirds of}} the total European wide {{allocation}} will be auctioned on average. Allowances for auctioning will be allocated among the Member States according to a predefined formula. In order to prevent carbon leakage, i. e. migration of EU industries to other areas to avoid carbon costs, industries found to be exposed to high cost increases or industries with high trade intensity will still get <b>free</b> <b>allowances,</b> according to industry benchmarks. Free allocation reduces the number of allowances to be auctioned. The list of Industry sectors to be entitled to receive <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> is going to be finally decided by the end of 2009. The report discusses the impact of allocation of <b>free</b> <b>allowance</b> for each of the Nordic countries, both in terms of free allocation to national industries and in terms of auctioning volume.
