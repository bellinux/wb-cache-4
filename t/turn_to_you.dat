"Something {{has to be}} {{done for}} women, Stephen, something--urgently--and nothing is done until that is done, some release from their {{intolerable}} subjection to sex, so that for us everything else in life, respect, freedom, social standing, is entirely secondary to that. But what {{has to be done}}? We women do not know. Our efforts to know are among the most desolating of spectacles. I read the papers of those suffrage women; the effect is more like agitated geese upon a common than anything human has a right to be.... That's why I <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Years ago I felt, and now I know, there is about you a simplicity of mind, a foolishness of faith, that is stronger and greater than the cleverness of any woman alive.

No, but still I <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> In the old days I used to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and shake your mind and make you think about things you seemed too sluggish to think about without my clamor. Once do you remember at Martens I shook you by the ears.... And when I made you think, you thought, as I could never do. Think now--about women.|$|E
