40|$|ABSTRACT: Analysis of the {{smectite}} {{content of}} mixed-layer illite/smectite minerals in 4 wells in the Paris Basin {{indicates that the}} sediments have not experienced the same thermal history throughout their burial history. Reconstruction of the total burial depths and thermal 9 maxima for the sediments inthe different levels of the wells indicates that he present-day depth-temperature relations reflect he existence of the same continuous sequence of diagenetic change in 2 of the wells. An empirical relation giving smectite content {{as a function of}} maximum paleotemperature wasderived. A strong break in the clay mineral compositions in the upper levels of 2 wells at a third site indicated an anomaly in the diagenesis process. This break in the sequence ofclay diagenetic transformation can be traced to major subvertical faults which cross-cut the wells. These anomalies are attributed tothe faults which are assumed to have acted as <b>thermal</b> <b>drains</b> towards the surface, locally increasing the temperature of the sediments for a major portion of the burial history when the faults were active. Closure of the fault system coincides with the return to a normal pattern in clay diagenesis for sediments in the upper portions of the wells. It is concluded that clays may be used to trace thermal histories of sediments in a sedimentary basin...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermoluminescence}} (TL) {{levels of}} 45 ordinary chondrites were measured {{to obtain information}} about the meteorite orbits. The low-temperature TL reaches equilibrium while the meteorite is in space and reflects {{the temperature of the}} meteorite at perihelion. Samples of Pribram, Lost City, and Innisfree, whose orbits are accurately known, were used as control samples. The TL levels in 40 out ot 42 meteorites are similar to the three control samples, indicating {{that the vast majority of}} ordinary chondrites that survive atmospheric entry have perihelia similar to three known orbits, i. e., in the range 0. 8 – 1 AU. The effects of albedo and rotation are also considered. A simple model indicates that temperature gradients of 1 – 2 °K/cm are possible in slowly rotating meteoroids and such a temperature gradient is consistent with the unusually large TL gradient measured in the Farmville meteorite. Since slow rotation rates are improbable, other possibilities are examined but no satisfactory explanation has been found. The TL level measured in the Malakal meteorite is two orders of magnitude lower than control samples and is best explained by <b>thermal</b> <b>draining</b> due to solar heating in an orbit with a small perihelion distance.

40|$|The {{complexity}} of microelectronic circuits, their scale of integration, and clock speed re quirements have been increasing steadily. All {{of these changes}} {{have the effect of}} increasing the power density of the micro-circuits. IC's with a power of several watts and area of over a square centimeter are quite common. Thus, there is more heat generated per device at die, component, and substrate-attach levels of electronic packaging. In order to maintain reliability of finished products, the junction temperature of the con stituent devices must be kept low. It has been demonstrated that thermal management can be one key to lowering the cost and increasing the performance life of microelectronic products. The cost effectiveness of lowering device temperature has been demonstrated to be dramatic in comparison to the cost of thermal management materials(l, 2). Proper thermal management of advanced microelectronic devices has to be addressed at all levels. One should address the problem from the basic level of die-attach, through com ponent attach, and eventually substrate-attach to <b>thermal</b> <b>drains.</b> <b>Thermal</b> management is almost invariably coupled with a thermally induced stress problem. The increase in temperature at the device level also means a larger fluctuation of tempera ture from the ambient. Each cycle of on-off for the device represents one thermal cycle. Stress induced failures due to coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch is much more acute for higher power devices. In this paper, we will also address the thermally induced stress on the microelectronic product at all levels of packaging with major emphasis on component and substrate levels. We will demonstrate various ways and examples of reducing or eliminating this stress, which is a major cause of device failures.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a thermal modeling for power management {{of a new}} three-dimensional (3 -D) thinned dies stacking process. Besides the high concentration of power dissipating sources, which is the direct consequence of the very interesting integration efficiency increase, this new ultra-compact packaging technology can suffer of the poor thermal conductivity (about 700 times smaller than silicon one) of the benzocyclobutene (BCB) used as both adhesive and planarization layers in each level of the stack. Thermal simulation was conducted using three-dimensional (3 -D) FEM tool to analyze the specific behaviors in such stacked structure and to optimize the design rules. This study first describes the heat transfer limitation through the vertical path by examining particularly {{the case of the}} high dissipating sources under small area.

The present deliverable is divided in two main parts dedicated to the fuel salt circuit and the draining system. Each part comprises three sections: - a first section named ‘Feedback from EVOL and previous studies: list of identified constraints’ explains the constraints leading to some design options on the basis of past studies (typically from the EVOL project and some previous MSFR parametric studies); - a second section named ‘Proposition of initial reference design’ proposes a preliminary design, based on the constraints identified, {{to be used as a}} basis for the optimization studies foreseen in the SAMOFAR project. This design is not fixed: it will be optimized and will evolve all along the project as will this deliverable itself; - a third section named ‘Developments and studies in the frame of SAMOFAR’ in which all the partners involved in the WP 1 will list the studies that are undertaken during the project. Deliverable 1. 1 presents the initial reference design and operation procedures of the MSFR proposed by CNRS and the other partners of WP 1 at the beginning of the project. The fuel circuit is enclosed in an internal vessel which serves as the container for the fuel salt, with 16 cooling sectors arranged circumferentially in the vessel, inserted from the top. This design results from previous physical and safety preliminary studies and aims at minimizing the fuel leakage occurrences and optimizing the use of the liquid salt both as fuel and coolant.

40|$|The {{literature}} of disturbance ecology reveals that, under present climatic conditions, non-native plants {{have little or}} no role in high arctic tundra revegetation. Rather, {{it has been suggested that}} indigenous flora, especially long-lived perennial graminoids, are crucial to recovery. However, few long-term data are available on past impacts within productive sedge-meadows in the High Arctic, and none which consider the non-vascular flora. This thesis combines biogeographical and patch dynamics perspectives to focus on $ geq$ 21 yr of natural and assisted recovery of vegetation and soils from a wide range of dated anthropogenic surface disturbances at three Canadian Arctic sites. Empirical, experimental and archival investigations were made among climatically similar, but widely disjunct, coastal lowlands of contrasting geologies on Baffin, Devon, and Cornwallis Islands. These data encompass minerotrophic and oligotrophic wetlands in which the vascular floras show minimal differentiation yet the sampled bryofloras share only 31. 8 % of their total taxa. The occurrences chosen for study are representative of the most widespread, small-scale human impacts in the North, including vehicular, pedestrian, construction, and pollution disturbances. It was determined that rutting from even a single passage of a tracked vehicle in summer resulted in significant reductions in species richness and biomass. On slopes $ geq$ 2 $ sp circ$, these same small ruts have drained large areas of peatlands, a serious cumulative impact. Long-term effects of drainage include the local extinction of populations of Sphagnum spp. and rhizomatous vascular aquatics, and changes in the chemistry and <b>thermal</b> regime of <b>drained</b> mineral soils. Other effects include significant changes in biomass and the concentrations of macronutrients in the leaves of dominant species. These effects were magnified in peatlands drained where multi-pass vehicle movements occurred. Species richness displayed an inverse relationship with trampling intensity and the soils of heavily trampled ground remained severely compacted after 21 years. These patches were dominated by dense swards of ruderal grasses. Nutrient concentrations in the leaves of the latter and other colonizing and surviving species tended to increase with trampling intensity. Trampled patches and archaeological sites appeared selectively grazed by several herbivores. Although humans initiated the disturbances within these patches, it is the animals which are responsible for many of the dynamics of patch change over the long-term. Classification and ordination procedures revealed linkages between the floristic associations of trampled meadows on Baffin Island and archaeological sites on Devon and Cornwallis Islands. One critical implication is that even low levels of human impact may give rise to ruderal plant communities which are extremely persistent. These patches are poor in terms of species richness, but contribute to habitat heterogeneity at the landscape level and comprise preferred forage for local vertebrate herbivores. Archaeological excavation and restoration revealed that at least some stores of viable seed exist in both mesic and wet tundra soils and point to the importance of initial floristic composition (sensu Egler 1954). From a long-term perspective, the data establish that mesic tundra vegetation and soils are easily disturbed and recover much more slowly than their low arctic counterparts under similar disturbance regimes...|$|R

By changing the gate temperature around its critical value, the heat flux exchanged between the hot body (source) and the cold body (drain) can be reversibly switched, amplified, and modulated by a tiny action on the gate. Such a device could find important applications in the domain of nanoscale thermal management and it opens up new perspectives concerning the development of contactless thermal circuits intended for information processing using the photon current rather than the electric current. The electronic solid-state transistor [Fig. 1 (a) ] introduced by Bardeen and Brattain in 1948 [1] is undoubtedly the cornerstone of almost all modern systems of information treatment. The classical field-effect transistor (FET), which is composed of three basic elements, the drain, the source, and the gate, is basically used to control the flux of electrons (the current) exchanged in the channel between the drain and the source by changing the voltage applied on the gate. The physical diameter of this channel is fixed, but its effective electrical diameter can be varied by the application of a voltage on the gate. A small change in this voltage can cause a large variation in the current from the source to the drain. In 2006, Li et al. [2] proposed a thermal counterpart of FET by replacing both the electric potentials and the electric currents by thermostats at a fixed temperature and heat fluxes carried by phonons through solid segments. Later, several prototypes of phononic thermal logic gates [3] as well as thermal memories (see [4] and references therein) were developed in order to process information by phonon heat flux rather than by electric currents. However, this technology suffers from some fundamental weaknesses which intrinsically limit its performance. One of the main limitations probably comes from the speed of acoustic phonons (heat carriers), which is 4 or 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the speed of photons. Another intrinsic limitation of phononic devices is related to the inevitable presence of local Kapitza resistances. Those resistances which come from the mismatch of vibrational modes at the interface of different elements can reduce the heat flux dramatically. Finally, the strong nonlinear phonon-phonon interaction mechanism makes the phononic devices difficult to deal with {{in the presence of a}} strong thermal gradient. On the contrary, the physics of transport mediated by photon tunneling remains unchanged close and far from thermal equilibrium. This explains, in part, why so many efforts have been deployed, during the past decades, to attempt to develop full optical or at least optoelectronic architectures for processing and managing information. In particular, important developments have been carried out during the past decade with plasmonics systems [5, 6] to greatly increase the speed of information processing while reducing the dimension of devices at the nanoscale at the same time. However, despite these major steps forward, an optical transistor is still missing. We introduce here a thermal transistor [Fig. 1 (b) ] based on the heat transport by evanescent photons rather than by acoustic waves or electrons. This near-field thermal transistor (NFTT) basically consists of a gate made of an insulator-metal transition (IMT) material which is able to qualitatively and quantitatively change its optical properties through a small change of its temperature around a critical temperature T c. Vanadium dioxide (VO 2) is one of such materials (the choice of IMT depends on the operating range of the transistor: around T ¼ 500 K, LaCoO 3 could replace VO 2, for instance) that undergoes a first-order transition (Mott transition [7]) from a high-temperature metallic phase to a low-temperature insulating phase [8] close to room temperature (T c ¼ 340 K). Different works have already shown [9 – 11] that the heat flux exchanged at close separation distances (i. e., in the near-field regime) between an IMT material and another medium can be modulated by several orders of magnitude across the phase transition of IMT materials. Further radiative thermal diodes have been recently conceived allowing fo...|$|R
