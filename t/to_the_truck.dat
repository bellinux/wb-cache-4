Joe Nemechek and Bowyer were announced as replacements in the truck for the races at Talladega and Texas, respectively. Bowyer gave the team a victory at Texas. Mike Wallace drove the truck {{at the beginning of}} the season at Daytona, but crashed {{at the beginning of the}} race. Timothy Peters drove the 46 in three races, with a top ten. Erin Crocker drove the first two races for this team in 2008, followed by Scott Speed who drove the truck at Atlanta and Martinsville, followed by Landon Cassill at Mansfield and Lowe's with the godaddy.com sponsorship. Aric Almirola and Regan Smith drove in between races when Cassill was fulfilling obligations for his Nationwide Series team. Cassill had the team's best finish of the year and the final top-five as Morgan-Dollar, when he finished 3rd at the Milwaukee Mile.|$|E
25|$|After Ultra {{purchased}} the Mattei Motorsports No. 7 Nations Rent-sponsored Cup team, Wallace was announced {{as the driver}} for 2001. Despite starting off {{the season with a}} sixth-place finish at the Daytona 500, the team struggled in qualifying, almost costing Wallace his job before he posted two consecutive top tens finishes. During that time, he began running with a new Busch Series team, Biagi Brothers Racing, running their No. 4 Geico-sponsored Chevy. His best finish of eight starts was a tenth at Richmond International Raceway. Late in the season, Wallace was granted his release from Ultra, and joined Penske-Kranefuss Racing, driving the No. 12 Mobil 1-sponsored Ford Taurus as a teammate to his brother Rusty. At Phoenix, he led forty-five laps late in the race before giving the lead up to Jeff Burton, finishing a career-best second place. Unfortunately, Penske decided not to keep the 12 team going, forcing Wallace out of a ride (Penske did keep the number 12 for Ryan Newman's team the following year, replacing the 02 Newman had used in a few races in 2001). He began the season driving for Andy Petree for a pair of races, before financial problems caused that team to cease operations. He returned to run with Biagi for seventeen races in the Busch Series, posting two consecutive fourteenth-place finishes. Wallace also returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truck</b> series driving the Federated Auto Parts truck for Schrader, posting two top-tens. Mid-season, he signed onto the No. 14 Conseco-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for A. J. Foyt Racing, his best finish a tenth at Bristol.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the 2006 season, Compton was replaced by Marcos Ambrose and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truck</b> Series, sharing the No. 09 Ford with Joey Clanton for nine races. In 2006, Compton founded Turn One Racing, LLC, as a way of promoting talented young drivers in the southeastern United States. He made a total of fourteen starts that season, ten for Wood Brothers/JTG, as well as one for Key Motorsports and three for Xpress Motorsports. He bought into Bobby Hamilton Racing in 2008, and was named driver of the No. 4 Dodge for the team during the season. After the race at Bristol Motor Speedway the No. 4 team shut down, leaving Compton out of a job. He drove the No. 60 Toyota for Wyler Racing in 2009, finishing with 8 top-tens and finishing 11th in points. Despite the new sponsorship, Jeff Wyler was unsure if the team would continue into 2010, so Compton and Turn One Racing bought the No. 60 from Wyler, though the team continued into 2010 under the Wyler Racing banner. Compton would split the No. 60 Truck with former Formula 1 driver Narain Karthikeyan and Red Bull development driver Cole Whitt, while also changing manufacturers to Chevrolet. Compton later took sole ownership of the team and renamed it Turn One Racing. Compton scored only five top tens and finished 20th in points. Karthikeyan left {{at the end of the}} year to drive for Hispania Racing in F1, while Safe Auto left the team to sponsor ThorSport Racing's No. 13 Truck.|$|E

Luke takes one last stab at freedom when he is ordered to take the turtle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> He steals the dump truck, as well as the keys to the other trucks. [...] In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the dump truck and joins Luke in his escape. Later, after abandoning the truck, Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God and blames Him for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline walks in and tells Luke that the police and bosses have promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully. But Luke, feeling that his life is no longer worth living, walks to a window facing the police and mocks the Captain by repeating the first part of his speech ("What we've got here is a failure to communicate."). He is immediately shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. Dragline carries Luke outside, then charges at Boss Godfrey and attempts to strangle him until he is beaten and subdued by the other guards. In tears, Dragline implores Luke to live. The local police want to take Luke to a nearby hospital, but the Captain tells them {{to take him to the}} prison hospital instead, a long enough distance that Luke's chances of survival are slim. As the captain's car drives away, it crushes Boss Godfrey's glasses. After Luke's implied death, Dragline and the other prisoners reminisce about him. In the final scene, the prison crew is seen working near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot. Dragline is now wearing leg irons, and there is a new Walking Boss. As the camera zooms out, the torn photograph of Luke grinning with the two women is superimposed on a bird's eye view of the cross-shaped road junction.|$|E
