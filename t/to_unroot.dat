It is of considerable interest whether a network can be considered `tree-like' or not, which lead {{to the introduction of}} tree-based networks in the rooted, binary context.

Previous extensions have considered extending <b>to</b> the binary, <b>unrooted</b> case and the nonbinary, rooted case.

40|$|Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) {{has become}} one of the {{principle}} methods of performing phylogenetic in-ference. Implementing the Markov chain Monte Carlo al-gorithm requires the definition of a proposal distribution which defines a transition kernel over the state space. The precise form of this transition kernel has a large impact on the computational efficiency of the algorithm. In this paper we investigate the efficiency of a number of different pro-posal distributions for clock-constrained phylogenetic trees (i. e. constrained by a strict or relaxed molecular clock). Clock-constrained trees have become increasingly important in phylogenetic inference, especially in the context of diver-gence time estimation and their constraints require substan-tially different proposal algorithms <b>to</b> <b>unrooted</b> phylogenetic trees. We investigated the efficiency of seven proposal moves on clock-constraint trees first on a small data set and then on six additional data sets. In contrast to the results for the case of MCMC on unconstrained phylogenetic trees we found that subtree swapping moves perform better than subtree prune and regraft algorithms and moderate proposals dominate bold proposals.

This thesis investigates ways of improving existing algorithms for calculating the minimum rooted subtree prune and regraft distance and hybridisation number for a pair or, in the latter case, set of trees. In both cases a technique is used that allows the problem to be rekernelised during the run of the program. Another, less effective method, is also looked at which finds the rooted subtree prune and regraft distance or hybridisation number solely on what cannot be contained within any agreement forest.

40|$|Abstract—We study a {{new data}} mining problem {{concerning}} {{the discovery of}} frequent agreement subtrees (FASTs) from a set of phylogenetic trees. A phylogenetic tree, or phylogeny, is an unordered tree in which the order among siblings is unimportant. Furthermore, each leaf in the tree has a label representing a taxon (species or organism) name, whereas internal nodes are unlabeled. The tree may have a root, representing the common ancestor of all species in the tree, or may be unrooted. An unrooted phylogeny arises {{due to the lack}} of sufficient evidence to infer a common ancestor of the taxa in the tree. The FAST problem addressed here is a natural extension of the maximum agreement subtree (MAST) problem widely studied in the computational phylogenetics community. The paper establishes a framework for tackling the FAST problem for both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees using data mining techniques. We first develop a novel canonical form for rooted trees together with a phylogeny-aware tree expansion scheme for generating candidate subtrees level by level. Then, we present an efficient algorithm to find all FASTs in a given set of rooted trees, through an Apriori-like approach. We show the correctness and completeness of the proposed method. Finally, we discuss the extensions of the techniques <b>to</b> <b>unrooted</b> trees. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods work well, and are capable of finding interesting patterns in both synthetic data and real phylogenetic trees.

40|$|Gene trees {{describe}} how {{parts of the}} species have evolved over time, and {{it is assumed that}} gene trees have evolved along the branches of the species tree. However, some of gene trees are often discordant with the corresponding species tree due to the complicated evolution history of genes. To overcome this obstacle, median problems have emerged as a major tool for synthesizing species trees by reconciling discordance in a given collection of gene trees. Given a collection of gene trees and a cost function, the median problem seeks a tree, called median tree, that minimizes the overall cost to the gene trees. Median tree problems are typically NP-hard, and there is an increased interest in making such median tree problems available for large-scale species tree construction. In this thesis work, we first show that the gene duplication median tree problem satisfied the weaker version of the Pareto property and propose a parameterized algorithm to solve the gene duplication median tree problem. Second, we design two efficient methods to handle the issues of applying the parameterized algorithm <b>to</b> <b>unrooted</b> gene trees which are sampled from the different species. Third, we introduce the graph-theoretic formulation of the Robinson-Foulds median tree problem and a new tree edit operation. Fourth, we propose a new metric between two phylogenetic trees and examine the statistical properties of the metric.

40|$|Abstract—Finding a maximal {{independent}} set (MIS) is {{a classic}} problem in graph theory that has been widely studied {{in the context of}} distributed algorithms. Standard distributed solutions to the MIS problem focus on time complexity. In this paper, we also consider fairness. For a given MIS algorithm A and graph G, we define the inequality factor for A on G to be the largest ratio between the probabilities of the nodes joining an MIS in the graph. We say an algorithm is fair with respect to a family of graphs if it achieves a constant inequality factor for all graphs in the family. In this paper, we seek efficient and fair algorithms for common graph families. We begin by describing an algorithm that is fair and runs in O(log ∗ n) -time in rooted trees of size n. Moving <b>to</b> <b>unrooted</b> trees, we describe a fair algorithm that runs in O(logn) time. Generalizing further to bipartite graphs, we describe a third fair algorithm that requires O(log 2 n) rounds. We also show a fair algorithm for planar graphs that runs in O(log 2 n) rounds, and describe an algorithm that can be run in any graph, yielding good bounds on inequality in regions that can be efficiently colored with a small number of colors. We conclude our theoretical analysis with a lower bound that identifies a graph where all MIS algorithms achieve an inequality bound in Ω(n) —eliminating the possibility of an MIS algorithm that is fair in all graphs. Finally, to motivate the need for provable fairness guarantees, we simulate both our tree algorithm and Luby’s MIS algorithm [13] in a variety of different tree topologies—some synthetic and some derived from real world data. Whereas our algorithm always yield an inequality factor ≤ 3. 25 in these simulations, Luby’s algorithms yields factors as large as 168. Keywords-MIS; fairness; I...|$|R

For speedup s, we find a 6 γ/(s + 1) -approximation for s in the range 1 ≤ s ≤ 2 and a 4 γ/s-approximation for s in the range 2 ≤ s ≤ 4, where γ = 1 on tree-shaped networks and γ = 2 + ǫ on general metric graphs. ...|$|R

There are no effective treatments for controlling this disease. The use of infected nursery stocks has largely contributed {{to the spread of}} the pathogen, and therefore the development of treatments to preventively sanitize the propagation stock is critical in the nursery industry. This study describes novel techniques to achieve this aim. The effects of several temperature–exposure time combinations were evaluated: (i) the survival of pathogen on culture medium (PDA); (ii) the pathogen viability on infected shoots and plants; (iii) the vegetative growth of plants of several cultivars; and (iv) the rooting ability of cuttings. The colonies of the pathogen growing in PDA were killed after 8 h and 60 min of exposure at 40 and 47 °C, respectively. Temperatures ≥ 42 °C for at least 2 h were lethal for the pathogen infecting the shoots. Likewise, moist hot air treatments at 42 – 44 °C for 6 – 12 h eradicated the pathogen, without compromising the viability of the plants. Five olive cultivars were also evaluated and classified according to their thermotolerance as follows: sensitive (Chiquitita), moderately sensitive (Koroneiki, Frantoio and Picual) and heat tolerant (Arbequina). However, the optimized sanitation methods were applicable to all of the cultivars. Finally, heat treatments were applied <b>to</b> <b>unrooted</b> cuttings, which severely affected their rooting ability.
