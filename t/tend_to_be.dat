5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abundant, so competition {{is low and}} individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made {{of only a few}} individuals. They also <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{at the top of the}} cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E

5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.|$|E

Silver(III) complexes <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rare and very easily reduced to the more stable lower oxidation states, though they are slightly more stable than those of copper(III). For instance, the square planar periodate 5− and tellurate 5− complexes may be prepared by oxidising silver(I) with alkaline peroxodisulfate. The yellow diamagnetic − is much less stable, fuming in moist air and reacting with glass.|$|E
