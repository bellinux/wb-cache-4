5|$|The Whitby Regatta {{takes place}} {{annually}} over {{three days in}} August. The competition between three rowing clubs – Whitby Friendship ARC, Whitby Fishermen's ARC and Scarborough ARC – forms {{the backbone of the}} weekend.

5|$|The Stonyhurst Officer Training Corps {{assembled}} for {{the first}} time on 16 October 1900, in the Ambulacrum, overseen by The First Volunteer Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment who gave instruction in drill and musketry. The original uniform was scarlet with a white piping and slouch hat, which was changed to khaki before the First World War. The Corps was granted the honour of representation at the Coronation of 1910 and sent members to the Royal Review at Windsor in 1911. It also appeared on parade annually for <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> the Corpus Christi celebrations until the practice became obsolete after Vatican II.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{reaching}} the Emerald City (an analogue of the real-life World Trade Center plaza), the quintet gains passage {{into the city}} because of Dorothy's ownership of the silver slippers; they marvel at <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> {{the city and its}} sophisticated, fashion forward dancers. They are granted an audience with the Wiz (Richard Pryor), who lives {{at the very top of}} the Towers. He appears to them as a giant fire-breathing metallic head. He will only grant their wishes if they kill the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East, Evillene (Mabel King), the Wicked Witch of the West, who runs a sweatshop in the underground sewers of Oz. Before they can reach her domain, Evillene learns of their quest to kill her and sends out the Flying Monkeys (a motorcycle gang) to kidnap them.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on Criterion's proprietary game engine RenderWare. The graphics engine was improved to give between 50–100% faster rendering than in Burnout 2. The increased performance {{allowed them to}} add features like real-time radiosity lighting and better environment mapping effects on vehicles. Programmers at the studio were adamant about making the game run at a frame rate of sixty frames per seconds to offer instant response and feedback while driving fast. Since the crash sequences were slower, the higher frame rate was less considered less critical than <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle collisions. They opted to run the game at thirty frames per second during these instances and dramatically {{increased the number of}} particles and debris that were rendered. From an early stage in development, the team wanted to include support for online network play in Burnout 3. They had never explored online play before, so they used Burnout 2 as a test-bed for the feature before integrating it into Burnout 3.|$|E
25|$|Traditional aristocratic values {{began to}} be criticised in the mid 17th century: Blaise Pascal, for example, offered a ferocious {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> power and François de La Rochefoucauld posited that no human act—however generous it pretended to be—could be considered disinterested.|$|E

25|$|A {{particularly}} distinctive form of {{road locomotive}} was the showman's engine. These were operated by travelling showmen both to tow fairground equipment and to power it when set up, {{either directly or}} by running a generator. These could be highly decorated and formed part of <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> the fair. Some were fitted with a small crane {{that could be used}} when assembling the ride.|$|E
25|$|Those minstrels {{who stayed}} in New York and similar cities {{followed}} Barnum's lead by advertising relentlessly and emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> minstrelsy. Troupes ballooned; {{as many as}} 19 performers could be on stage at once, and J. H. Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels had over 100 members. Scenery grew lavish and expensive, and specialty acts like Japanese acrobats or circus freaks sometimes appeared. These changes made minstrelsy unprofitable for smaller troupes.|$|E
25|$|Between 1936 and 1938, {{three very}} large Moscow Trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, {{in which they}} were accused of conspiring with fascist and {{capitalist}} powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.|$|E
50|$|At {{the turn}} of the 19th century, Beethoven and the Romantic {{movement}} ushered in a new era that led first to <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> <b>of</b> grand opera and then to the musical dramas of Giuseppe Verdi and the Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) of the operas of Richard Wagner leading directly to the music of the 20th century.|$|R

Wu Ting Fang was a Chinese diplomat in Washington and wrote America, through <b>the</b> <b>spectacles</b> <b>of</b> an Oriental diplomat (excerpted in The New York Times, 22 March 1914).

25|$|In certain instances, {{the values}} of 17th-century nobility played a major part in the {{literature}} of the era. Most notable of these values are the aristocratic obsession with glory (la gloire) and majesty (la grandeur). <b>The</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> power, prestige and luxury found in 17th-century literature may be distasteful or even offensive. Corneille's heroes, for example, have been labeled by modern critics as vainglorious, extravagant and prideful; however, contemporary aristocratic readers would see these characters (and their actions) as representative of nobility.|$|E
25|$|FIA President Max Mosley {{announced}} dramatic rule {{changes for}} the 2009 season {{in a bid to}} improve <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> the sport, with the cars undergoing major changes in an effort to increase overtaking. The design changes significantly altered the design of the cars, incorporating wider and lower front wings, taller and narrower rear wings, and a reduction on aerodynamic bodywork. Also introduced were slick tyres and Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems, as well as implementing cost-cutting measures in a response to the rising costs of competing.|$|E
25|$|The unit {{continued}} operating its Tempests from Pune {{after the}} annexation of Hyderabad, but following {{a spate of}} accidents in the following years, the unit was re-equipped first with Vampire FB 52s in December 1952 and then with Dassault Ouragans in February 1954. The unit regularly {{played a part in}} <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> Republic Day parades, and in ceremonial occasions, such as the Passing out Parade of Dehradun. In December 1954, No. 3 escorted the aircraft carrying Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia. The unit had, by this time, moved to Jamnagar for armament training.|$|E

25|$|Japan {{was one of}} the birthplaces of {{drifting}} as a sport. It {{was most}} popular in the All Japan Touring Car Championship races. The famous motorcyclist turned driver, Kunimitsu Takahashi, was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s. This earned him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> smoking tires. The bias ply racing tires of the 1960s1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip angle. As professional racers in Japan drove this way, so did the street racers.|$|E
25|$|Then {{the trio}} of Mrs Whatsit, Mrs Who, and Mrs Which arrive. They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT, because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him. Their father had last seen Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins. Mrs Whatsit says that, although she and the others like <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> the family reuniting, they have to go somewhere. Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence, she and the others disappear.|$|E
25|$|A {{man who is}} {{born into}} a world already possessed, if he cannot get {{subsistence}} from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature's mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly execute her own orders, {{if he does not}} work upon the compassion of some of her guests. If these guests get up and make room for him, other intruders immediately appear demanding the same favour. The report of a provision for all that come, fills the hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness of the guests is destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> misery and dependence in every part of the hall, and by the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly enraged at not finding the provision which they had been taught to expect. The guests learn too late their error, in counter-acting those strict orders to all intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast, who, wishing that all guests should have plenty, and knowing she could not provide for unlimited numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers when her table was already full.|$|E

25|$|The {{other two}} groups of protesters, however, {{maintained}} their positions for weeks to come. The art gallery closed {{for the duration of}} the occupation, probably more because of <b>the</b> <b>spectacle</b> <b>of</b> shabbily dressed homeless men juxtaposed against the opulent exhibits of high art than for any logistical reasons. The RCPU emphasized discipline among its members in order to win rather than alienate public sympathy, which was evident at the other two locations that remained open to the public. Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster attempted to persuade the men to leave, telling them that they had made their point and should now go home. Brodie responded that if they had homes, they would be in them, and invited the colonel to arrest them. They offered to submit to arrest peacefully, and continued to do so {{for the duration of the}} occupation. Foster refused, and instead sought to manage the situation rather than clog the local prison with 1000 demonstrators and giving them the publicity they sought. The attorney-general agreed with Colonel Foster that the strikers would likely vacate on their own in a matter of days. But even as the strike dragged on from days into weeks, the police stood by awaiting orders before proceeding with an eviction. Colonel Foster had earned a reputation for diplomacy with the unemployed during the 1935 strike, which he appeared to be cultivating again in 1938. Behind the scenes, however, Foster was plotting with politicians and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to evacuate the post office and art gallery.|$|E
