5|$|A {{reversible}} {{cellular automaton}} is a cellular automaton {{in which every}} configuration has a unique predecessor. That is, it is a regular grid of cells, each containing a state drawn from a finite set of states, with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based on the states of their neighbors, such <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> state of any cell before an update can be determined uniquely from the updated states of all the cells. The time-reversed dynamics of a reversible cellular automaton can always be described by another cellular automaton rule, possibly on a much larger neighborhood.|$|E

By 2100UTC on July 24, the National Hurricane Center began classifying the system as Tropical Depression Two. In the first advisory on the depression, it was noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> tropical depression was erroneously classified as Tropical Depression Two.|$|E
5|$|Batman Forevers tone is {{significantly}} different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since Warner Bros. believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> Batman film, Batman Returns (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films by drawing inspiration from the Batman comic book of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director. William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were initially considered for Keaton's replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.|$|E
5|$|After a large fire at Miss Knox's School (site of the Briarcliff Corporate Campus) in 1912, the department's {{equipment}} was upgraded {{to deal with}} larger fires. The village purchased its first motorized vehicle, an American LaFrance pumper truck. The existing hose-and-chemical wagon was motorized and became the chief's car. In 1914, the Briarcliff Manor Municipal Building was constructed to house the government and fire engines. The likeness of its garage doors {{can be seen in}} the façade of the present restaurant. Later in 1914 the department established sub-stations at Mrs. Whitson's barn on Pleasantville Road and on the Holden farm at Scarborough Road (roughly opposite the current firehouse); these were discontinued in 1921. The first major fire to involve the motorized vehicles was in 1916 at the central business district. In spite of the new equipment, several buildings at the northern end were destroyed. The 1908 hook-and-ladder truck was motorized in 1923 and two years later, the chief's car was replaced by another American LaFrance vehicle. An electric siren was installed in 1928 after a complaint <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> alarm sounded more like a call to breakfast than an alarm of fire.|$|E

5|$|Although Beebe and {{his team}} enjoyed {{rewarding}} seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality this was more the result of insufficient funding {{as well as the}} unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope of finding a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.|$|E
5|$|During a hailstorm in Washington state, {{university}} students run to find shelter. One girl, Lauren (Kristi Angus), {{stands in the}} rain, lights a cigarette, and goes up in flames. Millennium Group consultant Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) travels to the university to interview witnesses to the death. A teaching assistant tells Black that the dead girl was highly intelligent, pointing out an armillary sphere Lauren had constructed. She also tells Black <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> Millennium Group contact had taken great interest in this sphere. Black did not realize the Group had sent another member, but on leaving, he meets the man in question—Dennis Hoffman (Brad Dourif). Hoffman describes his theories to Black, detailing how when several planets achieve syzygy on May 5, 2000, a series of natural disasters will bring {{about the end of}} the world. Hoffman believes that this cataclysm will be preceded by strange events and weather patterns.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hedley Marston's {{research}} into nuclear {{fallout from the}} Maralinga nuclear tests brought Marston into bitter conflict with the Australian government appointed Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee. He was vindicated posthumously by the McClelland Royal Commission, which found that significant radiation hazards existed at many of the Maralinga test sites long after the tests. His project tracked fallout across the continent by examining the thyroids of sheep and cattle as well as devices that filtered radioactive elements from air. Later the results, which showed dramatic increases of certain radioactive elements after British Nuclear Tests, caused a further, controversial study where the bones of deceased people (especially children) were burnt to ash and then measured for strontium-90. These tests showed that the tests had increased the concentration of strontium-90 dramatically. As well as finding this after British tests a notable 50% increase was noticed one year {{when there were no}} tests and it was cited as evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> year's hydrogen bomb tests had contaminated the majority of the world.|$|E

5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> Nonary Game {{consisted}} of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic {{and in a}} mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that {{the stress of the}} game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This research was to help Ace cure his prosopagnosia. This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued the children from the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they could escape, and forced her into the incinerator room where she faced a sudoku puzzle that she could not solve, and apparently died.|$|E
5|$|More recently, a 2007 {{analysis}} by paleontologist William G. Parker {{resulted in a}} larger tree of aetosaur phylogenetics with the inclusion of Heliocanthus. Based on the tree, Parker defined the clades Typothoracisinae and Paratypothoracisini, both within Aetosaurinae. Parker also gave a revised phylogenetic definition of Aetosauria, mentioning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> definition, made by Heckert and Lucas in 2000, was somewhat ambiguous. Heckert & Lucas (2000) defined Aetosauria as a stem-based taxon, claiming that Aetosauria included all crurotarsans that were {{more closely related to}} Desmatosuchus than to the immediate sister group of Aetosauria. Because the immediate sister group of Aetosauria was uncertain, Parker offered a new definition with several non-aetosaur crurotarsan genera rather than one sister group. According to Parker, Aetosauria included all taxa more closely related to Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus than to Leptosuchus, Postosuchus, Prestosuchus, Poposaurus, Sphenosuchus, Alligator, Gracilisuchus, and Revueltosaurus.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, who always bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto {{and asked if he}} should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa on behalf of his elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E

5|$|One Foot used Bournemouth to film some {{exterior}} sequences {{because of}} its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the housenear Pokesdown, Bournemouthwhich had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided {{to find a new}} house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (Filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.|$|E
5|$|This {{demand was}} {{far-reaching}} and required {{transformation of the}} empire into a federal state, placing Lithuania {{on a par with}} the Grand Duchy of Finland within the Russian constitutional system. Heated discussions continued on the means to achieve this transformation. Some argued for armed resistance, but were reminded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> uprisings in November 1831 and January 1863 had failed. Others suggested peaceful and passive resistance: refusing to pay taxes, boycotting products from monopolistic companies (mostly those selling alcoholic beverages), not allowing children to attend Russian schools, evading drafts into the Russian army, and organizing factory worker strikes. The delegates, who were mostly small farmers, also discussed land reform, demanding that all land would be confiscated from large landlords and distributed to those who actually cultivated it. However, no conclusions in that area were reached as there was a perception that any resolution on land reform would encourage the peasants to rise against their landlords as it was happening in other parts of the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Two {{major medical}} studies have {{analyzed}} {{the extent of}} casualties from the smog. Leonard Greenburg — the same medical researcher who had previously published findings on the death count of the 1953 and 1963 smogs — published a paper in October 1967 showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> year's smog had likely killed 168 people. Greenburg showed that there were 24 deaths in excess of how many would normally be expected {{at that time of}} year every day, over a period of seven days — using a period four days longer than the smog itself had lasted because of the delay between smog exposure and resultant health effects. Greenburg said that his analysis could not account for damage during the smog that would remain latent and continue to cause disease and death for years. The results of Greenburg's paper were reported by the New York Times. A 1978 medical paper published in the Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine estimated that the smog shortened the lives of 366 people.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes colonised the North American {{continent}} in two waves: {{during or}} before the Illinoian glaciation, {{and during the}} Wisconsinan glaciation. Gene mapping demonstrates that red foxes in North America have been isolated from their Old World counterparts for over 400,000 years, thus raising the possibility that speciation has occurred, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> binomial name of Vulpes fulva may be valid. In the far north, red fox fossils {{have been found in}} Sangamonian deposits in the Fairbanks District and Medicine Hat. Fossils dating from the Wisconsian are present in 25 sites in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wyoming. Although they ranged far south during the Wisconsinan, the onset of warm conditions shrank their range toward the north, and have only recently reclaimed their former American ranges because of human-induced environmental changes. Genetic testing indicates two distinct red fox refugia exist in North America, which have been separated since the Wisconsinan. The northern (or boreal) refugium occurs in Alaska and western Canada, and consists of the large subspecies V.v.alascensis, V.v.abietorum, V.v.regalis, and V.v.rubricosa. The southern (or montane) refugium occurs in the subalpine parklands and alpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada. It encompasses the subspecies V.v.macroura, V.v.cascadensis, and V.v.necator. The latter clade has been separated from all other red fox populations since the last glacial maximum, and may possess unique ecological or physiological adaptations.|$|E
