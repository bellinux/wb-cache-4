500|$|York {{recorded}} {{their first}} victory since early September 2014 after winning 1–0 away against Cheltenham Town, De Girolamo scoring from a Coulson {{pass in the}} 43rd minute. De Girolamo was recalled early from his loan spell by Sheffield United as they wanted him for their two upcoming cup fixtures, after he had scored three times in four York matches. Bournemouth's Guadeloupe international defender Stéphane Zubar joined on loan until 4 January 2015, with Parslow being loaned back to Grimsby until the same date. York drew 1–1 {{at home with their}} divisional rivals AFC Wimbledon {{in the first round of}} the FA Cup; Hyde gave York the lead in the eighth minute after scoring from Coulson's low cross, before Andy Frampton equalised for the away team on 22 minutes. Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working as hard as <b>they</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> but I'm just looking for a little bit more now".|$|E

[...] In addition, it is often reported that individuals feel they gain access to higher spiritual dimensions and make contact with various spiritual or extra-dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers.|$|E

The two chosen members declare their love, and then reprise [...] "Perfect Strangers". Just then, there comes a noise from the crypt, and a very-much-alive Edwin Drood appears, ready to tell all what really happened {{on the night of}} his disappearance ("The Writing On The Wall"). What happened was that when Drood was attacked, he was only stunned when he fell and not killed. Jasper dragged him to a crypt where he left him. When Drood woke, he escaped and fled from Cloisterham, only returning so that he could find out who wanted him dead. He sings to the audience, eventually joined {{by the rest of the}} cast, imploring them to hold on to life for as long as <b>they</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> and telling them that 'holding on to life is all.' The mystery is solved, and the show concludes as the cast sings to the audience to read the writing on the wall.|$|E

If someone is saying 'What am I going to buy this month?' in November, I hope that our game is the one they pick out, because we're offering something that nothing else on the market is.
