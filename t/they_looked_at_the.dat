5|$|In 2010, Letlive {{began writing}} on the third album. Butler said that their writing {{approach}} changed in comparison to their previous releases, as they were now doing most of it while on tour. During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, {{who was in a}} soul band.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Barry Cunliffe decided {{to examine a}} single hill fort and its {{surrounding}} territory {{in an attempt to}} shed light on Iron Age society, its politics, and population. With the permission of the site's owner, Hampshire County Council, archaeological excavations began in 1969 and continued until 1988. Over the twentyseasons archaeologists spent examining the site, <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> defences and the gateway, and excavated 57% of the interior, where the remains of wattle and timber houses were discovered. It was the lengthiest investigation of any hill fort in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of outsiders {{such as the}} Strangers and the Particulars was a considerable annoyance to the Pilgrims. As early as 1623, a conflict broke out between the Pilgrims and the Strangers over the celebration of Christmas, a day of no particular significance to the Pilgrims. Furthermore, a group of Strangers founded the nearby settlement of Wessagussett and the Pilgrims were highly strained, both emotionally {{and in terms of}} resources, by their lack of discipline. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eventual failure of the Wessagussett settlement as Divine Providence against a sinful people.|$|E

5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of autoimmune disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous autoimmune hemolytic anemia. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> inheritance of autoimmune disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human autoimmune disease.|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E
5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop her dresser and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E
25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking {{on her door}} to inform her they had found Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's penmanship. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> writing on the note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't often see his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had told her they had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed this is what the Police would do. It is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E

500|$|Early in {{the morning}} the next day, some of the {{residents}} in Matamoros went to the site where most of the heavy fighting took place. They stood at awe as <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bullet-ridden cement building and the shattered windows. Since the early morning, gossip started to surround the death of Antonio Ezequiel. Sporadic gunfire was reported in the city and in Valle Hermoso, Tamaulipas, a city south of Matamoros. Grenade attacks and armed confrontations reportedly resulted in several casualties throughout Matamoros; in Valle Hermoso, only four deaths were unofficially confirmed. Law enforcement officials confirmed that an armed confrontation broke out between gunmen of Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel in Ejido Las Rusias neighborhood, and shootouts in the Lauro Villar and Roberto Guerra avenues in Matamoros. The casualties in these confrontations were difficult to calculate because both criminal organizations picked up the corpses of their fallen comrades and reportedly disposed them in clandestine graves. Roadblocks imposed by organized crime were set up in Reynosa following the death of Antonio Ezequiel, but it is unclear if they were directly related to his death. Phone services in the area continued to remain sporadic, with residents only able to use them at random hours of the day. With Antonio Ezequiel dead, Los Zetas celebrated the death of their rival's leader by hanging banners at pedestrian bridges in several cities in northeastern Mexico, where they mocked his brother Osiel and the Gulf Cartel. Pamphlets written with [...] "z" [...] instead of [...] "s" [...] were distributed across Matamoros with a message by Los Zetas to the general population and to members of the rival Gulf Cartel. [...] "The group of Loz Zetaz is informing you and giving you the opportunity to join with no hard feelingz," [...] one of the pamphlets read. [...] "Those who don't loze their head and their dezcendants." [...] Other banners with similar messages were put up in other states besides Tamaulipas. In the state of Veracruz, they were put up in the municipalities of Boca del Río, Medellín de Bravo, Poza Rica, Acayucan, Coatzacoalcos, Martínez de la Torre, Pánuco, Pueblo Viejo, Tampico Alto and Tantoyuca. In Nuevo León, most of the banners were put up in Monterrey, but the authorities also reported in the municipalities of Cadereyta, Juárez, Guadalupe and San Pedro Garza García. More banners were reported in San Luis Potosí, Oaxaca, and Quintana Roo.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, Atta's professor, Dittmar Machule, {{invited him}} to Aleppo for a three-day archaeological visit. Atta ended up {{spending}} several weeks in Aleppo during August 1994, and visited again that December. While in Syria, he met Amal, a young Palestinian woman, who worked there in the planning bureau. Volker Hauth, who was traveling with Atta, described Amal as [...] "attractive and self-confident. She observed the Muslim niceties, taking taxis {{to and from the}} office so as not to come into close physical contact with men on the buses. But, she was 'emancipated' and 'challenging'." [...] They appeared to be attracted to one another, but Atta regretfully explained to Hauth that, [...] "she had a quite different orientation and that the emancipation of the young lady did not fit." [...] This was the closest thing to romance for Atta. In mid-1995, Atta spent three months in Cairo with fellow students Volker Hauth and Ralph Bodenstein, on a grant from the Carl Duisberg Society. <b>They</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> effects of redevelopment in the Islamic Cairo old quarter which the government wanted to develop for tourism.

2500|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} in Regina, Saskatchewan in February 2009 at 3 different grocery stores located in 3 different regions that had the same median income before taxes of around $30,000. [...] Of the 211 respondents to the study, most were women who purchased most of the food for their household. When asked how they decide what food to buy, the most important factors were price, nutritional value, and need. When looking at the nutritional facts, however, they indicated that <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ingredients, and neglected {{to pay attention to the}} amount of trans fat. This means that trans fat is not on their minds unless they are specifically told of it. When asked if they ever heard about trans fat, 98% said, [...] "Yes." [...] However, only 27% said that it was unhealthy. Also, 79% said that they only knew a little about trans fats, and could have been more educated. Respondents aged 41–60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern, compared to ages 18–40. When asked if they would stop buying their favorite snacks if they knew it contained trans fat, most said they would continue purchasing it, especially the younger respondents. Also, of the respondents that called trans fat a major concern, 56% of them still wouldn't change their diet to non-trans fat snacks. This is because taste and food gratification take precedence over perceived risk to health. [...] "The consumption of trans fats and the associated increased risk of CHD is a public health concern regardless of age and socioeconomic status".|$|E
