5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grinding</b> {{equipment}} {{is powered by}} a pair of overshot wheels, which transfer power to the crown wheel via a series of belts. This then drives <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> stones and sack lift. There is a doorway on the first floor to allow material to be hoisted up the building.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamization was {{catching}} up with the conflict in Laos. During the 1970–1971 dry season, U.S. Air Force strike missions in support of Hmong operations had dropped by 70 percent {{from the previous year}} from 114 sorties per day to 38. <b>The</b> <b>grinding</b> nature of the conflict was also having a cumulative effect on the adult male population of the Hmong. Severe attrition had forced the Hmong into a numbers game that they could not win.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> of the wheels; more {{complicated}} repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center. Two monitor the ATC system, one monitors passenger information, while the last is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, {{there is always a}} team of technicians who can be sent to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E

Although boards must install <b>the</b> <b>Grind</b> upgrade themselves, Skates can already <b>Grind</b> from <b>the</b> start. Besides this, they are {{predominant}} in speed, and usually have no other functions.|$|R

5|$|Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are the bickering {{partners}} {{of a small}} law firm in the South Side of Chicago; in fact, {{for much of the}} time they are just a pair of ambulance chasers. Oscar's character holds the firm together despite the childish and unethical behavior of Wally, his junior partner. Their bickering is often mediated by Rochelle, the highly competent African American secretary, who had learned a lot of law in her eight years in the office. Meanwhile, David Zinc, a graduate of the Harvard Law School, is completely fed up with <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> and dehumanizing – though well-paid – life of an associate in the law firm of Rogan Rothberg, where in five years of work he had never seen the inside of a courtroom, in fact, David's expertise was in long-term bonds a job he hated. David suddenly breaks away, goes on a drinking binge and by chance finds himself at the Finley & Figg office. Feeling an elevating sense of freedom and vowing never to go back, Zinc willingly relegates himself to working for the two disreputable street lawyers and ambulance chasers.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} spark {{characteristics are}} color, volume, {{nature of the}} spark, and length. Note that the length {{is dependent on the}} amount of pressure applied to <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel, so this can be a poor comparison tool if the pressure is not exactly the same for the samples. Also, <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel must be dressed frequently to remove metallic build-up.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>grind</b> in Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) {{has been}} {{described}} by game studies theorists as an inscrutable, paradoxical convergence of work and play (Dibbell, 2006; Yee, 2006), troubling previously held notions about the carefree nature of play as advanced by seminal theorists such as Johan Huizinga (1951). However, despite the recent academic fervor around MMOGs, examinations of <b>the</b> <b>grind</b> offer little insight into why players grind, and even less about what <b>the</b> <b>grind</b> means to its practitioners. Studying the collected forum and interview texts of a six-year old MMOG community, this dissertation adopts a Wittgensteinian approach to discourse analysis in an effort to learn more about <b>the</b> <b>grind</b> {{and what it means to}} the players who practice it. This ‘mapping out’ of <b>the</b> <b>grind’s</b> meaning in <b>the</b> Guild Wars community is intended to both start and/or contribute to a dialog in game studies that examines how play can be situated theoretically with respect to phenomena so often construed as undesirable by its players while also providing a functional instrument for others to adopt in their further analysis of this phenomenon...|$|R
25|$|A {{bench grinder}} is usually {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500–11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to <b>the</b> <b>grinding</b> wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> type of <b>grind</b> {{is often}} {{named after the}} brewing method {{for which it is}} {{generally}} used. Turkish <b>grind</b> is <b>the</b> finest <b>grind,</b> while coffee percolator or French press are <b>the</b> coarsest <b>grinds.</b> <b>The</b> most common <b>grinds</b> are between these two extremes: a medium grind is used in most home coffee-brewing machines.|$|R
5000|$|Chamillionaire has {{released}} two freestyles of this song on Mixtape Messiah 4. One was entitled [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>Grind</b> Homie" [...] {{and the other}} was called [...] "Top Down, Money Up". An interesting fact is that the original freestyle (released on the Internet before the mixtape's release) had the chopped and screwed hook of [...] "Top Down, Money Up" [...] and the verse of [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>Grind</b> Homie". For an unknown reason, another freestyle and hook were recorded, and [...] "Top Down, Money Up" [...] received the new verse, as opposed to [...] "On <b>the</b> <b>Grind</b> Homie" [...] getting the new hook.|$|R

5000|$|Slave to <b>the</b> <b>Grind</b> was a {{departure}} for the band; where Skid Row was an album {{that followed the}} typical 80's band formula, Slave to <b>the</b> <b>Grind</b> had a heavier sound, even verging on speed metal with the title track. Skid Row took out Pantera as an opening act on much of the tour supporting Slave to <b>the</b> <b>Grind.</b> Skid Row originally asked upcoming grunge band Nirvana to open for them but they declined, saying that Skid Row was [...] "too homophobic", relating to the Sebastian Bach T-shirt incident. Coincidentally, Nirvana's original band name was also Skid Row.|$|R

50|$|Whether a grind is back-side (BS) or front-side (FS) {{depends on}} how rider {{approaches}} the rail or edge. If the skater approaches the rail {{with his back to}} it, <b>the</b> <b>grind</b> is a back-side <b>grind.</b> If <b>the</b> skater approaches the rail with the front of his body to <b>the</b> rail, <b>the</b> <b>grind</b> is a front-side grind.|$|R
