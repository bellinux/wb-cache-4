5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining {{the border of the}} suburban and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E

Bernard Bergonzi argued that [...] "it {{was a new}} departure in Eliot's poetry, and it inevitably resulted {{in the presence of}} the manipulatory will that [...] has observed at works in the Quartets, and in the necessity for low-pressure linking passages. As I have previously remarked, Eliot was capable of expressing the most intense moments of experience, but had little capacity for sustained structure." ...|$|E

Don Doyle argues that Davis displayed [...] "tone deafness" [...] in appointing Yancey, who was [...] "ignorant of the world" [...] and himself realized that he was [...] "wholly unsuited by experience and personality for diplomacy." [...] However, Davis feared that Yancey would be a political opponent, and wanted him out of the country.|$|E

500|$|Loevs {{script was}} penned by Sudhanshu Saria [...] in the United States, {{when he was}} working on the {{screenplay}} of another film, I Am Here. Describing the film as [...] "small, fragile, honest", Saria said that through his endeavour he [...] "tries to capture the silences and the things unsaid in male friendships". He wrote Loev because he was unable <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> financing for I Am Here. At the time of the script's inception, Saria had no plan of making it into a feature film, as he believed that no investors or actors would want to be associated with a film that he thought would be censored or banned in its home country. The plot of the film follows many personal experiences that Saria himself went through, growing up in the Indian hill town of Darjeeling, and later at the Ithaca Arts College, New York.|$|E
500|$|Perot campaigned in California in mid-June, {{and held}} a rally {{attended}} by 7,000 in Sacramento where he was heckled by some who chanted [...] "Talk about the issues!" [...] He privately spoke with black and Asian leaders in Los Angeles to discuss race relations following the L.A. race riots; afterwards, he gave a speech to a mostly white audience in Orange County about race relations, but did not {{take a stand on}} affirmative action. Perot finished his California campaign swing in Irvine before traveling to events in Colorado and Massachusetts. At the end of the month, large nominating conventions were held in Washington and other states <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> final pieces to include Perot on the ballot. Perot addressed the conventions, largely made up of [...] "well dressed, middle aged" [...] individuals, and spoke of improving the education system and restoring the America [...] "where you leave the doors unlocked". As June came to a close, speculation arose that Perot was planning a National Convention to follow the Democratic and Republican National Conventions.|$|E

With Pro Football Hall of Famer Leroy Kelly having retired after the 1973 season, Pruitt, {{the first of the}} team's two second-round draft picks that year, had taken a quantum leap in '75 into settling into his job as the go-to running back.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "When I Look at You" [...] was {{directed}} by Adam Shankman, producer of The Last Song. The video was filmed on August 16, 2009 in several outdoor settings in Savannah, Georgia. [...] "The premise of the video for 'When I Look at You' is <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>together</b> <b>the</b> relationships between Miley, the piano, and music, her relationship with Liam, her relationship to the song", Shankman commented, {{in regards to the}} video's concept. He believed Cyrus and Hemsworth had [...] "great chemistry" [...] while filming The Last Song and brought it into the set of the video. The video opens by showing a black grand piano alone on a pier, which transitions to a close-up of Cyrus with her wavy hair styled loose. She is shown playing the piano in a long white dress. Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, who portrays Will Blakelee in The Last Song, appears next to the piano, Cyrus not being present. Throughout the rest of the video, Cyrus sings and plays the piano in a forest, the beach, and a mansion's front yard. Cut-scenes feature Cyrus and Hemsworth interacting romantically, at one point kissing in a wheat field. The video ends by, again, showing the piano alone in the pier. Two alternate versions of the music video were later released: one replaces the cut-scenes of Cyrus and Hemsworth with clips from The Last Song, and another for the song's remix featuring Bisbal. The latter version replaces cut-scenes with shots of Bisbal signing in a forest and beach; his scenes were directed by Marc Roussel.|$|E
