5|$|The task {{of taking}} Villa Rogatti, the westernmost {{crossing}} point, {{was given to}} Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI). Having conducted reconnaissance on their objective during the night of 5 December 1943, an attack plan was devised by the battalion's commander—Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron Bethel Ware—detailing <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> of all four rifle companies. Once <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> had been secured by the early morning of 6 December, Anglo-Canadian reinforcements were to be moved into Villa Rogatti, {{with the intention of}} repulsing the expected potentially strong German counterattacks. Elements of three German regiments—the 200th and 361st Panzergrenadier, and 26th Panzer—maintained strong defences within the town.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{exchange}} {{project of the}} late 1980s, activity to export the Finnhorse has been minimal. However, a 2008 study stated that increased international interest and demand for the Finnhorse was advisable to ensure {{the survival of the}} breed. To this end, <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> of the national breeding program, as of 2008, include increasing international recognition of the Finnhorse and generating demand for the breed for recreational and educational uses such as in Pony Club; to make it the standard breed used in Finland for equestrian tourism; and to improve the opportunities for Finnhorse trotters to participate in Swedish and Norwegian heats.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a study {{to determine if the}} development objectives were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to compound helicopters, as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet <b>the</b> <b>objectives.</b> In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari had {{suggested}} to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be the}} Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had confirmed that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis.

In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the {{optimization}} problem which only measurements of <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function are available, {{it is difficult}} or impossible to directly obtain the gradient of <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function. Although <b>the</b> second order simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (2 SPSA) algorithm solves this problem successfully by efficient gradient approximation that relies on measurements of <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function, <b>the</b> accuracy of the algorithm depends on the matrix conditioning of <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> function Hessian.

5|$|Mad Maxs quest design also {{received}} mixed reviews. Tyrrel praised {{the content and}} activities scattered across the world, calling the activities engaging for most players.

Brown criticized the structure of several quests which force players to use a certain method, removing freedom and creativity.

Self-managed work teams are granted the responsibility of planning, scheduling, organizing, directing, controlling and evaluating their own work process.
