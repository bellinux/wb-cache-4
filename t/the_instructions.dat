50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> cycle, <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> {{is loaded}} into <b>the</b> <b>Instruction</b> {{register}} after <b>the</b> processor fetches {{it from the}} memory location pointed by the program counter.|$|R
50|$|The {{program counter}} (PC), {{commonly}} called <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> pointer (IP) in Intel x86 and Itanium microprocessors, and sometimes called <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> address register (IAR), <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> counter, or {{just part of}} <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> sequencer,is a processor register that indicates where a computer is in its program sequence.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{decoding}} stage, {{the control}} unit will determine if <b>the</b> decoded <b>instruction</b> reads from a register that <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> currently in <b>the</b> execution stage writes to. If this condition holds, the control unit will stall <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> by one clock cycle. It also stalls <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> in <b>the</b> fetch stage, to prevent <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> in that stage from being overwritten by <b>the</b> next <b>instruction</b> in <b>the</b> program.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>instructions</b> in Compendium ferculorum are succinct {{and often}} vague, lacking such {{elements}} of modern culinary recipes as lists of ingredients used, measurements or proportions, and cooking times. The underlying {{assumption is that}} they are to be used by a professional chef rather than a person with little cooking experience. The recipe for stewed meat in saffron sauce, cited below, is typical is this regard.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was christened privately by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Manners-Sutton, on 24June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace. She was baptised Alexandrina, {{after one}} of her godparents, Emperor Alexander I of Russia, and Victoria, after her mother. Additional names {{proposed}} by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte, and Augusta—were dropped on <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> of the Duke's eldest brother, George, the Prince Regent.|$|E
5|$|Writing in TouchArcade, Jared Nelson {{wrote that}} the game is unexceptional for players who are not fans of the toy line. While in the United Kingdom the game was subject of {{controversy}} concerning its incorporation of in-app purchases, the Advertising Standards Authority deemed it acceptable. The organization found that <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> detailing purchases did not coerce players to make such purchases.|$|E
50|$|Definition: The {{contents}} of source register {{is used by}} <b>the</b> <b>instruction.</b> <b>The</b> source registers address can be specified either (i) directly by <b>the</b> <b>instruction,</b> or (ii) indirectly by the pointer register specified by <b>the</b> <b>instruction.</b>|$|R

30|$|While {{transferring}} {{data from}} any port {{to the internal}} memory banks, no execution of any other instruction is carried out. This control mechanism is achieved when the controller holds <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> inside <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> register by re-entering <b>the</b> same <b>instruction</b> to <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> register till <b>the</b> end of the transfer process. The same mechanism works for vector <b>instructions,</b> where <b>the</b> controller re-enter <b>the</b> vector <b>instruction</b> to <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> register till <b>the</b> end of the execution phase.|$|R
5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> {{from the}} Ministry of Justice (Dirección General de Registros y Notariado), Spanish Consulates abroad may {{carry out the}} {{preliminary}} paperwork for a same-sex marriage. At {{least one of the}} marrying partners must be a Spanish citizen, residing in the Consular demarcation. However, the marriage itself can only take place at the Consulate if local laws recognize same-sex marriages. In all other cases, the partners must marry in Spanish territory. Two non-resident foreigners cannot marry in Spain, as {{at least one of the}} partners must be a Spanish resident, although they both may be non-Spanish citizens.|$|E
5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. <b>The</b> <b>instructions</b> were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it were driving a conventional load).|$|E
5000|$|Definition: The {{destination}} register {{is where}} <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> deposits its result.

50|$|Step 4 of <b>the</b> <b>Instruction</b> Cycle is <b>the</b> Execute Cycle. Here, the {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> is performed. If <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> involves arithmetic or logic, the Arithmetic Logic Unit is utilized.

50|$|The R10000 fetches four {{instructions}} every cycle {{from its}} instruction cache. These instructions are decoded and then placed into the integer, floating-point or load/store instruction queues {{depending on the}} type of <b>the</b> <b>instruction.</b> <b>The</b> decode unit is assisted by <b>the</b> pre-decoded <b>instructions</b> from <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> cache, which append five bits to every <b>instruction</b> to enable <b>the</b> unit to quickly identify which execution unit <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> is executed in, and rearrange the format of <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> to optimize <b>the</b> decode process.|$|R
5|$|As was {{traditional}} in {{the royal}} family, Anne and her sister were brought up separated from their father in their own establishment at Richmond, London. On <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> of Charles II, they were raised as Protestants. Placed {{in the care of}} Colonel Edward and Lady Frances Villiers, their education was focused on the teachings of the Anglican church. Henry Compton, Bishop of London, was appointed as Anne's preceptor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies in waiting busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> {{on how to deal}} with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
5|$|In 1534, Cromwell {{initiated}} a Visitation of the Monasteries ostensibly {{to examine their}} character, but in fact, to value their assets {{with a view to}} expropriation. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, in contrast to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Suppression of monasteries to raise funds was not unknown previously. Cromwell had done the same thing on <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> of Cardinal Wolsey to raise funds for two proposed colleges at Ipswich and Oxford years before.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>instruction</b> that <b>the</b> CPU fetches {{from memory}} determines what the CPU will do.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Instruction</b> Cache {{on these}} {{machines}} had a latency of one cycle, meaning that if <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> was in <b>the</b> cache, {{it would be}} ready on the next clock cycle. During <b>the</b> <b>Instruction</b> Fetch stage, a 32-bit instruction was fetched from the cache.|$|R
5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home, and in lieu of death duties, the Duchess's collection of Louis XVI style furniture, some porcelain, and paintings were made over to the French state. The British royal family received no major bequests. Most of her estate went to the Pasteur Institute medical research foundation, on <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the royal family and the Duchess's friends by surprise, as she had shown little interest in charity during her life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as {{indifferent}} or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not play any role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E

For example, many implementations of <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> pipeline only allow a single memory load or memory store per instruction, leading to a load-store architecture (RISC).

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible. <b>The</b> <b>instructions</b> did not result in attacks in Zagreb itself, but JNA barracks in Samobor were captured by Croatian forces {{on the day of the}} bombing. The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke and U.S. Ambassador to Croatia Peter W. Galbraith {{met with}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in Zagreb. Holbrooke was {{directed}} by the United States to urge Tuđman to stop offensive operations by the HV in western Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, Holbrooke and Galbraith thought <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> unwise and saw the opportunity to defeat the VRS and establish a new military balance in the country. Holbrooke also considered that the changing {{situation on the ground}} allowed him and Galbraith to ignore <b>the</b> <b>instructions.</b> Holbrooke urged Tuđman to capture Sanski Most, Novi Grad and Prijedor from the VRS, and to do so quickly, but asked him to stop short of capturing Banja Luka. Holbrooke and Galbraith considered it would be advantageous for them and that justice would be served if the VRS lost Banja Luka, but decided against encouraging it, fearing there would be another 200,000 refugees from the city or that Croatia would not be willing to relinquish control of Banja Luka later on. They were also hoping that more moderate Bosnian Serb leadership might be found in the city, as it was the most urban Bosnian Serb area.|$|E
5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Rome. The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading the defense of Rome against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> to display it from an elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story up to this point.|$|E
50|$|The prefix word {{comes in}} two formats, {{and the choice}} between them depends on <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> which follows.If <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> has any non-register operands, then the simple form is used, which {{provides}} 2 4-bit fields to extend any offset or immediate constant in <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> stream to 20 bits.|$|R
