In anticipation of this event, in August 1939 he arranged for the London Museum to place many of its most important collections into safe keeping. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Bristol University, and at the award ceremony met the Conservative Party politician Winston Churchill, who was then engaged in writing his multi-volume A History of the English-Speaking Peoples; Churchill asked Wheeler to aid him in writing about late prehistoric and early medieval Britain, to which the latter agreed.|$|E

The two <b>talked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone for about 40 minutes, where West explained some of the concepts for the project, and invited him down to his studio in Hawaii. West is a big admirer of Bon Iver's album For Emma, Forever Ago, and was impressed with Vernon's unique use of auto-tune. The two artists became friends while playing games of basketball together, and West introduced him to Jeff Bhasker, one of his main producers.|$|E

Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them and she felt better with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears off you want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is badâ€”much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E

2500|$|On June 8, 1981, Cotten had a {{heart attack}} {{followed}} by a stroke that affected his speech center. He began years of therapy which in time made it possible for him to speak again. As he began to recover, he and Orson Welles <b>talked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone each week for a couple of hours: [...] "He was strong and supportive," [...] Cotten wrote, [...] "and whenever I used the wrong word (which was frequently) he would say, 'That's a much better word, Jo, I'm going to use it.'" [...] He and Welles would meet for lunch and reminisce, and when Cotten said he had written a book Welles asked for the manuscript and read it that same night. In a phone conversation on October 9, 1985, Welles told his friend and mentor Roger Hill that Cotten had written a book, and Hill asked how it read. [...] "Gentle, witty, and self-effacing, just like Jo," [...] Welles replied. [...] "My only complaint is that it's too brief." [...] Welles died the following day. [...] "Somewhere among his possessions is a manuscript of this book," [...] Cotten wrote on the last page of his autobiography, published in 1987 under the title Vanity Will Get You Somewhere.|$|E
