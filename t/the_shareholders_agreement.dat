50|$|INA {{headquarters}} in ZagrebINA was established on January 1, 1964 through {{the merger of}} Naftaplin (company {{for oil and gas}} exploration and production) with the refineries in Rijeka and Sisak. Initially, the company was called “Oil and Gas Conglomerate” but on 26 November its name was changed to the one it has today. In 1990, INA became a state-owned company and in 1993 a joint stock company. The first stage of privatization, when MOL Company became INA’s strategic partner by purchasing 25% plus one share, was completed in 2003. Seven percent of shares were transferred to the Croatian Defenders’ Fund in 2005. After selling 7% shares to former and current INA employees, ownership structure of the company has changed and now less than 50% of total shares lie in state ownership. In this sense, the Croatian Government and MOL have signed the First Amendments to <b>the</b> <b>Shareholders</b> <b>Agreement.</b> In October 2008, MOL‘s voluntary public takeover offer to INA - INDUSTRIJA NAFTE d.d. shareholders was finalized.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{unanimous}} <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> is {{a feature}} of most Canadian corporate statutes that allows <b>the</b> <b>shareholders</b> to, by creating an agreement meeting the necessary criteria, restrict {{the powers of the}} directors to manage the business and affairs of the corporation. One possible justification for this is the "nexus of contracts" theory that all corporations are notionally reducible to voluntary agreements. Three key areas of ambiguity surrounding unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> are examined in this dissertation, with specific reference to existing judgments. The requirements for their formation are reviewed, including the exact meaning and strictness of the unanimity criterion and the necessity and validity of possible restrictions upon the directors. Four competing approaches to their enforcement are identified and contrasted: the corporate constitutional approach that truly removes the board's powers, the contractual approach that treats unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> as contracts existing alongside the corporate power structure, and the directors' duties and oppression approaches that apply existing corporate law remedies to deal with violations. The transfer of duties and liabilities that accompanies unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements</b> is considered in the context of unusual power structures and stakeholder theory, revealing unaddressed and possibly unsolvable problems in the legislation. It is concluded that, although <b>the</b> unanimous <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement</b> may suggest a move toward a more contractual view of the corporation, it can also be understood as a specific tool within the statutory framework...|$|R

40|$|O acordo de acionistas é hoje um dos principais instrumentos de composição dos interesses individuais dos acionistas. Tais acordos têm natureza jurídica contratual e parassocial, em razão de estarem intrinsecamente ligados aos pactos sociais, já que, ao celebrar a referida avença, as partes buscam disciplinar interesses e situações não compreendidas pelos estatutos sociais, regulando os direitos dos sócios fundados em sua participação na sociedade. Uma vez assumida a sua licitude no ordenamento jurídico brasileiro quando da previsão expressa do instrumento no art. 118 da Lei 6. 404 / 76, surgem hoje novas controvérsias com relação ao tema, diante da complexidade que tais pactos podem apresentar em razão da multiplicidade de objetos que podem prever. Dentre as questões hoje discutidas, será abordada especificamente a disciplina da extinção não satisfativa do acordo de acionistas, regulada pela teoria geral dos contratos, {{conforme}} reza o Código Civil Brasileiro. Para tanto, contudo, será necessário primeiramente revisitar o instituto, estabelecendo as bases essenciais de sua aplicação prática, objeto, natureza jurídica, forma e partes legitimadas para serem suas signatárias.

Once such instruments were assumed to be valid in Brazilian law by the express provision in article 118 of Law 6. 404 / 76, new controversies arise today on the issue, given the complexity that such agreements may have on account of the multiplicity of objects that can it can provide.

Essa associação foi fundamentada pelos efeitos entrincheiramento e enforcement. Considerando que o grau de conservadorismo de uma firma está atrelado aos incentivos advindos de mecanismos que reduzem o risco informacional aos stakeholders, este estudo foi desenvolvido sobre a seguinte questão de pesquisa: Qual a influência da concentração de votos e do acordo de acionistas sobre o grau de conservadorismo nas empresas listadas na Bovespa? Cabe ressaltar que o objetivo {{principal}} deste trabalho é tratar de fatores ainda não abordados na literatura (nacional e internacional) produzida por essa linha de pesquisa, fornecendo evidências acerca da influência da estrutura de propriedade sobre o conservadorismo no mercado brasileiro, que possui conflito de agência entre acionistas majoritários (controlador) e minoritários. A amostra do trabalho perfaz 617 observações composta por empresas não financeiras negociadas na Bovespa durante o período de 2000 a 2008. Alternativamente, foi selecionada outra amostra desconsiderando as observações do ano de 2008, de forma a expurgar os efeitos da crise financeira registrada nesse ano. As evidências indicam que a concentração de votos contribui para diminuir o grau de conservadorismo, enquanto, por outro lado, o acordo de acionistas contribui para aumentar. Alternativamente, os resultados considerando o ano da crise global distorcem o funcionamento do modelo de Basu (1997). Espera-se que este estudo contribua para investidores, reguladores, pesquisadores e analistas no entendimento da função da informação contábil no processo de governança das firmas. This study investigates how two {{features of}} the ownership structure of Brazilian companies, the voting rights concentration and <b>the</b> <b>shareholders</b> <b>agreement,</b> {{are associated with the}} conditional conservatism proposed by Basu (1997). This association was founded on the effects of entrenchment and enforcement. Considering that the degree of conservatism of a firm is tied to the incentives arising from mechanisms that reduce the informational risk to stakeholders, this study was developed on the following research question: What is the influence of both the voting rights concentration and shareholders agreement on the degree of conservatism in the companies listed on Bovespa? The main goal of this work is to deal with factors not yet considered in the (national and international) literature produced in this line of research, and provides evidence about the influence of ownership structure on conservatism in the Brazilian market, which is marked by a, agency conflict between controlling shareholders (controller) and minority shareholders. The sample of the paper comprises 617 observations of non-financial companies traded on Bovespa during the period from 2000 to 2008. Alternatively, another sample was selected, disregarding the observations for 2008, as a means to remove the effects of the financial crisis registered that year. The evidences indicate that the voting rights concentration contributes to decrease the degree of conservatism, while, on the other hand, the stockholders agreement contributes to an increase. Alternatively, the results considered in the global crisis year distort the Basu model (1997). The researchers hope this study contributes for investors, regulators, researchers and analysts to understand the function of accounting information in companies' governance process...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} CEO compensation in family firms, {{with a particular}} focus on the effects exerted by governance characteristics such as ownership concentration, wedge between voting and cash-flow rights rights, and <b>the</b> presence of <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreements.</b> On a sample of Italian listed companies over the period 1998 - 2002, we provide empirical evidence that family firms pay CEOs systematically more then other firms, and that the ownership structure exerts {{a significant effect on}} CEO compensation. In family firms, CEO pay is indeed positively affected by low ownership concentration, as well as a low wedge between voting and cash flow rights. Moreover, <b>the</b> presence of <b>shareholders</b> <b>agreements</b> has a moderating role on the level of CEO compensation. These effects are more pronounced in family than in non-family firms. The analysis of the relationship between excess compensation and future firm performance reveals that the higher compensation granted to the CEO by family firms is related to worse stock and accounting returns and could therefore be interpreted as a form of rent extraction. This result holds only for lower degrees of ownership concentration, higher wedge {{and in the absence of}} shareholders’ agreements, and supports the hypothesis that the prevalent agency conflict within Italian-listed family firms is between family owners and minority shareholders, instead of between <b>shareholders</b> and managers. <b>The</b> higher compensation granted to the CEO could be interpreted as the premium for the loyalty of the CEO to the family and for allowing the family to extract private benefits of control...|$|R

40|$|While {{this author}} {{agrees with the}} Wrigg Court’s {{ultimate}} decision, the Court’s overall discussion was lacking on three points. First, before determining whether an agreement has the requirements of an enforceable noncompete clause, the Court should have addressed the contract issues involved in Wrigg. In particular, the Court should have addressed the question of consideration and the potential ambiguity surrounding the terms of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> <b>agreement.</b> If <b>the</b> agreement is an unenforceable contract, enforceability of the non-compete clause becomes irrelevant. Next, even if a contract is enforceable, a non-compete clause within it is not automatically enforceable. As a general rule, post-employment, non-competes are allowed if they fall within certain parameters, {{one of which is}} the reasonableness of the clause. Although an inexact science, such a determination usually depends upon the use of a balancing test. As part of that balance, courts should consider the evolving psychological contract. The modern employer-employee relationship is based on an unspoken promise by the employer to ensure the employee is competitive in the job market, and courts should examine whether it makes sense to enforce a non-compete agreement under such circumstances. This is especially true in Montana, where an employer can impede the employee’s strong statutory protections against wrongful discharge by asking her to sign a term employment agreement— effectively turning her into a quasi at-will employee. Finally, the Court’s unclear position regarding how “for-cause termination” may affect the enforceability of non-compete agreements provides little guidance to district courts on how they should decide future cases. As such, it is likely that some trial courts will see Wrigg as a per se prohibition against noncompete agreements when the employee is involuntarily terminated; while other courts may interpret Wrigg {{in such a way that}} allows them to look to the circumstances of termination prior to determining the enforceability of the non-compete agreements. In failing to adequately address this critical issue, the Wrigg Court has invited inconsistent application among Montana’s district courts and an inevitable revisiting of the issue for a more definitive clarification...|$|R
