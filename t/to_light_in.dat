5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, the abdomens {{of three}} {{pregnant}} women were cut {{open and the}} foetus removed and thrown into a fire. In an incident that came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> 2007, Suresh Dedawala (Richard) alias Langado was caught on camera in a Tehelka sting operation talking to Bajarangi about slitting the belly of pregnant Muslim Kausar Banu, removing her foetus and killing it with a sword.|$|E
5|$|After {{it first}} came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> October, {{it was found}} that it had been posted to YouTube several months earlier, along with a {{similarly}} threatening message in binary code. The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is not telling the truth about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} what {{happened}} at Salon Kitty first came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> Walter Schellenberg's memoirs, published in Germany in 1956 under the title The Labyrinth. Peter Norden later expanded the story in his 1970 book Salon Kitty. This book became the basis for the highly controversial 1976 film Salon Kitty, directed by Tinto Brass and starring Helmut Berger as Walter Schellenberg (renamed Helmut Wallenberg) and Ingrid Thulin as Kitty Schmidt (renamed Kitty Kellermann).|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} in Germany, Sutcliffe began experiencing severe headaches and acute sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> April 1962, he {{collapsed in the}} middle of an art class after complaining of head pains. German doctors performed various checks, but were unable to determine the exact cause of his headaches. On 10 April 1962, he was taken to the hospital, but died in the ambulance on the way. The cause of death was later revealed to have been an aneurysm in his brain's right hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E

5|$|Forgotten {{for nearly}} 13 years, the Changi Murals were accidentally rediscovered in 1958 by {{servicemen}} of the Royal Air Force (RAF) occupying the Roberts Barracks. The Chapel was again {{used as a}} store, and later as accommodation by the RAF. Once rediscovered, the distemper coating covering the murals was carefully removed – four complete murals and the top-quarter of a fifth were revealed. As there was no signature {{on any of the}} murals, a search for the artist was undertaken but failed after initial investigations. By a stroke of luck, the artist's name came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the RAF Changi Education Library of all places. A reader came across a book titled The Churches of the Captivity in Malaya, mentioning about the Chapel of St Luke in Roberts Barracks and the artist's name – Bombardier Stanley Warren. The Daily Mirror was notified and again went to work looking for the known artist. In February 1959, he was found living in London with his wife and son. He was shocked when he saw the photo of his mural of the Crucifixion, when a keen-eyed colleague of his showed him the papers.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, {{he was one}} {{of those}} {{politicians}} who forced Prime Minister and Minister of Colonial Affairs Jan Jacob Rochussen, his former Governor-General, to resign his post, in part because a corruption scandal in the East Indies came <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> that same year he promoted his friend Multatuli's Max Havelaar, announcing in parliament that the book had sent tremors through the country. On 1 July 1862, he was appointed to the Council of State of the Netherlands, where he served until his death in The Hague on 10 February 1879. His wife died on 9 January 1888.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, GameTrailers {{dedicated}} {{an episode}} of its Pop Fiction series to examining Jackson's involvement with the game. Roger Hector, who previously stated that Jackson's involvement in the game was dropped due to the sexual abuse allegations, stated that any similarities to Jackson's music in Sonic 3 was not intentional on Sega's part. However, an anonymous source involved in the game's development reaffirmed Buxer's statements and said Jackson was involved before the scandals came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> August 1993, and that his contributions remained in the game with Jackson choosing to remain uncredited. The source specified that the musical theme for Carnival Night Zone {{was one of the}} pieces Jackson contributed to.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> the national media after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E

50|$|These moths {{are mainly}} found along the {{mangrove}} swamps of Venezuela and Guyana. The adult moths however swarm <b>to</b> <b>lights</b> <b>in</b> nearby towns and the urticating hairs are {{released into the}} air leading to severe urticarial and papilovesicular dermatitis. Hairs from male moths do not cause any symptoms.|$|R
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or not, she was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E
5|$|When light {{falls from}} above on a uniformly {{coloured}} three-dimensional object {{such as a}} sphere, it makes the upper side appear lighter and the underside darker, grading {{from one to the}} other. This pattern of light and shade makes the object appear solid, and therefore easier to detect. The classical form of countershading, discovered in 1909 by the artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, works by counterbalancing the effects of self-shadowing, again typically with grading from dark <b>to</b> <b>light.</b> <b>In</b> theory this could be useful for military camouflage, but in practice it has rarely been applied, despite the best efforts of Thayer, and later, in the Second World War, of the zoologist Hugh Cott.|$|E
5|$|In 1834 Alkan {{began his}} {{friendship}} with the Spanish musician Santiago Masarnau, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came <b>to</b> <b>light</b> <b>in</b> 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second Concerto da camera was performed in Bath by its dedicatee Henry Ibbot Field; {{it was published in}} London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with Moscheles and Cramer, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at Piscop outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo piano, the Twelve Caprices, published in 1837 as Opp. 12, 13, 15 and 16. Op.16, the Trois scherzi de bravoure, is dedicated to Masarnau. In January 1836, Liszt recommended Alkan for the post of Professor at the Geneva Conservatoire, which Alkan declined, and in 1837 he wrote an enthusiastic review of Alkan's Op.15 Caprices in the Revue et gazette musicale.|$|E
