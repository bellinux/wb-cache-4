5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off the}} advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E

25|$|In February 2005, the Israeli police began {{a formal}} {{criminal}} investigation of Metzger regarding allegations {{of fraud and}} bribery related to benefits he received from a Jerusalem hotel. Metzger was questioned twice, and denied any wrongdoing, but suspended himself from the Rabbinical High Court in June 2005, while waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the Israeli Attorney General, Menachem Mazuz, decided to indict him. No charges were brought, and Metzger and his supporters dismissed all of the accusations against him {{as part of an}} ongoing smear campaign against him.|$|E
25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by {{statistics}} and reports, {{such as the}} poverty line, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept {{of social and cultural}} exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E

500|$|He {{acknowledged}} {{that he had been}} driving MacMillan around the evening of July5, 1933, when he was followed by Caldwell and MacLean, but gave a dramatically different account of his reasons for doing so. [...] According to him, there had been talk of MacMillan joining his family at their rental cottage at Sylvan Lake that weekend provided that she could get the necessary time off work, and that evening he called her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not she had been able to. [...] During the ensuing phone conversation, MacMillan told him that she had other problems bothering her, and asked if Brownlee would take her for a drive to discuss them. [...] He agreed to do so, and it was during this drive that he noticed that he was being followed.|$|E
500|$|This {{storm of}} {{publicity}} caused {{a flurry of}} activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: [...] "there is no getting hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour {{to ask if he}} had finished." [...] Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Théophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: [...] "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin... And this is where I have to toss a 100-sou coin in the air <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not there's a God." ...|$|E
500|$|The Posen speeches made by Heinrich Himmler in October 1943 are {{the first}} known {{documents}} in which a high-ranking member of the Nazi government spoke explicitly about the perpetration of the Holocaust during the war. Himmler mentions the [...] "Judenevakuierung" [...] or [...] "evacuation of the Jews", which he uses synonymously with their extermination. At {{one point in the}} speech, Himmler says: [...] "elimination of the Jews, extermination, we're doing it", briefly pausing in the middle of [...] "elimination" [...] (Ausschaltung) before going on to say [...] "extermination" [...] (Ausrottung). His hesitation in the middle of saying [...] "elimination" [...] can be considered as a quick mental check <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not it is acceptable to use such words in front of his given audience. The answer is yes: it is the seniority of the SS in private. This has been compared to another incident of self-verification in the opposite way, where Josef Goebbels, in his Total War speech on February 18, 1943, begins to say [...] "Ausrottung des Judentums" [...] ("extermination of Jewry") but switches to saying [...] "Ausschaltung", bearing in mind that he is speaking very publicly. His resulting phrasing is [...] "Ausrott... schaltung des Judentums", which can be likened to [...] "exterm... elimination" [...] in English.|$|E

2500|$|A {{ceremony}} {{carried out}} in the town since 1678 involves the weighing of the mayor. At {{the beginning and end of}} each year of service, the mayor is weighed in full view of the public <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not he has gained weight, presumably at the taxpayers' expense. The custom, which has survived to the present day, employs the same weighing apparatus used since the 19th century. When the result is known, the town crier announces [...] "And no more!"

2500|$|Beckjord became {{intrigued}} {{with the idea}} of Bigfoot after seeing an article in the newspaper about alleged sightings of the creature. On an expedition <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the story was true, he claimed he saw a Bigfoot cross the road in front of him from about 200 feet away. Though he later returned with his camera and was unable to find the creature, Beckjord was then convinced of its existence. He also purportedly saw Bigfoot standing 6 feet tall and walking in a [...] "loose, limbo-dance style", and, at another time, eating apricots in an orchard around Vacaville, CA. He frequented a camp with other researchers, an alleged [...] "window site" [...] in the Bear River Reservoir area of Eldorado National Forest where he asserted that [...] "evidence of Bigfoot is almost routinely seen." [...] While he insisted that the exact location not be revealed to the public, Beckjord did agree to take skeptic Robert Sheaffer on a five-day expedition there in 1999. It was only after Sheaffer left the site, having seen nothing unusual, that Beckjord reported manifestations of Bigfoot.|$|E

In 2003, former U.S. ambassador to Iraq Joseph C. Wilson evoked the perp walk, and provided another term for it, when accusing a senior Bush Administration official of leaking {{the name of his}} wife, Valerie a spy, to the media as retaliation for a New York Times op-ed in which he had cast doubt on key aspects of the administration's claims in support of the Iraq War: [...] "It's of keen interest to me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not we can get Karl Rove [...] out of the White House in handcuffs." [...] Liberal critics of the administration created images of that occurring; in 2008 a Code Pink protester in San Francisco attempted to make a citizen's arrest of Rove, who had by then left the government.
