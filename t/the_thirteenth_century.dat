5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, {{pointed out that}} most of them, from <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia as early as <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E

Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Before <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E

5|$|A more {{elaborate}} style known as decorated Gothic, applying ornamentation to vaults and pillars, particularly using curved motifs, {{began to be}} adopted in <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> and was characteristic of Scottish church building in the fourteenth century. It was used at Dunblane Cathedral, built in <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> particularly to decorate the nave and East end. At Fortrose in the Highlands the elaborate decoration of this style is still visible in the south aisle. One of the finest examples is Sweetheart Abbey near Dumfries, a Cistercian monastery, named after the burial of John de Balliol's heart alongside the body of his wife. The period of the Wars of Independence (1296–1357) saw {{a large number of}} ecclesiastical buildings ruined, including Melrose and Jedburgh Abbeys. Church building was largely confined to the parish churches in the relatively secure areas like Fife, as at St. Monans, originally a church of the Dominican friars.|$|E

5|$|The first astrological book {{published}} in Europe was the Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus ("Book of the Planets and Regions of the World"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, {{and may have}} been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy's second century AD Tetrabiblos was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. <b>The</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. <b>The</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the Liber Astronomicus, a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned {{at the end of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E

25|$|The famine {{led to a}} stark {{increase}} in crime, even among those not normally inclined to criminal activity, because people would resort to any means to feed themselves or their family. For the next several decades, after the famine, Europe took on a tougher and more violent edge; it became an even less amicable place than during the twelfth and <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>centuries.</b> This could be seen across all segments of society, perhaps most strikingly in the way warfare was conducted in the fourteenth century during the Hundred Years' War, when chivalry ended, {{as opposed to the}} twelfth and <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>centuries</b> when nobles were more likely to die by accident in tournament games than on the field of battle.|$|R

5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century</b> and late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In the High Middle Ages, Scotland {{adopted the}} Romanesque {{in the late}} twelfth century and {{retained}} and revived elements of its style after the Gothic style had become dominant from <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and did not survive the effect of time and of the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors such as the sacrament houses at Deskford and Kinkell and the carvings of the seven deadly sins at Rosslyn Chapel. From <b>the</b> <b>thirteenth</b> <b>century,</b> there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies such as the elaborate Douglas tombs {{in the town of}} Douglas.

Visual illustration {{can be seen in the}} illumination of charters, and occasional survivals such as the fifteenth-century Doom painting at Guthrie.
