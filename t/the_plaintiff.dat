5|$|The Lines International {{conditions}} were applied {{by a different}} High Court judge {{in the case of}} Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009). <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> argued that the Urban Redevelopment Authority ("URA") had not been transparent while processing her application for permission to redevelop her house, or had not given her case genuine consideration. The Court held that the URA had considered the planning approval application, and had explained to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> the implications of her proposal and had extended several invitations to discuss the proposal but <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> had declined to amend her redevelopment plans. On these facts, the Court held that the URA had thoroughly considered the plaintiff's application and had not fettered its discretion.|$|E
5|$|As {{attorney}} general, Crittenden issued {{only one}} notable opinion. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> {{in the case}} was an individual whose property had been damaged during Andrew Jackson's invasion of {{what would become the}} Florida Territory in 1818. The case was still being adjudicated in 1841. A Florida court found in favor of <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> and ordered the federal government to compensate him for the damages and to pay him interest on his claim from the time the damages were incurred. Treasury Secretary Thomas Ewing asked Crittenden whether the court had the authority to award interest and whether or not it should be paid. Crittenden opined that it did not, and Ewing did not pay the interest. Crittenden's opinion was used as a precedent in similar cases by future attorneys general.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017, Davis {{was again}} sued {{for failing to}} issue a {{marriage}} license. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff,</b> , is a Vanderbilt University Law School graduate who was denied a license to marry a laptop computer. A similar Florida lawsuit was dismissed in May.|$|E

50|$|Market share {{liability}} {{was introduced}} in the California case Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories. In Sindell, <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were injured by DES, a drug prescribed to prevent miscarriage. The mothers of <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had taken DES while pregnant, and expert testimony showed this to be a proximate cause of reproductive tract cancers in <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> years later. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs,</b> however, could not ascertain which drug company distributed the DES taken by their mothers. The court responded by allowing <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> to apportion liability among the defendant drug companies according to their respective shares in the DES market.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> {{satisfied}} <b>the</b> first {{element of}} the hot-news misappropriation test because <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> spent [...] "hundreds of millions of dollars" [...] annually towards the production of equity research reports, including the employment of highly skilled analysts. The defendant did not dispute that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> engaged in costly information gathering.|$|R
5|$|The {{jury found}} that UBS had {{destroyed}} relevant e-mail evidence after the litigation hold {{had been in}} place. UBS was ordered to pay <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> US$9.1million in compensatory damages (including back pay and professional damage), and US$20.2million in punitive damages.|$|E
5|$|Brady was {{admitted}} to the New York Bar in either 1835 or 1836, when he was about twenty years old. His first case was an insurance proceeding, where he opposed the prominent lawyer, Charles O'Connor. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> staked a claim for insurance money from a property allegedly burned down by a fire. Though Brady lost that case, his proficiency for law and oration was immediately noted.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Circuit case of Saunders v Wilkins (1945), Saunders {{claimed that}} Virginia should have its Congressional {{representation}} reduced {{because of its}} use of a poll tax and other voting restrictions. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> sued {{for the right to}} run for Congress at large in the state, rather than in one of its designated Congressional districts. The lawsuit was dismissed as a political question.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{defendants}} argued that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> {{did not have}} standing because the Vatican was only a third party to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> injury.|$|R

5|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the first two {{requirements}} had been satisfied, and that the guideline had not been rigidly enforced because the PSA {{had been willing to}} consider representations from cruise operators like <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff,</b> and, if the circumstances required, the PSA had been willing to grant an exception to the 30% restriction rule. Moreover, a number of concessions had in fact been made by the PSA.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{handed the}} ACLU two key {{victories}} in 1957, in Watkins v. United States and Yates v. United States, {{both of which}} undermined the Smith Act and {{marked the beginning of}} the end of communist party membership inquiries. In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including Lamont v. Postmaster General (in which <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> was Corliss Lamont, a former ACLU board member), which upheld fifth amendment protections and brought an end to restrictions on political activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit had several {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> could count on always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> money and had the case dismissed. In addition, it worked for executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a plaintiff at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his case would come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another major}} {{standing}} case, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992), the Supreme Court elaborated on the redressability requirement for standing. The case involved {{a challenge to}} a rule promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior interpreting §7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). The rule rendered §7 of the ESA applicable only to actions within the United States or on the high seas. The Court found that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> {{did not have the}} standing necessary to bring suit, because no injury had been established. The injury claimed by <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> was that damage would be caused to certain species of animals and that this in turn injures <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> by <b>the</b> reduced likelihood that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> would see <b>the</b> species in the future. The court insisted though that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had to show how damage to the species would produce imminent injury to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs.</b> <b>The</b> Court found that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> did not sustain this burden of proof. [...] "The 'injury in fact' test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest. It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured". The injury must be imminent and not hypothetical.|$|R

5|$|The {{advantages}} to this method were that bills were substantially cheaper, and unlike writs did not tie <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> down; once the case came to court the bill could be amended to include any action or actions <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> wanted to enforce. In addition, by avoiding the Chancery writ, {{the case was}} substantially cheaper. The result of this was substantial; between 1560 and 1640, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold. This period also saw a substantial broadening of the remedies available in the common law. The main remedy and method was action on the case, which justices expanded to encompass other things. In 1499 it enabled the enforcement of parol promises, which rendered Chancery subpoenas obsolete; later developments included the recovery of debts, suing for defamatory words (previously an ecclesiastical matter) and action on the case for trover and conversion. Most of this reform took place under Fineux CJ, who never lived {{to see the results}} of his work; it took over 100 years for the reforms to fully reverse the decline in business.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} {{opinion in the}} Oregon Reports was Thompson v. Backenstos, involving a case about trespassing. In the case, Justice George Henry Williams wrote the opinion, Justice Thomas Nelson had served as the judge at the trial level due to circuit riding, while future justice Reuben P. Boise served as counsel for the defense, and fellow future justice Aaron E. Waite provided counsel for <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> {{not being}} a corporation, and having no such {{corporate}} name, could not at common law maintain an action. This right, however, was more than 40 years ago conferred by statute, which, among other things, provides that the Seneca Nation of Indians may maintain any action of ejectment to recover the possession of {{any part of the}} Allegany and Cattaraugus reservations unlawfully withheld from them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were {{registered}} voters who {{had asked the}} defendant Federal Elections Commission ("FEC") to determine that an organization called the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ("AIPAC") was a [...] "political committee" [...] subject to certain regulations and reporting requirements under the Federal Election Campaign Act, because AIPAC had crossed certain spending thresholds. The FEC determined that AIPAC had indeed crossed those thresholds, but still did not require it to make the required reports because the organization was issue-oriented, not campaign-related. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> sought review in the District Court, which granted summary judgment for the FEC; this ruling was affirmed {{by a panel of}} the Court of Appeals, but the Court of Appeals en banc reversed. The government sought certiorari, and challenged <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff's</b> standing on <b>the</b> grounds that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had suffered no 'injury in fact'; that if <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had any injury it was not fairly traceable to the FEC decision; and that a decision in favor of <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> would not redress their injury.|$|R

5000|$|Four {{recording}} {{companies who}} held the copyrights in the songs that the defendant downloaded filed a lawsuit accusing the defendant of copyright infringement. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois agreed with <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs,</b> and entered summary judgment for <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs.</b> <b>The</b> trial court rejected the defendant's [...] "fair use" [...] defense. As a remedy, the trial court (1) awarded <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> $22,500 in statutory damages (representing the statutory minimum of $750 times the defendant's 30 infringing downloads), and (2) issued a permanent injunction forbidding the defendant to download copyrighted recordings owned by <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> was Salim Ahmed Hamdan, {{a citizen}} of Yemen {{who worked as a}} {{bodyguard}} and chauffeur for Osama bin Laden. Hamdan had formerly worked in Afghanistan on an agricultural project that Bin Laden had developed. Hamdan was captured by militia forces during the invasion of Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 and turned over to the United States. In 2002, he was sent by the US to its new Guantanamo Bay detention camp at its naval base in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|When Dowling's {{attorneys}} {{learned about}} the retainer to DLA Piper they {{asked the court to}} order the return of the retainer to <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff,</b> and the circuit court ruled in favor of Dowling.

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> rests, {{the defense}} lawyer calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of {{embarrassing}} questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E

50|$|After {{the lawsuit}} {{initially}} had been dismissed, {{an appeals court}} found in favour of <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> and reinstated <b>the</b> lawsuit. A subsequent audit led to findings which supported the assertions raised by <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. In a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In both cases, the courts held that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiff</b> lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
5|$|Neither treaty {{made any}} {{provision}} {{as to the}} mode or {{manner in which the}} removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place. The grantees have assumed that they were authorized to take forcible possession of the two reservations, or of the four, as the case would have been under the first treaty. <b>The</b> <b>plaintiff</b> in this case was expelled by force; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained, the recovery against the defendants for the trespass was right, and must be affirmed.|$|E

5000|$|... 28 November 2008The Tribunal's {{decision}} on this date addressed four main issues: (1) Whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction {{to hear the}} case; (2) whether <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had been denied access to domestic courts {{in violation of the}} SADC Treaty; (3) whether the Zimbabwean government had discriminated against <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> on <b>the</b> basis of race, and (4) whether <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were entitled to compensation. (1) The Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction to hear the case, because Amendment 17 had eliminated the plaintiffs' access to the domestic courts, and <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were therefore entitled to seek remedy before the Tribunal. (2) The Tribunal found that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> had been deprived of their right to a fair hearing before being deprived of their rights. (3) On the racial discrimination issue, the Tribunal held that the actions of the Zimbabwean government constituted indirect or [...] "de facto" [...] discrimination because implementation of Amendment 17 affected white farmers only. (4) Finally, the Tribunal held that <b>the</b> <b>plaintiffs</b> were entitled to compensation for the expropriation of their lands.|$|R
