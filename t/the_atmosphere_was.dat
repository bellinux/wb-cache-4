5|$|The {{inversion}} prevented {{air pollutants}} from rising and trapped them within the city. The smog event itself started on Wednesday November 23, {{coinciding with the}} beginning of the long Thanksgiving weekend. The material sources of the smog were particulates and chemicals from factories, chimneys, and vehicles. Sulfur dioxide levels rose. Smoke shade, a measure of visibility interference in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>was</b> two to three times higher than usual.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles {{led him to}} make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of Venus <b>is</b> {{composed}} of 96.5% carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen, and traces of other gases, most notably sulfur dioxide. The amount of nitrogen in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> relatively {{small compared to}} the amount of carbon dioxide, but because <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> so much thicker than that on Earth, its total nitrogen content is roughly four times higher than Earth's, even though on Earth nitrogen makes up about 78% of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere.</b>|$|R
5|$|The old rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the final round}} of the 2000–01 season, when one of the most celebrated matches in Slovenian League history was played. Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium, Bežigrad, and both teams were {{competing}} for their fifth Slovenian League title. The home team needed a win for the title, while a draw was enough for Maribor. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> electric days before the kick-off, and the stadium with a capacity of 8,500 was completely sold out. At the end, the match ended with a draw (1–1) and Maribor started to celebrate their fifth consecutive title in front of 3,000 of their fans that gathered in Ljubljana that day.|$|E
5|$|The year 1968 {{had seen}} {{turmoil in the}} United States, {{including}} riots and the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged a boycott of the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games which left dozens dead.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E

30|$|The {{scattering}} by air {{molecules and}} aerosols: scattering in <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> very accurately modeled {{and can be}} adequately accounted for, provided the composition of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently well known. This {{is the case for}} the air molecules, but the difficulty lies in the knowledge of the aerosol properties, which are very variable, both in location and time.|$|R
5|$|Voyager 1s mission {{included}} a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which {{had long been}} known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by Pioneer 11 in 1979 had indicated <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within , passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight, and Earth-based measurement of {{its effect on the}} probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. Thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E
25|$|These events aggravated {{tensions}} among provincial, {{federal and}} industry leaders.

5000|$|The {{pressure}} of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>is</b> maximum {{at sea level}} and decreases with altitude.

It temporarily excluded former Confederates from voting, serving on juries, becoming corporate officers, or preaching from church pulpits. <b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> volatile, with widespread clashes between individuals and between armed gangs of veterans {{from both sides of}} the war.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> {{peaceful}} but {{at least}} 40 bus loads of riot police were standing by as thousands of protesters demonstrated, {{with a total of}} up to 50,000 expected to arrive during the day.

25|$|Foregoing a full album, {{the band}} {{released}} two EPs in 1984, Remote Luxury in March and Persia in August, {{but only in}} Australia and New Zealand. Both EPs reached the Top50 on the Australian Albums Chart. Again, almost all tracks were written by Kilbey, but compared to Seance, <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> lighter and less gloomy. The band's trademark guitar sound was complemented by the keyboards of guest musicians Davey Ray Moor (from The Crystal Set, which included Kilbey's brother Russell) and Craig Hooper (from The Reels), who joined as an auxiliary member.

25|$|In the 1960s, {{the chaotic}} nature of <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>was</b> first {{observed}} and mathematically described by Edward Lorenz, founding {{the field of}} chaos theory. These advances {{have led to the}} current use of ensemble forecasting in most major forecasting centers, to take into account uncertainty arising from the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth (climate models), have been developed that have a resolution today that are as coarse as the older weather prediction models. These climate models are used to investigate long-term climate shifts, such as what effects might be caused by human emission of greenhouse gases.|$|E

Patients capable of working were asked to help with various duties, partly because of staff shortages in World War II. Unless considered dangerous, patients were allowed some liberties, such as being allowed to go fishing - an activity that provided patients with leisure time, while also helping the fishing business Truby King had long ago established at nearby Karitane.|$|E
