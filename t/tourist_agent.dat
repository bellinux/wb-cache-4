40|$|This paper proposes the {{development}} of an Agent framework for tourism recommender system. The recommender system can be featured as an online web application which is capable of generating a personalized list of preference attractions for tourists. Traditional technologies of classical recommender system application domains, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering and content-based filtering are effectively adopted in the framework. In the framework they are constructed as Agents that can generate recommendations respectively. Recommender Agent can generate recommender information by integrating the recommendations of Content-based Agent, collaborative filtering-based Agent and constraint-based Agent. In order to make the performance more effective, linear combination method of data fusion is applied.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our ideas on using generic {{arguments}} {{as a means}} of representing the shared knowledge that an agent community has. In this approach each agent’s beliefs are represented by actual arguments. Because these actual arguments are drawn from a common generic tree, negotiation between agents can be simplified. The mapping between the negotiation protocol, the negotiation object and the agent’s decision making model is discussed and lays the groundwork for developing applications based on multiple agents negotiating outcomes. In this paper a simple application in the domain of Tourism where the <b>TOURIST</b> <b>agent</b> completely trusts the TOUR ADVISORY agent is used to illustrate our ideas. We contend that the generic argument framework is an effective representation for underpinning agent negotiation to provide effective decision support in more complex areas...|$|E

This article contemplates two types of antecedents of management innovation in the hospitality industry. In the internal context of the company, the influence of the employees' knowledge and skills is analysed, as well as the company's capacity to integrate this knowledge. In the external setting, an evaluation is performed of the way relationships established with <b>tourist</b> industry <b>agents</b> and external change agents affect the development of management innovation. The data obtained from 109 firms operating hotel establishments in Spain show that both the internal resources and the relations with external change agents determine the introduction of management innovations.

In museums, in opera houses, in the streets, in the schools, in theatres, in films, on the internet and beyond, narratives about the past circulate today at a dizzying speed.

40|$|One aspect {{that seems}} to mark the tourist demand in recent years relates to a trend (confirmed by statistics) called for {{increased}} environmental tourism. This fact brings new challenges to the <b>tourist</b> <b>agents</b> who still are confronted with increasingly demanding and diverse public. It {{should be noted that}} the environmental tourism, assumes a set of commitments not only from the environment itself as for individuals. For this it is necessary to develop an environmental awareness that allows, despite increased human presence in a "place " does not deface the nature of that space. Rather, environmental tourism and environmental ecology are presented as two sides of the same coin in that based on the same concerns of ecological, environmental and human and the same assumptions of conservation, sustainability and social responsibility. Thus, the greatest human presence that follows the development of this type of tourism should be reflected, not detract from the tourist destination but a greater investment in the preservation, conservation and respect for the uniqueness of that destination...|$|R

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of tourism destinations is {{a relevant issue for}} tourism studies, moreso, {{is a key}} element on the daily basis of tourism destinations. In this sense, the management of tourism destinations is essential to maintain competitive advantages. In this article tourism destination is considered as a relational network, where interaction and cooperation is needed among <b>tourist</b> <b>agents,</b> to achieve major levels of competitive advantage and a more effective destination management system. In addition, the perceptions of tourists are obtained from two main sources. The first one is the social construction of a tourism destination previous to the visit and the second one is obtained from the interaction between tourists and tourism destination agents during the visit. In this sense, the management of tourism destination to emit a homogenous and collective image is a factor that can reduce the gap if dissatisfaction from the previous and real tourist perception. The discussion is centered on the relationship within a destination, between the supply network and the targeted demand, considering these two approaches jointly, to benefit destination management. The main result is a conceptual model that shows how tourism <b>agents</b> and <b>tourists</b> in the tourism destination interact to improve the destination competitivenes...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{literary}} landscape of Monsanto. It confronts the discourse produced by the writer, Fernando Namora (1819 - 1989) —a pioneer of the Neo-Realistic literature in Portugal—and the literary production of other contemporary authors related with the ideological bases of “Estado Novo” (“New State”), the dictatorial regime that held the government in Portugal from 1933 to 1974. In the writings analysed, {{the representation of the}} landscapes of Monsanto entails powerful ideological messages. For Namora, the village was a “stone vessel,” a metaphor about the hard life of its inhabitants, victims of social injustices and lacking of resources. For the “Estado Novo,” that place was the symbol of the national identity (“the most Portuguese village,” as was stated in 1938). The metaphors of the stone, the strong substrata and the raw material used for shelters, stressed the value of preservation of Tradition, History, Religion and Work. Although very different, both discourses attach great value to the productive and dominated rural landscape of Monsanto, and to the human role in the transformation of its soil. At the present time, even if population has decreased drastically and agriculture has been abandoned, local authorities and <b>tourist</b> <b>agents</b> alike try to conciliate the “stone vessel” with “the most Portuguese village. ” In this context, the options for the management and valorisation of the landscape of Monsanto shall be discussed...|$|R

40|$|In tourism, {{cultures}} {{are often used}} as resources to attract tourists. This is because tourism is generated by difference. So that the culture of a tourist destination can be consumed by tourists the culture needs to go through commodification, a process through which {{part of the culture}} turns into a product or a service. Knowing how a culture is used for tourism practice is important from the viewpoint of the cultural sustainability of tourism. The present study primarily aims at examining how the local culture is dealt with by the Japanese in Saariselkä through tourism. The study concentrates on how Japanese tourists perceive the local culture during their stay and how the Japanese travel agents construe the experience of the tourists. A qualitative approach was applied in this research {{in order to understand the}} views of the Japanese deeply. Interviews were conducted qualitatively to gather the data from participants. For the analysis of data, content analysis was chosen as the analysis method. Using the method, the common themes were identified from the data, with which the author further argued the viewpoints of the interviewees. The results of the analysis indicate that tourists perceive the local culture differently depending on their concept of culture. The tourists, who had an idea that cultures differ due to surrounding environments, were aware of regional cultures within a nation. They related some of their cultural experience to the culture of Saariselkä. The results also revealed that the former kind of tourists are interested in the local culture more than the <b>tourist</b> <b>agents</b> assume...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{is to find a}} statistical method able to preview the general trend of tourism in summer time, in order to respond to the numerous requests made by the stakeholders in Basilicata (public administrations, <b>tourist</b> <b>agents,</b> researchers, and so on). There-fore there has been an enquiry, which analyzed the sensations of tourist accommodation facili-ties’ managers about a previous period and the next summer season to point out: •	booking features (timing, methods, trend); •	variations perceived in relationship to the same period of previous year; •	forecasts on tourist presences in summer (flows, average permanence and places of origin). The statistical population of the survey consisted in the accommodation facilities in Basilicata, interviewed through a written questionnaire. The analysis was carried out according to the ac-commodation size (number of firms and beds), typologies (hotels and other facilities) and to the areas (Matera, Potenza, Maratea, Jonian Coast, Pollino and rest of the territory). The analysis carried out in the present paper has pointed out that the managers’ sensations have been quite accurate, according to both the previous period and the forecasts. The data collected have made it possible to define the aspects of tourism in Basilicata useful to make a comparison with global tendencies, but also with booking features and tourist attitudes. The variations per-ceived are helpful also to understand the traders’ sensations and the difference between these and the final data, in order to evaluate the forecasting, planning and entrepreneurial capability of tourism agents, fundamental to improve tourism in Basilicata...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{tourism is}} the main driver {{of change in the}} Galapagos Islands, {{affecting}} the social, terrestrial, and marine sub-systems. Tourism also has direct and indirect consequences for the unique archipelago's natural habitats and for the human well-being. Describing the mechanisms that drive and affect most the tourism development in Galapagos is a preliminary condition to developing {{a better understanding of the}} interaction structure of factors that shape the Galapagos archipelago as a social-ecological complex system. In this paper, we present a first attempt to represent the touristic market in Galapagos trough an Agent Based Model (ABM) of touristic activity, focusing on touristic offers, reservations, and touristic activities. The model is based on an individual-based representation of tourists' consumption preferences and touristic accommodation offers in the Galapagos Islands. <b>Tourist</b> <b>agents</b> are created to mimic the real world by assigning average characteristics of individuals who visit the Galapagos Archipelago of Ecuador. The accommodation offers (i. e., hotels and cruises) are generated in accordance with actual conditions derived from data collected through field surveys. The model includes a market agent that can change the prices, create and delete accommodation offers following an evolutionary algorithm. We carried out preliminary simulations that show a close agreement between real world data and model outputs. Furthermore we used the model to generate three "what if" scenarios in order to study how emergent patterns in the touristic market in Galapagos are affected by changes in the archipelago environment. In this way we illustrate how the model can be used as a useful tool to help public policy makers to explore the consequences of their decisions...|$|R

40|$|Given {{that one}} type of tourist does not exist and {{different}} strategies are drawn to reach the wished "extraordinary" by tourists for holidays, there are windows of opportunities to the tourist destinations, as these give them the chance for differentiated offers and for a flexibility that opposes uniformity and gives place to variety and difference. Assuming {{that the development of}} the destinations do not obey to just a standard way, and alternatively is embedded in the historical, cultural, institutional and natural matrices of the regions where destinations are anchored, then the specific resources of a place can assume the basic role of inputs for the differentiation of the tourist destination and for the diversification of its tourist offers. Taking into account the exceptionality of tourist product as an experience, which is associated with an integrated experience offer, one can say that an idiographic perspective of a destination requires that the valuation of its specific resources pass not only for the tourist services providers to assume themselves as agents who facilitate the stay and the mobility of the tourists, but also that they need to become ambassadors of all the kind of services of the destination {{as well as of the}} region itself. Such tourist destination generates change. As it generates differentiated strategies at the regional level and as it is based on co-operation and network, these strategies and related facts make the environment propitious to the dissemination of knowledge and innovation. Innovation, in turn, generates difference, that strengthens the identity of the region, and potentially, of the tourist destination. Such strategies of differentiation, in a sustainable development frame, can be the turning point for a more selective tourist industry, and where all can win: the local communities, the <b>tourists,</b> the <b>tourist</b> <b>agents,</b> and the environment. ...|$|R
