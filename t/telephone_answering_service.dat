50|$|In the U.S., the Bell Operating Companies {{and their}} {{cellular}} divisions had been prohibited by the FCC from offering voicemail and other enhanced {{services such as}} paging and <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>services</b> (no such prohibition existed in foreign countries). A ruling by Judge Harold H. Greene on March 7, 1988 removed this barrier and allowed the BOCs to offer voice-mail service, however they {{were not allowed to}} design or manufacture equipment used to provide voice-mail services.|$|R
50|$|Another company, Delphi Communications of California, deserves some partial {{credit for}} {{invention}} of voicemail. Under {{the leadership of}} Jay Stoffer, Delphi developed a proprietary system called Delta 1 that picked up incoming calls directly from the telephone company. Stoffer presented the Delphi concept publicly to the association of <b>Telephone</b> <b>Answering</b> <b>Services</b> around 1973 and the prototype system was launched in San Francisco in 1976 by a Delphi company called VoiceBank. Delphi developed Delta 1 as a purely service-oriented voice messaging system to <b>answer</b> subscriber <b>telephones</b> for businesses and professionals. Delta 1 required human intervention for message deposit. While three machines were built, only one machine was put into operational service. The completely automated voice messaging system (Delta 2) was developed for initial operational use in Los Angeles in 1981. Apparently Delta 2 was built, installed and operational for a short while, but unfortunately Delphi's major early investor, Exxon Enterprises, abruptly shut down Delphi in July, 1982. Nothing further was done with Delphi's technology. A patent was applied for and issued for Delphi's Automated Telephone Voice Service System. The patent, U.S. Patent No. 4,625,081, was issued after Delphi's closure, but Delphi's assets (and the patent) were transferred to another Exxon company, Gilbarco, which made equipment for gas pumps at filling stations. Gilbarco is now owned by GEC in the United Kingdom.|$|R

40|$|Making {{profit is}} the {{foundation}} every modern company rests on. No profit, no business. During the passed 10 - 15 years making profits in the computer retailing industry has been harder and harder. Margins has has lessened and due to the simplification of computers and increased easiness to understand computers even more unqualified people may compete in the business. As an effort to increase the profitability of the industry niching was discussed as possible for success and earning money on added value, which is the theme running all through this thesis. The theories this thesis rests on are basically theories about a high quality service, which is the main foundation for any success: no high quality offered, no success. The high competition in this industry {{is one of the}} corner stones of the thesis as well due to the heavy competition in the investigated industry. A third important and clear corner stone are the theories about rules of public procurement which Government owned, or partially owned companies, has to follow. The fact that added value is a subgroup of customer value is natural, but in difference to added value, the concept of customer value is clearly defined, while the meaning of added value is rather ambiguous and undefined. The theories about added value stretches from, spoken from Telia as <b>telephone</b> <b>answering</b> <b>services</b> to co-production of values, some theories even say that added value can only be defined by customers and not by the industry offering it. In this thesis, 25 industrial companies was to be interviewed, of which 14 accepted or had their key responsible in question available. This gives a response frequency of nearly 60 %. Five out of the 14 answering companies have to follow the rules of public procurement. The interviews have been carried out by Perspektiv Undersökningar by phone during the fortnight before mid summer 2004. Eight questions regarding added value, its importance and what added values to pay for have been asked. Very clear in this study was partially the importance of added value, and rather surprising after heaving read the theories, how unanimous the respondents were, who all of them mentioned added value to be the relation between customer and retailer and the importance of suppliers ability to understand and see what the customer need. It is very clear that the ability to make money on added value is limited as the customer regards the added value of relation as obvious for any business transaction at all. However, the customer is prepared to pay a higher price to the supplier offering added value, than to suppliers just caring for transactions. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
