25|$|Aside {{from the}} lignocellulose, wood {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} low molecular weight organic compounds, called extractives. The wood extractives are fatty acids, resin acids, waxes and terpenes. For example, rosin is exuded by conifers as protection from insects.

While Sweden had not send an official request for assistance yet, the Finnish recovery ships prepared to join the spill combating operation if the oil slick, at that time some [...] northeast from Söderhamn, started drifting towards the Finnish coast. Although Louhi can operate in relatively high seas, the recovery effort was hindered and subsequently the oil slick was broken up by the storm on 27 December 2011. When Louhi moved to the recovery area on 28 December, the slick could not be located and only [...] of weathered oil was recovered.|$|E

It is the world's <b>tallest</b> <b>oil</b> platform, slightly <b>taller</b> than the Empire State Building. The highly complex job of installing Cognac's support "jacket" under water more than a thousand feet deep was directed from a barge-based control center. To enable crews to practice in advance difficult tasks never before accomplished, Honeywell, adapting NASA's Apollo technology, developed a system for simulating the various underwater operations.

5000|$|<b>Tall</b> <b>oil,</b> {{also called}} [...] "liquid rosin" [...] or tallol, is a viscous yellow-black odorous liquid {{obtained}} as {{a by-product of}} the Kraft process of wood pulp manufacture when pulping mainly coniferous trees.

50|$|The {{composition}} of crude <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> varies a great deal, {{depending on the}} type of wood used. A common quality measure for <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> is acid number. With pure pines it is possible to have acid numbers in the range 160 - 165, while mills using a mix of softwoods and hardwoods might give acid numbers in the range of 125 - 135.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} types of rosin: gum rosin (from pine tree oleoresin), wood rosin (obtained by {{extraction}} of tree stumps), and <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> rosin (obtained from <b>tall</b> <b>oil,</b> a byproduct of kraft paper process). Gum rosin has a milder odor and lower tendency to crystallize from solutions than wood rosin, and is therefore preferred for flux applications. <b>Tall</b> <b>oil</b> rosin finds increased use due to its higher thermal stability and therefore lower tendency to form insoluble thermal decomposition residues. The composition and quality of rosin differs by the tree type, and also by location and even by year. In Europe, rosin for fluxes is usually obtained from {{a specific type of}} Portuguese pine, in America a North Carolina variant is used.|$|E
