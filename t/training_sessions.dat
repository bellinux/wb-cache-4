MethodSixteen judokas {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two conditions: Carbohydrate solution and Placebo solution in a double-blind design. Saliva samples were collected at rest, immediately after the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> and 1 h after the <b>training</b> <b>session.</b> ResultsThe concentration of the salivary immunoglobulin A decreased during the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> in both conditions (p= 0. 0002) as well as at 1 h after the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> in the placebo solution condition (p= 0. 035). The rate of salivary flow decreased during the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> in the placebo solution condition (p= 0. 04). ConclusionCarbohydrate solution consumption during <b>training</b> <b>session</b> did not affect the athletes oral immunity, however, in the recovery period an upper-respiratory tract protection was observed...|$|R

Ill. (some col.) The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether the use of performance measures for instructional adaptation were more effective and efficient than the use of mental efficiency measures. Fifty-three undergraduate accounting students were randomly assigned to a performance group, a mental efficiency group, and a non-adapted control group. Participants were administered an initial diagnostic test, were placed in a <b>training</b> <b>session</b> about accounting cost-volume-profit analysis, and were administered a final diagnostic test, similar to the initial diagnostic test, and a mental effort rating of the <b>training</b> <b>session.</b> Performance group participants were placed in the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> and allowed to skip certain <b>training</b> <b>session</b> stages based on the results of rapid verification tests administered during the initial diagnostic test. Mental efficiency group participants were placed in the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> and allowed to skip certain <b>training</b> <b>session</b> stages based on the results of rapid verification tests and mental effort ratings administered during the initial diagnostic test. The non-adapted control group participants were placed in the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> at the beginning and did not skip any stages. The <b>training</b> <b>session</b> consisted of four difficulty levels, each with five stages. At each stage a faded worked example and a faded completion problem were provided and a rapid verification test and a mental effort rating were administered. Performance group participants advanced to the next stage or repeated the current stage based on the results of the rapid verification test. Mental efficiency group participants advanced to the next stage or repeated the stage based on the results of the rapid verification test and mental effort ratings. The non-adapted control group did not repeat any <b>training</b> <b>session</b> stages. The study produced no significant differences between any treatment groups for instructional time, final diagnostic test score, mental effort rating of the <b>training</b> <b>session,</b> or instructional efficiency (final diagnostic test score divided by mental effort rating of the <b>training</b> <b>session).</b> The author speculated that the non-significant results of the study were attributable to either an insufficient <b>training</b> <b>session</b> length or to the use of faded completion problems rather than conventional problems...|$|R

The main objective of the <b>training</b> <b>session</b> was to level the participant at the same background required to understand and properly execute the experimental tasks. Thus, they received training about basic concepts and terminologies. This training was given only once for each participant before the first steps of the quasi-experiment. The training consisted of a 15 -min presentation that covered the following topics: software design, code smells, and design problems. The <b>training</b> <b>session</b> took approximately 15 min, and the participants could make any question throughout it.|$|R

5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during <b>training</b> <b>sessions,</b> while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact <b>training</b> <b>sessions</b> than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries occur in the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% occur in the upper extremities.|$|E
