He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

500|$|Day-Lewis {{became an}} Irish citizen in 1993 and {{currently}} holds British and Irish dual citizenship. He {{has lived in}} Annamoe, County Wicklow since 1997. He stated [...] "I do have dual citizenship, but I think of England as my country. I miss London very much but I couldn't live there because there came a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> needed to be private {{and was forced to}} be public by the press. I couldn't deal with it".

500|$|By the 1970s Tunis {{felt his}} message had been ignored or {{misunderstood}} by most Americans, saying [...] "Nobody has paid attention... There was a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{expected to do}} some good. But {{that was a long}} while ago." [...] This may seem surprising considering that his New York Times obituary referred to him as a man who [...] "helped educate a whole generation of Americans". Perhaps seen in light of Tunis' distrust of professional athletics, it can be understood. Though he may have felt his message against the commercialization of sports was ignored, there are those who cite Tunis as having made a lasting impact in publishing and to them personally and professionally.|$|E

500|$|African-American {{literature}} scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe calls Angelou's {{depiction of}} the rape [...] "a burden" [...] of Caged Bird: a demonstration of [...] "the {{manner in which the}} Black female is violated in her tender years and... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, [...] "I can't remember a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wasn't loved by somebody." [...] When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, she indicated that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. [...] She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.|$|E
500|$|Following her accession, John Owen Dominis {{was given}} the title Prince Consort and {{restored}} to the Governorship of Oʻahu, which had been abolished following the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Dominis' death on August 27, seven months into her reign, greatly affected the new Queen. Liliʻuokalani later wrote: [...] "His death occurred {{at a time when}} his long experience in public life, his amiable qualities, and his universal popularity, would have made him an adviser to me for whom no substitute could possibly be found. I have often said that it pleased the Almighty Ruler of nations to take him away from me at precisely the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt that I most needed his counsel and companionship." [...] Cleghorn, her sister's widower, was appointed to succeed Dominis as Governor of Oʻahu. In 1892, Liliʻuokalani would also restore the positions of governor for the other three main islands for her friends and supporters.|$|E

[...] On 9 June 1917, after America's entry into the war, he enlisted as a bandsman in the U.S. Army with the 15th Coastal Artillery Corps Band in New York City. He had joined as a saxophonist, though he records learning the oboe: [...] "I long for the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can blow my oboe well enough {{to play in the}} band". [...] In his 18 months' service, Grainger [...] made frequent appearances as a pianist at Red Cross and Liberty bond concerts. As a regular encore [...] he began to play a piano setting of the tune [...] "Country Gardens". The piece became instantly popular; [...] sheet music sales quickly broke many publishing records. The work was to become synonymous with Grainger's name through the rest of his life, though he came in time to detest it. [...] On 3 June 1918 he became a naturalised American citizen.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Joel H. Cohen, {{and it was his}} first sole writing credit for a Treehouse of Horror episode. He {{previously}} wrote the [...] "Hex and the City" [...] segment of season 13's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XII". Bob Anderson served as director. It was his third Treehouse of Horror episode, the first two being season seven's [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI" [...] and season 20's [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIX". Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter film series, guest starred as Edmund in the third segment which parodies the Twilight novel and film series. Radcliffe said that he is a fan of the show and guest starring is [...] "a huge honour. The Halloween episode has become a big tradition in The Simpsons so I'm very excited to be part of it. There was a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 12 or 13 when 50 percent of everything I knew about the world came from The Simpsons, so this is a big deal."

500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was [...] "delighted" [...] as [...] " [...] is a hugely loved character and one we think will be stirring things up from the moment she steps back into Walford." [...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came back to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently. It really reminded me that the square is where I feel at home." [...] BBC executives hoped that Peggy's return would help to revive EastEnders ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for EastEnders, with David Liddiment in The Guardian drawing direct correlation between her return and the show's [...] "ratings rejuvenation". The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 47% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|Caine {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about both the production and the final version. He thinks {{that it was a}} first for him to be involved with someone his own age in a film. He compares the relationship between two middle-aged people to the romance between two teenagers. Although disappointed {{not to be able to}} collect an Academy Award because of filming in the Bahamas, he was glad to be involved in the film. In the press release, he explains that [...] "it is part of movie history... the original was one of the great all-time thrillers. I thought it might be nice to be mixed up with that. I liked the script very much." [...] However, Caine later claimed: [...] "I have never seen it , but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!" [...] In his 1992 autobiography What's it All About?, he says that the film [...] "will go down in my memory as the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> won an Oscar, paid for a house and had a great holiday. Not bad for a flop movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Extraordinary {{events had}} {{recently}} transpired in England, with King Charles I executed, {{power in the}} hands of a commoner, and freedom of the pulpit given to Puritans. The commoner in power was a personal friend of Wheelwright, the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, with whom Wheelwright had gone to college. Henry Vane, who had been very close to Wheelwright during the events of the Antinomian Controversy, had also reached high positions in government. These two prominent men had been working side by side for political and religious liberty, but became estranged and hostile towards each other in the early 1650s. Vane had retired from public life while Cromwell moved into the highest position of authority in England. Wheelwright was well received by Cromwell, who once described his classmate this way: [...] "I remember the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was more afraid of meeting Wheelwright at football than I have been since of meeting an army in the field, for I was infallibly sure of being tripped up by him". Wheelwright wrote a letter to his church in Hampton, dated 20 April 1658, in which he described his meeting with Cromwell, writing, [...] "I had discourse in private about the space of an hour. All his speeches seemed to me very orthodox and gracious".|$|E

500|$|In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada {{together}} with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse renku. In 1666, Yoshitada's sudden death brought Bashō's peaceful {{life as a}} servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but {{it is believed that}} Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto miko named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō's own references to this time are vague; he recalled that [...] "at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land", and that [...] "there was a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love": there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, [...] "the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless". His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of renga and haikai no renga as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Kakha Kaladze's brother Levan, {{a medical}} student, was kidnapped in Georgia, with a ransom of $600,000 demanded. Georgia's {{president}} at the time, Eduard Shevardnadze, promised that [...] "everything {{is being done to}} locate him". Despite this assurance, the only time that Levan was ever seen was in a video where he was shown blindfolded and begging for help. Following the kidnapping, Kaladze threatened to take up Ukrainian citizenship, but reverted his decision, stating, [...] "There was a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought about quitting the national side completely, but I couldn't do it out of respect for the Georgian people and the fans who come and give us such support." [...] Roughly four years later, on 6 May 2005, Georgian police officers found eight dead bodies in the Svaneti region and it was speculated that Levan was among the dead. On 21 February 2006, Levan was officially identified among the deceased, after tests from FBI experts. The local media claimed that the ransom was paid by Kaladze's family, although another source says that Kaladze's father attempted to meet the kidnappers, who fled as they believed he was followed by the police. Two men were sentenced to prison for the murder: David Asatiani for 25 years and Merab Amisulashvili for five years. On 14 July 2009, Kaladze's wife Anouki gave birth to their first-born son in Milan. The couple named their son Levan, in memory of Kaladze's brother.|$|E
500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure.
