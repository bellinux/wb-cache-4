The fact is that thanks to this procedure, businesses which {{are in a state of}} financial crisis, either actual or upcoming can be placed under court protection from creditors which results in blocking enforcement and increasing interest and penalties, allowing them a new start through a reorganization of their activities. Reorganizaing the activities of insolvent debtors activity may also be in the interest of creditors, if they cannot obtain sufficient repayment through the debtor’s <b>bankruptcy.</b> Thus, requests <b>to</b> <b>open</b> insolvency proceedings by them will appear as a means to preserve their rights and to avoid irreversible deterioration of the situation of the deptor. On the other hand, an aggressive insolvency procedure may be used by creditors as a means of pressure in order to obtain a quick settlement of their receivables from solvent borrowers acting in a state of panic created by the existence of an application <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a <b>bankruptcy</b> procedure. And not least, the paper presents how the situation has seriously deteriorated regarding the criteria allowing businesses to apply for an insolvency procedure and the proper use of the benefits of this procedure. bankruptcy, crises, insolvency, insolvability...|$|R

In most cases it includes the maximization of certain variables, {{but in the case}} of financial and capital structure it refers to the most favourable ratio of debt and capital. In order to determine the most suitable range of financial (capital) structure it must be associated with company's success. The question that arises is – how to measure success of a company? There are many ways – most common is definitely profitability. But nowadays profitability in many cases cannot be reliable indicator of company's success because there are many ways to embellish »bottom line« without substantial upturns. There is notable number of cases in which profitable companies go bankrupt. That is the reason why business continuity was used as a measure of company's success in this paper.

It has been suggested that Bernarr Macfadden, another magazine publisher, maneuvered to force the bankruptcy because Gernsback would not sell his titles to Macfadden, but this is unproven. Experimenter Publishing did not file any defence and was declared bankrupt by default on 6 March 1929; Amazing survived with its existing staff, but Hugo and his brother, Sidney, were forced out as directors.
