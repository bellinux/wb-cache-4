500|$|The {{potential}} energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when {{the distance from}} the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.

While the plane of the ellipse is near the other feature's shared reflection symmetry plane, it is definitely offset. This structure's kinematics are the only such ones known among studied PN. Unlike all the other Mz 3 structures, there is no increase of velocity as the radial offset from <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases.</b> Consequently, this must not be a simple equatorial flow despite the fact that its motion appears to be strictly radial (that is, there is no indication of rotation which would suggest that this feature is dynamically stable). All the kinematic properties of the ellipse are symmetric and very ordered relative to the nucleus, consistent with all the other Mz 3 features. Therefore, the ellipse must be historically linked to the evolution of the central star.|$|E

50|$|Rev acts post-transcriptionally to {{positively}} {{regulate the}} expression of structural genes and to negatively regulate {{the expression of}} regulatory genes. Rev positively regulates the expression of gag, pol, and env. Rev-mediated export from <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases</b> cytoplasmic levels of the structural mRNAs (gag, pol, and env). Gag, pol and env expression is lower {{in the absence of}} Rev and higher in the presence of Rev. Rev negatively regulates the expression of the regulatory genes (rev and tat) by creating a negative feedback loop, which regulates Rev production. There is a decrease in Rev production when Rev protein levels are higher than is necessary for the given amount of HIV-1 genome encoded. Rev also decreases the quantity of completely spliced viral messages expressed by exporting pre-mRNA before it can be spliced. This results in decreased expression of the regulatory proteins, Rev and Tat. Since Rev is continuously shuttled between the nucleus and cytoplasm, small amounts of the protein are able to impact many mRNA transcripts. Maintenance of the proper balance between early and late viral gene quantities leads to an overall increase in virion production.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} article, we use an axially {{symmetric}} galactic gravitational {{model with a}} disk-halo and a spherical nucleus, in order to investigate the transition from regular to chaotic motion for stars moving in the meridian (r, z) plane. We study in detail the transition from regular to chaotic motion, in two different cases: the time independent model and the time evolving model. In both cases, we explored all the available range regarding {{the values of the}} main involved parameters of the dynamical system. In the time dependent model, we follow the evolution of orbits as the galaxy develops a dense and massive nucleus in its core, as mass is transported exponentially from the disk to the galactic center. We apply the classical method of the Poincare ́ (r, pr) phase plane, in order to distinguish between ordered and chaotic motion. The Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent is used, to make an estimation of the degree of chaos in our galactic model and also to help us to study the time dependent model. In addition, we construct some numerical diagrams in which we present the correlations between the main parameters of our galactic model. Our numerical calculations indicate, that stars with values of angular momentum Lz {{less than or equal to}} a critical value Lzc, moving near to the galactic plane, are scattered to the halo upon encountering the nuclear region and subsequently display chaotic motion. A linear relationship exists between the critical value of the angular momentum Lzc and the mass of the nucleus Mn. Furthermore, the extent of the chaotic region increases as the value of the mass of <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases.</b> Moreover, our simulations indicate that the degree of chaos increases linearly, as the mass of <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases.</b> A comparison is made between the critical value Lz...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoid {{resistance}} {{is a major}} driver of therapeutic failure in Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we identify the AKT 1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR 3 C 1 glucocorticoid receptor protein activity driving glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT 1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR 3 C 1 at position S 134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR 3 C 1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT 1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to glucocorticoid therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK 2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR 3 C 1 translocation to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus,</b> <b>increases</b> the response of T-ALL cells to glucocorticoid therapy, and effectively reverses glucocorticoid resistance invitro and inviv...|$|E

40|$|Alterations in {{the major}} {{biochemical}} constituents of intervertebral discs coincide with aging and degeneration, and can alter the disc's ability to support load. The most significant biochemical change that occurs in degeneration {{is the loss of}} proteoglycans in the nucleus pulposus. During a diurnal cycle, the disc experiences approximately 16 hours of functional loading, followed by 8 hours of recovery. An axisymmetric, poroelastic model was created using ABAQUS finite element software. Standard poroelastic theory is utilized, but a user-defined material was written to include the effects of osmotic swelling, which is directly related to proteoglycan content. Due to the high stresses in the nucleus, the annulus fibrosus must remodel itself to account for the change in properties of the nucleus. The stress experienced by <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases</b> greatly in Grade 2 from Grade 1, but then decreases in Grade 3, and even Grade 4 experiences lower stresses than in Grade 2.

40|$|We {{study the}} nature of motion in a {{logarithmic}} galactic dynamical model, with an additional external perturbation. Two different cases are investigated. In the first case the external perturbation is fixed, while in the second case it is varying with the time. Numerical experiments suggest, that responsible for the chaotic phenomena is the external perturbation, combined with the dense nucleus. Linear relationships are found to exist, between the critical value of the angular momentum and the dynamical parameters of the galactic system that is, {{the strength of the}} external perturbation, the flattening parameter and the radius of the nucleus. Moreover, the extent of the chaotic regions in the phase plane, increases linearly as the strength of the external perturbation and the flattening parameter increases.

To identify novel genes or molecules that are involved in innate immunity, we carried out two genetic screens in Drosophila. From a forward screen of flies mutagenized with Ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), four mutants with increased susceptibility to Drosophia X virus (DXV) were found. In this study, we focused on the rogue mutant and identified a novel antiviral gene rogue. The rogue mutant is highly susceptible to DXV infection and is unable to control viral replication during infection. The expression of rogue in either the hemocytes or the fat body is required for flies to control viral accumulation and to survive a viral infection. At an early stage of infection, rogue is induced and the amount of Rogue protein that locates to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases.</b> In addition, we confirm that the Rogue protein interacts with the polyA binding protein (PABP), and we propose that rogue restricts viral replication via translation regulation in Drosophila.

Since {{we are currently}} unable to calculate antiproton yields in this regime from first principles, we must rely on empirical data in order to answer questions involving antibaryon production at these energies. Typically, the motivation for studying this topic using proton-nucleus (p-A) collisions is {{to shed light on}} antiproton production in the more complicated collisions between heavy nuclei (A- A). For this reason, this thesis will use the measured target dependence to illuminate issues relating to annihilation of antiprotons in the nuclear medium. It is found that, at 19 GeV/c beam momentum, the ratio of the antiproton invariant multiplicities in lead divided by those in beryllium is less than one and suggests strong antiproton annihilation in the lead target. Furthermore, the target dependence does not disappear as the antiproton's relative momentum with respect to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases,</b> which may suggest that the antiproton often rescatters without annihilating in the heavier target. A simple Glauber model is employed to quantify the absorption in the nucleus. In addition, comparisons will be made with the antiproton production in E 941 's predecessor experiment, E 864. The energy scaling observed by E 941 will assist in the comparison of our data to E 864 and other experiments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractProtein {{transduction}} domains (PTDs) are peptides that {{afford the}} internalization of cargo macromolecules (including plasmid DNA, proteins, liposomes, and nanoparticles). In {{the case of}} polycationic peptides, the efficiency of PTDs to promote cellular uptake {{is directly related to}} their molecular mass or their polyvalent presentation. Similarly, the efficiency of routing to <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases</b> with the number of nuclear localization signals (NLS) associated with a cargo. The quantitative enhancement, however, depends on the identity of the PTD sequence as well as the targeted cell type. Thus the choice and multivalent presentation of PTD and NLS sequences are important criteria guiding the design of macromolecules intended for specific intracellular localization. This review outlines synthetic and recombinant strategies whereby PTDs and signal sequences can be assembled into multivalent peptide dendrimers and promote the uptake and routing of their cargoes. In particular, the tetramerization domain of the tumour suppressor p 53 (p 53 tet) is emerging as a useful scaffold to present multiple routing and targeting moieties. Short cationic peptides fused to the 31 -residue long p 53 tet sequence resulted in tetramers displaying a significant enhancement (up to 1000 fold) in terms of their ability to be imported into cells and delivered to the cell nucleus in relation to their monomeric analogues. The design of future polycationic peptide dendrimers as effective delivering vehicles will need to incorporate selective cell targeting functions and provide solutions to the issue of endosomal entrapment...|$|E

In the cytoplasm E-RAF {{is associated with the}} rough endoplasmic reticulum. In the nucleus it is mainly localized at the interchromatin space, and surrounding the clumps of compact or semi-condensed chromatin. Quantitative analyses show that the abundance of E-RAF in <b>the</b> <b>nucleus</b> <b>increases</b> after ovariectomy and decreases 3 minutes after estradiol administration. These results are in agreement with the currently available bio-chemical data. Double immunolocalizations demonstrate that p 32, p 55, p 60 co-localize with other splicing-related protein. High resolution immunolocalization shows that p 32, p 55, p 60 are associated with perichromatin fibrils (co-tran-scriptional splicing) and with clusters of interchromatin gran-ules (storage of splicing-related molecules). The nuclear abundance of the snRNP complex decreases with ovariecto-my, increases within 3 minutes after estradiol administration and remains higher than that in ovariectomized animals for 27 minutes.
