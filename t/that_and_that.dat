[...] Probably use a lot of that mid-70s material, but not the more ponderous things like 'Warszawa.' I tried <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> was a bit yawn-making.

500|$|Throughout the series, Allen {{refused to}} use Bodyline tactics, and openly said so within the team. His {{attitude}} made him popular with Australian spectators. Jardine twice {{tried to force}} the issue. Before the first Test, he asked Allen to bowl more bouncers with fielders on the leg side; Allen refused, saying {{he did not want}} to play cricket like <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Jardine should leave him out if he was not happy. Prior to the second Test, Jardine again approached Allen and said that Larwood and Voce wanted him to bowl short, and believed that he only refused because he wanted to maintain his popularity. Allen wrote home: [...] "Well, I burst and said a good deal about swollen-headed, gutless, uneducated miners." [...] Allen threatened not to play, and to go home to relate the events of the tour to the press. Jardine did not pursue the matter. Others in the team also opposed Bodyline. The Nawab of Pataudi refused to field in the [...] "leg trap"—the ring of fielders positioned on the leg side to catch deflections from short deliveries—during the first Test. Allen had no compunction fielding there; at short leg he held five catches from Larwood's bowling in the series. Upon his return to England, Allen continued to oppose Bodyline tactics, making his opinion known to senior figures in the MCC, and leading a debate among county representatives which resulted in legislation to ban the tactic after the 1934 season.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a {{research}} {{team led by}} David Burney and Ramilisonina performed interviews in and around Belo sur Mer, including Ambararata and Antsira, to find subfossil megafaunal sites used early in the century by other paleontologists. [...] During carefully controlled interviews, the team recorded stories of recent sightings of dwarf hippos (called kilopilopitsofy) and of a large lemur-like creature known as kidoky; {{a report of the}} interviews was published in 1998 with encouragement from primatologist Alison Jolly and anthropologist Laurie Godfrey. [...] In one interview, an 85-year-old man named Jean Noelson Pascou recounted seeing the rare kidoky up close in 1952. [...] Pascou said that the animal looks similar to a sifaka, but had a human-like face, and was [...] "the size of a seven-year-old girl". It had dark fur and a discernible white spot both on the forehead and below the mouth. [...] According to Pascou, it was a shy animal that fled on the ground instead of in the trees. [...] Burney interpreted the old man as saying that it moved in [...] "a series of leaps", but Godfrey later claimed that [...] "a series of bounds" [...] was a better translation — a description that would closely match the foot anatomy of monkey lemurs, such as Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur. [...] Pascou could also imitate its call, a long single [...] "whoop", and said that kidoky would come closer and continue calling if he imitated the call correctly. [...] The call Pascou imitated was comparable to that of a short call for an indri, which lives {{on the other side of}} Madagascar. [...] When shown a picture of an indri, Pascou said kidoky did not look like <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it had a rounder face, more similar to a sifaka. [...] Pascou also speculated that kidoky could stand on two legs and that it was a solitary animal.|$|E

500|$|In December 1941 and January 1942, Chetniks under Dangić's command co-operated {{with the}} Germans in eastern Bosnia. Between December 1941 and April 1942, Dangić engaged in direct {{negotiations}} with the Germans. During {{the latter half of}} December he met with Abwehr representatives numerous times in an effort to reach an agreement with them. In January 1942, Dangić and other Chetnik leaders met with Renzo Dalmazzo, the commander of the Italian 6th Army Corps. By this time, Dangić's cooperation with the Germans came to be seen as being even more valuable because of the arrival of Tito and his First Proletarian Brigade to eastern Bosnia. The Germans and Croats launched Operation Southeast Croatia on 17 January. Dangić and Todorović advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, or went home. Many withdrew across the Drina river into the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia to avoid being engaged. On 22 January, Dangić ordered his own troops to permit the Germans to pass through Bosnia, saying [...] "they are advancing peacefully and minding their own business without disturbing our unfortunate and long-suffering people." [...] He urged Chetniks and Serbs to annihilate the Ustaše, Croats and Communists. Within a few days, the Germans and Croats succeeded in pushing the Partisans out of eastern Bosnia and southward into the Italian-occupied zone of the NDH. The Chetnik actions in response to Operation Southeast Croatia severely weakened Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. The result was the severing of any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia. In the same month Dangić's staff declared that the Partisans [...] "are led by the Kike Moša Pijade, the Turk Safet Mujić, the Magyar Franjo Vajnert, and that so-and-so Petar Ilić whose real name nobody knows [...] " [...] and announced the shared goal of the Partisans and Ustaše was [...] "to break up and destroy Serbdom. <b>That,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> alone! [...] ". In February, Dangić and other former Royal Yugoslav Army officers re-entered eastern Bosnia from the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, where some of them had withdrawn to avoid Operation Southeast Croatia. They started to re-form Chetnik units in eastern Bosnia and began agitating against the Partisans on a [...] "conservative, Serb-nationalist and anti-Muslim basis." ...|$|E
