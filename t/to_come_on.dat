5|$|By 1968 the Americans {{were well}} aware of the scope and scale of the Cambodian {{logistical}} effort, but still remained reluctant to overtly violate Cambodia's neutrality since the U.S. still hoped to persuade Sihanouk <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> board against the communists. It was also conscious that any overt action might escalate the conflict into the international arena, possibly directly involving the Soviets and/or Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Henry's 2006–07 {{season was}} marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 {{domestic}} appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing {{the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.|$|E

5|$|In late 1962, {{after the}} Cuban Missile Crisis had settled {{well enough to}} permit the {{evacuated}} servicemen's families to return to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was eager to do more for morale there. He asked Perry Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Perry and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when the loved ones began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which {{was seen in the}} US on December 12, 1962, included Como's shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like beard and the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> stage to do the Twist with the lovely ladies who were part of the visiting dance troupe.|$|E
5|$|The {{speech was}} a success and Ingersoll’s {{appellation}} of “plumed knight” remained a nickname for Blaine for years <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> <b>On</b> the first ballot, no candidate received the required majority of 378, but Blaine had the most votes, with 285 and no other candidate had more than 125. There were a few vote shifts {{in the next five}} ballots, and Blaine climbed to 308 votes, with his nearest competitor at just 111. On the seventh ballot the situation shifted drastically as anti-Blaine delegates began to coalesce around Hayes; by the time the balloting ended, Blaine’s votes had risen to 351, but Hayes surpassed him at 384, a majority.|$|E
5|$|However, in an {{unexpected}} return, Cissé was able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> as a 75th-minute substitute {{in the second}} leg of Liverpool's Champions League quarter-final tie with Juventus on 13 April 2005. He went on to score both Liverpool goals in their last Premiership match of the season, a 2–1 win over Aston Villa and also converted a penalty in Liverpool's penalty shootout win over AC Milan in the Champions League final. During the 2005–06 season, Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez deployed Cissé on the right wing on numerous occasions. While his pace made him well suited to such a role, it was doubtful whether he {{would be happy to}} continue in this role rather than in his preferred position as striker. He scored two goals as Liverpool won the 2005 UEFA Super Cup. Cissé also scored Liverpool's opening goal in the 2006 FA Cup Final with a sliding shot past West Ham United keeper Shaka Hislop. Liverpool went on to win 3–1 on penalties. He ended the 05/06 season with 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for {{products}} such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City {{finished}} third in the 2010–11 Premier League, to qualify for the rebranded version of the European Cup, the UEFA Champions League, for the first time. The club's league finish granted direct entry into the group stages without qualification. Their group stage opponents were Bayern Munich, Villarreal and Napoli. City's first group match was at home to Napoli. The Italians took the lead in the second half following a counter-attacking move, but five minutes later Aleksandar Kolarov scored from a free-kick to equalise, and the match finished 1–1. City then lost 2–0 at Bayern Munich, a match most notable for the refusal of Carlos Tevez <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> as substitute, which resulted in an exile from the first team lasting nearly six months. A double-header with Villarreal resulted in two Manchester City wins. Sergio Agüero scored a last-minute winner in the first, which finished 2–1; the second was a comfortable 3–0 victory. A 2–1 defeat at Napoli then took qualification out of Manchester City's hands, and despite a 2–0 win against group winners Bayern Munich, City {{finished third}} in the group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United, this time {{constructed}} from a Giggs break down the left wing, but Van Nistelrooy failed {{in his attempt to}} back-heel Giggs' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted. Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free kick on the left wing; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg, but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide. With a couple of minutes left in the extra period, Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking, but Giggs' cross from the free kick was headed away. Meanwhile, Manchester United's substitute goalkeeper, Howard, was seen warming up behind the goal, suggesting that he was preparing <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> for Carroll {{in the event of a}} penalty shootout; however, no substitution was made.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>on</b> to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

The host also held an exclusive, four-part interview with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. Both interviews drew significant media attention as they were front runners for the 2008 presidential election. In the same election cycle, Ron Paul and O'Reilly got into a testy exchange over the issue of Iran. The 2008 Republican candidate for Vice President, Sarah Palin, and then Democratic Vice President candidate Joe Biden were also invited to the show, but chose not to make an appearance.|$|E

25|$|Cuba {{perceived}} the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions {{on how to}} resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev.
