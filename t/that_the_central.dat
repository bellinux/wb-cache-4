5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> American squirrel monkey {{was just a}} population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the Central American squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Apollo 14 {{had visited}} and sampled a ridge of {{material}} that had been ejected by the impact that created the Mare Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material {{in the region of}} Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would provide an answer.|$|E
5|$|As {{a second}} level {{administrative}} division municipalities are the third tier of public {{administration in the}} Netherlands after the central government and the provinces. The Netherlands is a decentralized unitary state, which means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> government is supreme and delegates certain tasks to lower levels of government by law. The different levels do, however, make work agreements, which give municipalities {{a certain degree of}} independence in their policy decisions. Municipalities are responsible {{for a wide variety of}} public services, which include land-use planning, public housing, management and maintenance of local roads, waste management and social security. After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in 2010 three special municipalities (officially public bodies) were formed. These municipalities function the same as regular municipalities and are grouped together as the Caribbean Netherlands and are not part of a province.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so much larger than the national economy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too great a burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar greying also took place in the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members {{can be explained by the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea that}} Bristol's main {{shopping}} area should be {{moved away from}} the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first proposed to Bristol Corporation's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders' Federation (MTF), representing the larger retailers and chain-stores, in October 1943. They suggested that the pre-war shopping area should be set aside as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> shopping area should be moved to a less-constrained site. This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer's Master Plan of February 1944, which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall, with underground parking for 2,000 cars. The removal of the shopping area was considered desirable because the fire that had destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by its congested nature, and in any case many of the chain-stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites.|$|E
5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E
5|$|Planes {{carrying}} the brigade left England at around 09:45 and arrived over DZ 'X' at 13:00. After an uneventful landing the brigade, once organised, {{set off for}} Arnhem. The 2nd Parachute Battalion followed a southern route along the river Rhine, to the north 3rd Parachute Battalion took the Heelsum-Arnhem road through Oosterbeek, while the 1st Parachute Battalion initially remained in reserve at brigade headquarters. The 2nd Battalion, with 'A' Company leading, came under sporadic fire from pockets of German troops. 'C' Company were directed to capture the Arnhem railway bridge, but it was blown up just as they arrived. Pushing ahead, 'A' Company came under fire from German armoured cars and discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> span of the pontoon bridge was missing. Entering Arnhem as night fell, the leading battalion elements reached the main road bridge at 21:00. Having secured {{the northern end of}} the bridge, attempts to capture the southern end were repulsed and the battalion started to fortify the houses and dig in. Following behind, other units of the brigade started to arrive, including a troop of guns from 1st (Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery, brigade headquarters without the brigadier, part of the 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron, and detachments of Royal Engineers and Royal Army Service Corps men. In total about 500 men were now at the bridge.|$|E

5|$|The Tycho impact, which {{occurred}} between 15–20 and 70–95 million years ago, formed secondary crater clusters in various {{locations of the}} Moon. Data from the examination of these clusters suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> crater cluster in the valley formed {{as a result of}} said impact. Upon analysis of known secondary impact clusters resulting from the Tycho impact, it has been discovered that the majority of them have a downrange ejecta blanket, or debris layer, with a distinctive 'birdsfoot' pattern. Apollo 17 observation data and comparison between the valley's central crater cluster and known Tycho secondary impacts shows many similarities between the two. The central crater cluster has a birdsfoot ejecta pattern that points in the direction of Tycho and the debris pattern of the light mantle points directly towards the South massif. The latter piece of evidence further supports the hypothesis that the light mantle formed {{as a result of an}} avalanche occurring on the aforementioned massif because of secondary Tycho impacts. Large-scale analysis suggests that the crater cluster may be part of a larger secondary cluster of Tycho, including craters on the North massif and other clusters as far north as Littrow crater. If indeed related, the smaller clusters form a large cluster that could be part of a nearby ray of Tycho.|$|E
