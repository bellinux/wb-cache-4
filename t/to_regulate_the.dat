A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones.

5|$|Studies on Drosophila serpins {{reveal that}} Serpin-27A {{inhibits}} the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), {{which results in}} toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In Tenebrio molitor (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions <b>to</b> <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> toll proteolytic cascade.|$|E
5|$|The Senne {{had long}} since lost its {{usefulness}} as a navigable waterway, being replaced by canals, including the Charleroi Canal.

Making matters worse, within the city the river's bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to demographic pressure. The supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded water flow and caused water levels to rise even further, exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste.|$|E
