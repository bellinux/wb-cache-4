5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (<b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> system. The part of <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> inside the crown is <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> and {{periodontal}} ligament have nociceptors (pain receptors), but <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> lacks proprioceptors (motion or position receptors) and mechanoreceptors (mechanical pressure receptors). Consequently, pain {{originating from}} the dentin-pulp complex {{tends to be}} poorly localized, whereas pain from the periodontal ligament will typically be well localized, although not always.|$|E
5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E

In this paper, the poplar Alkaline Peroxide Mechanical Pulp (APMP) pulping {{wastewater}} {{was treated}} by <b>the</b> SBR. <b>The</b> <b>pulping</b> wastewater {{was from the}} processes of washing, soaking and defibrination. The COD of <b>the</b> <b>pulping</b> wastewater was 5671 mg/L and the BOD was 1862 mg/L. The B/C (biological oxygen demand/chemical oxygen demand) ratio of <b>the</b> <b>pulping</b> wastewater was 0. 32, which indicated that the wastewater was suitable to be treated by biological methods. SBR technology was used to treat <b>the</b> <b>pulping</b> wastewater. After a series of experiments, the best conditions for <b>the</b> <b>pulping</b> wastewater was achieved as follows: time 6 hrs, original pH about 8. Under these conditions the removal ratio of COD can reach 81. 4 % and that of BOD can reach 91. 5 %;but the removal ratio of the TSS and the Chromaticity were low, the removal ratio of TSS only reach 31. 8 %...|$|R

Determination of the radioactivity of nitrobenzene oxidation products and sulfuric acid hydrolysates of the newly formed xylem indicated that xylan and pectin were labeled with 3 H and 14 C, respectively. The doubly labeled wood tissue was treated to kraft <b>pulping,</b> and <b>the</b> radioactivity of <b>the</b> <b>pulping</b> black liquor and treated wood tissue were determined at various stages of <b>the</b> <b>pulping</b> to compare <b>the</b> dissolving behavior between pectin and xylan during <b>the</b> <b>pulping.</b> <b>The</b> results showed that pectin was not dissolved as easily as xylan and was not redeposited on <b>pulp</b> fiber at <b>the</b> late stage of <b>the</b> <b>pulping.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} effects of lactoferrin treatment {{on the development}} of erythroleukemia in the spleen of mice infected with Friend virus complex (FVC). Lactoferrin (LF) treatment was carried out in mice for up to 2 weeks at a total dose of 200 micrograms per mouse. The treatment was started at Days 7 and 14 prior to viral infection and Days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 11 after viral infection. Spleens were analyzed 14 days after viral infection. In mice whose treatment was initiated at Days 0 and 1, few leukemic cells were present in the spleen. Most of them appeared in clumps in <b>the</b> red <b>pulp.</b> No leukemic cells were seen in <b>the</b> white <b>pulp.</b> <b>The</b> white <b>pulp</b> was greatly enlarged. In mice whose treatment was initiated at Day 3, leukemic cells began to spread out in <b>the</b> red <b>pulp</b> and encroached upon <b>the</b> white <b>pulp.</b> <b>The</b> white <b>pulp</b> was enlarged and clearly visible. In mice whose treatment was initiated at Days 7 and 11, many leukemic cells were present in <b>the</b> red <b>pulp.</b> <b>The</b> white <b>pulp</b> was infiltrated by leukemic cells and became less discernible. The morphologic features of the spleen in mice whose treatment was initiated at Day 7 or 14 prior to viral infection were similar to those of untreated groups. Leukemic cells not only filled most of the cordal space in <b>the</b> red <b>pulp</b> but also invaded <b>the</b> white <b>pulp.</b> Many leukemic cells were seen in venous sinuses. When infected mice responded to LF treatment, the general architecture of <b>the</b> red <b>pulp</b> remained intact and <b>the</b> white <b>pulp</b> was enlarged but not infiltrated by leukemic cells...|$|R
5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near <b>the</b> <b>pulp,</b> to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis (inflammation of <b>the</b> <b>pulp)</b> can be {{triggered}} by various stimuli (insults), including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial irritants, or rarely barometric changes and ionizing radiation.

The last issue was dated Winter 1955, {{and the title}} was then merged with Startling Stories, another of Pines' science fiction magazines.

5|$|As the {{paperback}} book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction.

Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp.

5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside <b>the</b> <b>pulp</b> chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asian {{traditional}} beliefs, as well {{as traditional}} Chinese medicine, consider the durian fruit to have warming properties liable to cause excessive sweating.
