50|$|The Manunggul Jar {{shows that}} the Filipinos' {{maritime}} culture is paramount that it reflected its ancestors' religious beliefs. Many epics around the Philippines would tell how souls {{go to the next}} life, aboard boats, pass through the rivers and seas. This belief is connected with the Austronesian belief of the anito. The fine lines and intricate designs of the Manunggul Jar reflect the artistry of early Filipinos. These designs are proof of the Filipinos' common heritage from the Austronesian-speaking ancestors despite the diversity of the cultures of the Filipinos. The upper part of the Manunggul jar, as well as the cover, is carved with curvilinear scroll designs which are painted with hematite. The depiction of sea-waves on the lid places this Manunggul jar in the Sa Huỳnh culture pottery tradition. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> migrated in an East to West migration from the Borneo-Palawan area to Southern Vietnam.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2013, DC Comics {{announced}} {{the launch of}} Superman/Wonder Woman in October 2013. The series written by Charles Soule, {{best known for his}} work on Swamp Thing, and drawn by Tony Daniel (Action Comics, Detective Comics) will explore the budding relationship between Superman and Wonder Woman, the DC Universe's most powerful heroes. About the series Soule said, [...] "Obviously, the idea of Superman and Wonder Woman being romantic with each other is not brand new. That concept {{has been around for a}} long time. It was addressed in Kingdom Come, the great Mark Waid book. Most recently, in Justice League #12 (October 2012), they had the kiss heard 'round the world... They're arguably two of the most powerful beings in the whole DC Universe and they're romantic together so just imagine the adventures and excitement that can come from that." [...] Regarding the dynamic of the characters Soule said, [...] "Frankly, <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> have a lot in common. There are maybe 100 people on the planet that can fly, and two of them are Wonder Woman and Superman. At the same time, they grew up in very, very different cultures and situations. They have extraordinarily different backgrounds and there is a lot that they have to learn about each other too." [...] Soule continued, [...] "One of things that I would like to do is have the way they approach battles grow over time as they get to know each other better so that fights become more coordinated. Wonder Woman has the background as a warrior dating back to when she was very little. Ares, in the New 52, was her warrior teacher when she was 12. She has a strategic, practical approach to battles where Superman, it's not like he rushes in guns-a-blazing, but he has a slightly less schooled approach to his attack." ...|$|E

60|$|My Lords, <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> {{ought to}} have been treated with a little decorum. When we {{consider}} the high rank of their husbands, their fathers, and their children, a rank so high that we have nothing in Great Britain to compare with theirs, we cannot be surprised that they were left in possession of great revenues, great landed estates, and great moneyed property. All the female parts of these families, whose alliance was, doubtless, much courted, could not be proffered in marriage, and endowed in a manner agreeably to the dignity of such persons, but with great sums of money; and your Lordships must also consider the multitude of children of which these families frequently consisted. The consequences of this robbery were such as might naturally be expected. It is said that not one of the females of this family has since been given in marriage.|$|R
40|$|Guardianship-and-administration tribunals {{are bound}} to hold as {{paramount}} {{the best interests of}} people who commonly are among the most vulnerable and dependent among us. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are not able to make reasonable decisions for themselves by reason of a disability. Guardianship tribunals often appoint as guardians and administrators citizens who freely give of themselves in roles of decision-makers and advocates. These citizens frequently do so for extended periods of time, often involving a close, positive relationship with the person they represent. The transforming power of such protective and enabling relationships upon the disabling effects of impairment is well documented. Using Joan Tronto’s concept of ‘care ’ I will reflect upon the nature and value of this potential in organisational functioning and structure of guardianship tribunals. I like the quote on the Center for Therapeutic Justice’s website, attributed to lawyer and philosopher Sir Francis Bacon. It states: If we are to achieve results never before accomplished, we must employ methods never before attempted. I like it because generally I believe that we are at another juncture in huma...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{practical}} impossibility in ‘objectively’ describing the complex layering of migration and reception, both of which collide against the walls of memories, traumas and socio-political realities. These complex interactions are based on processes of cultural mythologies’ sedimentations, differentiations and negotiations of the dramas of people’s journeys of survival and arrival. In particular, when the issue of migration is not explored through local realities imbued of emotive connections, but dissected via the detached logic of positivism or {{what has been called}} ‘the cold heart of Europe’ that beats for an even colder capitalistic brain, what is offered for analysis are a series of desensitized and clinically sterilized data that can be interpreted, manipulated and subjugated to the multiple needs of the EU’s body politic. If the EU represents the reconciliatory nature and softness of power of an incongruous group of 28 states, the Mediterranean – in this instance – acts as the mirror which reflects that image, revealing its cracks, possible future conflicts and the sum of traumas which pit one ‘kind’ of humanity versus another via a series of linguistic qualifiers that place people outside the lines of legality and the borders of national states. Outside these lines there are the stories of migrants left to die in the cold waters of the Mediterranean, trapped in the byzantine bureaucracy of contradictory national legal systems, abandoned to waste away in centers that have very little in common with places of hospitality and refuge but share much more with prisons. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> are ditched beyond the lines of acceptance and cast as unrecognizable and stateless beings with no human status. An emotive anthropological methodology could perhaps assist in understanding the paraphernalia of power that sell this drama with false commotion and circumstantial platitudes, continuing to defend the logic of both money and power. The essay will argue that contemporary remnants of ancient Mediterranean rituals could be used to bring back the ‘human,’ at a personal level, rejecting the positivist rationale of a European Union that excludes migrants from the ranks of beings worth saving through brutal force, omission and silence...|$|E
50|$|The most {{publicly}} known sexual {{literature of}} India are {{the texts of}} the Kama Sutra. <b>These</b> texts <b>were</b> written for and kept by the philosopher, warrior and nobility castes, their servants and concubines, and those in certain religious orders. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> could also read and write and had instruction and education.

There are many {{different versions of the}} arts which began in Sanskrit and were translated into other languages, such as Persian or Tibetan. Many of the original texts are missing and the only clue to their existence is in other texts. Kama Sutra, the version by Vatsyayana, is one of the well-known survivors and was first translated into English by Sir Richard Burton and F. F. Arbuthnot. The Kama Sutra is now perhaps the most widely read secular text in the world. It details ways in which partners should pleasure each other within a marital relationship.|$|R

There are commonwealths, plainly to be distinguished here and there in history, which pass from prosperity to squalor, or from glory to insignificance, or from freedom to slavery, not only in silence, but with serenity.
