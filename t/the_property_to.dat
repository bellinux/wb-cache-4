5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds for a down payment on the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to digital cinema.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E

However, after less than three years into the 52-year contracts, CNL terminated their agreements with PARC Management in November 2010.

5|$|The {{shareholders}} {{decided to}} open the property year-round; it had only previously opened for the summer season.

5|$|After leasing it to Warner {{for four}} years, Sinatra sought to sell <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> Howard Hughes in 1967 {{as part of}} the renewal of his {{contract}} at the Sands Hotel and Casino. Following a fallout between Hughes and Sinatra, the entertainer instead signed a contract with Caesars Palace. This included a requirement for Sinatra's stake in Cal Neva to be purchased by his new employer for $2 million, but instead the lodge passed {{into the hands of the}} same owners as Reno's Club Cal-Neva in 1968 for $1.4 million.|$|E

5|$|Although Hogg spent {{little time}} at the Varner {{plantation}} after Bayou Bend was constructed, she continued to purchase art and antique furniture on its behalf. In the 1950s, she restored the plantation, and each room was given a different theme from Texas history: colonial times, the Confederacy, Napoleonic times (1818), and the Mexican–American War. One room was dedicated to her father, and contained his desk and chair {{as well as his}} collection of walking sticks. She donated <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> the state, and it was dedicated as the Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site in 1958, the 107th anniversary of Jim Hogg's birth.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{taken in}} 1634 after Zouche's death listed the library as having 250 {{books and a}} collection of mathematical instruments, and revealed that the maids' chamber was of a very high standard. James Zouch, grandson of Edward la Zouche, sold <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>to</b> the Earl of Antrim in 1637, at which time the house's furniture was valued at £2,762. During the reign of Charles I, the house was partly destroyed by a fire. On 25 June 1640, Lord Antrim sold Bramshill for £9,500 to Sir Robert Henley.
