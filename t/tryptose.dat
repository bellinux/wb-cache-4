This study was undertaken to determine whether F. necrophorum enhanced the in vitro growth of B. intermedius. <b>Tryptose</b> phosphate broth {{did not support the}} growth of B. intermedius alone, but the bacterium did survive in a <b>tryptose</b> phosphate broth culture of F. necrophorum. B. intermedius cultured in F. necrophorum-conditioned <b>tryptose</b> phosphate broth grew impressively, reaching maximal absorbance at 24 h after inoculation. The growth of B. intermedius in F. necrophorum-conditioned <b>tryptose</b> phosphate broth was proportional to the amount of conditioned medium present. The B. intermedius growth-stimulating factor was detectable in conditioned medium 8 h after inoculation with F. necrophorum and could be detected throughout the 96 -h incubation period. Growth-factor-active fractions eluted from a Sephadex G- 100 column did not absorb at 280 nm and were retained on the column until 4 column volumes were eluted. The growth factor was nondialyzable and stable to boiling, lyophilization, extraction with hot aqueous phenol, and trypsin digestion. The factor was inactivated by exposure to pH 2. 0 in the pepsin digestion protocol. Significant amounts of hexose, methyl pentose, and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate were detected in pooled growth-factor-active fractions eluted from the Sephadex column.

Field isolates were tested only on media containing i-erythritol, rifampicin and thionin. Furthermore, each suspension was also inoculated on <b>tryptose</b> agar incubated in air, to test its ability to grow without CO 2. Sensitivity to fuchsin was similar among reference strains evaluated. Growth of S 19, 544 and 2308 but not RB 51 were inhibited on media containing rifampicin. Medium with safranin O showed no inhibition for RB 51, 544 and 2308, but it partially inhibited the S 19 growth as well as medium containing i-erythritol. Treatment/control growth ratio for 2308 on <b>tryptose</b> agar containing thionin (2. 5 &# 956;g/mL) was approximatelly 1. 0, whereas S 19 and RB 51 showed 0. 85 and 0. 89 ratios, respectively.
