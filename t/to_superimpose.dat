5|$|A second movie, titled Terry, {{focused on}} the Marathon of Hope, was {{produced}} by the CTV Television Network in 2005. Fox was portrayed by Shawn Ashmore. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used <b>to</b> <b>superimpose</b> a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie. Canadian National Basketball Association star Steve Nash, who himself was inspired by Fox {{when he was a}} child, directed a 2010 documentary Into the Wind, which aired on ESPN as part of its 30 for 30 series.|$|E

25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} sonar readings, the {{floodlit}} camera obtained {{a pair of}} underwater photographs. Both depicted {{what appeared to be}} a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and retouched from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were retouched <b>to</b> <b>superimpose</b> the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. No one is sure how the originals were altered.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, aerial photography, {{satellite}} imagery, {{and remote}} sensing provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. Advancements in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography. Ready availability {{of computers and}} peripherals such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability <b>to</b> <b>superimpose</b> spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials.

50|$|Waveform {{distortion}} can be mathematically analysed to {{show that}} it is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>superimposing</b> additional frequency components onto a pure sinewave.

25|$|Border Memorial: Frontera de los Muertos is an {{augmented}} reality public art project and memorial, {{dedicated to the}} thousands of migrant workers who have died along the U.S./Mexico border in recent years trying to cross the desert southwest in search of work and a better life. Built for smartphone mobile devices, this project allows people to visualize the scope of the loss of life by marking each location where human remains have been recovered with a virtual object or augmentation. The public can simply download and launch a mobile application and aim their devices’ cameras at the landscape along the border and the surrounding desert. The application uses geolocation software <b>to</b> <b>superimpose</b> individual augments at the precise GPS coordinates of each recorded death, enabling the public to see the objects integrated into the physical location as if they existed in the real world.|$|E

The optical printer improved {{some of the}} deep focus shots. One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive graininess, such as the optical zoom out of the snow globe. Welles decided <b>to</b> <b>superimpose</b> snow falling to mask the graininess in these shots. Toland said that he disliked {{the results of the}} optical printer, but acknowledged that [...] "RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production—a by no means inconsiderable assignment—with ability and fine understanding." ...|$|E

50|$|Otomycosis is a fungal ear infection, a {{superficial}} mycotic {{infection of the}} outer ear canal. It {{is more common in}} the tropical countries.

Suppuration can occur due <b>to</b> <b>superimposed</b> bacterial infection commonly due to pseudomonas species and proteus species. The mycosis results in inflammation, superficial epithelial exfoliation, masses of debris containing hyphae, suppuration, and pain.|$|R

40|$|The {{prediction}} formulas for {{the increase}} of creep due <b>to</b> <b>superimposing</b> a cyclic load upon a static load are derived and verified by six different data sets. Cyclic load effects upon both basic creep and drying creep are analyzed. The nonlinear dependence of uniaxial static (non-cyclic) creep upon stress is also quantified. The creep increase due <b>to</b> <b>superimposed</b> cyclic load is understood as the increase beyond the static creep that corresponds to the mean stress rather than the maximum stress. This appears to make the previously uncorrelated measurements of cyclic basic and drying creeps mutually consistent. It is found that load cycling accelerates only the basic creep but not " the additional creep due to simultaneous drying. Since cyclic creep is necessarily a nonlinear phenomenon, a simple description of the nonlinear dependence of creep on stress is also given. Finally, the coefficients of variation of the deviations of formula predictions from the test data are evaluated (for all 80 data sets considered in this six-part study) and the average coefficients of variation to be expected in the predictions are indicated. They are overall much lower than those for the current formulations of CEB-FIP Model Code and ACI Committee 209...|$|R

2500|$|In 2008 a new English {{translation}} {{was published}} by Penguin Classics in three volumes. It is translated by Malcolm C. Lyons and Ursula Lyons with introduction and annotations by Robert Irwin. This is the first complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) since Burton's. It contains, {{in addition to the}} standard text of 1001 Nights, the so-called [...] "orphan stories" [...] of Aladdin and Ali Baba as well as an alternative ending to The seventh journey of Sindbad from Antoine Galland's original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, [...] "o attempt has been made <b>to</b> <b>superimpose</b> on the translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text," [...] and the work is a [...] "representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye". The Lyons translation includes all the poetry (in plain prose paraphrase) but does not attempt to reproduce in English the internal rhyming of some prose sections of the original Arabic. Moreover, it streamlines somewhat and has cuts. In this sense it is not, as claimed, a complete translation.|$|E
2500|$|Arne De Boever {{believes}} {{that there is a}} [...] "close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh in No Country for Old Men [...] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice {{at the beginning of the}} film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were <b>to</b> <b>superimpose</b> these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk from the bottle that stands sweating on the living room table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both." ...|$|E
