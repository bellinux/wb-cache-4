5|$|Syphilis is most {{commonly}} spread through sexual activity. It {{may also be}} transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth, resulting in congenital syphilis. Other human diseases caused by related <b>Treponema</b> pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant women be tested.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{was known}} {{in the nineteenth century}} that {{bacteria}} are the cause of many diseases, no effective antibacterial treatments were available. In 1910, Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic, by changing dyes that selectively stained <b>Treponema</b> pallidum—the spirochaete that causes syphilis—into compounds that selectively killed the pathogen. Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on immunology, and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria, with his work being the basis of the Gram stain and the Ziehl–Neelsen stain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as <b>Treponema</b> pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by quinine. By accurately controlling the fever with quinine, the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950. Wagner-Jauregg was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the therapeutic value of malaria inoculation {{in the treatment of}} dementia paralytica.|$|E
25|$|<b>Treponema</b> is {{converted}} into treponeme and the plural is treponemes and not treponemata.|$|E
25|$|<b>Treponema</b> pallidum pertenue, a {{bacterium}} which causes the disease yaws, {{is in the}} process of being eradicated.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic {{species of}} {{bacteria}} Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, <b>Treponema</b> denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium sp. {{have all been}} implicated in chronic periodontitis.|$|E
25|$|Noguchi's {{most famous}} {{contribution}} is his {{identification of the}} causative agent of syphilis (the bacteria <b>Treponema</b> pallidum) in the brain tissues of patients suffering from partial paralysis due to meningoencephalitis. Other lasting contributions {{include the use of}} snake venom in serums, the identification of the leishmaniasis pathogen and of Carrion's disease with Oroya fever. His claim to have grown a culture of syphilis has proven irreproducible.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{infectious}} diseases can be transmitted either congenitally (before or at birth), and can cause serious neurodevelopmental problems, as for example the viruses HSV, CMV, rubella (congenital rubella syndrome), Zika virus, or bacteria like <b>Treponema</b> pallidum in congenital syphilis, which may progress to neurosyphilis if it remains untreated. Protozoa like Plasmodium or Toxoplasma which can cause congenital toxoplasmosis with multiple cysts {{in the brain and}} other organs, leading to a variety of neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{dermatitis}} {{is caused}} by the bacteria from the genus <b>Treponema.</b> It differs from foot rot and can appear under unsanitary conditions such as poor hygiene or inadequate hoof trimming, among other causes. It primarily affects dairy cattle and has been known to lower the quantity of milk produced, however the milk quality remains unaffected. Cattle are also susceptible to ringworm caused by the fungus, Trichophyton verrucosum, a contagious skin disease which may be transferred to humans exposed to infected cows.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{infection}} of the liver commonly results in pyogenic liver abscesses, acute hepatitis, or granulomatous (or chronic) liver disease. Pyogenic abscesses commonly involve enteric bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and are composed of multiple bacteria up to 50% of the time. Acute hepatitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Bartonella henselae, Borrelia burgdorferi, salmonella species, brucella species and campylobacter species. Chronic or granulomatous hepatitis is seen with infection from mycobacteria species, Tropheryma whipplei, <b>Treponema</b> pallidum, Coxiella burnetii, and rickettsia species.|$|E
25|$|Syphilis (caused by {{infection}} with <b>Treponema</b> pallidum) is passed {{from person to}} person through direct contact with a syphilis sore; these occur mainly on the external genitals, or in the vagina, anus, or rectum. Sores also can occur on the lips and in the mouth. Transmission of the organism occurs during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. In 2006, 64% of the reported cases in the United States were among {{men who have sex with}} men. This is consistent with a rise in the incidence of syphilis among MSM in other developed nations, attributed by Australian and UK authors to increased rates of unprotected sex among MSM.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} that all donated blood {{be tested for}} transfusion transmissible infections. These include HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, <b>Treponema</b> pallidum (syphilis) and, where relevant, other infections that pose a risk {{to the safety of}} the blood supply, such as Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) and Plasmodium species (malaria). According to the WHO, 25 countries are not able to screen all donated blood for one or more of: HIV; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; or syphilis. One of the main reasons for this is because testing kits are not always available. However the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted infections is much higher in low income countries compared to middle and high income countries.|$|E
25|$|Many {{bacteria}} are parasitic, though since {{the result is}} infection and disease, sometimes leading to death, they are generally thought of as pathogens instead. Parasitic {{bacteria are}} extremely diverse, and infect their hosts {{by a variety of}} routes. To give a few examples, Bacillus anthracis, the cause of anthrax, is spread by contact with infected domestic animals; the bacillus's spores, which can survive for years outside the body, can enter a host through an abrasion or may be inhaled. Borrelia, the cause of Lyme disease and relapsing fever, is transmitted by a vector, ticks of the genus Ixodes, from the diseases' reservoirs in animals such as deer. Campylobacter jejuni, a cause of severe enteritis (gut inflammation), is spread by the fecal-oral route from animals, or by eating insufficiently cooked poultry, or by contaminated water. Haemophilus influenzae, an agent of bacterial meningitis and respiratory tract infections such as influenza and bronchitis, is transmitted by droplet contact. <b>Treponema</b> pallidum, the cause of syphilis, is spread by sexual intercourse.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and <b>Treponema</b> pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions.|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} ways {{bacteria}} avoid contact with phagocytes. First, they can grow in sites that phagocytes are not capable of traveling to (e.g., the surface of unbroken skin). Second, bacteria can suppress the inflammatory response; without this response to infection phagocytes cannot respond adequately. Third, some species of bacteria can inhibit the ability of phagocytes {{to travel to the}} site of infection by interfering with chemotaxis. Fourth, some bacteria can avoid contact with phagocytes by tricking the immune system into [...] "thinking" [...] that the bacteria are [...] "self". <b>Treponema</b> pallidum—the bacterium that causes syphilis—hides from phagocytes by coating its surface with fibronectin, which is [...] produced naturally by the body and plays a crucial role in wound healing.|$|E
500|$|Syphilis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium <b>Treponema</b> pallidum subspecies pallidum. The {{signs and symptoms of}} syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The primary stage classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as [...] "the great imitator" [...] as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.|$|E
2500|$|In 1913, Noguchi {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of}} <b>Treponema</b> pallidum (syphilitic spirochete) in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, proving that the spirochete {{was the cause of}} the disease. [...] Dr. Noguchi's name is remembered in the binomial attached to another spirochete, Leptospira noguchii.|$|E
2500|$|Many infections {{can cause}} oral {{ulceration}} (see table). The most common are {{herpes simplex virus}} (herpes labialis, primary herpetic gingivostomatitis), varicella zoster (chicken pox, shingles), and coxsackie A virus (hand, foot and mouth disease). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) creates immunodeficiencies which allow opportunistic infections or neoplasms to proliferate. Bacterial processes leading to ulceration {{can be caused by}} [...] Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis) and <b>Treponema</b> pallidum (syphilis).|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{relationship}} between syphilis {{and the two}} types of pupils (AR pupils and tonic pupils) is not known at the present time. [...] The older literature on AR pupils did not report the details of pupillary constriction (brisk vs. tonic) that are necessary to distinguish AR pupils from tonic pupils. Tonic pupils can occur in neurosyphilis. [...] It is not known whether neurosyphilis itself (infection by <b>Treponema</b> pallidum) can cause tonic pupils, or whether tonic pupils in syphilis simply reflect a coexisting peripheral neuropathy.|$|E
2500|$|Ferdinand Cohn [...] {{recognized}} 4 tribes: Spherobacteria, Microbacteria, Desmobacteria, and Spirobacteria. Stanier and van Neil [...] {{recognized the}} Kingdom Monera with 2 phyla, Myxophyta and Schizomycetae, the latter comprising classes Eubacteriae (3 orders), Myxobacteriae (1 order), and Spirochetae (1 order). Bisset [...] distinguished 1 class and 4 orders: Eubacteriales, Actinomycetales, Streptomycetales, and Flexibacteriales. Migula, {{which was the}} most widely accepted system of its time and included all then-known species but was based only on morphology, contained the 3 basic groups, Coccaceae, Bacillaceae, and Spirillaceae but also Trichobacterinae for filamentous bacteria; Orla-Jensen [...] established 2 orders: Cephalotrichinae (7 families) and Peritrichinae (presumably with only 1 family). Bergey et al [...] presented a classification which generally followed the 1920 Final Report of the SAB(Society of American Bacteriologists) Committee ( [...] Winslow et al), which divided Class Schizomycetes into 4 orders: Myxobacteriales, Thiobacteriales, Chlamydobacteriales, and Eubacteriales, with a 5th group being 4 genera considered intermediate between bacteria and protozoans: Spirocheta, Cristospira, Saprospira, and <b>Treponema.</b>|$|E
