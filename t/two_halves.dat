5|$|Richmond Bridge is an 18th-century stone {{arch bridge}} that crosses the River Thames at Richmond, {{connecting}} the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of the present-day London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It {{was designed by}} James Paine and Kenton Couse.|$|E
5|$|The 1981 Major League Baseball strike {{caused the}} season to split into <b>two</b> <b>halves.</b> This caused Major League Baseball to hold the Divisional Series so that the first- and second-half champions could play each other to {{determine}} playoff spots for the NLCS and World Series.|$|E

5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Road {{was divided}} into <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> in 1969 by the {{construction}} of Princess Road. A footbridge was subsequently constructed, crossing Princess Road {{at the same place}} as the road previously ran. As part of the regeneration of the Hulme district, it was decided to construct a new bridge to rejoin the two sections of the road, and also to provide a local landmark.|$|E

5|$|The 1981 Major League Baseball strike {{caused the}} season to be split into <b>two</b> <b>halves.</b> The Mets {{finished}} with a 17–34 record {{in the first half}} of the season, and a fifth-place finish in the National League East.

5|$|The 1981 Major League Baseball strike {{caused the}} season to be split into <b>two</b> <b>halves.</b> The Yankees were given a berth in an {{expanded}} playoff tournament because they led the American League East when the strike began.

5|$|This {{station is}} unusual in that its {{mezzanine}} is split in <b>two</b> <b>halves.</b> This is because at this location, Union Turnpike and the Jackie Robinson Parkway cross under Queens Boulevard but over the Queens Boulevard Line tracks; the mezzanine is {{at the level of}} Union Turnpike, one half on either side, with no connection between the two outside of fare control.|$|E

50|$|The CFL {{adopted a}} regular season {{overtime}} format that {{will consist of}} two-minute halves (no sudden death), which will be implemented for the 1986 season.

5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of the island.|$|E
5|$|Indoor soccer {{features}} {{six players}} per team {{as opposed to}} the standard eleven, and is played without an offside rule on an artificial field of play. The pitch is far smaller than that used in regular soccer, with a regulation size of 200 feet by 85 feet, identical to a North American ice hockey rink. The goals and penalty areas are also scaled down. Instead of <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of 45 minutes each, matches are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's main {{newspapers}} {{are owned by}} the government and political parties in the ruling coalition, although some major opposition parties also have their own, which are openly sold alongside regular newspapers. A divide exists between the media in the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of the country. Peninsular-based media gives low priority to news from the East, and often treats the eastern states as colonies of the Peninsula. The media have been blamed for increasing tension between Indonesia and Malaysia, and giving Malaysians a bad image of Indonesians. The country has Malay, English, Chinese, and Tamil dailies.|$|E
5|$|The crests of Corythosaurus {{resemble}} {{that of a}} cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They {{are formed}} {{by a combination of}} the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of the crest are separated by a median suture. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the late}} Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphs, the {{frontier}} between Byzantium and the Caliphate became stabilized {{along the line}} of the Taurus-Antitaurus mountain ranges. On the Arab side, Cilicia was permanently occupied and its deserted cities, such as Adana, Mopsuestia (al-Massisa) and, most importantly, Tarsus, were refortified and resettled under the early Abbasids. Likewise, in Upper Mesopotamia, places like Germanikeia (Mar'ash), Hadath and Melitene (Malatya) became major military centers. These two regions came to form the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of a new fortified frontier zone, the thughur.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> of the History means they cannot have been written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|On this planet, {{magic and}} {{witchcraft}} are quite normal. The Megans are an ageless species that had, at one time, lived on Earth, and {{were responsible for}} the legends about witches. During this time, the Enterprise crew begin to experiment with magic: Lt. Hikaru Sulu (voiced by George Takei) conjures up a beautiful woman while Science Officer Spock (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) telepathically moves a Vulcan chess piece. Lucien, their guide, warns the crew that their experiments would draw unwanted attention, but it is too late. The Enterprise splits into <b>two</b> <b>halves</b> and disappears, and the crew are transported to a location on the planet that appears to be Salem during the middle of a witch trial in 1691.|$|E
