The site of the former station buildings is now the main monastery building, while the platform itself remains intact and now marks the boundary of the monastic enclosure.|$|E

5|$|Although historians {{differ in}} their {{opinions}} about his relationship, if any, to Kings Edgar the Peaceable and Edward <b>the</b> <b>Martyr,</b> it is generally thought that he enjoyed {{a good relationship with}} King Æthelred II. His daughter Ælfgifu married Æthelred. Thored was ealdorman in Northumbria for much of his reign, disappearing from the sources in 992 after being appointed by Æthelred to lead an expedition against the Vikings.|$|E

5|$|Edward <b>the</b> <b>Martyr</b> (Old English: Eadweard; 18 March 978) was King of England from 975 {{until he}} was murdered in 978. Edward was the eldest son of King Edgar the Peaceful but was not his father's {{acknowledged}} heir. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and others supporting his much younger half-brother Æthelred the Unready, recognized as a legitimate son of Edgar. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|In 975, {{not long}} after the death of King Edgar, Oslac was banished from England. No reason is given by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles report of his expulsion. Version C of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{describes}} the events thus:The valiant Oslac was driven from the country, over the tossing waves, the gannet's bath, the tumult of the waters, the homeland of the whale; a grey-haired man, wise and skilled in speech, he was bereft of his lands The historian Richard Fletcher guesses that Oslac's downfall may have been the result of opposing the succession of Edward <b>the</b> <b>Martyr.</b>|$|E
5|$|In time, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was victorious {{and placed}} the relics in a church in Brookwood Cemetery in Woking, with the enshrinement {{ceremony}} occurring in September 1984.

5|$|The {{history of}} the Lords of the Manor of Aldermaston Court {{can be traced to}} Achard D'Aldermaston, who was born in 1036. Six {{families}} have had lordship of the Aldermaston estate. In the 11th century, Henry I gave Aldermaston to Robert Achard (or Hachard) of Sparsholt. In the mid-12th century, the Achard family founded the church of St Mary the Virgin. In 1292, Edward I granted the right for the lord of the manor to hold a market in the village. Another charter was granted by Henry IV, with evidence that the market existed until approximately 1900. The Achards also established an annual fair to observe the feast of St. Thomas <b>the</b> <b>Martyr</b> on 7 July.|$|E
5|$|Thored's {{governorship}} as ealdorman, {{based on}} charter attestations, cannot be securely dated before 979. He did attest royal charters {{during the reign}} of Æthelred II, the first in 979, six in 983, one in 984, three in 985, one in 988, appearing in such attestations for the last time in 989. It is possible that such appearances represent more than one Thored, though that is not a generally accepted theory. His definite predecessor, Oslac, was expelled from England in 975. The historian Richard Fletcher thought that Oslac's downfall may have been the result of opposing the succession of Edward <b>the</b> <b>Martyr,</b> enemy and brother of Æthelred II.|$|E
5|$|Ælfric's {{appointment}} to Canterbury caused consternation with the clergy {{of the cathedral}} chapter. In reaction, the chapter sent two members to Rome ahead of Ælfric and tried to secure the archbishopric for either of the monks. Pope Gregory V, however, would not appoint a candidate without royal permission, which neither of the monks had. Instead, when Ælfric arrived in Rome in 997, he was appointed and received the pallium, a symbol of an archbishop's authority. He also witnessed some miracles at the gravesite of Edward <b>the</b> <b>Martyr</b> at Shaftesbury Abbey, helping to lead to Edward's sainthood.|$|E

5|$|A {{month after}} the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted {{in the ranks of}} those who fought against the {{military}} uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, a representative of the pro-independence political party. He was dubbed <b>the</b> <b>martyr</b> of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.|$|E
5|$|In 972 Oswald {{was made}} Archbishop of York and journeyed to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium from Pope John XIII. It is {{possible}} that he also traveled on Edgar's behalf {{to the court of}} the Emperor Otto I, and that these two journeys had been combined. He continued to hold the see of Worcester in addition to York. The holding of Worcester in addition to York became traditional for almost the next fifty years. Although it was uncanonical, it had many advantages for York in that it added a much richer diocese to their holdings, and one which was more peaceful as well. When Edgar died in 975, Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, broke up many monastic communities, some of which were Oswald's foundations. Ramsey, however, was not disturbed, probably due to the patronage of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, son of Æthelstan Half-King. Ælfhere was a supporter of Ethelred the Unready, the son of Edgar's third marriage, while Oswald supported the son of Edgar's first marriage, Edward <b>the</b> <b>Martyr,</b> in the dispute over who would succeed King Edgar.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 16–17 April 1941, the London {{terminus}} was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable. Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery, the London Necropolis Railway was never used again. Soon {{after the end of}} the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space, and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed. The part of the London building which housed the LNC's offices survives today. The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished. The site of the northern station, serving the Nonconformist cemetery, is now heavily overgrown. The site of the southern, Anglican, station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward <b>the</b> <b>Martyr,</b> which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels.|$|E
