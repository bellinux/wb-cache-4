500|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Bell stated on the {{way that}} the season had tied in with the films, [...] "we got to be our own show and <b>tell</b> <b>our</b> own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are {{incumbent}} upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us." ...|$|E
500|$|On the season's {{potential}} for crossover {{with the rest}} of the MCU, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "I think [...] year worked really well—we got to be our own show and <b>tell</b> <b>our</b> own stories in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and do a nice hand off or a tie-in, but neither are incumbent upon the other to be a follow, and I think that's a great model for us. Ant-Man comes out this summer and will have come and gone before we air again in September, so whether there's anything vestigial from that or for [...] next season is to be determined. But we're in contact with the movie people and them with us, and any time we can put little easter eggs in, it's a lot of fun for die-hard fans." [...] Bell also stated that there was a possibility of Hayley Atwell once again reprising her role as Peggy Carter in the season for an Agent Carter crossover, and after the series acknowledged the character's death in Civil War, added, [...] "Any time we can make a connection to her, whether in a flashback or dealing with what’s happening now, it makes the universe smaller." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to <b>tell</b> <b>our</b> complete story." ...|$|E
500|$|Derrickson and Marvel had {{originally}} discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel {{felt that they}} would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer, with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead. Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started [...] "pestering" [...] Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked [...] "all afternoon, and the fit was right", but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not [...] "take that answer. Call them back, tell them there’s a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room", and after talking with Marvel for [...] "another three or four hours" [...] he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film. Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a [...] "fully-formed" [...] sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that [...] "the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell that story, and <b>tell</b> <b>our</b> best version of it." [...] Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as [...] "little things" [...] from Spaihts, [...] "like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple." [...] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of [...] "nightmares themselves as being a dimension", but Feige felt [...] "getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension" [...] would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, [...] "the most present villain in the comics", became the film's main villain.|$|E

2500|$|On October 23, 2007, Romanian President Traian Băsescu {{publicly}} {{apologized for}} his nation's {{role in the}} Porajmos, {{the first time a}} Romanian leader has done so. He called for the Porajmos to be taught in schools, stating that, [...] "We must <b>tell</b> <b>our</b> children that six decades ago children like them were sent by the Romanian state to die of hunger and cold". Part of his apology was expressed in the Romani language. Băsescu awarded three Porajmos survivors with an Order for Faithful Services. Before recognizing Romania's role in the Porajmos, Traian Băsescu was widely quoted after an incident on 19 May 2007, in which he insulted a journalist by calling her a [...] "stinky gypsy".

"See the outings of {{the tyrant}} [...] among silent crowds with eyes {{sparkling}} [...] {{and yet the}} next day journals announce that the sovereign was acclaimed… No book can be published without reaching the tyrant.

Raise not your voice, or else a will spy betray you, a plain clothes man will arrest you, a gendarme or a butcher will beat you up savagely, and occasionally, in the Police cellars, your head will be crushed or put up against the wall.

[...] or [...] "let's <b>tell</b> <b>our</b> friends from (visiting team name) the real forecast..." [...] If rain is actually falling before the game, Essig will often dismiss it as [...] "a light drizzle", or [...] "liquid sunshine" [...] but not actual rain by Oregon standards.

Culeman-Beckman said Jacob Bernstein, the son of Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron, had told him the name at summer camp in 1988, and that Jacob claimed he had been told by his father. Felt denied the identification to the Courant saying [...] "No, it's not me. I would have done better. I would have been more effective.
