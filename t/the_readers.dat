5|$|The English Civil War {{marked the}} end of legal {{education}} at the Inns, and the class of Readers went into decline. The last Readers were appointed in 1677, and the position of <b>the</b> <b>Readers</b> as heads of the Inn and members of Pension was taken by the Benchers.|$|E
5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn <b>the</b> <b>Readers,</b> when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only <b>the</b> <b>Readers</b> would be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to help <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> {{understand}} who are the governing bodies, what legislation applies, and what the strategic impacts of that legislation are on the salmon farming industry in British Columbia. First, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is presented with a history of the salmon farming industry, which allows <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> to appreciate why the legal context is so important to the salmon farming industry. Second, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is presented with a summary of the applicable statutes and regulations to salmon farming in British Columbia. Third, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is presented with a discussion on some of the issues, threats, and opportunities for salmon farm operators. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is presented with an integrative summary analysis. This identifies by grouplinterest, the key players in the regulation of salmon farming to help <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> understand <b>the</b> competing perspectives on salmon farming...|$|R
5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

5|$|In late 1978, Guccione {{shut down}} the {{unprofitable}} magazine. Wintour decided {{to take some time}} off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York. She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as fashion editor for a new women's magazine named Savvy.

50|$|Bringhurst {{describes}} a book page as a tangible proportion, which {{together with the}} textblock produce an antiphonal geometry, which has the capability to bind <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> to <b>the</b> book, or conversely put <b>the</b> <b>reader's</b> nerve on edge or drive <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> away.|$|R
25|$|Sensation is used {{to portray}} a character's perceptions. It can help draw <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> in by {{conveying}} the actual sensations of things comprising the story, breathing life into its physical world. Since <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> has experienced {{only a portion of}} the sensations experienced by the character, the author aims to either provoke recall from <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> or convey <b>the</b> experience, drawing <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> in and maintaining interest in the story.|$|R
25|$|Signaling between <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> and <b>the</b> tag is done {{in several}} {{different}} incompatible ways, depending on the frequency band used by the tag. Tags operating on LF and HF bands are, in terms of radio wavelength, very close to <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> antenna because they are {{only a small percentage}} of a wavelength away. In this near field region, the tag is closely coupled electrically with the transmitter in <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> <b>The</b> tag can modulate the field produced by <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> by changing <b>the</b> electrical loading the tag represents. By switching between lower and higher relative loads, the tag produces a change that <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> can detect. At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> requiring a different approach. The tag can backscatter a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to <b>the</b> <b>reader's</b> interrogation signal.|$|R

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially <b>the</b> <b>readers,</b> know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. <b>The</b> <b>readers</b> use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one question in a given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E
50|$|Although {{primarily}} nonfiction in content, Providence {{is written}} with a fictional backdrop, in which <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> {{is presented as}} someone who has read Ishmael and sneaked into Daniel Quinn’s house at night to ask Quinn for further information regarding his inspirations for the novel and its philosophical ideas. Quinn, though tired, welcomes <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> into his house and opens himself up to <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> questions. Throughout <b>the</b> story, Quinn narrates as though replying to questions asked by (the character of) <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> which Quinn “restates” in his answers and explanations; the voice of <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is never directly heard.|$|R

5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The {{unresolved}} larger narrative arc encourages {{speculation about}} future story events. According to Martin, {{much of the}} key to Ice and Fire future lies over a dozen years in the fictional past, of which each volume reveals more. Events planned from the beginning are foreshadowed, although Martin is careful {{not to make the}} story predictable. The viewpoint characters, who serve as unreliable narrators, may clarify or provide different perspectives on past events. Therefore, what <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> believe to be true may not necessarily be true.|$|E

5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's mind about his early {{appearances}} in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration where Kenshin's characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective about what he could add to him.

She was also unable to include Ian and Tokage's newfound friendship, because Rin and Ian's romantic relationship served as the focus of the story.|$|E
5|$|A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is {{a member}} of Pension, the {{governing}} body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when <b>the</b> <b>Readers,</b> for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights and privileges as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — RFID is core {{technology}} {{in the area of}} ubiquitous computing. To identify the objects begins with <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> query to <b>the</b> tag attached to the subject. When multiple tags exist in <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> interrogation zone, these tags simultaneously respond to <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> query, resulting in collision. This kind collision makes <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> to take long time to identify tags within <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> identification range and impossible to identify even one tag. In RFID system, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> needa <b>the</b> anti-collision algorithm which can quickly identify all the tags in interrogation zone. This paper proposes a design methodology with two different RF modules, 433. 92 MHz and 315 MHz are interfaced into microcontroller, encoder, decoder IC’s are used. According to query technique, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> sends <b>the</b> query signal to all tags with one frequency and the tag corresponding to the query will respond to reader with another frequency, likewise anti-collision algorithm is implemented to avoid collision and number of query reponses can be reduced...|$|R
