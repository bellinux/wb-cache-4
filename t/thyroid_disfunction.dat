40|$|Amyloid goiter {{is a rare}} {{pathology}} due {{to massive}} amyloid infiltration of thyroid tissue, which cause diffuse or localized enlargement of the gland. It can be totally asymptomatic or cause only non-specific symptoms (compression of adjacent structures, tracheal deviation). <b>Thyroid</b> <b>disfunction</b> (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) is rare. It is important to differentiate primitive amyloid goiter from other kinds of amyloid infiltration of the thyroid, such as in systemic amyloidosis. The correct diagnosis can be difficult because of the common presence of amyloid in thyroid neoplasms, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). The Authors present a case of primitive amyloid goiter, that needed immunohistochemical analysis for a correct diagnosis, and {{a review of the}} concerning literature...|$|E
40|$|Background: Reinke’s edema {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} head and neck diseases. A great majority of the patients are middle-aged women. In the initial stage of the disease, a deeper voice appears. Hoarseness is a sign of an advanced disease. An enormous edema can even cause breathing problems. The known etiologic factors for the development of Reinke’s edema are smoking, gastroesophageal reflux, vocal overuse, unfavourable microclimate at work and possibly <b>thyroid</b> <b>disfunction</b> and allergy. Besides the causal treatment, in a majority of patients the surgical treatment is the only possibility of cure. The voice therapy after the surgical procedure helps the patient to regain a proper vocal technique and vocal habits. Conclusions: Reinke’s edema is quite a frequent cause of voice disorders. In order to treat the disease and prevent a recurrence, all etiological factors must be detected and eliminated or extenuated. A proper voice therapy that follows the surgical treatment can enable the patient to regain a good voice quality...|$|E
40|$|Using male rats of Wistar strain, {{studies were}} made on the {{influences}} of the thyroid and thymic systems upon the changes of weight and histochemical findings of the prostatic gland, testicle, seminal vesicle and adrenal gland. Simultaneously, effects of sexual hormones which added to the thyroid and thymic agents were also observed. The results are summarized as follows. 1) Observ a tions of short duration (3 and 5 weeks) in the thyroid groups revealed {{a slight increase in}} weight of the prostatic gland, a decrease in ACP and an increase in ALP following thyroidectomy or administration of MTU, and a decrease in weight of the prostatic gland and increases in ACP and RNA with administration of thyroid powder. The results indicated that supression of thyroid function yields an increase in weight and hypofunction of the prostatic gland while hyperthyroidism makes a decrease in weight and hyperfunction of the prostatic gland. 2) Obse r vations of long duration (3 and 5 months) in the thyroid groups showed an increase in weight and decrease in function of the prostatic gland following administration of MTU, while a decrease in weight and increases in Zn and SD of the prostatic gland after administration of thyroid powder. However when the grade of suppression or acceleration of the thyroid function is exceeded, both of weight and function of the proststic gland were decreased. 3) Administration of sexual hormones in association with experimental <b>thyroid</b> <b>disfunctions</b> resulted intenser effects of the sexual hormones upon the prostatic gland. 4) In thyroid groups, weight of the testicle shoWed a slight increas e after thyroidectomy and administration of MTU or thyroid powder. The level of SD in seminal vesicle the yielded decreases after thyroidectomy or administration of MTU and an increase after administration of thyroid powder. Furthermore, with thyroidectomy or with administration of MTU, increases in weight, amount of Sudan III stainable substance and 17 KS of the adrenal gland were demonstrated during short observations period, while decreases in these values were shown during long observation period. With administration of thyroid powder, despite a slight decrease in weight of the adrenal gland, Sudan 'III stainable substance and 17 KS revealed increases in short observation period and decreases in long observation period, making a diphasic pattern. 5) Following thymectomy, the prostatic gland showed an increase in weight and hyperfunction with increases of Zn and SD. Administration of thymic agent resulted decreases in weight and function of the prostatic gland with decreases of RNA, Zn and SD. 6) Administration of male or female sexual hormones in association with thy m ectomy or treatment with thymic agent demonstrated a more intense effects of sexual hormones upon gonads in the cases of thymectomy with sexual hormonal administration than the cases of simultaneous treatment with thymic agent and sexual hormones. 7) Weight of the testicle increased after thymectomy a n d decreased with administration of thymic agent. The level of SD in the seminal vesicle coincided with that of in the prostatic gland. Thymectomy also resulted a decrease in weight and an increase of stainability of the adrenal gland, while results of vice versa were obtained with administration of thymic agent...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>Thyroid</b> <b>disfunction</b> (hypothyroidism) {{in women}} at childbearing age (WCA) can cause {{reproduction}} disorder, i. e. infertility, spontaneous abortion, impaired {{growth and development}} of foetus, placental abruption, and preterm delivery. Pesticide exposure is suspected to cause thyroid dysfunction. The research objective is to prove that pesticide exposure is {{a risk factor for}} thyroid dysfunction among WCA in lowland agricultural areas. Research Methods This was an observational study, combined of cross-sectional and case-control design. Study subjects in cross-sectional study were 216 WCA and in case-control study were 44 WCA as cases and 45 WCA as controls. Pesticide exposure was measured by asking WCA’s involvement in agricultural activities using structured questionnaire and by checking their levels of cholinesterase. Thyroid dysfunction was determined {{based on the results of}} TSH, FT 4, and T 3 level. Confounding variables were also measured. These variables were age, BMI, haemoglobin level, participation in hormonal contraception, liver function, iodine intake, intake of goitrogenic substances, blood lead level, exposure to cigarette smoke, habit of using insect repellent and habit of using plastic for food packaging.

40|$|Background: Intracranial {{atherosclerosis}} {{was one of}} {{the etiology}} of ischemic stroke and could caused by several risk factors, including hypertension. Hypertension modulates the endothelial function which could be the cause of the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Increased intima media thickness of internal carotid artery is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and is a reflection of general atherosclerosis. Objective: To determine the contribution of hypertension to internal carotid artery atherosclerosis in post-ischemic stroke patients in Dr. Kariadi General Hospital, Semarang, Indonesia. Methods: A cross sectional study of 42 subjects post stroke ischemic with hypertension had done from June-August 2011. Inclusion criteria were post ischemic stroke patients one month to five years after onset, age 45 – 75 years. The exclusion criteria were patients with recurrent stroke, kidney and <b>thyroid</b> <b>disfunction,</b> steroid and estrogen users. The thickness of the tunica intima-media of the internal carotid artery was examined by carotid duplex ultrasound. Hypertension was determined by the onset of hypertension, blood pressure base on JNC VII and funduscopic examination. The correlation between hypertension and atherosclerosis were analyzed by Chi Square and Fisher Exact test. Results: The risk factors for internal carotid artery atherosclerosis were age ≥ 55 years, the prevalence ratio 16. 8 (95...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mercury was {{released}} in environment {{as a result of}} human activities such as the traditional gold mining industry. The activities of traditional gold mining used amalgam processes that cause negative effects of mercury which exposured to traditional gold miners. Chronic effects of mercury exposure  due to obstruction of iodine uptake by mercury in the body, so that it disrupt thyroid function. It was caused by inhibition of secretion levels of T 3 and T 4, and  increased activity of TSH, as feedback synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormone. The {{purpose of this study was}} determine the relationship between mercury exposure with disfunction thyroid in traditional gold mining workers in the Village Jendi, Selogiri District, Wonogiri. Method:It was an observational research using cross-sectional design. The subject were 42 traditional gold miners in Jendi Selogiri Village, Wonogiri, which purposively selected. The instrument used  are questionnaires and laboratory analysis of blood and urine specimens. Data obtained from TSH, FT 4 serum, Hg in blood, urinary iodine excretion, and measurement of nutritional status. Data would be analyzed using chi squar and regression logistic. Result: The research results showed that there was no correlation between level of  Hg in blood (p= 0, 800), work period (p= 0, 101), work duration (p= 0, 594) and there was no different of disfunction thyroid by oocupation (p= 0, 853), with range of  Hg in blood 4, 4 to 9, 373 ppm. Conclusion: This study concluded that, there was no association between mercury exposure with disfunction thyroid in the traditional gold miners in Jendi, Selogiri District, Wonogiri.   Keyword : mercury, <b>thyroid</b> <b>disfunction,</b> TSH, FT...|$|E
40|$|Background  : Pesticide {{exposure}} {{on women}} {{who live in}} agricultural areas can cause health problems such as disruption of thyroid function. Pesticides can inhibit the binding of iodine by the body. Hypothyroidism can cause disturbances in female reproductive system, including disorders of puberty and menstruation, pre menstrual syndrome, sexual disfunction, birth defects and low birth weight infant. Goiter are usually be found in mountainous or highland areas but now mostly found in the lowlands. This is {{probably due to the}} exposure to heavy metals such as Pb, the use of hormonal contraceptives, and consumption of thiocyanate.   The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify some factors associated with thyroid function on child bearing age woman in  Kersana Subdistrict,  district of Brebes Method  : It was an observational research using cross-sectional design. Research was conducted in 4 villages namely Kemukten, Limbangan, Sutamaja and Kubangpari Kersana Brebes District. The subjects were 87 women. Data obtained from TSH, FT 4 serum, Pb in blood, kholinesterase in blood, urinary iodine excretion, thiocyanate, measurement of nutritional status, the interview to find out the type of contraception used by couples. Data were analyzed using chi square test. Result  : The results showed that there was no correlation between levels of kholinesterase, Pb in blood, urinary iodine excretion, urinary thiocyanate, the type of contraception, age and BMI with thyroid function on child bearing age woman in Sub district of Kersana. There was no association between exposure of pesticides and Hypothyroid cases occured in Kersana Sub district. It was recomended that women of childbearing need to reduce the adverse impacts of pesticides by using personal protective equipment in agricultural activities and improve health and clean living, and  health department should monitor and regular inspection for kholinesterase levels in women of childbearing age who live in agricultural areas.

40|$|Aim: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the incidence and short term outcome of abnormal thyroid functions in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods: Fourty-two patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who were diagnosed and observed in our department of pediatrics between 2001 - 2006 were retrospectively evaluated. The thyroid function tests of the patients were measured within {{four and a half}} days of the initial diagnosis of diabetes and at least one follow-up test median on day 180 after diagnosis. Results: Twenty-two (52. 4 %) of the patients were female and 20 (47. 6 %) were male. Mean age of the patients was 9. 4 (± 3. 6) years. Twenty-three patients (54. 8 %) were diagnosed as diabetic ketoacidosis, 15 (35. 7 %) as ketosis and 4 (9. 5 %) as hyperglycemia at the time of initial presentation. Thyroid functions were normal in 26 (61. 9 %) subjects. Thyroid function tests were abnormal in 16 (38. 1 %) subjects of whom 12 (75. 0 %) had biochemical findings compatible with sick euthyroid syndrome and of these 10 (83. 3 %) had diabetic ketoacidosis. All of these abnormalities were transient and thyroid function tests all returned to normal except for one patient. Antithyroid antibodies were positive in 7 (16. 7 %) subjects 2 (10. 5 %) with ketosis or hyperglycemia and 5 (21. 7 %) diabetic ketoacidosis. Thyroid function tests were abnormal in 6 (14. 3. 1 %) subjects at follow-up. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>disfunction</b> rate decrased the 38. 1 % to 14. 3 % at the follow-up. Conclusion: This retrospective study revealed that abnormalities in thyroid function tests in subjects with newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetes mellitus were frequent and mostly transient. For this reason, {{in the absence of any}} clinical situation suggesting a thyroid disorder, we think it would be better to assess thyroid function tests at least one mouth after theinitial diagnosis of diabetes.
