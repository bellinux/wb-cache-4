5|$|In {{the second}} {{month of the}} 2010–11 season, Lucic {{recorded}} a natural hat-trick on November 18, 2010, during a 4–0 win over the Florida Panthers. Later in the campaign, he was fined $3,500 by the NHL for his actions during a game against Atlanta on December 23. After Lucic was hit by opposing defenceman Freddy Meyer, teammate Andrew Ference engaged Meyer in a fight. In the ensuing scrum, Lucic punched Meyer as the two were being restrained by referees, resulting in a match penalty. Three days following the game, Lucic received a $2,500 fine for his punch and an additional $1,000 for an obscene gesture he had made to players on the Thrashers' bench immediately afterwards. In January 2011, he missed three games with a shoulder injury. Lucic completed {{the season with a}} career-high 30 goals, 32 assists and 62 points in 79 games. He led the Bruins in goal-scoring while tying for the points lead with centre David Krejčí. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the third seed in the East, the Bruins eliminated the Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers and Tampa Bay Lightning in the first three rounds, en route to the Stanley Cup Finals against Vancouver. Although Lucic scored below his regular-season pace during the post-season with 12 points (five goals and seven assists) in 25 games, he helped the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup since 1972, as the team defeated the Canucks in Game 7 of the Finals. It was later reported that Lucic was playing <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> injuries during the playoffs. During the Eastern Conference Finals, he suffered a broken toe after blocking a shot from teammate Tyler Seguin during practice. He also struggled with a sinus infection, which {{was part of a larger}} problem in his right nostril that traced back to the end of the 2009–10 season and caused improper breathing. Lucic underwent surgery in the off-season to repair the sinus.|$|E

Humanity had been storing its nuclear waste in vast disposal sites {{on the far side of}} the Moon, but when an unknown form of electromagnetic radiation is detected, the accumulated waste reaches critical mass and causes a massive thermonuclear explosion on September 13, 1999. The force of the blast propels the Moon like an enormous booster rocket, hurling it out of Earth orbit and into deep space at colossal speed, thus stranding the 311 personnel stationed on Alpha.

2500|$|Lunger {{is perhaps}} most renowned for {{being one of the}} drivers, along with Guy Edwards, Arturo Merzario and Harald Ertl, who saved Niki Lauda from his burning car during the 1976 German Grand Prix.

He went off at a speed of between [...] and [...] [...] He had apparently crashed on exit, went <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> rows of catch fence, up a relatively steep bank, and back {{into the middle of the}} track, the Ferrari on fire. Lunger said that Edwards was able to get by Lauda's car to the left but Lunger was unable to avoid the wrecked Ferrari. He made contact about three quarters on because I was committed to a line and couldn't make it through the debris. Ertl followed, colliding with the Ferrari and knocking it into Lunger's Surtees. Lunger's fire extinguishers were set off by the collision which was fortunate and saved time in the rescue. Lunger got out of his Surtees which was tangled up with the Ferrari. The extinguishers going off had dampened the fire somewhat. Workers arrived and kept the fire down, eventually putting foam on the Ferrari. This enabled Lunger and Merzario to get close to the fire, although they could not free Lauda at first. Lauda was conscious, struggling to get free on his own. Again the fire flared up and kept the men back from the car's side. Lunger jumped on top of the Ferrari and grabbed Lauda by his shoulders. Merzario unbuckled the seatbelts and Lunger and Lauda tumbled out of the car as a portion of the cockpit broke apart. As Lauda and Lunger emerged corner workers put foam on them. They lay for a few seconds in the grass. The burning fuel was moving toward them so Lunger and Lauda walked 6 to 8 steps away from the fire.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his release}} on 3 July, Lays had to undergo the ritual humiliation {{the public was}} {{imposing}} on the [...] "Terrorist actors": {{they were forced to}} sing the anti-Jacobin hymn [...] "Le Réveil du Peuple", which had just been set to music by a tenor from the Théâtre Feydeau, Pierre Gaveaux, and which seemed destined to replace the Marseillaise as the main Republican anthem. Antoine Trial, a colleague of Gaveaux from the Opéra-Comique who was then in his sixties, had been forced to sing the new hymn kneeling on stage to boos, whistles and jeers from the audience, and had never recovered from the experience, eventually taking his own life with poison. Quéruel writes Lays managed to avoid making his return to the stage in Iphigénie en Tauride, in which his character Oreste sang lines which were a little too suggestive coming from an ex-"Terrorist": [...] "J'ai trahi l'amitié, j'ai trahi la nature/Des plus noirs attentats, j'ai comblé la mesure" [...] ("I have betrayed friendship, betrayed Nature/I have gone to the extreme of blackest deeds"). On the other hand, according to the memoirs of Count , it was indeed in the role of Oreste that Lays sought to return to the stage. However, the implacable hostility of the audience prevented him from singing a single note and, after an hour of fruitless efforts, he eventually had to be replaced by an understudy. His actual reappearance then took place in a revival of Sacchini's Œdipe à Colone, in which he sang the far less controversial character of King Theseus. Even then, things did not go smoothly: the audience booed and protested throughout the performance, although this time he was not prevented from completing it. At the end, the leading tenor Étienne Lainez returned onto the proscenium to sing, as usual, Le Réveil du Peuple, but he was shouted down and forced to take refuge in the wings. Lays was rowdily summoned back instead. Lainez accompanied his colleague on stage, hoping they would be allowed to sing together, but he was once more driven off by the furious audience, and Lays had to perform solo. No sooner had he managed to get <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> verses, however, than he too was driven off by booing, because the audience thought he was unworthy of the words he was singing. The unfortunate Lainez had to retake the stage for a third time to finish the performance. By the end of September, nevertheless, enthusiasm for such post-Revolutionary reprisals had abated and Lays was able to make a triumphant return as the Genius of Fire in Salieri's Tarare, his debut in the role.|$|E

40|$|Mode {{coupling}} theory (MCT) {{has been}} successful in explaining the observed sequence of time relaxations in dense fluids. Previous expositions of this theory showing this sequence have required the existence of an ideal glass transition temperature $T_ 0 $. Recent experiments show no evidence of $T_ 0 $. We show here how the theory can be reformulated, in a fundamental way, such that one retains this sequence of relaxation behaviors but with a smooth temperature dependence and without any indication of $T_ 0 $. The key ingredient in the reformulation is the inclusion of the metastable nature of the glass transition problem <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the mass density to the defect density. A main result of our theory is that the exponents governing the sequence of time relaxations are weak functions of the temperature in contrast to the results from conventional MCT.

40|$|Using a lattice Boltzmann {{model for}} fluid dynamics, we {{investigate}} the flow and phase {{behavior of a}} binary fluid moving over a patterned substrate within a microchannel. The binary fluid consists of two immiscible components, A and B, and this liquid is subjected to a Poiseuille flow. The substrate is decorated with a checkerboard pattern of A- and B-like patches. <b>Through</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> hydrodynamics and thermodynamics, each component is driven to flow from the nonwettable domains to wettable regions. As a consequence, the A and B fluids undergo extensive mixing within the microchannels. We investigate how the degree of mixing depends {{on the size of}} the patches, the velocity of the imposed flow field, and the characteristics of the fluid. The results provide guidelines for creating localized "mixing stations" within microfluidic devices. The findings also reveal how a combination of imposed flow fields and surface patterning can be exploited to control the phase behavior of complex fluids...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{glucocorticoid}} receptor (GR), {{like many}} signaling proteins, {{depends on the}} Hsp 90 molecular chaperone for in vivo function. Although Hsp 90 is required for ligand binding in vivo, purified apo GR is capable of binding ligand with no enhancement from Hsp 90. We reveal that Hsp 70, known to facilitate client delivery to Hsp 90, inactivates GR through partial unfolding, whereas Hsp 90 reverses this inactivation. Full recovery of ligand binding requires ATP hydrolysis on Hsp 90 and the Hop and p 23 cochaperones. Surprisingly, Hsp 90 ATP hydrolysis appears to regulate client transfer from Hsp 70, likely <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> the two chaperone’s ATP cycles. Such coupling is embodied in contacts between Hsp 90 and Hsp 70 in the GR:Hsp 70 :Hsp 90 :Hop complex imaged by cryoelectron microscopy. Whereas GR released from Hsp 70 is aggregation prone, release from Hsp 90 protects GR from aggregation and enhances its ligand affinity. Together, this illustrates how coordinated chaperone interactions can enhance stability, function, and regulation...|$|R
