The fundamental absorption edge, which indicates the exact optical transitions from occupied valence bands to the unoccupied conduction band, is estimated by calculating the photon energy dependent imaginary part of the dielectric function using scissors approximations (rigid shift of unoccupied bands).

The thermodynamic parameters such as glass transition temperatures, crystallization temperatures for Si-Te and M-Si-Te glasses were obtained.

The glass forming ability are obtained by using the differences between the crystallization and grass transition temperature and between the melting and crystallization temperature. The values of grass forming ability for the Si-Te glasses are over 0. 4, which indicates that the Si-Te alloys near the eutectic composition are good glass formers. The addition of Ag element to the Si_ 15 Te_ 85 alloy becomes lower the glass transition temperature and the crystallization temperature.

The thesis {{installation}} entitled "Owarinaki Michi: Ka Huaka'i Palena 'Ole" {{was presented}} at the Haigo and Irene Shen Architecture Gallery at the University of Hawaiʻi School of Architecture from April 1 - 12, 2013. "Owarinaki Michi: Ka Huakaʻi Palena 'Ole" depicts my journey to connect with both my native and adopted cultures. Through this process, I have come to realize how precious the beauty of nature is by cleansing negative emotion from my mind in order to absorb mana, a source of life, into my body. The English equivalent of these Japanese and Hawaiian phrases is "The Never-Ending Journey. " In this exhibition, my purpose was to depict a connection between both the Japanese and Hawaiian cultures, each of which respects <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> and humanity. Japanese people express this through the spirit of Shintoism, whereas Hawaiians express it through the spirit of mana. In the exhibition, the salt spiral represents a journey to discover my Japanese roots through the lens of the Hawaiian culture. The path is ritually drawn by hand-sprinkling salt three times into mound-shaped piles. This process metaphorically purifies the body, emotions and spirit while preserving knowledge from experiences. The structure of the roots refers to my own experiences and knowledge acquired through the course of my life, while the luminosity of the glass refers to spiritual power and strength that can be obtained from nature. Tying individual roots together symbolizes the establishment of self-awareness; the experiences and knowledge of the past joining together to create a complex tapestry continuing into the future. The journey of awareness will never end if there is hope that drives a person forward. My intent was to present a path through one such journey...|$|R
40|$|Discourses of {{identity}} in East Asian new music are often limited to tracing ethnographic materials or conceptual influences from the composers' cultures of origin. Existing analytical approaches {{tend to look}} for the musical features that are emblematic of the cultures in question, and to map relationships between the contemporary and traditional musical aspects. Composers who resist employing their native traditions as musical tropes, however, problematise discussions of their identity and are consequently overlooked in studies {{of identity}} politics. This thesis therefore examines questions of identity through a focus on three contemporary composers who, in diverse ways, challenge and complicate essentialising expressions of East Asian identity: Chinese composer Chen Yi (1953 -), Korean composer Unsuk Chin (1961 -) and Japanese composer Karen Tanaka (1961 -). All of them came to Europe or the United States to hone their skills in the mid- 1980 s and have since developed their musical careers in the Western world. They have been selected for examination due to their radically different reactions to the East-meets-West question; namely, Chen Yi's embracing of cultural fusion; Unsuk Chin's reaction against cultural fusion; and Karen Tanakaâs lack of interest in cultural fusion. To demonstrate this variation, this thesis analyses the works of these composers, their personal viewpoints and the critical reception of their works. Beyond discussing conventional notions of identity and difference, this dissertation explores the ways in which these composers complicate their perceived dissimilarity by embracing a 'universal music' ideal. Chapter One explores Chen Yi's musical identity as defined by her idea of 'cultural translation' and her musical goal of enhancing intercultural communication; where Chen Yi affirms cultural fusion, her work contributes to the traditional idea of 'East-meets-West'. Chapter Two examines an alternative approach in the case of Unsuk Chin, who consciously avoids the practice of cultural hybridity by locating her work squarely within the Western tradition. Chapters Three examines the works of two Japanese composers â Toru Takemitsu and Karen Tanaka â who focus their attention not on cultural fusion but on natural themes. The first section of Chapter Three presents Toru Takemitsu's Japanese-based philosophy of <b>the</b> co-creative <b>bond</b> <b>between</b> <b>nature</b> and humanity, which serves as a foil for Karen Tanaka's evolving, observational relationship with the natural world. To conclude, I compare the identity choices and the musical representations in the three case studies of Chen Yi, Unsuk Chin and Karen Tanaka. By gaining a better understanding of each composerâs music, this thesis aims to provide a more expansive discourse of identity formation in contemporary East Asian art music, and to offer a critical rethinking of what counts as an 'Asian perspective' in this field. </p...|$|R

The optimized interlayer spacing of SiC graphitic-like multilayer sheets has been found to depend on the ordering of atoms in different layers of the SiC graphitic-like structure (0. 37 nm for the Si-C sequence of bilayer arrangement versus 0. 48 nm for either the Si-Si or the C-C sequence of bilayer arrangement).

Moreover, it is found through annealing experiments that intermixing is stronger for higher temperatures. The resulting ground state structure contradicts the dominant ab-initio results in the literature, requiring revisions of the proposed switching mechanisms. Overall, these findings shed light on <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> of GeTe–Sb 2 Te 3 superlattices and open a way to the understanding of their functionality...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} solution {{shows that}} a competition between bond order loss and <b>the</b> associated <b>bond</b> strength gain of the lower coordinated atoms {{near the edge of}} a surface dictates the mechanics of the surface and, hence, a nanosolid. Bond order loss lowers the activation energy for atomic dislocation, whereas bond strength gain enhances the energy density or mechanical strength in the region near the surface. Therefore, the surface is harder than the bulk interior at temperatures far below the melting point (Tm), and the surface becomes softer at temperatures close to the surface Tm that drops because of bond order loss. Matching predictions to measurements reveals that a transition happens to the Hall-Petch relationship for a nanosolid when <b>the</b> effect of <b>bond</b> order loss becomes dominant, and the critical size of the Hall-Petch transition depends intrinsically on <b>the</b> <b>bond</b> <b>nature</b> of <b>the</b> specimen and the ratio of T/Tm, where T is the temperature of operation.

40|$|While {{solid-state}} {{materials are}} commonly classified as covalent, ionic, or metallic, {{there are cases}} that defy these iconic bonding mechanisms. A prominent example is given by phase-change materials (PCMs) for data storage or photonics, which have recently been argued to show 'resonant' bonding; a clear definition of this mechanism, however, has been lacking until the present day. Here we show that these solids are clearly different from resonant <b>bonding</b> in <b>the</b> pi-orbital systems of benzene and graphene. Instead, they exhibit a unique mechanism between covalent and metallic bonding, which we call 'metavalent' <b>bonding.</b> <b>The</b> materials {{are on the verge}} of electron delocalization, which explains their exceptional property portfolio, and we therefore argue that they represent 'incipient metals'. This yields deeper, fundamental insight into <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>nature</b> of solid-state materials, and is expected to accelerate the discovery and design of new functional materials including PCMs and thermoelectrics...|$|R
