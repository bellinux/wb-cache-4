50|$|Matt Aragon is {{the sixth}} {{full-length}} album from San Diegan punk band Dogwood. The album's title is {{in honor of}} the band's long-time friend Matt Aragon, who had continued to support and encourage the band as a whole and the members as individuals during a stressful period around the album's production. The album was recorded in January 2001 at Motor Studios in San Francisco, and produced by Ryan Greene, most notable at the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> artists on the prominent punk record label Fat Wreck Chords such as NOFX, No Use for a Name, and Lagwagon. Guitarist Sean O'Donnell departed the band after the album's release. The album went on to win a 2002 San Diego Music Award for Best Punk album.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the albums release, much of the bands {{pre-existing}} fanbase did not receive the album well. As Jawbreaker had made many previous comments to the media declaring their disdain of the major-label music industry-claiming many times that they would not sign to a major label-many fans saw the band signing to DGC Records (for a reported advance of one million dollars) as a [...] "betrayal." [...] The slicker production, courtesy of a producer known at the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> Green Day, and Schwarzenbachs changed vocal style, did not go over well with many fans who did give the album a chance. After Jawbreakers breakup, many of these same fans came to reconsider the album {{in the context of the}} bands legacy, and changed their opinion to a more positive view.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, more of {{high stakes}} (National exam- NP) have been {{introduced}} in Sweden and now (2015) the government has decided that the NP in social sciences- and natural science in 6 th grade is optional {{in order to reduce}} teachers' administrative burden. Based on these reforms, to have more tests in more grades and also on the decision to remove the test, {{the purpose of this study}} is to examine how teachers perceive the work of the (NP). A quantitative research was done in the form of questionnaires. The study was based on questionnaires regarding the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the NP and of the intention that the NP should be a support for teachers. The result of the study is linked to school development and the constructivist theory of learning. The results show that teachers perceive work with NP takes a lot of time, where as the time for administration seems to take slightly lesser time than the time for assessing the exams. The results also indicate that teachers perceive NP as supportive, mainly in relation to the curriculum. The result also shows if management gives priority to work with NP it affects teachers' perception of it positively...|$|E

The used and combined technologies were computer tomography, 3 D scanning and modeling with textures, rapid prototyping and 3 D milling. These modern technologies are standardly used in relic documentation and restoration, but their combination in a synergic procedure is unique.

40|$|Self-reports from {{siblings}} {{of children}} with special needs regarding their appraisal of family stress and coping are important additions to the disability literature. Twelve school-age siblings {{of children with}} special needs were interviewed about their daily hassles, uplifts, and coping strategies related to living in a family with a child with a disability. Parents also reported on family coping strategies. Children reported that the most frequent daily hassle was when their sibling with special needs cried, screamed, or yelled when he/she did not want to do some-thing. The most frequent daily uplift was when their sibling gave hugs or kisses. Children reported feeling most stressed when embarrassed by their sibling with special needs in front of friends and happiest when playing with their sibling. Wishful thinking was a common child coping strategy during stressful <b>times.</b> Im-plications <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> families with special needs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis is to find what the seniors and social workers think about the senior sexuality. The present state talks about the necessity of sexual activity in old age, its significance, about changes in this field {{and how we can}} satisfy this desire. Individual chapters deal with needs in the old age, the sexual activity of seniors and the possibility of saturation in facilities of social services. In the connection with the aim of the thesis, there were chosen quality research, the method of questioning and the technique of semi-structured questionnaire. The given results were processed into bunches and graphically illustrated through the thought maps. The research sample consisted of 2 sets. The first set contained the group of 8 seniors in the age of 60 and more who use residential services, concretely in the retirement home in Sušice. The second set contained three social workers who work in this concrete retirement home. Both sets were chosen by the method of deliberate choice. The thesis shows that there is a decline in sexual activity with increasing age, but the desire after sexual activity can also edure. The biggest influence has the loss of the absence of the partner. In the terms of sexuality in retirement homes, there is not given much <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> this phenomenon despite the positive attitude of social workers to this topic which {{is considered to be a}} natural part of life. There also appear some problems connected with this topic occasionally. The benefit of this thesis is the examination of opinions which seniors have about their own sexuality which can help the social workers to satisfy their need...|$|E
40|$|Medieföretaget AB is a Swedish Media Company {{that covers}} several {{different}} business areas. The company daily produces {{one of the}} biggest newspapers in Sweden and publishes editorial news on one of the country’s most visited news homepage. The company also has smaller firms that produce new business models. Due to big changes in the media climate over the world and a new company management team the company in November 2008 started a department for innovation. The main purpose of the department was to create a structured way for managing ideas and to promote innovation. The innovation process was inspired by the one described in the book Innovation by Carlson and Wilmot from the Stanford research Institute. The purpose with this final thesis was on behalf of the innovation manager to detect obstacles in the innovation process and to give recommendations for improvement of the process. The results of the task were based on an empirical- and theoretical analysis. The empirical analysis was based on just over 208 survey answers, seven interviews ant a by the student participating observation. The theoretical reference frame contained theories about innovation processes, project portfolio management and innovation measurement. Amongst the obstacles that were detected the survey showed that lack of time was the main reason for champions not to continue working with their ideas after leaving them to the department for innovation. But another reason was simply lack of engagement. Several of the interview objects pointed out the inadequateness of a well-communicated innovation strategy. But also that the company was working on to many different projects. Some of the recommendations the student presents in the end of the report is, spreading information in the company in a better way, having a person responsible for innovation in each department, having a more sophisticated reward strategy or more free <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> new ideas and potential innovations. A more organizational recommendation was to collect all the different projects in the company and to visualize them in a project portfolio. Medieföretaget AB är ett svenskt medieföretag som omfattar ett flertal olika verksamheter. Dagligen ger företaget ut en av Sveriges största tidningar samt publicerar redaktionella nyheter på en av landets största nyhetssajter på Internet. Företaget har även andra mindre bolag som utvecklar nya affärsidéer. På grund av förändringar både i mediaklimatet världen över samt på ledningsnivå inom företaget startade man i november 2008 en innovationsavdelning. Avdelningens huvudsyfte var att ta till vara på idéer och främja innovation. Den process företaget valt att kalla innovationsprocessen är inspirerad av den process Carlson och Wilmot från Stanford Research Institute beskrivit i boken Innovation. Syftet med examensarbetet var att på uppdrag från innovationschefen på företaget detektera hinder för innovation samt ge förslag till förbättringar. För att lösa uppgiften genomfördes en empirisk- samt en teoretisk analys. Den empiriska analysen byggde på drygt 200 enkätsvar, 7 intervjuer samt en deltagande observation. Den teoretiska referensramen innehöll litteratur om innovationsprocesser, projektportföljhantering och mätbarhet inom innovation. Bland de hinder som detekterades visade enkätsvaren att tidsbrist var en stor orsak till att idélämnare inte valde att arbeta vidare med sina idéer. Även bristande engagemang identifierades som en orsak. Flera intervjupersoner berättade även att en tydlig innovationsstrategi var bristfällig inom företaget samt att man arbetade med för många olika idéer. Bland de förbättringsförslag som examensarbetaren rekommenderade fanns bland annat, bättre informationsdelgivning, innovationsansvariga på varje avdelning, en mer genomarbetad belöningsstrategi eller innovativ arbetstid. En annan mer organisationssträckande rekommendation var att sortera och visualisera alla företagets projekt i en projektportfölj...|$|E

In 1978, Barrat was awarded the prize of Best Documentary Filmmaker in Milan, Italy for the film. In Italy, Channel 2 aired the film several times at prime time. In America, earlier that same year, excerpts were aired on NBC. The Whitney Museum in New York also showed the film along with Barrat's first photography of the South Bronx, which was well-attended and well-regarded by the press.|$|R
2500|$|Broadway {{producers}} are usually eager to cast big-named performers in their musicals, but Katzenberg, famous at the <b>time</b> <b>for</b> avoiding <b>working</b> <b>with</b> actors of such caliber, decided against this practice for Beauty and the Beast. Eisner concluded {{that most of}} the film's original voice actors would be too busy to reprise their roles onstage. In her Broadway debut, then-22-year-old actress Susan Egan was cast as the musical's original Belle. Egan, who had not yet seen the film, had been auditioning for several other Broadway projects at the time – namely My Fair Lady, Carousel and Grease – in which she was much more interested. Despite longing to originate a Broadway role, the actress was initially reluctant to audition for Beauty and the Beast because she thought that [...] "it was a terrible idea for Disney to put a cartoon on Broadway." [...] Additionally, Egan felt she was not attractive enough to play a character touted [...] "the most beautiful girl in the village", but her agent managed to convince her otherwise. Without any film to reference, Egan determined that Belle {{is supposed to be a}} [...] "quirky" [...] character and approached her funnier than how she is depicted in the film, in turn garnering laughs from the producers – who were amused by her unique interpretation – and eventually earning several callbacks. Meanwhile, her competition of 500 actresses, many of whom were simply offering imitations of voice actress Paige O'Hara's original performance, continued to be eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results from an experimental investigation of the starting parameters of fluorescent lamps operating with electronic ballasts. Two types of lamps are investigated, T 5 tubes and compact fluorescent lamps, operating with three types of ballasts: instant start, rapid start and programmed start type. Five different operating cycles are employed. Starting and operating voltage and current waveforms are recorded at regular time intervals of the lamp life at different starting scenarios. The preheat ratio is also calculated {{at the end of}} the preheat <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the systems <b>working</b> <b>with</b> preheating ballasts. This ratio indicates the temperature at the moment of starting, which is critical for the lamp life. its value in real time is also calculated for each lamp system during the starting period. The signatures of the lamp starting scenarios are discussed and a comparison is given between the different ballast operations. Their potential consequences on lamp life are examined.

40|$|School {{libraries}} and school library materials centers are being evaluated {{in terms of}} services they offer to the many changing philosophies and methods of education. If {{the objective of the}} school library is to contribute to achieving the objectives formulated by the school, the objectives are more nearly attained when the major function of the library is to provide high quality work with teachers and students. * The librarian of this library or materials center must work with the teachers of a team in the major emphasis of each; he must provide materials for every level of maturity whether material is presented by television or classroom teacher; he must watch for and follow the changes in subject matter, such as the new mathematics presents; he must have material ready for large groups of students and for individuals. In addition to providing materials, he must teach. He instructs both teachers and students in the use of all library resources. The provision of materials and the teaching function are two time-consuming activities. But before these functions can be performed, the material, printed or audio -visual, must be ordered, cataloged, and processed. These, too, are time-consuming activities. Administrators and supervisors began to realize that library service could be improved if a part of these responsibilities would be taken from the librarians to provide more <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>working</b> directly <b>with</b> teachers and students. The administrator of a school district where no library service had been provided questioned from the beginning the fact that similar and overlapping routines were planned for each library.

40|$|Recently {{there have}} been major shifts in biology {{education}} towards emphasizing {{the teaching of the}} scientific process to more closely reflect actual scientific practices. Authentic research experiences require the development of many higher order cognitive skills. Creating an authentic research experience that appropriately scaffolds the development of these complex skills while engaging individual student motivation remains challenging in classroom settings. Some common challenges include limited <b>time</b> available <b>for</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> large numbers of students, cramped working areas, and limited funding and materials resources. Using the Siamese Fighting Fish, Betta splendens, we have created an economically viable authentic animal behavioral research experience in the classroom that is emotionally and intellectually engaging while emphasizing the development of skills critical to the scientific process. Students will work collaboratively in pairs and as a class to perform novel research investigating the relationship between environmental temperature and air breathing by this fish during aggressive interactions. Studying aggression in bettas is ideal in a classroom setting because the behavior is inducible, reliable, and easily manipulated. In this experiment, 12 male bettas were housed individually in 3. 8 L plastic containers. They were subjected to two different temperature treatments (High 30 °C; Low 27 °C). Each male was observed in paired contests with 6 other males of comparable size, during which we quantified air breathing and observed tail beating. This research reveals that males in warmer water do more air breathing during aggressive displays than males in cooler water. Additionally, the basic experimental design can be easily modified to investigate novel student-driven questions. Limitations of this animal model can be explored and discussed as considerations that are integral to the scientific process, further instilling the authenticity of the student experience...|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 6 May 2010. The {{research}} {{on the effects of}} household responsibilities on commute lengths so far is not conclusive. Further, little has been done to test the hypothesis cross-culturally. This study is an international comparative analysis of the relationship of household responsibilities and women's commute lengths. I hypothesize that 1) Household responsibilities shorten women's commute lengths both with respect to men and other women with lower amount of household responsibilities, and, 2) Women in US have a tighter household responsibility-commute length relationship than women in GB. Using 1995 US Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS) data from the United States, and 1995 / 97 NTS data from Great Britain, I approximate household responsibilities with a composite life stage variable consisting of age, presence of children, and number of adults in a household. I present descriptive results and results on estimated models which test for both independent and interaction effects of gender and country on work trip distance and time, and presents results of estimated equations for pooled, women-only, and separate regressions for US and GB, controlling for land use indicators, number of workers and household income.; I find little variation among-women, and more variation between men and women according to life stage. I find that household responsibilities affect women's commute lengths differently than men. The household responsibility-commute length relationship is strongest for mothers of school-aged children in 2 -adult households. I also find some differences between the countries which point that, as expected, the relationship between household relationship and commute lengths are weaker in GB. I conclude that since Great Britain has a number of mediating factors such as mode (GB women use car in journey to work at a lower rate compared to GB men, and women with higher household responsibilities switch to car), and more attractive option <b>for</b> part <b>time</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> women <b>with</b> household responsibility which makes the direct relationship between household responsibilities and commute lengths weaker in Great Britain...|$|R
