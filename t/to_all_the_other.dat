However, after going 5–7 {{the following two}} seasons and suffering a season-ending blowout in 2003 by intrastate rival Clemson, Skip was demoted from the offensive coordinator and assistant head coaching positions to quarterbacks coach. Four assistant coaches—including the team's defensive coordinator—were fired in the same shakeup that saw Skip demoted. On November 22, 2004, one season after Skip's demotion, Lou Holtz announced he was retiring as head coach of South Carolina. The next day, South Carolina announced Steve Spurrier as the next head football coach. Coach Spurrier {{announced that he was}} keeping only three members of Lou Holtz's staff. Letters were sent <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> staffers—including Skip Holtz—informing them that they likely would not be retained.|$|E
2500|$|In faster {{breeding}} species {{there is}} less of a problem. Haldane mentions the peppered moth, Biston betularia, whose variation in pigmentation is determined by several alleles at a single gene.

Another allele, [...] "c", is recessive <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> and cc moths are light. Against the originally pale lichens the darker moths were easier for birds to pick out, but in areas, where pollution has darkened the lichens, the cc moths had become rare. Haldane mentions that in a single day the frequency of cc moths might be halved.|$|R

This line will even have a longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has also expressed interest in the implementation of possible express services on the CRL in future, apart from having just normal services. This express service would benefit commuters during the morning peak hours as trains would stop at only the interchanges and skip the remaining stations, hence, reducing travel time greatly.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee's {{breath was}} thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.|$|E

25|$|When a nucleon {{such as a}} proton or neutron {{is added}} to a nucleus, the nuclear force attracts it <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> nucleons of the nucleus (if the atom is small enough), but {{primarily}} to its immediate neighbours due to the short range of the force. The nucleons {{in the interior of}} a nucleus have more neighboring nucleons than those on the surface. Since smaller nuclei have a larger surface area-to-volume ratio, the binding energy per nucleon due to the nuclear force generally increases with the size of the nucleus but approaches a limiting value corresponding to that of a nucleus with a diameter of about four nucleons. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that nucleons are quantum objects. So, for example, since two neutrons in a nucleus are identical to each other, the goal of distinguishing one from the other, such as which one is in the interior and which is on the surface, is in fact meaningless, and the inclusion of quantum mechanics is therefore necessary for proper calculations.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} was assembled into a Headquarters {{and four}} company-sized units called Commandos: One, Two, Three and Support (each commando with ± 100 men). As a premise, a commando could have five troops, of which only four troops were normally activated. However, {{with the arrival}} of Intake 150 (in May 1976) the commandos were up to full strength for the first and only time. Some of the commandos mustered five troops until the end of 1976; with the university students demobbing at the end of 1976, the commandos reverted to four troops (in 2 Commando's case 9 Troop was deactivated). The troops in each commando relayed R (military) consistently one at a time; therefore the average fighting strength of a commando in bush mode was just over 70 men. Depending on the deployment and/or purpose, troops were divided into a small headquarters and either two 'patrols' or three 'sections'. Support Commando had a history dissimilar <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> units and, for an era prior to 1976, was called Support Group.|$|E

The Hive use superior numbers to overwhelm their opponents in close quarters while more elite units attack from a distance.

The Taken, in addition <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> races specialties, use high mobility and plenty of long-range attacks to out-maneuver the player. The Devil Splicers use multiple, unpredictable, lightning-like shots to surprise the player and hit them even while strafing.
