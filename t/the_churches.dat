40|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> {{has continued to}} generate interest among scholars since {{the early history of}} Christian theology. This interest has been facilitated by the fact that this doctrine is one that touches on several other doctrines such as the doctrines of God, Christ, Holy Spirit, humanity, salvation and eschatology.   A prominent approach in ecclesiological discussions is the use of analogy in describing <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> This is because, often times, complex issues get clarified by the use of analogies. This article reviews a number of the different analogies that have been used to describe <b>the</b> <b>church</b> and finds them deficient in capturing the depth of God’s relationship with <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> <b>The</b> article argues that a correct {{understanding of the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>church</b> entails locating God in <b>the</b> <b>church</b> as a member and the head of <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> <b>The</b> nature of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> is not fully comprehended when God is not located within <b>the</b> <b>church</b> as its center and head. Other studies of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> ignore this important fact of the unity of God with <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> It is not enough only to emphasize the roles of God in <b>the</b> <b>church</b> which could leave room for perceiving God as a detached controller of <b>the</b> <b>church.</b> This article presents God contrary to this perception, as being in <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> <b>the</b> head of <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> indeed, a member of <b>the</b> <b>church</b> who orders and runs <b>the</b> <b>church</b> from within...|$|R

The altars of <b>the</b> <b>churches</b> of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples.
