40|$|This study tested {{hypotheses}} that {{locus of}} causality attributions for {{the academic performance}} of <b>others</b> <b>are</b> influenced by whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> a specific individual, or a typical <b>other,</b> and whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>is</b> similar or dissimilar to self. The research was carried out in two studies. Study 1 entailed development of two scales to measure perceptions of interpersonal similarity: 254 Australian undergraduates rated their similarity to either a specific other or to typical other students. In Study 2, 332 subjects completed one of the 16 -item scales developed in Study 1, along with Rosenberg 2 ̆ 7 s self-esteem scale, and self-attribution and other-attribution versions of the Multidimensional Multi-attribution Causation Scale (MMCS). Results showed that attributions for {{the academic performance of}} <b>others</b> <b>were</b> strongly affected by whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> perceived to be similar or dissimilar to self, especially when <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>was</b> a specific individual. In particular, causal attributions for similar specific <b>others</b> <b>were</b> more favourable than attributions for self...|$|R

50|$|Derrida {{proposed}} that the absolute alterity of <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>is</b> compromised because <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>is</b> <b>other</b> than <b>the</b> Self and the group.

Hence, the use of the language of Otherness in the anthropological discourse (Oriental Studies) about Western encounters with non-Western cultures preserves the dominantor-dominated discourse of hegemony, just as misrepresenting <b>the</b> feminine as <b>Other</b> reasserts male privilege as primary in social discourse.|$|R
