500|$|During her {{travels in}} China, Wong {{continued}} to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating {{in many areas of}} China because she was raised with the Taishan dialect rather than Mandarin. She later commented that some of the varieties of Chinese sounded [...] "as strange to me as Gaelic. I thus had the strange experience of <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own people through an interpreter." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on April 23, 1971. Melvin Van Peebles stated that [...] "at first, only two theaters in the United States would show the picture: one in Detroit, and one in Atlanta. The first night in Detroit, it broke all the theater's records, and that was only {{on the strength of}} the title alone, since nobody had seen it yet. By the second day, people would take their lunch and sit through it three times. I knew that I was finally <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> audience. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song made thousands of dollars in its first day." [...] The film grossed $15,000,000+ at the box office (about $90 million in 2016 dollars).|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{seeking to}} {{establish}} through song Liliom's {{motivation for the}} robbery, Rodgers remembered that he and Hart had a similar problem in Pal Joey. [...] Rodgers and Hart had [...] overcome the problem [...] with a song that Joey sings to himself, [...] "I'm <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> Pal". [...] This inspired [...] "Soliloquy". [...] Both partners later told a story that [...] "Soliloquy" [...] was only {{intended to be a}} song about Liliom's dreams of a son, but that Rodgers, who had two daughters, insisted that Liliom consider that Julie might have a girl. [...] However, the notes taken at their meeting of December 7, 1943 state: [...] "Mr. Rodgers suggested a fine musical number {{for the end of the}} scene where Liliom discovers he is to be a father, in which he sings first with pride of the growth of a boy, and then suddenly realizes it might be a girl and changes completely." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Northrop News, March 27, 1981, Stephens is {{described}} as [...] "one {{of the founders of}} Northrop Corporation." [...] Stephens said, [...] "Tom Ellsworth was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> brother-in-law Wesley LeFevre. He said, 'It's a shame for that fellow Northrop to be working for other people. He should head his own company.'" [...] In 1939, Stephens used his lawyerly skills to scout the countryside for a site to erect Northrop Aviation's first buildings. He was {{one of the men who}} brought John K. [...] "Jack" [...] Northrop together with Gage H. Irving [...] and La Motte Cohu. Stephens was appointed to the board as secretary and was chief of the flight division. As chief test pilot, he flew the first flying wing, the Northrop N-1M, prototype of today's B-2 bomber.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{asked him}} [...] {{when he had}} his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one who}} did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Wilson often lampooned {{and criticized}} some New Age beliefs, bookstores specializing in New Age {{material}} often sell his books. Wilson, a well-known author in occult and Neo-Pagan circles, used Aleister Crowley {{as a main}} character in his 1981 novel Masks of the Illuminati, also included some elements of H. P. Lovecraft's work in his novels, and at times claimed to have perceived encounters with magical [...] "entities" [...] (when asked whether these entities seemed [...] "real", he answered they seemed [...] "real enough," [...] although [...] "not as real as the IRS" [...] but [...] "easier to get rid of", and later decided that his experiences may have emerged from [...] "just my right brain hemisphere <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> left"). He warned against beginners using occult practice, since to rush into such practices and the resulting [...] "energies" [...] they unleash could lead people to [...] "go totally nuts".|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson pegged [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] as a {{follow-up}} song to her 2004 track [...] "Because of You" [...] and the album's [...] "most personal" [...] record, saying that [...] "once you've worked through {{that and you}} find love {{and the kind of}} happiness you hoped for but didn't really know was possible. It's a happy song. And it has a happy ending, unlike 'Because of You. She revealed that she was inspired to write it after a discussion with her sister about their relationships with their respective families. She remarked, [...] "I was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sister on the phone about how sometimes girls with daddy issues don't find men like that!". Clarkson also noted that how their husbands were so supportive and loving were {{in stark contrast to the}} cliché about people with [...] "abandonment issues" [...] dating [...] "losers". She also said that [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] is a positive song, despite its somber resonance, and that she's still grateful to her father for making her want to be much more present in her family. Sonically, Jon Pareles of The New York Times compared it to the anthems recorded by U2. While Marissa Muller of CBS Radio described its sound as having a stadium feel with big drums.|$|E
