25|$|The 5 {{data bits}} allow for only 32 {{different}} codes, which cannot accommodate the 26 letters, 10 figures, space, a few punctuation marks and the required control codes, such as carriage return, new line, bell, etc. To overcome this limitation, the teleprinter has two states, the unshifted or letters {{state and the}} shifted or numbers or figures state. The change from one state to the other takes place when the special control codes LETTERS and FIGURES are sent from the keyboard or received from the line. In the letters state the teleprinter prints the letters and space while in the shifted state it prints the numerals and punctuation marks. Teleprinters for languages using other alphabets also use an additional <b>third</b> <b>shift</b> state, in which they print letters in the alternative alphabet.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 2015, the Automobile Club de l'Ouest {{announced}} that the Viper Exchange.com/Riley Motorsports entry into the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans had been approved, with American Marc Miller joining Keating and Jeroen as co-driver. The team will drive the No. 53 Dodge Viper GTS-R in the GT-am class. The team was first among the reserves for the event, and the entry gives Keating the opportunity to accomplish the feat of winning both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans events in the same year. This {{will be the first}} 24 Hours of Le Mans for both Keating and Miller, while Jeroen will be earning his 10th consecutive start in the event. Jeroen finished fourth in class in qualifying, and so the team had good position {{for the start of the}} race. Bleekemolen continued the strong start with his opening shift in the car, leading for most the third hour, and Keating continued to maintain a top-four position during the second shift. Miller took the <b>third</b> <b>shift</b> through much of the night, and the team entered the final shift, again driven by Bleekemolen, in fifth place. However, Bleekemolen began to notice issues with the gearbox, and after replacing the gearbox failed to resolve the problems, the No. 53 car was forced to retire from the race at 1:45 PM, having completed 304 laps.|$|E

First, firms on the left-hand side of the distribution, i. e. firms that are growing more slowly or declining, are typically more responsive to aggregate shocks than those on the right-hand side of the distribution. Second, trending behaviour in the volatility of firm growth is predominantly driven by increasing dispersion in the growth of highly performing firms. <b>Third,</b> <b>shifts</b> in the probability mass {{on either side of the}} mode may act as important propagators of business fluctuations.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} strain dependence of photoluminescense (PL) spectra of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT). Nanotubes were sparsely dispersed {{in a thin}} PMMA film applied to acrylic bar, and strained in both compression and extension by bending this bar in either direction in a homebuilt four-point bending rig. The average surface strain was measured with high accuracy by a resistive strain gage applied {{on top of the}} film. The near infrared imaging and spectroscopy were performed on the inverted microscope equipped with high numerical aperture reflective objective lens and InGaAs CCD cameras. PL was excited with a diode laser at either 658, 730 or 785 nm, linearly polarized {{in the direction of the}} strain. We were able to measure (n,m) types and orientation of individual nanotubes with respect to strain direction and strain dependence of their PL maxima. It was found that PL peak shifts with respect to the values measured in SDS micelles are a sum of three components. First, a small environmental shift due to difference in the dielectric constant of the surrounding media, that is constant and independent of the nanotube type. Second, shift due to isotropic compression of the film during drying. <b>Third,</b> <b>shifts</b> produced by the uniaxial loading of the film in the experiment. Second and <b>third</b> <b>shifts</b> follow expression based on the first-order expansion of the TB hamiltonian. Their magnitude is proportional to the nanotube chiral angle and strain, and direction is determined by the nanotube quantum number. PL strain dependence measured for a number of various nanotube types allows to estimate TB carbon-carbon transfer integral...|$|R

50|$|Miyake and Friedman's {{theory of}} {{executive}} functions proposes {{that there are}} three aspects of executive functions: updating, inhibition, and shifting. A cornerstone of this theoretical framework is the understanding that individual differences in executive functions reflect both unity (i.e., common EF skills) and diversity of each component (e.g., shifting-specific). In other words, aspects of updating, inhibition, and shifting are related, yet each remains a distinct entity. First, updating is defined as the continuous monitoring and quick addition or deletion of contents within one's working memory. Second, inhibition is one's capacity to supersede responses that are prepotent in a given situation. <b>Third,</b> <b>shifting</b> is one's cognitive flexibility to switch between different tasks or mental states.|$|R

40|$|Background: Studies {{have shown}} the {{detrimental}} effect of increased temperature on brain injury. Fever is common after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The term &#x 2032;central fever&#x 2032; ? is often used when no cause is identified. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the correlation of fever with <b>third</b> ventricular <b>shift</b> in 61 patients with ICH and hypothesize about the mechanism of fever. Setting: Neurointensive Care Unit Design: Prospective observational study. Materials and Methods: From August 1999 to April 2000, data from 61 patients with ICH were prospectively collected including maximum temperature (Tmax) and fever (T > 37. 5 &#x 00 B 0; C) at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, ICH volume, and <b>third</b> ventricular <b>shift.</b> Outcome measures included discharge mortality, 3 -month National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and Barthel Index (BI). Statistical Analysis: Spearman correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney test, and logistic regression were used to assess relationships. Results: Fifty-six per cent of patients had fever in the first 24 hours and 53 &#x 0025; for at least two consecutive days. There was a correlation between ICH volume and Tmax at 24 hours (P = 0. 04) and 72 hours (P = 0. 03) and fever at 24 hours (P = 0. 039) and 72 hours (P = 0. 036). Tmax at 72 hours correlated with <b>third</b> ventricular <b>shift</b> (P = 0. 01). Those with shift were more likely to have fever within the first 72 hours (P = 0. 049) and worse outcome. Fever at 72 hours was associated with a higher discharge mortality (P = 0. 046) and trend of a worse 3 -month NIHSS score (P = 0. 06). Conclusion: Fever is common after ICH and correlates with ICH volume and <b>third</b> ventricular <b>shift</b> suggesting a role of hypothalamic compression in "central fever.

40|$|International audienceProduction Planning (PP) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modern manufacturing enterprises. With more and more restrictions imposed by various labour laws, PP decisions should be made not only based on industrial constraints, such as production capacity and inventory level, but also with respect to social constraints, such as limited use of overtime. Under such conditions, we propose a dynamic programming based approach for solving a class of PP problems with explicit consideration of social constraints. The problem considered in this paper is defined based on a real-life problem proposed by an international automobile industry. The objective is to find a feasible and flexible PP with respect to both industrial and social constraints. In the studied assembly system, PP decisions are made based on the sales forecast, the available production capacity and the current inventory level and with respect to the limited use of non-working days, overtimes and <b>third</b> <b>shifts...</b>|$|R
40|$|To craft a post- 2012 {{climate change}} agreement, four key {{sticking}} points {{will need to}} be addressed in advance of the COP 15.
