The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings {{and the need to}} reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.|$|E

40|$|Since the 19 th century, the {{processes}} of modernization, industrialization and urbanization have fundamentally impacted the spatial organization and the actual contents of social ties. In particular, the role of place of residence in everyday life has significantly changed. Compared to the past, the spatial distance is less relevant for maintenance of interpersonal ties and non-local social relations are of growing importance. This process has been recently enhanced by development of communication technologies and the Internet in particular.

25|$|According to {{the social}} {{learning}} theory (more recently expanded as social cognitive theory), behavioural change is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>environment.</b> Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change.|$|E

The bishop has acquired control of the sacraments, presbyters and deacons acting only under his orders; the episcopate appears as a unit, bishops being bound to respect one another's disciplinary decrees.|$|E

40|$|Title: Preschool – a <b>social</b> {{language}} <b>environment</b> and {{an arena}} for emergent literacy processes. Author: Martina Norling By focusing on preschool, as an arena for emergent literacy and language learning processes, this thesis put the lens on preschool staff´s approaches and strategies in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> language <b>environment</b> in Swedish preschools. Taking its {{point of departure}} in real preschool settings, the overall purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} greater understanding of this <b>social</b> language <b>environment,</b> with particular emphasis on the quality dimensions of strategies, such as the preschool staff´s sensitivity and approaches in the preschool environment. Two didactic issues are of special importance to the thesis: preschool staff´s descriptions of what kind of strategies and approaches they use in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> language <b>environment</b> as well as how preschool staff support children’s language learning processes in literacy-related activities. The thesis consists of four articles aimed at capturing, variations of dimensions of preschool staff strategies as well as approaches that contribute to highlighting essential strategies for supporting children in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> language <b>environment.</b> <b>The</b> theoretical framework in this thesis consists of social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1997) and bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 2005). The four empirical studies in this thesis have made possible a mixed method design. The data production consists of questionnaires with questions regarding background information of the participants, observation instruments (scoring the quality of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> language <b>environment),</b> focus group interviews, video observations as well as a systematic literature review. In this thesis, three dimensions of preschool staff strategies in <b>social</b> language <b>environment</b> emerged: play strategies, emotional strategies and communicative strategies. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> language <b>environment</b> in Swedish preschool can be described in terms of those three strategy dimensions and continuous interplay processes among children, peers and preschool staff, over time. The quality dimensions of strategies focus, on preschool staff efforts and children’s prerequisites of learning processes, rather than focusing on children’s individual performance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of <b>the</b> classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> mediate <b>the</b> relations between teacher self-efficacy and student adjustment. Research suggests that early adolescents often experience decreases in engagement and motivation during the middle school years, which can put individuals at risk for academic failure and school dropout (Eccles, Lord, 2 ̆ 6 Midgley, 1991). This occurs due to a mismatch between the individuals 2 ̆ 7 developmental needs and the environment (Eccles et al., 1993). Whether early adolescents remain engaged in school is largely dependent on how they perceive the classroom environment promoted by their teacher (Erikson, 1950; Masten 2 ̆ 6 Coatsworth, 1998; Roeser, Eccles 2 ̆ 6 Sameroff, 2000). Additionally, the type of environment teachers promote is based on their assessments of their own teaching abilities (Ashton 2 ̆ 6 Webb, 1986; Guskey, 1988; Hall et al., 1992). Therefore, this study describes a model proposing that <b>the</b> classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> (i. e., teacher support, teacher-promoted social interaction and mutual respect) mediates the relation between teacher self -efficacy and student adjustment (i. e., academic and social self-efficacy, classroom engagement, and disruptive behavior). This model was tested via single-level structural equation model with 358 middle school students from an economically and racially diverse sample. This study utilized a single data point from a larger, longitudinal quantitative study which examined student motivation and adjustment across the transition from elementary school into middle school. The study aimed to determine: (1). What is the impact of teacher self-efficacy on students 2 ̆ 7 perception of <b>the</b> classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment?</b> (2). What is the impact of <b>the</b> classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> on students 2 ̆ 7 academic and social self- efficacy, involved behavior, and disruptive behavior? (3). To what extent does <b>the</b> classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> mediate <b>the</b> relation between teacher self-efficacy and student adjustment (i. e., academic and social self efficacy and involved and disruptive behavior). Findings suggest that teacher self-efficacy had minimal impact on classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> and student adjustment variables, and thus may not play a mediating role between these variables. However, findings did indicate a significant, moderate impact of <b>the</b> classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> on student adjustment. This finding aligns with previous research which suggests when the classroom environment provides opportunities for students to develop their academic and social competencies, and when students feel cared for and supported, school adjustment is enhanced (Eccles, Wigfield, 2 ̆ 6 Schiefele, 1998; Roeser et al., 2000). The overall impact of <b>the</b> classroom <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> on student adjustment in this study highlights the need for school psychologists to advocate for the development of middle school environments that meet early adolescents 2 ̆ 7 developmental and basic needs...|$|R
25|$|While fear of rape is {{typically}} associated with being outside the home, {{the great majority of}} sexual violence actually occurs in the home of the victim or the abuser. Nonetheless, abduction by a stranger is quite often the prelude to a rape and the opportunities for such an abduction are influenced by the physical environment. <b>The</b> <b>social</b> <b>environment</b> within a community is, however, usually more important than the physical surrounding. How deeply entrenched in a community beliefs in male superiority and male entitlement to sex are will greatly affect the likelihood of sexual violence taking place, as will the general tolerance in the community of sexual assault and the strength of sanctions, if any, against perpetrators. For instance, in some places, rape can even occur in public, with passersby refusing to intervene. Complaints of rape may also be treated leniently by the police, particularly if the assault is committed during a date or by the victim's husband.|$|E
