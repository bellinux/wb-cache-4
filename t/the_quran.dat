5|$|After the {{completion}} of the rough draft, he wrote a volume of four chapters, Qur'an al-Majid, which served as an introduction for the tafsir. Darwaza stresses a close connection between <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> and the biography of the Muhammad (sira) and states that <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> fully reflects various stages between <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> and the career of Muhammad. He also emphasizes that both the angels and the jinn are spoken in <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> not for their own sake, but to reinforce Muhammad's missions and goals.|$|E
5|$|He {{contends that}} the {{presentation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> and its suras was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of <b>the</b> <b>Quran.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quran</b> is {{the central}} {{religious}} text of Islam.

Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E

40|$|Taubah and {{listening}} to <b>the</b> Holy <b>Quran</b> recitation are highly recognizable Islamic repentance to the Muslim community. Undoubtedly, these beliefs can flourish people's mind and soul. Therefore, this repentance has a miraculous power to reduce anxiety and stress like psychological pessimistic matters from one's mind. Besides this, listening to <b>the</b> Holy <b>Quran</b> recitation can relieve and calm a disturbed mind. Consequently, this repentance {{may be used as}} the therapeutic agents in some cases. In this work, the authors make use of taubah {{and listening}} to <b>the</b> Holy <b>Quran</b> recitation as stimuli in psychophysiological research, via galvanic skin response (GSR), an objective method for realizing the changes of emotional response of subjects.

5|$|Jerusalem is {{recognized}} as a sacred site in Islam. Though <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> does not mention Jerusalem by name, it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> refer to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is also mentioned {{many times in the}} hadith. Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre, known as al-Fadhail or history of cities. The Fadhail of Jerusalem inspired Muslims, especially during the Umayyad period, to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts. Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{reaction}} {{ranged from}} those believing in literal creation from <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> to many educated Muslims who subscribed to {{a version of}} theistic or guided evolution in which <b>the</b> <b>Quran</b> reinforced rather than contradicted mainstream science. This occurred relatively early, as medieval madrasahs taught the ideas of Al-Jahiz, a Muslim scholar from the 9th century, who proposed concepts similar to natural selection. However, acceptance of evolution remains low in the Muslim world, as prominent figures reject evolution's underpinning philosophy of materialism as unsound to human origins and a denial of Allah. Further objections by Muslim authors and writers largely reflect those put forward in the Western world.|$|E
