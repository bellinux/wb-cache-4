500|$|Loren Pankratz - A {{founding}} {{faculty member}} of the Skeptic's Toolbox, Pankratz explained to Harriet Hall, [...] about {{the beginnings of the}} Toolbox, [...] "Ray Hyman, Jerry Andrus and I were meeting together once a month or so and we decided <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> three of us could put a Toolbox together." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 2016, {{the first}} teaser trailer {{for the film}} debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly {{compared}} the [...] "series of kaleidoscopic, world-bending scenes" [...] featured in the trailer to the film Inception, as did Scott Mendelson of Forbes. Forbes added that {{the structure of the}} trailer resembled early marketing for the film Batman Begins. The Hollywood Reporters Graeme McMillian criticised these similarities, as well as similarities to The Matrix and between Cumberbatch's American accent and that of Hugh Laurie's Gregory House from House, calling them not [...] "necessarily a real problem, of course... there's nothing there outside the derivative aspects: {{due to the nature of}} the trailer, there's no story beyond the 'white man finds enlightenment in Asia' trope and barely any dialogue to let audiences decide <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> performances will elevate the material." [...] McMillian did enjoy the visual effects and the visual of [...] "Tilda Swinton literally knock Benedict Cumberbatch's soul out of his body," [...] but concluded, [...] "as an introduction to not only a brand new franchise for Marvel, but a potential new genre, this feels far less bold and assured" [...] than the first trailer for Guardians of the Galaxy.|$|E
500|$|... "Tallahassee" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many {{noting that the}} Florida story-line gave the series a focus. TV Equals noted that the episode was [...] "one of the best episodes of The Office this the season and [...] {{one of the better}} episodes from the last couple of seasons." [...] Brian Marder from Hollywood.com wrote a largely positive review, noting that [...] "Overall, tonight represented a significant step back in the right direction – and hope <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> series still has hope... More promisingly, the humor was top-notch, funnily similar to the effortless comedy of early seasons and refreshingly dissimilar to the forced, uncharacteristic stuff that has pervaded season 8." [...] Bret Davinger from the California Literary Review noted that [...] "A couple of weeks ago, I complained about The Office spending too much time away from the office. How was I to know that taking a trip to Tallahassee would produce probably the best episode of the season and maybe one of the best episodes of the past couple of seasons?" [...] Davinger went on to note that the change in scenery from the office set to Tallahassee was working for the series. In addition, he noted that episode did not feature any hints of Erin's desire to stay in Florida or Cathy's attempt to seduce Jim, a move he hoped would be permanent. [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "between 'Special Project' and 'Tallahassee' it’s fair to say that The Office is on a nice little run. Everything good and funny about last week's episode spilled over to 'Tallahassee'." [...] TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella awarded the episode four out of five stars. Despite praising the episode for coming [...] "together {{as one of the best}} Office episodes of the season," [...] he criticized Dwight's main plot, calling it [...] "not funny." [...] The Filtered Lens reviewer Matt Dougherty called the episode [...] "solid" [...] and noted [...] "While 'Tallahassee' was not quite as good as last week, it still is a step in the right direction for this struggling show." [...] He ultimately awarded the episode a 7 out of 10. Many reviews praised the episode's cold opening, with many critics calling it one of the funniest openings of the eighth season. What Culture! reviewer Jeffrey Kratzer, despite awarding the episode three out of five stars, wrote, Tallahassee' was so enjoyable (for the most part) that [...] next few episodes look to be the excitement and focused momentum we've been waiting for all season." ...|$|E

Its quite a pure area isnt it? ...|$|R
2500|$|Saygin has {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> original {{game is a}} way of proposing a less biased experimental design as it hides the participation of the computer. The imitation game also includes a [...] "social hack" [...] not found in the standard interpretation, as in the game both computer and male human are required to play as pretending to be someone they are not.|$|E
2500|$|Crawford {{admitted}} the Duncan incident {{was one of}} the biggest regrets of his career, saying [...] "The Duncan thing probably changed my life. It was just—you come to the realization <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> way you've been doing things is not the proper way and you have to regroup, not only on the court but off the court. I had seen a sports psychologist before that. But after, I saw him a lot more. ... It gave me a new perspective." ...|$|E
2500|$|The report {{recommended}} against active American {{encouragement of}} a coup, but it recommended seeking [...] "urgently {{to identify and}} build contacts with an alternative leadership if and when it appears". It opined that a successful coup appeared to be unlikely, although the assassination of Diệm or Nhu was possible. Forrestal {{also noted that the}} proposed suspension of the USD 200,000 monthly salary for the Special Forces would encourage a coup, saying [...] "It was the first sign the generals had [...] [...] [...] <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> United States was serious about this".|$|E
5000|$|... "Maybe what we're {{hearing from}} our {{politicians}} in Washington about {{how bad things}} are, how divided we are, <b>maybe</b> <b>that's</b> not true. <b>Maybe</b> <b>the</b> American people are sensible and do have this common ground." ...|$|R
5000|$|The humorous {{name and}} disillusionment with Poland's {{political}} transformation led some Poles {{to vote for}} the party. The nature of the party's appeal to its supporters was reflected in frequently-heard remarks <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> with <b>the</b> PPPP at the helm [...] "it wouldn't be better but for sure it would be funnier".|$|R
5000|$|... "I began {{thinking}} of songs and nursery rhymes {{from my own}} childhood to play to him.

2500|$|Others {{also think}} <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> two humans are symbols of {{misplaced}} asceticism - {{perhaps as much}} [...] "conceptual and imaginative" [...] as [...] "actual denial of the flesh." [...] It {{is quite possible that}} Blake is criticizing the New Testament view of a life of self-denial: the stinting of earthly desires in order to gain entrance to an after-life of bliss. The Sunflower, the Youth and the Virgin may be all mis-spending their lives, instead of living them {{in the here and now}} (what Blake called the [...] "eternal Now").|$|E
2500|$|Production of Patlabor the Movie 2 {{started after}} Kazunori Ito was {{appointed}} as the scriptwriter {{for the upcoming}} movie {{back in the early}} 1990s. The original plan called for the same plot used in the original OVA series episode [...] "The SV2's Longest Day", which showed renegade JGSDF soldiers and officers conspiring to undermine and overthrow the Japanese government. However, it was soon abandoned when Mamoru Oshii told Kazunori Ito <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> scope of terrorists causing havoc under the cover of a coup would be a better movie idea.|$|E
2500|$|... "Godric came as mysteriously {{alive for}} me as Bebb had and, with him, all the people he knew and the whole medieval world he lived in. I had Godric narrate his own life, and despite the problem of {{developing}} a language that sounded authentic on his lips without becoming impenetrably archaic, and despite the difficulties of trying to recapture {{a time and place}} so unlike my own, the book, like Lion Country before it, came so quickly and with such comparative ease that there were times when I suspected <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> old saint himself was not entirely uninvolved in the process, as, were I a saint and were somebody writing a book about me, I would not be entirely uninvolved in the process either." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{publication}} in 2005 {{of an issue}} of Green Arrow in which Anarky guest-starred, writer James Peaty juxtaposed Anarky's radical philosophy with the liberal progressive beliefs of Green Arrow: [...] "Everyone always goes on about what a radical Ollie is and I wanted to show <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> isn't <b>the</b> case... especially as Ollie's radical credentials are pretty antiquated... Anarky as a character—and as a broader idea—is much more radical than Ollie." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the week}} after his {{resignation}} from office, he was interviewed about {{the increased use of}} heavy firearms by criminals. He said <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> in <b>the</b> past firerarms didn't have the attention of the authorities, but now they rose to the challenge and he was on it. In reality he had quietly disbanded the task force on heavy weapons two months earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Charlottetown {{is a town}} {{of about}} 365 people in the Canadian {{province}} of Newfoundland and Labrador. It {{was said to be}} founded by Benjamin Powell in 1950 and named for Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island: [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> someday <b>the</b> place would be the capital of the bay, the same way Charlottetown is the capital of Prince Edward Island." ...|$|R
2500|$|After 1847, Solomos {{started writing}} in Italian once more. [...] Most works {{from this period}} are half-finished poems and prose drafts <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> poet was {{planning}} to translate into Greek. [...] Serious health problems made their appearance in 1851 and Solomos' character became even more temperamental. [...] He alienated himself from friends such as Polylas (they came on terms {{with each other in}} 1854) and after his third stroke the poet did not leave his house. [...] Solomos died in February 1857 from apoplexy. [...] His fame had reached such heights so when the news about his death became known, everyone mourned. Corfu's theater closed down, the Ionian Parliament's sessions were suspended and mourning was declared. His remains were transferred to Zakynthos in 1865.|$|E
2500|$|The Yankees' {{home opener}} of the 1978 season, on April 13 against the Chicago White Sox, {{featured}} a new product, the [...] "Reggie!" [...] bar. In 1976, while playing in Baltimore, Jackson had said, [...] "If I played in New York, they'd name {{a candy bar}} after me." [...] The Standard Brands company responded with a circular [...] "bar" [...] of peanuts dipped in caramel and covered in chocolate, a confection which was originally named the [...] "Wayne Bun" [...] as it was made in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The [...] "Reggie!" [...] bars were handed to fans as they walked into Yankee Stadium. Jackson hit a home run, and {{when he returned to}} right field the next inning, fans began throwing the Reggie bars on the field in celebration. Jackson told the press that this confused him, thinking <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> fans did not like the candy. The Yankees won the game, 4–2.|$|E
2500|$|While Montag and Mildred are perusing {{the stolen}} books, a {{sniffing}} occurs at their front door. Montag recognizes it as The Hound while Mildred passes {{it off as}} a random dog. They resume their discussion once the sound ceases, but Mildred refuses {{to go along with}} it, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He then states <b>that</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>the</b> books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the [...] "parlor walls" [...] (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.|$|E

2500|$|Damage is {{unequivocally}} {{my favorite}} {{album of the}} year so far, and I have a feeling {{that a lot of people}} who hear these songs at the right moment in their lives are going to share <b>that</b> sentiment. <b>Maybe</b> <b>the</b> connection will come on some late and sweltering summer night, and a teenage kid will be climbing into his car with heartbreak on his mind and nothing left to say.|$|R
