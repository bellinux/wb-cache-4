5|$|Clacks, 2014, by Backspindle Games (Designers: Leonard Boyd & David Brashaw), Published in {{conjunction}} with Z-Man Games. In this game players compete <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> 'message' on a clacks board while disrupting their opponents' messages. It resembles the game Amoeba, with its constantly changing board.|$|E
5|$|Educators face {{considerable}} challenges {{due to the}} nation's {{dispersed population}} and {{a certain degree of}} reluctance on the part of parents <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> children to school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, {{and more than half of}} the population is illiterate. Higher education is provided at the University of N'Djamena. At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of Sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|Even before Aurangzeb died, Bahadur ShahI {{had made}} {{preparations}} for {{a battle for}} the Mughal throne. With the help of Munim Khan, the naib subahdar of Lahore, he gathered troops from local rulers in Beas and Satluj. He had built bridges and improved the roads between Lahore and Peshawar. He was also successful in persuading Rao Budh Singh (the king of Bundi) and Bijai Singh of Kachhwa <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> soldiers to him.|$|E

5000|$|The {{organization}} was established {{with the intent}} of training groups of scientist-astronauts and making them available for hire. Research institutions, principal investigators and private spaceflight companies would engage these individuals to conduct experiments in suborbital and eventually orbital space, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> own personnel on these missions.|$|R
5|$|Following Italy's September 1911 {{invasion}} of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh {{for the joint}} Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 most of River Oaks was {{assigned}} to River Oaks Elementary School. Prior to desegregation, it had around 800 children. After desegregation, many parents removed their children from River Oaks Elementary, and the school was far below capacity. In 1986 the neighborhood component of the school closed. At the time River Oaks had mainly older families. At the time the remaining families who did have children had the money <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> children to private school and preferred to do so.|$|E
5|$|In 1952–53, South Africa's cricket {{authorities}} were hesitant <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> inexperienced team to Australia, fearing that the Test series would be uncompetitive. The Australian Board of Control's concern that—after losing {{money on the}} previous season's tour by the West Indies—the series would be another financial disaster resulted in South Africa offering an indemnity of ₤10,000 against any losses. Hassett began the season with two consecutive Sheffield Shield losses before the Tests, although he did manage 91 against South Australia before facing South Africa. He scored 123 in the return match {{later in the season}} and Victoria recorded two wins under his watch, against Queensland.|$|E

30|$|Parents’ {{pressure}} {{is easy to}} explain. Whenever you change something new, they [parents] panic. Parents are so used <b>to</b> <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> children <b>to</b> cram schools [to prepare for exams]. But now, even cram schools {{do not know how}} to teach [using inquiry]. Of course, parents panicked, so they rejected this policy.|$|R
5|$|In fact, Squall and {{the heroes}} do help Ultimecia start Time Compression, {{but they do}} so to confront her in her own time. After Squall and his party defeat Sorceress Adel, Adel {{transfers}} her power to Rinoa, then Ultimecia possesses Rinoa again, and Ellone uses her power <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> consciousness to the past, at which point Ultimecia starts Time Compression. At that moment, the heroes are able to travel to Ultimecia's distant future and defeat her. After the final battle, the defeated Ultimecia transfers her powers to Edea.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March {{the whole}} brigade {{was ordered to}} deploy to assist the civil {{authorities}} dealing with growing unrest among the Egyptian civilian population. The regiment moved to the Nile Delta on 23 March, forming a column with four armoured cars and an armoured train. Any one found rioting was arrested and tried {{in front of a}} court headed by the commanding-officer, who also imposed sentences. Within weeks the rioting was quelled and the regiment returned to their camp, remaining there until 17 June when they were ordered <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> horses to the remount depot and move to Ismailia on the Suez Canal. On 30 June they embarked on the transport ship HMNZT Ulimaroa for New Zealand and the regiment was disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Pirlo {{appeared}} {{in all three}} of Italy's group matches at UEFA Euro 2008. He was named Man of the Match in Italy's second group match, a 1–1 draw against Romania, on 13 June. On 17 June 2008, Pirlo netted a penalty as Italy defeated France 2–0 in the final group match, <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> rivals and World Cup runners-up crashing out of the European Championships in the first round. Italy lost on penalty kicks to eventual winners Spain in the quarterfinals, as Pirlo and Milan teammate Gennaro Gattuso were suspended for the match.|$|E

5|$|Players control {{one of two}} diamond trading companies: the eponymous Diamond Trust of London or {{an unnamed}} Antwerp-based competitor. The game is set in 2000 and {{the aim is to}} extract {{diamonds}} from Angola before the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is put in place. The winner is the one who finishes the game with the most diamonds after nine turns. Each turn, players decide where <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> three agents. They can be sent to six different Angolan regions to extract diamonds, or recalled to the player's headquarters to deposit extracted diamonds. Players make decisions in secret, and both sets of decisions are resolved on the game board simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Thousands of {{residents}} evacuated coastal areas of South Carolina, {{many of whom}} stayed at inland hotels; 850people sought protection in shelters, including 500 at an elementary school in Horry County and 240 in a shelter in the Grand Strand. In Beaufort County, city and county offices were closed early and businesses were advised <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> workers home prematurely. Officials in Chatham County, Georgia evacuated nursing homes on Tybee Island, and encouraged others to leave due to the potential for high tides to isolate the island by cutting off U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|Ursula Maria Martius {{was born}} in Munich, Germany on September 16, 1921. Her mother was Jewish and an art {{historian}} and her father, an ethnographer, came from an old German Protestant family. Because of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, her parents tried <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> only child to school in Britain when World War II broke out, but the British refused to issue a student visa to anyone under 18. Ursula studied chemistry and physics at Berlin University until she was expelled by the Nazis. Her parents were interned in concentration camps while Franklin herself {{was sent to a}} forced labour camp. The family survived The Holocaust and was reunited in Berlin after the war.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, the {{inhabitants}} of conquered cities were frequently massacred during the Crusades against the Muslims in the 11th and 12th centuries. Noblemen could hope to be ransomed; their families would have <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> captors large sums of wealth commensurate with the social status of the captive.|$|R
5|$|When Ross {{arrived at}} the school, he found no running water, a housing shortage, a disgruntled faculty, and many {{students}} running wild. As Ross began to make improvements, parents began <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> children to the school {{in the hopes that}} they would learn from Ross's example. Although enrollment had always been limited to men, in 1893, Ethel Hudson, the daughter of an A professor, became the first woman to attend classes at the school and helped edit the annual yearbook. She was made an honorary member of the class of 1895. Several years later her twin sisters became honorary members of the class of 1903, and slowly other daughters of Aggie professors were allowed to attend classes.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of this engagement, the trapped Pompée and Hannibal were under heavy fire from the {{anchored}} Formidable {{and an array of}} Spanish batteries and gunboats, both ships taking severe damage without being able to effectively reply as their main broadsides now faced away from the enemy. On Hannibal the situation seemed hopeless: as casualties mounted, the main and mizen masts were shot away and the ship remained firmly and irretrievably grounded. Pompée was in a slightly better position: Sterling's rigging was in tatters, but his masts held and his ship was at least afloat, although totally becalmed. At one stage, Pompées colours were shot away, leading to French claims that the ship had surrendered, although they were quickly replaced. At 11:30, no longer able to contribute to the battle with rigging torn and more than 70 casualties, Saumarez ordered the remainder of the squadron <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> remaining boats to tow Pompée out of danger, the boats coming under heavy fire as they did so, with a number sunk.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E
2500|$|Israel's Pupils' Rights Law of 2000 prohibits {{discrimination}} {{of students}} for sectarian reasons in admission to or expulsion from an educational institution, in establishment of separate educational curricula or holding of separate {{classes in the}} same educational institution, and in rights and obligations of pupils.

5|$|The local Polish {{population}} {{felt that}} Warsaw had betrayed {{them and they}} were not satisfied with the division of Cieszyn Silesia. About 12,000 to 14,000 Poles were forced to leave to Poland. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates (depending mainly whether the Silesians are included as Poles or not) range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles filled in Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities but reality in Zaolzie was quite different. Local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>their</b> children there. Czechs schools were built in ethnically almost entirely Polish municipalities. This and other factors contributed to the cultural assimilation of Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After few years, the heightened nationalism typical for the years around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not follow certain laws related to language, legislative and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put those issues on agenda. One way or the other, more and more local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.|$|E
5|$|Local Czech militants forced about 5,000 local Poles, {{mostly from}} the {{northern}} part of the region, to flee to Poland already before July 1920. 4,000 of these expellees were located in a transitional camps in Oświęcim. About 12,000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia.
