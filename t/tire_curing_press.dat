50|$|Curing is {{the process}} of {{applying}} pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger <b>tires</b> <b>cure</b> in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic <b>curing</b> <b>press</b> types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds.|$|R

50|$|Tires {{are complex}} {{composite}} structures made {{of many different}} components that are assembled on a drum and cured in a mold. As a result, there are many conditions that result in RFV.

All of these factors can lead to variations in the material distribution and thickness that are modelled as spring length. The various tire components also are made from different materials, each of which exhibit variation in their elastic properties. These variations are influenced by rubber viscoelastic properties, mixing dispersion and uniformity, and cure heat history, among other things.|$|R

50|$|The {{chemical}} process of vulcanization {{is a type}} of cross-linking that changes rubber to the hard, durable material associated with car and bike tires. This process is often called sulfur curing; the term vulcanization comes from Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. This is, however, a slower process. A typical car <b>tire</b> is <b>cured</b> for 15 minutes at 150 °C. However, the time can be reduced by the addition of accelerators such as 2-benzothiazolethiol or tetramethylthiuram disulfide. Both of these contain a sulfur atom in the molecule that initiates the reaction of the sulfur chains with the rubber. Accelerators increase the rate of cure by catalysing the addition of sulfur chains to the rubber molecules.|$|R

The mechanism of crosslinking of hexamethylene diamine and 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 6 -hexanediamine is well known and occurs in four different steps. To elaborate a film of commercially available poly(VDF-co-HFP) copolymer crosslinked by 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 6 -hexanediamine, a step of <b>press</b> <b>cure</b> under air is necessary. Temperature, time and pressure were optimised by regarding the solubility of the <b>press</b> <b>cured</b> films, the mechanical properties, the swelling rate in methyl ethyl ketone, and the degradation of the films. The best temperature, time and pressure for <b>press</b> <b>cure</b> were 150 C, from 15 to 30 min, and 20 bars, respectively. Other properties of crosslinked poly(VDFco- HFP) copolymers containing 10 mol. % and 20 mol. % of HFP were characterized. First, all films were insoluble in concentrated HCl. Secondly, swelling rates of different amounts of diamine crosslinked copolymers were measured in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate and in methyl ethyl ketone; it was proved that the higher the molar percentage of diamine, the higher the crosslinking density, so the lower the swelling rate. Concerning thermal properties, glass transition temperature mainly increased when the amount of diamine increased. Thermal stability measurements showed a higher decomposition temperature when the percentage of diamine was very low (5 mol. %). Finally, mechanical properties were measured by dynamic mechanical analysis; the storage tensile modulus (E 0) of a diamine crosslinked Kynar copolymer versus temperature exhibited a high drop because Kynar was a highly amorphous copolymer. Moreover, the higher the amount of diamine, the higher the rubbery modulus...|$|R

50|$|Given {{that the}} tire is an {{assembly}} of multiple components that are cured in a mold, {{there are many}} process variations that cause <b>cured</b> <b>tires</b> to be classified as rejects.

A depression is a strong spot that does not expand in equal measure as the surrounding area. Both are deemed visual defects. Tires are measured in production to identify those with excessive visual defects. Bulges may also indicate defective construction conditions such as missing cords, which pose a safety hazard.
