50|$|The RB26DETT N1 is a {{modified}} version of the RB26DETT engine, developed by Nismo (Nissan Motorsports) for Group A and Group N motorsport. Nismo found that the standard RB26DETT engine required too much maintenance for use in a Group-A or Group-N race car and subsequently designed the N1 block. This was first used in Bathurst Australia. Nismo balanced the crankshaft to a higher specification than stock, as the RB26DETT engine experiences vibrations between 7000 and 8000 rpm. The engine also received improved water and oil channels within the engine block. The pistons and <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> rings were also upgraded to 1.2 mm.

50|$|The {{key feature}} of the GSX engine was the change from the common two-valve per {{cylinder}} hemispherical combustion chamber with domed piston design of the GS engine, to a four-valve per cylinder Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber (TSCC) with flat <b>topped</b> <b>piston</b> design. The TSCC design was essentially a modification of the Pent-roof combustion chamber design to which was added a slightly raised ridge running along the combustion chamber roof parallel to the gas flow of the inlet charge. This was to encourage controlled swirl of the incoming fuel-air charge {{in order to increase}} the fuel burn speed through better flame front propagation. The higher burn speed, coupled with lowered heat loss from the shallower combustion chambers created by comparatively narrow included valve angles and the flat <b>topped</b> <b>piston</b> meant that the GSX engines produced more power and torque than the same sized GS mills.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the fatal}} flight, the Lockheed L-049 Constellation {{known as the}} Clipper Eclipse had {{suffered}} engine problems during a flight earlier that week. This had required it to turn back near Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador on the outbound leg of the journey, and delayed it for two days. A cylinder was replaced in the number 2 engine, as a failure in the <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> ring was found. A further problem was found in that engine {{later in the week}} while in Rome. Captain Joseph Hart, Jr., and chief purser Anthony Volpe were walking under the wing when Volpe spotted what he thought was oil dripping from the engine.

50|$|From 1991 to 1998 the {{connecting}} rods were forged steel with standard type crank pin bearings. SOHC engines, for 1991-1998, used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs from 1991-2002 {{aimed at reducing}} oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between {{the top of the}} piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports {{on the bottom of the}} pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new hypereutectic design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a powder forged design and cracked bearing caps. The piston pins floated in {{the connecting}} rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the piston pins being retained with snap rings.|$|E
50|$|Another {{design element}} {{that can be}} {{included}} into the sample assembly is a thermocouple.

The side entry thermocouple reads the temperature closer to the sample center, but the placement usually involves a hole to be drilled {{in the middle of the}} furnace, altering the heating characteristics of the furnace. To avoid both downside associated with wither thermocouple some sample assemblies do not use a thermocouple; temperature is instead either calibrated from the relationship of watts vs. temperature or calculated using the known pressure and calculated sample volume from in-situ x-ray diffraction data.|$|E

5000|$|The Super Duty was {{introduced}} in 1958, {{the same year as}} the FE and MEL series V8 engines, as a replacement for the Lincoln Y-block in truck applications. The Super Duty was available in displacements of 401, 477 and 534 cubic inches (6.6L, 7.8L and 8.8L). These engines were large, heavy, high torque engines and operated at a relatively low RPM. They were never designed as automobile engines and were commonly found in large, industrial use vehicles including dump trucks, garbage trucks, concrete mixing trucks, large buses and other medium and heavy duty trucks of the time. The Super Duty engine was built in Ford's Cleveland engine plant number 2. They had a unique intake system where the intake dumped into the head and all four cylinders pulled the mixture out of a log type port in the head. They could spit when cold and blow the choke plate out into the air cleaner because of the large port configuration. In later engines this was corrected; they had a spider type intake more modern style. The exhaust valves were sodium filled that when hot it liquefied and carried heat away from the valve head and took it to the valve spring that dispensed heat into the oil coming off the rocker arm which is the reason for a water to oil cooler. The piston assembly weighed three times more than other gas engine manufactures. The block was unique in that it was a 90 degree v 8 but the top deck was 60 degrees. The head was flat on the combustion chamber side so by doing this they achieved a wedge combustion chamber. With this design it left a big hole so they put a large pop <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> to try to displace some volume. They used a deep skirted block for strength. They governed these at about 3400 rpm due to their great rotating mass. When ford built the 385 series engine and started to change over a 460 or 429 weighed about half of the 477.

40|$|With {{tightening}} emission regulations, increased expected fuel economy, {{and longer}} drain intervals impacting on lubricant formulation, {{greater understanding of}} how oil degrades in an automotive engine is becoming ever more important. Equally significant is the effect that this degraded lubricant has on the tribological operation of the engine, particularly its overall internal friction and component wear. In a previous paper, four tests to degrade oil in a single cylinder engine were reported [1].

40|$|Chrome plating is {{routinely}} {{being used in}} piston rings in the automobile industry. However, as the emission norms are getting tightened, the working surface temperature of <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> rings needs to be increased. Consequently wear increases and hence the need for better wear resistant coatings on piston rings. We have identified sputter deposited CrN as a suitable replacement for hard chrome for piston rings. CrN coatings were deposited on steel, silicon and other substrates using a reactive DC magnetron sputtering process. As CrN exists in different phases (i. e., cubic-CrN and hexagonal-Cr 2 N), process parameters were optimized to achieve single phase of CrN with varying hardness values. The basic properties of CrN such as: structure, mechanical properties, thermal stability, oxidation resistance and corrosion behavior have been studied in detail using X-ray diffraction, nanoindentation, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, micro-Raman spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarization, etc. For a comparison, we have also evaluated the properties of TiN coatings. Cubic-CrN coatings with different thicknesses (about 1. 5, 3, 4. 5, 6 and 10 m) have also been deposited on various steel samples for wear measurements.

40|$|In {{spite of}} much {{progress}} {{in the development of}} gasoline direct injection (GDI) engines, choosing an appropriate piston top contour to obtain desirable combustion efficiency is still an arduous process for engineers. This study investigates the combined effects of piston bowl geometry and a charge motion control valve (CMCV) on tumble flow and combustion features in GDI engines. Based on the model validation, the processes of intake, spray, mixture formation and combustion at different engine speeds are simulated and analyzed for different piston shapes for the two cases of opening and closing the CMCV. The results show that the bowl on the top of piston is beneficial for the formation and development of tumble flow. The flat <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> with the CMCV closed is able to achieve acceptable combustion pressure. However, with the increase of engine speed and load, the advantages of the flat top pistons gradually disappear; the dual offset bowl piston has a minimum tumble ratio and turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) {{at the end of the}} compression stroke because of the projection in the middle of the piston top surface which leads to a lower pressure rise rate and a reduced flame propagation speed at high load. The closed CMCV contributes to a faster evaporation rate and a more uniform mixture at lower speeds. It is not recommended for use at high speeds due to lower intake air mass and reduced combustion pressure. The research provides an effective way for engineers to choose an appropriate piston top contour combined with a CMCV to obtain desirable combustion efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Reducing {{emissions}} is a {{top priority}} within heavy duty diesel engine development and research. The power cylinder system is a main contributor to emissions and accounts for about 50 % of the total frictional losses found in the engine, so is important to optimize. Reducing frictional losses will lead to reduced consumption of fuel which results in reduced CO 2 emission. It is possible to simplify the experimental testing of engine components by stratified testing, enabling cost-effective screening of candidate material concepts. In a component specific tribometer test, components are studied individually which results in a decreased number of noise factors compared to full scale testing. The vision for general tribological testing {{is to create a}} test environment capable of reproducing full scale engine conditions. The objective of this work is to develop and verify a tribometer test method capable of reproduce the real engine behavior for boundary and mixed lubrication regimes in order to minimize frictional losses and wear. To make sure of an accurate comparison is made between rig parameters and the contact parameters of the engine the Hersey parameter is solved for the contact between top ring and cylinder liner for the engine. The input parameters for the tribometer experiments are then selected so that the test rig reproduces the contact conditions of the <b>top</b> <b>piston</b> ring in the engine in the vicinity of combustion top dead centre. Three types of cylinder liner materials/surfaces are tested with a novel type of tribometer test cycle setup were dynamic viscosity, contact pressure and contact velocity are varied according to a design-of-experiment setup. It was shown that for a material/surface with lower friction the importance of dynamic viscosity and velocity increases. For a material/surface with higher friction only contact pressure is of importance. This means that a surface {{has to be able to}} generate conditions for oil film buildup, otherwise the properties of oil and the velocity have little or no significance on friction. For the materials studied in this work it is apparent that surface roughness is important regardless of material properties. The parameters of highest importance for controlling friction are found to be those describing the plateau part of the surface. To better understand the correlations between friction and surface roughness a future study should include a study of similar materials with different roughness values. The effectiveness of the tribometer methodology should also be validated against full-scale tests...|$|E

HSO and CSO used 9. 1 to 42. 6 % and 0 to 43. 1 % more fuel than MD fuel for all engine speeds. Mean NOx increased by 11. 4 to 40. 2 % for HSO and 15. 7 to 35. 1 % for CSO above 1800 rpm compared with RME. NOx was higher by 11. 9 to 34. 6 % for HSO and by 16. 2 to 29. 7 % higher for CSO for all engine speeds than WCOME. Both HSO and CSO increased NOx by 6. 9 to 55. 1 % and 5. 1 to 56. 9 % compared with MD fuel above 1800 rpm. RME and WCOME gave 2. 2 to 26. 7 % and 1. 8 to 25 % greater NOx respectively than MD fuel above 3750 rpm.

For 1975, Ford dealt with this problem by decreasing the compression ratio further with a larger 15cc piston dish and reducing ignition timing. However the 400 V8 obtained {{a reputation for being}} prone to detonation. [...] Although Ford did not make a piston to correct this, TMeyer Inc worked with Keith Black pistons to make a 400 piston that increases the compression ratio and gives the piston a [...] "zero deck" [...] deck clearance.|$|R
