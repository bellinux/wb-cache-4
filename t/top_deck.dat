5|$|Neither of Go Man Go's parents raced. His sire (father), the Thoroughbred {{stallion}} <b>Top</b> <b>Deck,</b> was bred by the King Ranch. His dam (mother) {{hailed from}} Louisiana; Go Man Go {{is thought to}} have gained his swiftness on the track from her. For the first years of Go Man Go's racing career, his owner faced difficulty in registering him with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), a matter that remained unresolved until 1958.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in.|$|E

5|$|The vintage de Havilland Tiger Moth {{appears as}} a scale model for {{sequences}} such as Alan and Tin-Tin's departure from Tracy Island and Brains' arrival on the <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of Skyship One. The production team also decided to arrange a live-action location shoot in Buckinghamshire to star a full-sized biplane. Joan Hughes, an experienced pilot who had flown Supermarine Spitfires and Avro Lancasters from factories to airbases during the Second World War, was selected to fly the aircraft. Sequences that comprise live-action filming include Brains launching the Tiger Moth from a field to rescue the occupants of Skyship One, Penelope's subsequent struggle to control the aircraft, the gun battle with Foster's remaining henchmen, the near collisions with the motorway bridge and the exhaust tower, and the final crash-landing. For the later sequences, stunt dummies fixed to the Tiger Moth's wings and undercarriage represent the characters of Alan, Tin-Tin, Parker, Brains and the White Ghost agents, while Hughes doubles for Penelope in the cockpit. The location filming was based at Wycombe Air Park.|$|E
5|$|Within {{ten minutes}} of the first shot, Junons <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> was almost {{completely}} cleared and Shortland had been taken below, his leg broken by grapeshot and his body pierced by several large wooden splinters. Lieutenant Samuel Bartlett Deecker assumed command, and successfully beat off a boarding attack from Clorinde. Pulling Junon clear off the two full-strength French frigates, Deecker tried to escape but found his ship unresponsive. Within minutes, Roquebert and Saint-Cricq had regained their positions {{on either side of}} the British frigate and boarded simultaneously, forcing Deecker to surrender at 18:15. The British had suffered heavy losses, with 20 killed and 40 wounded, including Shortland. The prisoners were dispersed among the French squadron and rather than spare the men required to repair and crew the battered Junon, Roquebert had the frigate set on fire and abandoned. French losses were also severe, Renommée losing 15 killed and three wounded and Clorinde six killed and 15 wounded. Loire, Seine, and HMS Observateur suffered no losses at all.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} onto the <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> but is confronted by Foster {{and his two}} {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The plastic {{construction}} kit company Airfix {{produced a}} 1:144 scale {{model of the}} SR.N4 in the early 1970s, with a clear plastic <b>top</b> <b>decking</b> to show the detailed interior.|$|R
2500|$|There were no {{personal}} injuries. The fire did, however, cause severe {{damage to the}} <b>top</b> <b>decks,</b> whilst {{the rest of the}} yacht escaped virtually undamaged.

50|$|The SK-2 was {{a minimum}} change fighter {{derivative}} of the SK-1 {{with a normal}} protruding enclosed cockpit, normal light alloy wing skinning, enlarged fin and rudder, and two 12.7mm BS machine-guns in the <b>top</b> <b>decking</b> of the forward fuselage. Flown in October 1940 by G.M. Shiyanov, but no production was authorised.|$|R
5|$|Roquebert {{had learned}} the correct signals for Spanish {{shipping}} from captured Spanish merchant ships and, having lured Junon within range, opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junons rigging. Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside, Shortland returned fire {{as best he could}} while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage. As Junon closed with the flagship, Clorinde attacked her from the other side and the flûtes took up stations fore and aft, repeatedly raking the British ship. Observateur had been some distance behind Junon when the action began, and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships. Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range, but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron. As Observateur escaped, Junon was pounded from all sides, Roquebert's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided, inflicting further damage. The French squadron was so close to Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British <b>top</b> <b>deck,</b> killing many of the sailors manning the guns.|$|E

25|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{were carried}} out at the Halifax Shipyard. The two <b>top</b> <b>decks</b> were cut away and light-cruiser superstructure was fitted, eliminating the boat deck cabins and lounges. The hull and deck were stiffened and some watertight subdivision added. All three ships suffered from the basic weakness of large cargo and accommodation compartments extending across their hulls.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is built}} up as a wooden truss with a plywood-covered stressed-skin <b>top</b> <b>decking</b> and wooden semi-monocoque forward fuselage.

50|$|The Tern was {{constructed}} of wood with a fabric-covered two-spar cantilevered tapered wing with no dihedral. A plywood leading edge was fitted {{but only as}} an aerodynamic fairing and not as primary structure.

5000|$|Like the Sopwith Snipe it replaced, the Grebe was a single-seat, single-engined biplane of fabric-covered wood construction. The {{fuselage}} had ash longerons and spruce stringers {{joined to}} plywood formers, while the single-bay wings (which had a considerable overhang outboard of the struts), had fabric-covered spruce spars and ribs. Two synchronised [...]303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns were {{mounted on the}} fuselage <b>top</b> <b>decking.</b>|$|R
25|$|Almost {{one hour}} after {{the attacks on the}} London Underground, a fourth bomb was detonated on the <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> of a number 30 {{double-decker}} bus, a Dennis Trident 2 (fleet number 17758, registration LX03BUF, two years in service at the time) operated by Stagecoach London and travelling its route from Marble Arch to Hackney Wick.|$|E
25|$|The {{machinery}} of the <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> and forecastle was integrated within the ship, concealing it and releasing {{nearly all the}} exposed deck space for passengers. As such {{it was the only}} ocean liner to have a regulation-sized open air tennis court on board. The air conditioner units were concealed along with the kennels inside the third, dummy, funnel.|$|E
25|$|The {{forward section}} of the {{fuselage}} was divided into three levels. The <b>top</b> <b>deck</b> housed the pilots and wireless station, the middle the engine compartment and the lower the bombardiers, fuel tanks and payload. It has to be noted that this configuration {{would have made the}} aircraft top heavy when, after expending its fuel and weapon payload, it eventually landed.|$|E

25|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Mott MacDonald. The firm designed an early iteration of the bridge in 1982, with a two lane dual carriageway on the <b>top</b> <b>deck,</b> and a light railway on the lower deck. The bridge was redesigned beginning in 1989 {{to account for the}} three lane dual highway and the heavier airport railway. The designers were inspired by the Forth Bridge in Scotland and the Severn Bridge in England.|$|E
50|$|The F 5 was a low-wing tandem two-seat {{monoplane}} which {{retained the}} fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage {{of the earlier}} Fieseler F 4 but introduced a new two-spar cantilever wing.
