5|$|That night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill {{just north}} of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled their homes. In the house where Morgan stayed, <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> set with supper which {{he and his men}} ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the {{telegraph}} lines again and began sending false reports that they were headed for New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. As they passed up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{court upheld}} a {{socio-economic}} ranking system for commoners and nobles, {{which was based}} on the twenty-ranks system installed by the statesman Shang Yang (d. 338 BCE) of the State of Qin. All males above the age of 15 (excluding slaves) could be promoted in rank up to level eight. When a commoner was promoted in rank, he was granted a more honorable place in the seating arrangements of hamlet banquets, was given a greater portion of hunted game at <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>was</b> punished less severely for certain crimes, and could become exempt from labor service obligations to the state. This system favored the elderly, since a longer lifespan meant more opportunities to become promoted. In addition to an increase in salary (see table to the right), newly promoted men were granted wine and ox-meat for a celebratory banquet. The 19th and 20th ranks were both marquess ranks, yet only a 20th rank allowed one to have a marquessate fief.|$|E

5000|$|It {{can now be}} {{made clear}} why the payment for an {{insertion}} is 3. 1 pays for the first insertion of the element, 1 pays for moving the element the next time <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded, and 1 pays for moving an older element the next time <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded. Intuitively, this explains why an element's contribution never [...] "runs out" [...] regardless of how many times <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> expanded: since <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>is</b> always doubled, <b>the</b> newest half always covers the cost of moving the oldest half.|$|R

25|$|The Round Table is King Arthur's famed {{table in}} the Arthurian legend, around which he and his Knights congregate. As its name suggests, it has no head, {{implying}} that everyone who sits there has equal status. <b>The</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> first described in 1155 by Wace, who relied on previous depictions of Arthur's fabulous retinue. The symbolism of the Round Table developed over time; by {{the close of the}} 12th century it had come to represent the chivalric order associated with Arthur's court, the Knights of the Round Table.|$|E
25|$|In {{a modern}} table saw, {{the depth of}} the cut is varied by moving the blade up and down: the higher the blade {{protrudes}} above the table, the deeper the cut that is made in the material. In some early table saws, the blade and arbor were fixed, and <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> moved up and down to expose more or less of the blade. The angle of cut is controlled by adjusting the angle of blade. Some earlier saws angled the table to control the cut angle.|$|E
25|$|The {{portion of}} the Tabular methods section above {{describes}} the historical arguments and methods by which the present dates of Easter Sunday were decided in the late 16th century by the Catholic Church. In Britain, where the Julian calendar was then still in use, Easter Sunday was defined, from 1662 to 1752 (in accordance with previous practice), by a simple table of dates in the Anglican Prayer Book (decreed by the Act of Uniformity 1662). <b>The</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> indexed directly by the golden number and the Sunday letter, which (in the Easter section of the book) were presumed to be already known.|$|E

25|$|By {{the summer}} of 2003, the Progressive Conservatives {{received}} an unexpected opportunity to re-gain popularity {{in the form of}} the 2003 North American blackout. When the blackout hit, Eves initially received criticism for his late response; however, as he led a series of daily briefings to the press in the days after the blackout, Eves was able to demonstrate leadership and stayed cool under pressure. The crisis also allowed Eves to highlight his principal campaign themes of experience, proven competence and ability to handle the government. When polls began to register a moderate increase for the Conservatives, <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> set for an election call.|$|E
25|$|The eldest male at <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> always served first, {{commonly}} {{served to}} them in the men's quarters by the women of the house. Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their chopsticks or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of {{contributors to the}} Mishnah state that <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> of the same dimensions as the loaves - 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, but Rabbi Akiva contributed a dissenting view, according to which there was {{a gap between the}} piles of shewbread, with the table being 12 Etzba long, and 6 Etzba wide; Abba Saul argued that the cups of incense were placed within the gap. These dimensions clearly are too small for the loaves to rest on the table lengthways, and clearly some support would have been needed for them to be piled high upon the table in two distinct piles, which is difficult to reconcile with the apparent biblical implication that the loaves were free standing on the table.|$|E

25|$|At {{the north}} end of the Chamber is the Speaker's Chair, a present to Parliament from the Commonwealth of Australia. The current British Speaker's Chair is an exact copy of the Speaker's Chair given to Australia, by the House of Commons, to {{celebrate}} the opening of Old Parliament House, Canberra. In front of the Speaker's Chair is the Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, and on which is placed the Commons' ceremonial mace. <b>The</b> <b>Table</b> <b>was</b> a gift from Canada. The dispatch boxes, which front-bench Members of Parliament (MPs) often lean on or rest notes on during Questions and speeches, are a gift from New Zealand. There are green benches on either side of the House; members of the Government party occupy benches on the Speaker's right, while those of the Opposition occupy benches on the Speaker's left. There are no cross-benches as in the House of Lords. The Chamber is relatively small, and can accommodate only 427 of the 650 Members of Parliament—during Prime Minister's Questions and in major debates MPs stand at either end of the House.|$|E
25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>was</b> covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for a moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E
