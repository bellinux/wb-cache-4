40|$|Boiling water reactor (BWR) {{plants are}} {{equipped}} with safety/relief valves (SRVs) to protect the reactor from overpressurization. Plant operational transients, such as <b>turbine</b> <b>trips,</b> will actuate the SRV. Once the SRV opens, steam released from the reactor is discharged through SRV lines to the suppression pool in the primary containment. Steam is then condensed in the suppression pool in a stable condition. Extended steam blowdown into the pool, however, will heat the pool to a level where the condensation process may become unstable. This instability of steam condensation may cause severe vibratory loads on containment structures.

This study is divided in three parts. As an introduction, {{a brief description of the}} code RAMONA- 4 B.

Finally, the reactor behavior during a <b>turbine</b> <b>trip</b> transient is numerically simulated through the description of nuclear and thermal hydraulic parameters and under the scenario conditions suggested by General Electric. The SBWR model consists of the representation of the vessel internal components through parameters such as areas, diameters and volumes, and the one-quarter-core neutron parameters which were obtained using the transport theory lattice physics code CASMO- 3. The thermohydraulic equations are solved by RAMONA- 4 B in a closed-contour inside the vessel and in a hundred eighty four parallel channels (including bypass) in the core. The tridimensional representation of the reactor core is accomplished through a proposed fuel load which was obtained from a selection of out of three fuel loads and using some standard fuel design parameters. The cross sections are represented using a polynomial as a function of the bumup, void fraction, fuel and moderator temperatures. The six-group delayed neutron equation and the one-and-a-half neutron diffusion equation are solved and the power distribution in the reactor core is obtained.

First, a steady state solution was obtained and the transient solutions were then obtained for the <b>turbine</b> <b>trip</b> test conducted in December 1995.

Nowadays, the coupled codes method, which consists in incorporating three-dimensional (3 D) neutron modeling of the reactor core into system codes, is extensively used. It is particularly suited for simulating transients that involve core spatial asymmetric phenomena and strong feedback effects between core neutronics and reactor loop thermal-hydraulics. Within this framework the Peach Bottom BWR 2 <b>Turbine</b> <b>Trip</b> test was selected since it involves a rapid pressw"e induced positive reactivity addition into the core.

The model contains the most criticalcomponents in the steam system from reactor tank to condenser and also the mostimportant parts of the control systems. The final model has been compared to real power plant data from Ringhals 1 for fullpower operation, reduced power and a <b>turbine</b> <b>trip.</b> During steady state conditionsthe model has good compliance with the available data in most positions of the steamsystem. Due to absence of good data the results of the dynamic verification for thedrop of load and <b>turbine</b> <b>trip</b> is incomplete. Instead the plausibility of the systembehavior has been done. The results are good but the magnitudes of the transientsare impossible to evaluate. Two major weaknesses have been found during the verification of the model. Theyare the turbine behavior during off-design load and various transients, and the controlof the flow through the tube side of the reheater. The lack of mass flow data is alsomaking it hard to fully trust the model. The final conclusion is that the steam system model is not ready to take on realproblems, but it is a good basis for further development and utilization. The abovementioned problems have to be looked further into and depending on the intendedusage of the model; {{it may be necessary to}} modify it to more exactly describe certainparts of the steam system...|$|R
