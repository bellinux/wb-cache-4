5|$|These two adaptations {{received}} mainly positive reviews, with <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> {{being that}} they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although Hobo with a Shotgun was not as big a box office success in the U.S. {{as it was in}} Canada, it has since gained a cult following there.|$|E
5|$|While {{residents}} {{along the}} NY63 corridor {{are against the}} increased truck traffic along the corridor (spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement), most of those same residents, along with other groups, also fought the proposed expressway. <b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> {{of all of these}} groups is that NYSDOT should impose restrictions on the NY63 corridor and force trucks to remain on I-390 and the Thruway to travel between Buffalo and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures gave Spider-Man 3 a US {{release on}} May 4, 2007. The film begins with Peter Parker basking in his success as Spider-Man before an {{extraterrestrial}} symbiote takes control of him. Peter must then battle a rival photographer that the symbiote then takes control of (Topher Grace) and the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). <b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> among critics {{was that the}} final installment was not as refined as the first two entries, with it being criticized for its excessive use of villains, romantic conflicts and weak plot points. Nonetheless, Spider-Man 3 surpassed the previous two films' openings, making $151 million at over 4,250 locations.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as evidence of great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E

50|$|Currently, Siamoperadectes is {{considered}} to be a peradectid metatherian, and in particular closely related to Sinoperadectes and Junggaroperadectes. Though described as a didelphid in the original paper, <b>the</b> current <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> is that peradectids are outside of crown-group Marsupialia, and their appearance in the Late Cretaceous greatly predates the estimated initial divergence within marsupials 45 million years ago.|$|R

25|$|Both {{negative}} and positive affect {{play a role in}} forgiveness interventions.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> in {{the field}} {{is that there is a}} derivational {{relationship}} between verbs undergoing the causative alternation that share the same lexical entry. From this it follows that there is uncertainty surrounding which form, the intransitive or the intransitive, is the base from which the other is derived. Another matter of debate is whether the derivation takes place at the syntactic or lexical level.|$|E
25|$|While <b>the</b> <b>general</b> {{scientific}} <b>consensus</b> is that hypnosis cannot induce {{individuals to}} engage in conduct {{in which they would}} not otherwise engage, the Model Penal Code, as well as the criminal codes of Montana, New York, and Kentucky do provide hypnosis and hypnotic suggestion as negating volition, and consequently, actus reus.|$|R

25|$|Dravidian {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{language}} families in the Nostratic proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the Fertile Crescent sometime between the last Ice Age and the emergence of proto-Indo-European 4–6 thousand years BCE.

25|$|Indeed, many Tunisians {{at first}} welcomed the {{progressive}} changes {{brought about by}} the French, but <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> that evolved was that Tunisians preferred to manage their own affairs. Before the French conquest, during the 1860s and 1870s Khair al-Din had introduced modernizing reforms in Tunisia. His innovative ideas, although acknowledging the ascendancy of Europe, remained conversant with Islamic tradition and favored reform on Islamic terms. He wrote an influential book.|$|E

25|$|Schopenhauer praises Kant for his {{distinction}} between appearance and the things-in-themselves that appear, whereas <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> in German Idealism {{was that this}} was the weakest spot of Kant’s theory, since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances, as Kant argued. The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>general</b> <b>consensus</b> is that {{theoretical}} fractals are infinitely self-similar, iterated, {{and detailed}} mathematical constructs having fractal dimensions, of which many examples have been formulated and studied in great depth.

Fractal patterns with various degrees of self-similarity have been rendered or studied in images, structures and sounds and found in nature, technology, art, and law. Fractals are of particular relevance in the field of chaos theory, since the graphs of most chaotic processes are fractal.|$|E
