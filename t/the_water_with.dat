5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} forages mainly by diving from <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> <b>with</b> dives usually lasting less than 30 seconds. These dives are usually shorter in time when in more shallow water. In between dives, this grebe rests {{for an average}} of 15 seconds. It also forages by {{gleaning}} foliage, plucking objects off of the surface of water, having its head submerged while swimming, and sometimes capturing flying insects.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{compared}} {{the effect on}} weight loss of either replacing diet beverages (DBs) <b>with</b> <b>water</b> or continuing to consume DBs (study 1 in healthy overweight and obese, n= 89 and study 2 in patients with type 2 diabetes, n= 81) adults during a 24 -wk weight-loss program (for study 1 and 2) and 18 month weight loss and weight maintenance plan (for study 3, n= 89). In study 1, compared with the DB group, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group had a greater decrease in weight (1. 2 kg more weight loss in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P= 0. 015), BMI (0. 5 kg/m² more BMI reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P= 0. 002), fasting insulin (1 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (0. 2 more HOMA-IR reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P< 0. 001) and 2 -h postprandial glucose(0. 305 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001). In study 2, weight (2. 5 kg more weight loss in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 005) and BMI (0. 9 kg/m² more BMI reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 005) decrease after 18 months in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs group was significant. There was also a greater reduction in fasting insulin levels (1. 8 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001), better improvement in HOMA-IR (0. 5 more HOMA-IR reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P< 0. 001), a greater decrease in 2 -h postprandial plasma glucose (0. 5 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P< 0. 001) and glycated hemoglobin (0. 2 more HbA 1 c reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 030) in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs over 18 months. In study 3, obese participants with Type 2 diabetes in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group of study 2 had more weight loss (1. 16 kg more weight loss in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 006) and BMI (0. 5 kg/m² more BMI reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 006). Also reduction of fasting insulin (1. 6 mU/l more Fasting insulin reduction in <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> DBs Group,P< 0. 001), fasting plasma glucose (0. 3 mmol/l more Fasting plasma glucose reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 003), HOMA-IR (0. 7 more HOMA-IR reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 003) and 2 hour postprandial glucose (0. 3 mmol/l more 2 hpp reduction in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> DBs Group, P= 0. 027) was greater in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> group. By contrast, changes in waist circumference and lipid profiles {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups in these three studies. Replacement of DBs <b>with</b> <b>water</b> after <b>the</b> main meal in obese and overweight healthy and type 2 diabetic women who were regular users of DBs may cause greater weight reduction during 24 weeks and also in the longer period of an 18 month weight management program. In addition, replacement of DBs <b>with</b> <b>water</b> offers clinical benefits to improve insulin resistance. Generally, better improvements in energy and carbohydrate metabolism may occur when water rather than DBs is consumed over a weight loss program...|$|R
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening to keep its plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E
5|$|Behind {{schedule}} and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E

5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E

5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks feed {{primarily}} {{in summer and}} live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking krill and small schooling fish such as juvenile Atlantic and Pacific salmon, herring, capelin and American sand lance, as well as Atlantic mackerel, pollock and haddock in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and copepods are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> pectoral fins or flukes.|$|E
5|$|Magical healing spells, {{which were}} used by Egyptians of all classes, are the source for an {{important}} portion of the myth, in which Horus is poisoned or otherwise sickened, and Isis heals him. The spells identify a sick person with Horus so {{that he or she}} can benefit from the goddess's efforts. The spells are known from papyrus copies, which serve as instructions for healing rituals, and from a specialized type of inscribed stone stela called a cippus. People seeking healing poured water over these cippi, an act that was believed to imbue <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> the healing power contained in the text, and then drank the water in hope of curing their ailments. The theme of an endangered child protected by magic also appears on inscribed ritual wands from the Middle Kingdom, which were made centuries before the more detailed healing spells that specifically connect this theme with the Osiris myth.|$|E

5|$|Some 97% of {{the common}} thresher's diet is {{composed}} of bony fishes, mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel, bluefish, herring, needlefish, and lanternfish. Before striking, the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> its tail, often in pairs or small groups. Threshers are also known to take large, solitary fishes such as lancetfish, as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates. Off California, common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), with Pacific hake (Merluccius productus), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Pacific mackerel (Scomber japonicus), market squid (Loligo opalescens), and pelagic red crab (Pleuroncodes planipes) also being important food items. The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years, but become less discriminating during less productive, warmer El Niño periods.|$|E
5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them {{from the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>with</b> their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule bat, which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat, also known as the American false vampire bat, and the ghost bat of Australia.|$|E
