5|$|At common law, if a party {{resisted}} arrest by {{an officer}} without warrant {{and who had}} no right to arrest him, and if in the course of that resistance <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> was killed, the offense of the party resisting arrest would be reduced from what would have been murder if <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> had had the right to arrest, to manslaughter. What would be murder if <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> had the right to arrest might be reduced to manslaughter by the very fact that he had no such right. So an officer, at common law, was not authorized to make an arrest without a warrant, for a mere misdemeanor not committed in his presence.|$|E

[...] when <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> came to <b>the</b> vehicle. [...] <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> alleged that, while stopped, Beatty called Bully-Cummings to have <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> called off, which they were ordered to do. When reports of the incident started to surface in the media, Bully-Cummings said <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> harassed Beatty, and Kilpatrick said the stop [...] "looked like a setup".|$|R

5|$|After Collins told Polite to leave, {{she became}} {{verbally}} abusive of <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> and Collins arrested {{her on the}} grounds of disturbing the peace. Florine Roberts, the mother of Robert Bandy, a black soldier in the U.S. Army who was also present, observed the incident and asked for Polite's release. The official police report held that the soldier threatened Collins; in the report, Bandy and Mrs. Roberts then attacked Collins. Bandy hit <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> and, while attempting to flee, Collins shot Bandy in the shoulder with his revolver. In an interview with PM, the soldier said that he intervened when <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> pushed Polite. According to Bandy, Collins threw his nightstick at Bandy, which he caught. When Bandy hesitated after Collins asked for its return, Collins shot him. Bandy's wound was superficial, but he was taken to Sydenham Hospital for treatment. Crowds quickly gathered around Bandy as he entered the hospital, and also around the hotel and police headquarters, where a crowd of 3,000 amassed by 9:00 pm. The crowds combined and grew tense, as rumors that an African-American soldier had been shot soon turned to rumors that an African-American soldier had been killed.|$|E
5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> and his assistant, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E
50|$|Eyewitness {{accounts}} of the incident are split, with some individuals outraged that <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> used deadly force, and others convinced that <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> acted appropriately, however there are discrepancies between the shared account of <b>the</b> enforcing <b>officers</b> and <b>the</b> separate witnesses who saw the scene.

5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the two-year}} life of <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> {{indoctrination}} program, about 930 women completed {{the training and}} were commissioned as SPAR officers. In late 1944, the USCG determined that this complement was sufficient for its needs and discontinued the program. However, to replace the officers who had gone overseas, and those separated from the SPARS, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> candidate school was later reopened for one last class. The candidates were all former enlisted personnel, who received their indoctrination at the USCG training station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York. The USCG strived to recruit officer candidates who already had some civilian training or work experience of the type {{that could be used}} without further training. As result, only about one third of the officers received any specialized training. However, the specialized training programs produced 203 communications officers, and 106 pay and supply officers, prior to its discontinuance in November and December 1944.|$|E

5|$|For {{the coup}} to be successful, the {{military}} committee needed {{to gain the}} support {{of some of the}} Syrian officer corps.

At the time, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> corps was split into five different factions; the Damascus faction which supported the ancien régime, supporters of Akram al-Hawrani, a Nasserist faction, a Ba'athist faction and a group of independents. The Damascus faction was the enemy of the military committee because of their support for Nazim al-Kudsi's regime and the Hawranist were considered as rivals because of their stance against pan-Arabism. The Nasserists became allies of the Ba'ath, even while they supported Gamal Abdel Nasser and the reestablishment of the UAR.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} {{shifts in the}} social make-up of <b>the</b> Bavarian <b>officer</b> corps during <b>the</b> German confederation {{and the development of}} <b>the</b> role <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> played in Bavarian society.

The analysis clearly shows that the development of <b>the</b> Bavarian <b>officer</b> corps had different characteristics than that of the Prussian. <b>The</b> Bavarian <b>officer</b> corps emerges as a socially inhomogeneous military elite lacking the Prussian social exclusiveness. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> stayed in constant touch with the milieu of their family background.
