5|$|Historian Vlad Georgescu {{writes that}} archaeological {{research}} has proven {{the existence of}} about 60 settlements in Glad's duchy. Other historians, including Sălăgean and Pop, say that the earth-and-wooden or stone fortresses unearthed at Bulci, Cenad, Ilidia, Orșova, Pescari, and Vladimirescu were Glad's forts. Florin Curta says that <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> of these sites is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|The 1592 date {{remained}} the established one until the 19th century. In the 1870s, however, several publications corrected <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> {{and within a}} few decades 1535 became the generally accepted date. The painting's correct historical context was finally laid bare with the publication of the censored manuscript from the Vasa Chronicle in 1909.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>dating</b> of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 {{using a combination of}} radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.|$|E

5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to be boring.

5|$|According to Anne Feldhaus, the Morgaon temple {{does not}} pre-date the seventeenth century, when Morya Gosavi popularized it. However, even <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> of Morya Gosavi is disputed and varies from the 13th–14th {{century to the}} 17th century. The {{descendants}} of Morya Gosavi – who were worshipped as Ganesha incarnates at the Chinchwad temple – often visited the Morgaon temple and controlled the finances and administration of many Ashthavinayak temples. The 17th-century saint Samarth Ramdas composed the popular arati song Sukhakarta Dukhaharta, seeing the Morgaon icon.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Hartman studied art at Santa Monica City College, {{dropping}} out in 1969 {{to become a}} roadie with a rock band. He returned to school in 1972, this time studying graphic arts at California State University, Northridge. He developed his own graphic arts business, which he operated on his own, creating over 40 album covers for bands including Poco and America, as well as advertising and the logo for Crosby, Stills & Nash. In the late 1970s, Hartman made his first television appearance on an episode of <b>The</b> <b>Dating</b> Game; he won but was stood up by his date.|$|E

For recent events the Chronicle, like his Ecclesiastical History, relied upon Gildas, upon {{a version of the}} Liber pontificalis current at least to the papacy of Pope Sergius I (687–701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on Eusebius's Chronikoi Kanones. <b>The</b> <b>dating</b> of events in the Chronicle is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the anno mundi.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{contribution}} to the victory at Demetrias, John Palaiologos was shattered {{by the loss of}} his army at Neopatras. According to the Byzantine sources, he resigned his title of despotes (although some modern historians have postulated that it was revoked by his brother), and appears to have died shortly after (1273/1274 or 1274/1275, depending on <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> of the Thessalian campaign).|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the completion of Astronomia Nova, most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the Rudolphine Tables and a comprehensive set of ephemerides (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer Giovanni Antonio Magini. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> {{of events in the}} life of Jesus, and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of Helisaeus Roeslin.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather have been moved and reset at a later date, therefore <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons.

5|$|No queen consort of Menkauhor {{has been}} {{identified}} for certain. The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has proposed that Khuit I was a queen of Menkauhor. Based on <b>the</b> <b>dating</b> of the tombs surrounding Khuit's burial, Seipel argues that she lived during the mid-Fifth Dynasty. By the process of elimination, he attributes known queens to each king of the period, which leaves only Menkauhor {{as a candidate for}} her king. These arguments are criticized by the Egyptologist Michel Baud, who observes that pharaohs could have had more than one queen.|$|E
5|$|Robert's {{theology}} {{is expressed in}} his three surviving works, the Quaestiones de divina pagina, Quaestiones de epistolis Pauli, and the unfinished Sententiae. <b>The</b> <b>dating</b> of the works is problematic, {{but it appears that}} the first two works were composed between 1145 and 1157. The Sententiae was revised twice, probably during the 1150s and the 1160s. His works, especially the Sententiae, cover the entire subject of theology and are strictly orthodox in Christian doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest {{is thought}} by most {{scholars}} {{to have been}} written in 1610–11, and is generally accepted as the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone, although some have questioned either or both assertions.

Edward Blount entered The Tempest into the Stationers' Register on 8 November 1623. It was one of 16 Shakespearean plays that Blount registered on that date.|$|E
