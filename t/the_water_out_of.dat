5|$|Captained by Commander Geoffrey Layton, her post-completion trials {{lasted for}} five months as {{she was used to}} {{evaluate}} steam power for submarine use. Much was learned about the operation of steam submarines, which helped the subsequent design of the steam-powered K-class fleet submarines. She proved to be very unstable while surfacing, presumably because she could not pump <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her controlled free-flooding spaces quickly enough in the upper part of her double hull. These problems, coupled with {{the fact that she was}} too slow to work with the fleet as originally envisioned, meant that she was impossible to make into an effective warship, and she was laid up after her trials.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{predicted}} that the standing water caused by the storm surge would render {{most of the city}} uninhabitable for weeks and that the destruction of oil and petrochemical refineries in the surrounding area would spill waste into the flooding. The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the city.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{found himself}} {{at the heart of}} the battle for the island before the {{squadron}} arrived. On 27 November the convoy came under attack from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship. He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships. Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel. The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E

5|$|On 19 December, {{the first}} winter storm struck the French squadron. In the heavy waves and high winds, first Windham and then Vénus were {{separated}} from the convoy, Manche marshalling the remaining ships and continuing the southwards journey. Windhams French prize crew were able {{to regain control of}} their ship and continued on to Île de France alone, but Vénus was struck by an even larger hurricane on 27 December and lost all three topmasts in the gale. The French crew panicked as the storm began, and refused to attend to the sails or even close the hatches: as a result the vessel almost founded as huge amounts of water poured into the ship. In desperation, Hamelin called Captain Stewart to his cabin and requested that his men save the ship but demanded that Stewart give his word that his men would not attempt to escape or seize the frigate. Stewart refused to give any such guarantee but agreed to help repair the damage and bring the ship to safety. After securing the weapons lockers aboard, Hamelin agreed and Stewart and his men cut away the wrecked masts and pumped <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the hold, repairing the ship so {{that she was able to}} continue her journey without fear of foundering.|$|E

25|$|Cryoablation also {{involves}} {{the insertion of}} a probe into the affected area, however, cold is used to kill the tumor instead of heat. The probe is cooled with chemical fluids which are very cold. The freezing temperatures cause the tumor cells to die by causing osmotic dehydration, which pulls <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cell destroying the enzyme, organelles, cell membrane and freezing the cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|A noria (Arabic: ناعورة, nā‘ūra) {{performs}} {{the function of}} moving water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation. In this it {{is similar to the}} saqiya and other pumps like the Persian wheel (Rahat in Urdu), but those are generally powered by other means or a combination, usually lifting water from a pond or well. Noria is similar to the modern hydraulic ram, which also uses the power of flowing water to pump some of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the river.|$|E
25|$|The {{water system}} however {{was far more}} complex than just the {{reservoirs}} and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system {{was designed to be}} harmonious with the structure so that at places there were central drainage canals {{in the center of the}} columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure.|$|E

25|$|Consolidation is {{a process}} by which soils {{decrease}} in volume. It occurs when stress is applied to a soil that causes the soil particles to pack together more tightly, therefore reducing volume. When this occurs in a soil that is saturated with water, water will be squeezed out of the soil. The time required to squeeze <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a thick deposit of clayey soil layer might be years. For a layer of sand, the water may be squeezed out {{in a matter of}} seconds. A building foundation or construction of a new embankment will cause the soil below to consolidate and this will cause settlement which in turn may cause distress to the building or embankment. Karl Terzaghi developed the theory of consolidation which enables prediction of the amount of settlement and the time required for the settlement to occur. Soils are tested with an oedometer test to determine their compression index and coefficient of consolidation.|$|E
25|$|The ferries were {{in major}} decline by the 1950s. In 1948, the No. 3 {{was taken off}} of regular service and was sold in 1953. The cost of {{operating}} the ferries was high, and the last sailing by the No. 4 ferry took place on August 30, 1958. The No. 4 was later sold {{to be used in}} Prince Rupert. Later, No. 4 returned to Vancouver and was tied up on the Vancouver side of Burrard Inlet. She was in desperate need of a refit and had to be kept afloat with pumps to keep <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her hull. When the power failed and the pumps stopped she went to the bottom. The No. 5 was converted into the Seven Seas Restaurant at the foot of Lonsdale in North Vancouver. It remained there until 2002 when the City of North Vancouver and the federal courts had it demolished after a long-standing dispute over who would be responsible if it sank and concern that the hull was in danger of imminent collapse. In dry dock it proved to be quite sound, but at that point the decision had already been made to scrap it.|$|E
500|$|The Merced Irrigation District (MID) {{operates}} most of {{the irrigation}} infrastructure on the lower river, which supplies water to [...] of farmland. As a whole, the system includes about 4,000 control gates and [...] of canals and laterals. Irrigation has taken most of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the lower river, which is often reduced to a small stream where it joins the San Joaquin. Irrigation return flows carry pesticides, fertilizer and other pollutants into the river. The MID is federally required to allow at least [...] of water annually to flow continually down the river, not including floodwater releases.|$|E

500|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the G3 battlecruisers were {{intended}} to withstand the explosion of a [...] torpedo warhead. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the torpedo bulkhead that consisted of two layers of [...] high-tensile steel. The bulkhead was situated some [...] inboard {{from the side of}} the ship. Postwar tests done on a replica of this system showed that filling the buoyancy space with water rather than the sealed steel crushing tubes as used in [...] was just as effective and weighed less. A compressed air system was fitted to blow <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the buoyancy spaces and bring the ship upright in 15 minutes after two torpedo hits.

500|$|As the {{high-speed}} maneuvers finished at 13:30, Waddle called for Greeneville {{to perform an}} emergency dive (called an [...] "emergency deep") followed by an emergency main ballast blow, a maneuver that brings the submarine from a depth of about [...] to the surface {{in a few seconds}} by using high-pressure air to force <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ship's ballast tanks as quickly as possible. [...] The rise is so rapid that the submarine's bow rises high out of the water upon surfacing. [...] Before executing this maneuver, the submarine was required to go to periscope depth to check for ships or dangerous obstacles on the surface. [...] After completing {{the high-speed}} maneuvers, standing orders called for the submarine to hold a steady course for three minutes to reestablish sonar contact, which had been disrupted by the high speed maneuvers, with any vessels in the area. [...] In this case, however, Waddle ordered the submarine to change course and go to periscope depth after holding the steady course for only 90 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Extreme {{amounts of}} {{rainfall}} were produced over Alabama. Dauphin Island {{had the highest}} amount of rainfall, 37.75inches (959mm) reported by the HPC. [...] Dauphin Island Sea Lab recorded 36.71inches (932mm) of rain, {{but not all the}} rain may have recorded in the rain gauge at this location, so it is possible the rainfall may have been underestimated. Doppler weather radar estimates show that around 43inches (1,090mm) of rain fell off the coast of Dauphin Island. A storm surge of over 6.5feet (1.98m) occurred off Highway 182, midway between Gulf Shores and Fort Morgan, in addition to the rainfall. Unusually, when the storm stalled off the coast of Alabama, prevailing northerly winds forced <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Mobile Bay, causing tides to be twofeet (0.61m) below normal. Observers noted that, if river channels had not remained, it would have been possible to walk across the bay unhindered by water. Additionally, a four-story condominium project that was under construction in Gulf Shores crashed due to high winds. [...] In addition, three tornadoes occurred in Alabama, one being in Orange Beach, another in Opelika, while the other one occurred in Alabama Port. There were some other tornadoes that also caused minimal damage.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} the story, Peter carelessly aims a flare gun through an air vent, causing the sprinklers to come on. Meanwhile, Meg {{is trying to}} persuade the burglars to attack her {{but they are not}} interested. The rest of the family, still trapped in the panic room, are preparing to potentially drown from the sprinklers filling the room up with water. Peter tells the story of his ancestor, Willie [...] "Black-Eye" [...] Griffin, who was a silent film star in the 1920s, but whose career later faltered due to his vo(much like Bobcat Goldthwait's) not being cut out for talking pictures. Peter then tells his family about his great uncle, Peter Hitler, who was able to provide Adolf Hitler with success at his Munich speech, although annoying Adolf greatly. As the water from the sprinklers almost reaches its peak, Peter admits to the family that he did not care for The Godfather and a heated debate ensues, ending with Peter declaring his love for The Money Pit. At the last minute Joe rescues them, draining <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the room, thus saving their lives.
