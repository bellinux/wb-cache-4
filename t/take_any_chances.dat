500|$|The disc also {{contains}} a variety of deleted scenes. These scenes show the animosity between Brody and his wife's boss, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo), Brody explaining to Ellen that he's not about to <b>take</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> letting Mike go sailing, saying that the [...] "smell of death" [...] is the same in Amity {{as it is in}} New York, and the selectmen voting to fire Brody; the Mayor (Murray Hamilton) is the only person to vote to save him. These scenes were cut because they were slowing the film's pace. Also included is footage of the shark attacking the coast guard pilot underwater after his helicopter had capsized. The scene was cut because of the struggle with the ratings board to acquire a PG certificate. In the storyboard, it is shown that the helicopter pilot would have escaped and saved Marge (Martha Swatek) from being eaten after she saves Sean, and saves himself as well.|$|E

[...] Speaking about his decision to leave the gym Cleverly said [...] "I have been trained by Enzo Calzaghe for six years since my youth days so leaving him {{has been one of}} the hardest decision I've ever had to make... Enzo is largely responsible for where I am in my career and I cannot thank him enough for what he has done for me." [...] Cleverly had been concerned following the legal wranglings between promoter Frank Warren and his former stablemate Joe Calzaghe and added [...] "I cannot <b>take</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> with my career... I take boxing very seriously and want to be world champion. Hopefully Frank can sort that out for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, 2 June, at dawn Dyer's brigade {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the Afghan regulars that were positioned away to the west of Thal and as this attack went in Nadir Khan sent out an envoy to deliver a message to the brigade commander. The message told Dyer that Amir Amanullah had ordered Nadir Khan to cease hostilities and Nadir Khan asked Dyer to acknowledge that he would honour the request for an armistice that Amanullah had sent to the British Indian government on 31 May. Unaware that this request had been made, and uncertain as to whether the message and request for a cease fire was a ruse on Nadir Khan's part, Dyer decided that he would not <b>take</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> and sent the reply: [...] "My guns will give an immediate reply, but your letter will be forwarded to the Divisional Commander".|$|E

2500|$|The great {{shock of}} the Fourth Test was that Mike Denness became the first Test captain to drop himself for poor form. Percy Chapman had dropped himself for the Fifth Test in 1928–29 because of flu and Wally Hammond in 1946–47 due to fibrositis, but in both these cases the series had already been decided. England could still win the series by winning the last three Tests, or hold onto the Ashes by winning two and drawing the other. Denness had made only 65 runs (10.83) {{so far in the}} series and was desperately out of form, but his {{replacement}} Keith Fletcher was hardly a better bet with 45 runs (11.25) and had been dropped for the Third Test. The vice-captain John Edrich was put in charge, an old pro who had captained Surrey since 1973, but was unlikely to fire up the team or <b>take</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances.</b> Geoff Arnold replaced the injured Mike Hendrick, but Chris Old was made twelfth man and England went into the match with just two fast bowlers on a lively green wicket that made Frank Tyson [...] "worry about the safety of the English batsmen". Australia made a change to their line up with the opener Wally Edwards being dropped after making 68 runs (11.33) in the first three Tests. He was replaced by the tall, athletic Rick McCosker who had made four consecutive first class centuries that season and 52 and 56 for NSW against the tourists. Unfortunately, this left Australia with only one opening batsman and McCosker was sent in with Ian Redpath on his debut, though admittedly on his home ground. Ian Chappell won the toss for the fourth time in a row (Edrich called heads, while Denness had always called tails) and chose to bat regardless of the help the wicket was due to give the bowlers.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 July 2012, Ynetnews {{reported}} that {{on that day}} the Iron Dome system was deployed in the greater Eilat area {{as a part of}} an IDF survey meant to test it in various areas across Israel. The IDF published on its website that the Iron Dome battery will be temporarily stationed there {{as part of an effort}} to test and prepare different sites across the country for the possibility of permanently stationing there additional batteries. [...] "Since the system continues to grow and improve, it is important to test potential sites," [...] said a commander from the Air Defense Formation. [...] "After stationing Iron Dome batteries in numerous regions in southern Israel, including Ashkelon, Ashdod, Netivot and Gush Dan—it is time to test the southernmost region in the country, Eilat." [...] Haaretz {{reported that}} an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the interceptors were set up on 9 July. Three weeks beforehand, two Katyhusha rockets were fired into southern Israel, and according to The Jerusalem Post the IDF believes that they originated from the Sinai. According to the report, IDF assessments are that they were either fired by a Palestinian rocket cell from Gaza—affiliated either with Hamas or Islamic Jihad—or by Bedouin freelancers who work for them. The launches followed an earlier one in April 2012, when at least one Katyusha rocket was fired from the Sinai to Eilat. Ynetnews reported that according to a military source, following these rocket attacks, the IDF decided not to <b>take</b> <b>any</b> <b>chances</b> and calibrated the system to the region's topography, before finally deploying it. The system's deployment was coordinated with local communities and the City of Eilat, in order to prevent public panic.|$|E

60|$|Young Fordyce {{glowed with}} delight in these tales, reading beneath the terse lines of Haney's slang {{something}} epic, detecting a perfect willingness to <b>take</b> <b>any</b> <b>chance.</b> The {{fact that his}} bravery led to nothing conventionally noble or moral did not detract from the inherent interest of the tale; on the contrary, the young fellow, being of unusual imaginative reach and freedom, took pleasure in the thought that a man would risk his life again and again merely for the excitement of it. Occasionally he glanced at Judge Crego, to find him looking upon Haney with thoughtful glance. It was a little like listening to a prisoner's confession of guilt (as he afterwards said), but to him, as to Congdon, it was a most interesting monologue.|$|R
