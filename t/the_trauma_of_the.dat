Upon 'waking up', he does not have any memory of what happened while hypnotized, but sees that the woman and his son Ben (Charlie Tahan), a young musical prodigy, are missing. Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) reveals that similar cases have ended with the victims being returned, but left insane from <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident.

5|$|Similar to the Moor-Christian {{confrontation}} of the morisca—whether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America—there are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico {{such as the}} Danza de la Pluma that exploit <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that—depending on where one sees them and under what conditions—it is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration {{from the fact that}} the natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} thought she would need to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked with the staff to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after <b>the</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to adjust to a new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E
5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater earnings, and popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. <b>The</b> <b>trauma</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E
