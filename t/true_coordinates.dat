30|$|Note {{that range}} {{information}} from two sensors, combined with kinematic prior knowledge, can provide adequate information {{to estimate the}} position of a single target[19]. Specifically, geometry is used to find the intersection between two circles whose radii (in Cartesian coordinates) are the ranges of the sensors. The two intersections of these circles provide two coordinate locations, one of which can be selected that agrees with the kinematic prior information. For multiple targets, there are multiple of these circles for each sensor and each target, and multiple intersection points that do not correspond to <b>true</b> <b>coordinate</b> locations. Therefore, the use of three sensors can help clear the ambiguity by providing fewer intersections of three circles. In order to avoid complicated geometry, we first process the returns of two sensors and sample Cartesian coordinate target locations using the likelihood. We then weight the sampled locations with measurements from the third sensor. Our method is for a general number of sensors equal or greater than three; in this work, we kept the number of sensors to a minimum of three.|$|R

This tool connects different systems together through a hosted web interface, which provides the data required for multiple library departments to use in order to begin to achieve coordinated collection development. This data includes titles matching the following criteria: the number of times an item has been requested by IDS libraries, if less than 3 IDS libraries have the request, and it matches the IDS Conspectus for the lending library.

Current solutions to the indoor localization problem are either both unreliable and inaccurate, or very expensive. In this paper we propose, design and build a low-cost, robust and accurate indoor localization system using laser light sources.

40|$|AbstractIn {{industrial}} construction, each fabricated material item {{such as a}} steel piece or a {{pipe spool}} is a unique building element. They are typically staged in a large laydown yard before final on-site installation. Manually tracking and locating each particular item in a large laydown yard can be very time consuming, and excessive man hours spent in this process can negatively impact on field installation activity and overall project performance. This study developed a robust and accurate yet cost effective material tracking and locating solution based on mature tracking technologies. The proposed solution features a handheld computer equipped with barcoding and GPS technologies for laydown yard material tracking and fast retrieval in a cost effective manner. The device scans item barcodes when the item is unloaded in the yard and, meanwhile, captures the GPS coordinates along with the item image, and stores these data in a central database. For material retrieval, material lookup through the database provides geographical location and images of an item, and navigation function gets the crew to the item in a shorter duration. To validate the accuracy of GPS and practicality of this solution, various handheld computing devices with built-in GPS functions were tested by comparing their GPS recordings against the <b>true</b> <b>coordinates</b> of selected geological survey benchmarks.
