5|$|In early 2013, protestors went to {{the streets}} flying the old colonial flag {{demanding}} more democracy and resignation of Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying. The use of the flag has created concerns from Chinese authorities and request from Leung to stop flying the flag. Despite the calls from Leung the old flags {{are not subject to}} use restrictions beyond not being allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> flagpoles and are freely sold and manufactured in the territory.|$|E

5|$|Less {{than two}} weeks later, on 2 December, Admiral Hipper {{submitted}} his request <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the inactive list. He retired on 13 December with a full pension; {{at the age of}} 55, Hipper spent almost 37 years on active duty in the Imperial Navy. The German fleet in Scapa Flow, meanwhile, was scuttled by its crew on 21 June 1919.|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated {{the need for an}} ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{where he}} {{discovered}} {{that no one would}} employ him in any job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban was about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E

5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's window {{at the front of}} the aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned on the right side of the case, so it had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the left side of the fuselage.

5|$|Around 1497, while {{continuing}} {{with his work}} on the Caesars, Cairano also developed five keystones for portico of the Loggia palazzo, representing Sant'Apollonio, San Faustino, San Giovita, Justice and Faith. Between 1499 and 1500, he delivered two large trophies <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the top order of palazzo, while between 1493 and 1505, Cairano participated in the fulfilment of leonine protome, capitals, and candelabras and friezes for the same top order. The attention of the artist to his craft and productions is evident, and it influenced in general all the decorative sculptural works made for the palazzo at the time.|$|E
5|$|Barry's scheme {{provided}} two plinths for sculptures on {{the north}} side of the square. A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey, originally intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> top of the Marble Arch, was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until the late-20th century. There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.|$|E

In June he was able to escape from a coal-mining work camp with an Irish soldier, and fled to occupied Poland, but was soon captured in Kraków and returned to Stalag VIII-B {{by the end of the}} month. He was sentenced to two weeks of solitary confinement, but retained his secret identity.|$|E
5|$|Colin Renfrew {{has pointed}} out the dangers of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E
5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the standard edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter left Egypt on 22 November 1916 and {{returned}} to the United Kingdom, where she was paid off at Devonport to provide crews for antisubmarine vessels. She remained at Devonport until April 1919, in commission as a special service vessel and auxiliary patrol ship until February 1918, when she was again paid off. After that she became an accommodation ship. In April 1919, Jupiter became the first Majestic-class ship <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the disposal list. She was sold for scrapping on 15 January 1920, and on 11 March 1920 was towed from Chatham to Blyth to be scrapped.|$|E

Nichols arranged with the Eldorado Mining and Refining Company for the purchase of ore from its mine in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots. Nichols met with Undersecretary of the Treasury Daniel W. Bell and arranged for the transfer of 14,700 tons of silver from the West Point Depository for use in the Y-12 National Security Complex in place of copper, which was in desperately short supply in wartime.|$|E
5|$|Once the badnjak has burnt through, the thicker end {{is often}} {{taken out of}} the fire and used {{according}} to the local custom. It may be carried around the beehives, extinguished, and placed between the branches of a young plum or apple tree. The men may make crosses from it and put them under the eaves, on the fields, meadows, vineyards, and apiaries, so that the coming year may be happy and fruitful. It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E

5|$|Standard {{planetary}} models {{suggest that}} the interior of Saturn {{is similar to that}} of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles. This core is similar in composition to the Earth, but more dense. Examination of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of the Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about 25,000km. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000km and consists of gas.|$|E
5|$|Three albums {{have been}} released: the promotional Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Pre Soundtrack in July 2013, the Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack in November 2013, and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII Soundtrack Plus in March 2014. The music has {{received}} a mostly positive response from reviewers. The main soundtrack, despite some tracks being critiqued, was generally praised as a good selection of music and a fitting conclusion {{to the music of}} the Final Fantasy XIII series. It was also praised by reviewers of the game as a whole. The Soundtrack Plus album was reviewed less favorably. Both commercial albums sold well enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the Oricon charts, with the Original Soundtrack reaching #29 and remaining on the charts for four weeks.|$|E
