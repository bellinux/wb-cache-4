5|$|His {{observations}} of <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> of Jupiter caused {{a revolution in}} astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform {{to the principles of}} Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing. His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{discovered}} that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy; they are not randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions. This may indicate a common tidal origin for <b>the</b> <b>satellites.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2007, SvalSat was {{expanded}} with 12 antennas. Five {{are used for}} Galileo, while the remaining are used for a large array of customers. In 2007 and 2008, both Terra and Landsat 7 were hacked twice. The hackers were able to achieve all steps {{which would have been}} necessary to take control over <b>the</b> <b>satellites,</b> but did not actually take control.

5000|$|Intelsat 603 was {{launched}} by a Commercial Titan III on 14 March 1990. The {{separation of the}} upper (second) stage from <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> failed. This left <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> and <b>the</b> upper stage attached to each other, and Intelsat was unable to fire the perigee motor to boost <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> to its higher orbit. Intelsat flight controllers jettisoned the perigee motor which detached <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> from <b>the</b> Titan upper stage. However without the perigee motor <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> could not be boosted to its nominal geostationary orbit.

5|$|The {{facility}} had a Simulation for Automatic Machinery computer {{built by}} FFI which allowed for real-time operations with the data.

50|$|The launch is scheduled, and {{the space}} shuttle Daedalus {{successfully}} launches into orbit. They find <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> but all agree it looks nothing like a communication <b>satellite.</b> They secure <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> with <b>the</b> shuttle's loading arm and begin repairs, but soon find it houses six nuclear missiles, relics from the Cold War and {{a violation of the}} Outer Space Treaty. The mission is quickly put under secrecy. Frank discovers that the control system for <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> originated from Bob's own files and was stolen by the KGB, and that <b>the</b> <b>satellite's</b> computers will launch the missiles at predetermined targets if <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> falls out of orbit. NASA and the crew devise a plan to use the payload-assist rockets to push <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> out of orbit and into deep space. However, as they prepare for this maneuver, one of the younger astronauts, Ethan Glance (Loren Dean), acting under Bob's original orders, tries to put <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> into stable orbit himself, which is mistimed and sets off a chain reaction: <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> collides with <b>the</b> shuttle, damaging most of the shuttle's computer systems and engines, destroying the solar panels on <b>the</b> <b>satellite,</b> and sending it faster into a decay orbit, while Ethan is knocked out and dragged along with <b>the</b> <b>satellite.</b>|$|R
5|$|There is {{very strong}} {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, the origin of which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into <b>the</b> <b>satellites.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jupiter has a faint {{planetary}} ring system composed of three main segments: an inner torus of particles {{known as the}} halo, a relatively bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring. These rings appear {{to be made of}} dust, rather than ice as with Saturn's rings. The main ring is probably made of material ejected from <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> Adrastea and Metis. Material that would normally fall back to the moon is pulled into Jupiter because of its strong gravitational influence. The orbit of the material veers towards Jupiter and new material is added by additional impacts. In a similar way, the moons Thebe and Amalthea probably produce the two distinct components of the dusty gossamer ring. There is also evidence of a rocky ring strung along Amalthea's orbit which may consist of collisional debris from that moon.|$|E
5|$|Satellite nests {{are common}} among P. exclamans. A queen will fly somewhere between 0.15 and 11m {{away from the}} {{original}} nest to settle in a new location. About 16–39% of nests create satellites from May to July. Similar to the wasp species, Parischnogaster alternata, constructing multitude of nests in clusters {{in order to create}} protection through dilution effect, <b>the</b> <b>satellites</b> are used as an insurance against attacks by predators and parasitoids. Of 12 nests that were knocked down by birds that had satellites, 66.7% of the colony survived by moving to the satellite, compared to the reproductive success of nests with no satellite that were attacked (5.7%). When Chalcoela iphitalis invades, the prevalence of satellites didn’t increase the survivability, however it did have an effect when Elasmus polistis were introduced. It gave the P. exclamans a place to escape to.|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} {{compensating}} for atmospheric effects {{to detect the}} actual location of low elevation objects using near horizon radar to detect an object which utilizes a preexisting satellite structured to send a signal indicating {{the position and velocity}} of said <b>satellite,</b> wherein <b>the</b> location of <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> is known. <b>The</b> method includes a step of providing a radar site, a first receiver structured to receive a signal from <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> indicating an apparent location of <b>the</b> <b>satellite,</b> and a second receiver, located at a distance from the radar site, structured to receive <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> signal and which indicates the observed location of <b>the</b> <b>satellite.</b> <b>The</b> first receiver is utilized to receive a signal from <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> when <b>the</b> <b>satellite</b> is at a low elevation.
