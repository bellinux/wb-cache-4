A ship operates under the laws of its flag state, and these laws are used if <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> involved in an admiralty case.

5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>is</b> black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
