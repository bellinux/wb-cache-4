5|$|Romeo and Juliet {{has been}} adapted {{numerous}} times for stage, film, musical, and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick's 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda's Romeo und Julie omitted {{much of the}} action and added a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman's, restored the original <b>text</b> <b>and</b> focused on greater realism. John Gielgud's 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare's <b>text</b> <b>and</b> used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted in versions as diverse as George Cukor's 1935 film Romeo and Juliet, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version Romeo and Juliet, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to see how second-language {{learners}} uses noun phrases in their written <b>texts</b> <b>and</b> oral speech as well as how they differ from each other. In order to answer this, the following questions have been formulated: What congruent errors are found in the noun phrases in the students' <b>texts</b> <b>and</b> oral speeches? Are there any differences in the use of noun phrases in the students' <b>texts</b> <b>and</b> oral speeches? The study is based on performance analysis, where student <b>texts</b> <b>and</b> transcribed recordings of students' oral speeches are analyzed. The result shows that congruence errors in the students' noun phrases are mostly due to the misuse of gender, definite form and numerus. The result also shows that the students had more congruence errors in the written texts, but there were similar, but fewer, mistakes in the oral speeches. This means that you cannot draw general conclusions about any differences between the written <b>texts</b> <b>and</b> the oral speeches...|$|R
