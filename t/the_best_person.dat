5|$|Scott {{frequently}} {{clashed with}} the legislature, including once when the Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Dr. Walter Brashear as lieutenant colonel commandant of the state militia's second regiment. The governor refused to nominate anyone else for the position, saying that Brashear was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> for it, and he assumed the senators {{would not want to}} be sent a worse nomination. He employed his gubernatorial veto three times {{over the course of his}} tenure, but all three were overridden by the legislature. Measures creating Harrison County and allowing squatters to purchase occupied land on more favorable terms were both vetoed because Scott felt that they had been passed too hastily to allow proper debate. Scott also vetoed the revocation of a pension granted to recently retired Kentucky Court of Appeals justice George Muter, because he felt it undermined citizens' confidence in the promises of their government.|$|E
5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E

25|$|After the war, when serious {{consideration}} was {{being given to}} the production of the official history, Lieutenant General Alexander Godley, the commander of the NZEF, believed that Ross would be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> to produce the history. However, Major General Alfred Robin, the commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, held firm views of what should be communicated by an official history. He dictated an educational approach, considering the target audience to be students of military history. Journalistic and writing skills were second to the ability to understand and communicate military tactics and strategy, the lessons of which were to be imparted at the direction of the Imperial General Staff at the War Office. Hence, rather than Ross, Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Stewart, who had commanded a battalion in the New Zealand Division during the war, was favoured by Robin to write the official history. It was recognised that an accessible 'Popular History', aimed at a more general readership would be appropriate alongside the official history. Endorsed by the Minister of Defence James Allen, the Government approved the writing of this 'Popular History'. The Government's decision to produce a 'Popular History' was formally announced in June 1918.|$|E

[...] Clem Hill, the former Australian captain, noted Jackson's sparkling footwork, watching {{close enough to}} notice that his toes turned in as he walked. [...] Like Kippax, whose style was uncannily similar, Jackson wore his shirt-sleeves almost down to his wrists. This was not in imitation but to conceal the blemishes on his arms caused by psoriasis. Kippax was not seen by some as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> to imitate, with Charles Kelleway critical of Jackson's flourishes, wishing {{he would not be}} so, [...] "... cramped in copying other batsman's styles".|$|E
500|$|Bell began {{crafting}} his script, {{adding a}} mafia-related sub-plot and replacing the airplane drop with a fall from a building, for budgetary reasons. The biggest hurdle for the episode, however, was crafting the Rube Goldberg machine. However, because Bell had [...] "extra time" [...] {{to write his}} script, the art department was given {{a head start on}} crafting the contraption. Gillian Anderson later explained that working with the machines required a lot of patience, because multiple takes had to be filmed in order to make sure everything went as planned. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, broke a [...] "long-standing rule" [...] on the show and re-cast Willie Garson—who had appeared in the third season episode [...] "The Walk"—as Henry Weems.

500|$|Rupert Graves {{was cast}} as DI Greg Lestrade. The writers {{referred}} to the character as [...] "Inspector Lestrade" [...] during development until Gatiss realised that in contemporary England the character would have the title [...] "Detective Inspector". Moffat and Gatiss pointed out that Lestrade does not appear often in the stories and is quite inconsistently portrayed in them. They decided {{to go with the}} version that appeared in [...] "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons": a man who is frustrated by Holmes but admires him, and whom Holmes considers as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> at Scotland Yard. Several candidates took a comedic tack in their auditions, but the creative team preferred the gravitas that Graves brought to the role. His first name is revealed to be Greg in [...] "The Hounds of Baskerville".|$|E
500|$|The casting of {{the lead}} pair was leaked well before the {{intended}} official announcements. Gowariker cast Harman Baweja after watching the trailer of his debut film, the science fiction romance Love Story 2050 (2008). He asked Harman's father, Harry Baweja, to show him the film's rushes and was impressed with his performance, calling him <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> for the part. Following this, Priyanka Chopra, {{who had worked with}} Baweja in Love Story 2050, was cast to play all twelve of the potential brides, each related to one of the twelve zodiac signs. On casting Chopra, Gowariker said: [...] "I have always liked Priyanka's work, right from [...] She's been fabulous in all her films. So when I thought of somebody doing twelve roles I thought about her, as I thought she had the potential." [...] When Gowariker offered the film to her, Chopra instantly agreed to star in it.|$|E
500|$|In December 1994, Madonna sent Parker a four-page letter {{explaining}} {{that she was}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> to portray Eva and would be fully committed to the role; She also sent him a copy of her [...] "Take a Bow" [...] music video {{as a way of}} [...] "auditioning". Rice believed that Madonna suited the title role since she could [...] "act so beautifully through music". Lloyd Webber was wary about her singing. Since the film required the actors to sing their own parts, Madonna underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader to increase her own confidence in singing the unusual songs, and project her voice in a much more cohesive manner. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— it's operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1942, Hand's friends {{once again}} lobbied {{for him to}} fill a Supreme Court vacancy, but Roosevelt did not appoint him. The {{president}} gave age as the reason, but philosophical differences with Hand may also have played a part. Another explanation lies in one of Justice William O. Douglas's autobiographies, where Douglas states that, despite Roosevelt's belief that Hand was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> for the job, Roosevelt had been offended by the pressure Justice Felix Frankfurter placed on the president during a vigorous letter-writing campaign on Hand's behalf. [...] D.C. Circuit Judge Wiley Blount Rutledge, whom Roosevelt appointed, died in 1949, while Hand lived until 1961. [...] In a February 1944 correspondence with Frankfurter, Hand expressed a low opinion of Roosevelt’s new appointees, referring to Justice Hugo Black, Justice Douglas, and Justice Frank Murphy as [...] "Hillbilly Hugo, Good Old Bill, and Jesus lover of my Soul". [...] Deeply disappointed at the time, Hand later regretted his ambition: [...] "It was the importance, the power, the trappings of the God damn thing that really drew me on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} debated by many critics and {{scholars}} {{whether or not}} sonnet 110 was written about Shakespeare's career in the theater or if the sonnet is a confession of love to a young man.

[...] Sonnet 110 can be interpreted as a confession of love and the mistakes the poet made when he decided to leave his original love. The poet confesses to the young man his infidelities and regrets in order to receive pity from the young man for what the poet did was wrong but should be forgiven since he claimed the young man is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>person</b> he will ever love.|$|E
