When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone.

As {{the result}} of a 17 December conference on the matter, an intelligence data base was developed of locations of past usage of Communist 122mm and 130mm field guns. Raven Forward Air Controllers and photo reconnaissance pilots surveilled the old gun locations. As the Communists reused their past locations, their guns were spotted and struck with laser guided bombs. By the turn of the year, seven of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> had been hit. U.S. air power totaled 957 sorties for December; the RLAF flew 2,200.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> {{opened fire}} on the New Madrid {{defensive}} positions on March 13, and continued throughout the day. McCown realized that Pope would try to attack his forts by regular approaches. He felt that his reduced artillery companies would be too exhausted to resist, so {{he decided not to}} wait for the inevitable. On the night of March 13–14, orders were given to abandon the town and its two forts. A heavy rainstorm hid the troop movements from the enemy, so the evacuation was accomplished without incident. There was some confusion (which seems to have been exaggerated in Pope's reports), and the departure was so sudden that the guns in the forts had to be spiked and left behind, but most of the troops were successfully removed and redistributed. On the morning of March 14, two deserters appeared bearing a white flag, and informed Pope that the town was deserted.|$|E
25|$|Adaptations {{to modern}} arms. Others learned however. Tewodros's successor, Yohannes IV had been {{backed by the}} British and {{received}} 500,000 pounds (sterling) worth of military equipment. This was {{put to good use}} against a variety of other enemies, including the Mahdi's dervish forces from the Sudan, and in inflicting a crushing defeat on an Italian force at the Battle of Dogali in 1887. In 1875 and 1876, Yohannes' troops also defeated substantial Egyptian armies trained and officered by European mercenaries and US Civil War veterans. The Egyptians had been equipped with Remington rifles, Krupp artillery, Gatling guns and rocket tubes. This hardware was transferred to the victorious Ethiopian forces, and captured Egyptian gunners were pressed into service, training the Ethiopians to use <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b> Yohannes' successor Menelik continued the armed buildup, and by the 1890s the Ethiopians were a tough fighting force on their own ground, capable of mobilizing massive numbers of infantry.|$|E

25|$|In fact, Drake {{had been}} {{preparing}} for action since the previous visit by Ranger, taking on volunteers from the Carrickfergus area to boost the crew from 100 to about 160, many of them landsmen who were to be used only for close-quarters combat, {{although there was a}} shortage of ammunition. Absent from the ship's company at this crucial time were the gunner, master's mate, boatswain, and lieutenant. The aging captain, George Burdon, was later reported to have been in poor health himself. Drake got under way about 8am, but with wind and tide against it, made little progress. After an hour or so a boat was therefore sent {{to get a closer look}} at the intruder. Jones opted to try a slight variant of the plan which had failed to capture the customs vessel a few days earlier; hiding most of the crew and <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns.</b> This time it worked; the crew of the reconnaissance boat was captured, and this success raised the morale of the Americans. One of the prisoners revealed the large number of volunteers who had gone aboard Drake.|$|E

[...] There, the lead crew refused to continue owing {{to a lack of}} snow and the upcoming steep descent to the Connecticut River valley. [...] Knox hired additional oxen and persuaded the crew to go on. [...] As the train moved further east, news of it spread, and people came out to watch it pass.

500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1951 season, Houtteman was drafted into the United States Army.

He served in the heavy weapons division of the Army, where the roar of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> sent pains throbbing through Houtteman's head and gave him severe headaches, which doctors believed was a lingering effect of the skull fracture three years earlier. As a result, the Army reclassified Houtteman as not fully qualified for combat duty. This led to a medical discharge on September 15, 1951. Speaking of his time in the Army, Houtteman said, [...] "I spent most of my time in the Army hospital. I did play a little ball at Camp Pickett", Virginia.|$|E

Instead Spears swims through dark, often hip-hop hued waters with occasional forays into minor keyed electro dance terrain." [...] Ali Fenwick of The Johns Hopkins News-Letter said, [...] "Despite bringing out <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> in a duet with Madonna, 'Me Against The Music' is not danceable, the measure of success in any pop tune." [...] Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie commented that {{although much of the}} content of In the Zone is [...] "catchy", [...] "it is hard to see any potential singles impressing as much as 'Me Against The Music'."

500|$|The only {{artillery}} {{support for}} the troops making these tentative advances was from the navy. Finding targets difficult to spot, and in fear of hitting their own troops, <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> of the battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches. The destroyers {{were able to get}} in closer, and from 08:00 began engaging their own targets. At 09:50, two minutes after the [...] destroyed a 75mm gun position in WN-74, the destroyers were ordered to get as close in as possible. Some approached within 1,000 yards (900m) several times, scraping bottom and risking running aground. An engineer who had landed in the first wave at Fox Red, watching the Frankford steaming in towards shore, thought she had been badly hit and was being beached. Instead, she turned parallel to the beach and cruised westwards, guns blazing at targets of opportunity. Thinking she would turn back out to sea, the engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up, guns still firing. At one point, gunners aboard the Frankford saw an immobilized tank at the water's edge, still firing. Watching the fall of its shot, they followed up with a salvo of their own. In this manner, the tank acted as the ship's fire control party for several minutes.|$|E

2500|$|On May 15, a {{detachment}} of the U.S. Navy's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, {{under the command}} of Commander John Rodgers steamed up the James River from Fort Monroe to test the Richmond defenses. At 7:45a.m., the USS Galena closed to within [...] of the fort and anchored, but before she could open fire, two Confederate rounds pierced the lightly armored vessel. The battle lasted over three hours and during that time, Galena remained almost stationary and took 45 hits. Her crew reported casualties of 14 dead or mortally wounded and 10 injured. Monitor was also a frequent target, but her heavier armor withstood the blows. Contrary to some reports, the Monitor, despite its squat turret, did not have difficulty bringing its guns to bear and fired steadily against the fort. The USS Naugatuck withdrew when her 100-pounder Parrott rifle exploded. The two wooden gunboats remained safely out of range of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns,</b> but the captain of the USS Port Royal was wounded by a sharpshooter.

2500|$|The {{offensive}} {{strategy in}} military vogue since the 1870s did not prepare the British army {{for the long}} term needs of a war of attrition but instead focused on the construction of, for example, capital ships. [...] By late 1915, ammunition supplies were so reduced that the Commander in Chief of the British army, John French ordered that <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> not fire more than ten shells in a day. [...] The news of the British army's shortages and the failure of the Gallipoli Campaign contributed to restructuring of the Government to include the Unionist (conservative) members of government. A new Government of National Unity at once appointed David Lloyd George as the new Minister of Munitions, and his department set about building munitions factories throughout the country, including one next to the little village of Birtley in County Durham, just south of Newcastle upon Tyne, commissioning the ship and automobile manufacturer Armstrong-Whitworth of Tyneside to construct and run it and a neighbouring cartridge factory. One large problem arose, however – finding people to work in them, seeing that most British munitions workers were by 1915 enlisted, trained and serving at the various fronts, while most of the female workforce was already in employment in other factories and as landgirls.|$|E
2500|$|On May 29, 1861, a {{converted}} 250 ton paddle-wheel steamer mounting 3 guns, the [...] of the Federal Potomac Flotilla {{under the command}} of Commander James H.

On the following day, May 30, 1861, the Thomas Freeborn returned with the , a 200 ton vessel with 2 guns, and , which was half the size of the Anacostia, and engaged the Confederate batteries for several hours, again with little effect. The largest guns of the squadron were 32-pounders. On June 1, the Thomas Freeborn, Anacostia, Resolute, and the sloop-of-war [...] bombarded the batteries for almost 5 hours, firing over 500 rounds. Captain Lynch reported no deaths or injuries from the second and third days of shelling, only the death of a chicken and a horse. Lynch added that his works sustained some damage, houses in the rear were [...] "knocked about" [...] and the railroad was torn up in three or four places. Lynch said that he returned fire sparingly in order to save ammunition and because he could fire only when the ships came in view and range of his embrasures as <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guns</b> could not be turned. Nonetheless, during the fight both the Thomas Freeborn and the Pawnee took minor damage from the batteries and required repairs. No Federal sailors were seriously wounded or killed.|$|E
