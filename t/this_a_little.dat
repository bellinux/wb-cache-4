It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit.' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{original}} {{performances of}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{the actor who}} played Egeus and the actor who played Philostrate were probably one and the same. This can be gathered through discrepancies between the First Folio and earlier quarto versions of the play. In Act V, scene 1, for example, the quartos say [...] "Call Philostrate" [...] in several places where the 1623 Folio says [...] "Call Egeus". This would be an easy mistake to make if one actor had spoken both parts in this scene. One actor filling both roles explains the jumbled dialogue in this scene. Howard Furness, editor of several Shakespeare editions, interprets <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> differently, saying that Shakespeare may not have originally intended both roles to be played by the same person, but that directors combined the roles to save money. In any case, Act V, scene 1 is the only scene in which both men are present at the same time. In cases where one actor was playing both roles, Egeus' character would probably have filled both roles in this scene, absorbing Philostrate's lines into his own.|$|E

Released on the Sony BMG label Burgundy Records, it peaked at No. 17 on the U.S. Top 200 Album Chart, her highest placing {{on the chart}} since 1983. The songs I'm a Fire, Stamp Your Feet and Fame (The Game) all reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Dance Chart. The ballad Sand on My Feet was released to adult contemporary stations and reached No. 30 on that chart. Summer said, [...] "I wanted this album {{to have a lot}} of different directions on it. I did not want it to be any one baby. I just wanted it to be a sampler of flavors and influences from all over the world. There's a touch of <b>this,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smidgeon of that, a dash of something else, like when you're cooking." ...|$|E
