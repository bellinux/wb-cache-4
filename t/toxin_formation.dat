Citrulline and proline were produced as major fermentation products in media containing high levels of arginine, but in media with basal amounts of arginine these products were produced in lower quantities during growth and were later reassimilated.

Here, structure-based mutagenesis was used to identify non-conserved ANTXR 2 residues responsible for this striking 1. 0 pH unit difference in pH threshold. Residues conserved between ANTXR 2 and ANTXR 1 that influence the ANTXR 2 -associated pH threshold of pore formation were also identified.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus <b>toxin</b> <b>formation</b> in {{hydrated}} batter mixes {{can cause}} consumer illness. This toxin {{in particular is}} a concern because the toxin cannot be destroyed by heating steps that may be performed by the processor or the consumer.

Control Measures S. aureus can enter the process on raw materials. It can also be introduced into foods during processing from unclean hands and insanitary utensils and equipment. The hazard develops when a batter mix is exposed to temperatures favorable for S. aureus growth for sufficient time to permit toxin development. S. aureus toxin does not normally reach levels that will cause food poisoning until the numbers of the pathogen reach 500, 000 to 1, 000, 000 /gram. S. aureus will grow at temperatures as low as 44. 6 °F (7 °C) and at a water activity as low as 0. 83 (additional information on conditions favorable to S. aureus growth are provided in Table A- 1.

This review displays current understanding of the intestinal microbiome impacting on the progression of chronic viral hepatitis caused by HCV- and HBV-infection, as well as changes in bowel microbiocenosis features depending on the duration of chronic process in the liver. It is indicated that chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis progression is accompanied by Bifidobacterium and strains of lactic acid (Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Weissella) number decreasing and overgrowth of opportunistic species such as Enterococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, Enterobactericeae, Candida spp., Clostridia spp. This phenomena caused by PAMPs entry into the bloodstream including various types of toxins playing a role in liver immune inflammation processes progression. Thus patients with HBV and HCV infection are increased the number of CD 4 +, CD 25 + in the blood and liver significantly, FOXP 3 + Treg cell providing an immunosuppressive effect, and the function of specific CD 8 lymphocytes is reduced and insufficient leveling virus significantly. Microbial imbalance has a negative effect on the biosynthesis of bile acids and sterolbiom functioning of our body as a result of changes in the balance between Bacteroides/Firmicutes, overgrowth of pathogenic and opportunistic Enterobacteriaceae, Veillonellaceae, Alcaligeneaceae and Porphyromonadaceae, Clostridium cluster XIVa, Helicobacter spp. and Clostridium difficile. These <b>toxins</b> <b>formation</b> and various carcinogenic metabolites from these strains leads to the inflammation development in the intestines and as a consequence to the progression of the inflammatory process in the liver. In turn, the reduction in the bacteria number producing short-chain fatty acid contributes to intestinal colonization by pathogenic representatives Gracilicutes (Salmonella, Shigella, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli) and Firmicutes (Clostridia), the toxins having a direct toxic effect on the liver. It is examined a little-studied question about a possible cofactor effect of enteric viruses (rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus type 1, Coxsackie virus, ECHO) and bacteria (Shigella, Salmonella, diarrheagenic E. coli, C. jejuni) on the progression of chronic hepatitis.

40|$|Anthrax toxin (ATx) is {{composed}} of the binary exotoxins lethal toxin (LTx) and edema toxin (ETx). They have separate effector proteins (edema factor and lethal factor) but have the same binding protein, protective antigen (PA). PA is the primary immunogen in the current licensed vaccine anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA [BioThrax]). AVA confers protective immunity by stimulating production of ATx-neutralizing antibodies, which could block the intoxication process at several steps (binding of PA to the target cell surface, furin cleavage, <b>toxin</b> complex <b>formation,</b> and binding/translocation of ATx into the cell). To evaluate ATx neutral-ization by anti-AVA antibodies, we developed two low-temperature LTx neutralization activity (TNA) assays that distinguish antibody blocking before and after binding of PA to target cells (noncomplexed [NC] and receptor-bound [RB] TNA assays). These assays were used to investigate anti-PA antibody responses in AVA-vaccinated rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that survived an aerosol challenge with Bacillus anthracis Ames spores. Results showed that macaque anti-AVA sera neutralized LTx in vitro, even when PA was prebound to cells.

The positive evidence consists in the demonstration that lactic acid, even in dilutions comparable to the amounts that can be formed in living muscle, can produce a similar or identical waxy transformation of the striated muscle fibers, both in vitro and in vivo; and also the observation that muscles stimulated to exhaustion, under which condition lactic acid is known to accumulate in the muscle, show microscopically changes identical with those of Zenker's waxy degeneration...|$|R

Increased contents of antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GSH) were seen in both N and P-deficient conditions, suggesting the presence of excess amount of free radical generation caused by nutrient stress. The amount of SOD and GSH continued to increase even after the nutrient was reintroduced and a strong correlation was seen between the MDA and enzyme activities, indicating the robust effort of rebalancing the redox system in Microcystis cells.

40|$|SUMMARY: Several cations {{have been}} shown to affect protein and {{porphyrin}} for-mation by the G 12 / 6 strain of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Cobaltous ion (Co++), at concentrations only slightly inhibiting growth, caused a marked inhibition of <b>toxin</b> <b>formation.</b> This effect was not produced by vitamin B,, or annulled by increases of cysteine or histidine concentration. Only a small proportion of added CO++, at concentrations above 0. 2 pg. /ml., was found in washed organisms, and the effect of Co++ was more marked than that of Fe++when based on the weight of metal in the organisms. No appreciable proportion of the Co++ existed as a porphyrin complex. The growth inhibition caused by 5 pg. Co++/ml. was annulled by 0. 6 pg. Fe++/ml.

40|$|AbstractThe Charnoly body (CB) is a pleomorphic, electron-dense, multilamellar, preapoptotic, {{mitochondrial}} biomarker of cell injury. Nutritional {{stress and}} environmental <b>toxins</b> induce CB <b>formation</b> in highly vulnerable developing neurons because of compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics; however, nutritional rehabilitation, physiological zinc supplementation, and metallothioneins (MTs) inhibit CB formation. Accumulation of CBs {{at the junction}} of the axon hillock may impair the axoplasmic transport of ions, neurotransmitters, neurotropic factors, and enzymes at the synaptic terminals. Therefore, drugs may be developed to inhibit CB formation in neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. In addition, nonspecific induction of CB formation in hyperproliferating cells with cancer chemotherapy causes as adverse effects alopecia, myelosuppression, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, cardiovascular toxicity, and infertility. Hence, drugs may be developed to induce cancer stem cell-specific CB formation to cure multidrug-resistant malignancies and chronic infections. Natural abundance and genetic susceptibility of mitochondrial DNA qualify CB as an early, unique, and sensitive universal biomarker of clinical significance...|$|R
40|$|Most {{bacterial}} genomes contain {{different types}} of toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems. The ω-ε-ζ proteinaceous type II TA cassette from the streptococcal pSM 19035 plasmid {{is a member of}} the ε/ζ family, which is commonly found in multiresistance plasmids and chromosomes of various human pathogens. Regulation of type II TA systems relies on the proteolysis of antitoxin proteins. Under normal conditions, the Epsilon antidote neutralizes the Zeta <b>toxin</b> through the <b>formation</b> of a tight complex. In this study, we show, using both in vivo and in vitro analyses, that the ClpXP protease is responsible for Epsilon antitoxin degradation. Using in vivo studies, we examined the stability of the plasmids with active or inactive ω-ε-ζ TA cassettes in B. subtilis mutants that were defective for different proteases. Using in vitro assays, the degradation of purified His 6 -Epsilon by the His 6 -LonBs, ClpPBs and ClpXBs proteases from B. subtilis was analyzed. Additionally, we showed that purified Zeta toxin protects the Epsilon protein from rapid ClpXP-catalyzed degradation...|$|R
