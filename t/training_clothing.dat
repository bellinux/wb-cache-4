Trainers also act as brokers, or agents, to create a link between the activities of their customers and the purchase of extra goods and services that their customers need for particular activities such as shoes for specific <b>training,</b> <b>clothing,</b> or home equipment. Trainers are also motivators of the goods and services. They are required to have technical skills in order to provide professional fitness services to their customers and they need to have good communication skills meant to persuade their customers to do more in the fitness institution, which in turn means purchasing more goods and services. Finally, personal trainers also act as entrepreneurs: creating a large network of customers for different goods and services in order to produce profits.

During the experiment specially prepared specimens were loaded with the punch up to tearing. They were loaded also with the same punch for sustained creep process. Creep tests were carried out with dry and wet specimens. Mechanical stability of textile materials was evaluated by relative values of creep test parameters. For the evaluation of these parameters the special test unit created at Kaunas University of Technology was used. The objects of the investigation were woven fabrics from cotton – PES blended yarns, with camouflage printing typical for military clothing. Two samples of tested materials were water repellent. The water repellent treatment improved mechanical stability of textile material, so water repellent fabrics are in preference to outdoor <b>training</b> <b>clothing...</b>|$|E

Shortly before graduation, he founded his label and became the go-to designer for many performance artists.
