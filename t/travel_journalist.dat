[...] The bridge shook whenever a train trundled over it, although this had no effect on its integrity. [...] When the frequency of passing trains was high, the trembling was noticeable to travelers on the lower deck and proved uncomfortable to some; writer Mark Twain noted, [...] "You drive over to Suspension Bridge and divide your misery between the chances of smashing down two hundred feet into the river below, and the chances of having a railway-train overhead smashing down onto you. [...] Either possibility is discomforting taken by itself, but, mixed together, they amount in the aggregate to positive unhappiness." [...] Despite such commentaries, thousands of people crossed over the bridge safely every day.|$|E

40|$|Online {{resources}} are increasingly facilitating research for those traveling for business or leisure. Professionally produced articles and guides are now consulted alongside TripAdvisor, blogs, wikis, and other non-professional sources. This research seeks {{to understand the}} role of <b>travel</b> <b>journalists,</b> to explore their occupational ideology and how they distinguish themselves from other content creators. Through content analysis and interviews with English-speaking journalist and bloggers who focus on Paris as a destination, researchers {{were able to identify}} an ideology specific to professional <b>travel</b> <b>journalists.</b> Ultimately they do not do anything that amateur writers cannot, and often rely on their branded publication to give them credibility. <b>Travel</b> <b>journalists</b> do, however, adopt some practices inherent to bloggers interviewed, including moving towards more personal writing and lowering reporting standards, while resisting social media. While in a moment of identity crises, <b>travel</b> <b>journalists</b> still differentiate themselves from bloggers, further research will reveal if this phenomenon is unique to a highly mediatized destination like Paris...|$|R

This study reports {{the findings of a}} representative survey of Australian <b>travel</b> <b>journalists,</b> focusing on their views of PR. Results show that <b>travel</b> <b>journalists</b> are wary of PR, although they believe they can be relatively immune from its influence and see some PR activities as quite useful. Cluster analysis identifies three distinct groups based on their views of PR, which range from a positive attitude to strong criticism. Their backgrounds and differences are explored, pointing to gender, job status, and background in mainstream journalism as main determinants for differences...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{significant}} changes in mainstream journalism in recent decades, journalistic fields beyond the news have been little explored. In an attempt {{to contribute to a}} deeper understanding of such fields, this article examines the role perceptions of 85 Australian <b>travel</b> <b>journalists.</b> By viewing <b>travel</b> journalism as a distinct field of practice that is affected by a unique mix of influences, this study identifies five dimensions of practitioners’ role perceptions. These relate to travel journalists’ views of themselves as Cultural Mediators, Critics, Entertainers, Information Providers and Travellers. In addition, the study examines in some depth the ethical standards of <b>travel</b> <b>journalists.</b> Determinants of these views and standards are explored. The study argues that, in light of travel journalists’ increasingly important role in reporting about foreign places, more remains to be done to promote travel stories that show a deeper understanding of other cultures and which contain a more critical appraisal of destinations...|$|R
