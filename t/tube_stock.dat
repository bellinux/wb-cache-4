5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> is permanently stabled on the branch. This train can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E

25|$|In January 2003, the Waterloo & City {{was closed}} for over three weeks for safety checks after a major {{derailment}} on the Central line, which required all 1992 <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> trains to be modified.

25|$|Replacement of the 1967 {{rolling stock}} began in July 2009 {{as part of}} Transport for London's 5-year £10billion {{redevelopment}} project. A new fleet of 47 eight-car trains called 2009 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> were built by Bombardier Transportation. The first prototypes began testing in 2008. The main fleet began to be introduced in 2009 and went into squadron service - {{the majority of the}} trains in service - in 2010. The last of the 1967 stock trains ran on 30 June 2011, after which the whole service was provided by 2009 stock.|$|E
25|$|The stock outlasted {{many former}} British Rail EMUs: the Scottish Class 303 managed 43 years, the Class 309 Clacton Express units 38 years and British Rail Class 312 only 28 years. The former Southern Region 4CIG and 4CEP managed 46 and 49 years respectively. The stock {{was one of}} Britain's longest-serving types of train, {{although}} falling short of the service length of the ex-1938 Stock still in use on the Isle of Wight around 77 years after construction, or the 81 years of Glasgow Subway rolling stock between 1896 and 1977. A Stock may be outlasted by the InterCity 125 HSTs and the Bakerloo line 1972 <b>tube</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{trains are}} part of a £3.4 billion {{contract}} awarded by the now-defunct Metronet to Bombardier to supply new trains featuring Automatic Train Operation and signalling for the Victoria line and other deep tube lines. This upgrade, when completed in 2012, is expected to provide improved reliability, an 8% decrease in journey times between stations, and a 16% overall decrease in journey times. This {{is due in part to}} the trains having better performance than the 1967 Stock they replaced - they have a higher top speed of , a faster maximum acceleration of , a normal service deceleration of , and an emergency brake deceleration of , the same as the 1992 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock.</b> At peak times, 43 trains should be in service, an increase of six over the 1967 Stock.|$|E

25|$|Britain's {{railways}} were nationalised on 1 January 1948, and London Transport {{placed under}} the authority of the British Transport Commission (BTC). The BTC prioritised the reconstruction of the main line railways over the maintenance of the Underground and most of the unfinished plans of the 1935–40 New Works Programme were shelved or postponed. For the tube lines new cars (1949 Stock) were built to run with the 1938 stock. Some of the cars on the District line were in need of replacement, and in 1953 an unpainted aluminium train (R Stock) entered service, and this became the standard for new trains, and was followed by 1959 <b>tube</b> <b>stock.</b> After experiments with an AEC lightweight diesel multiple unit in 1952, steam trains were removed from the Central line following the electrification of the Epping–Ongar section in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the line}} was opened, it was served by a fleet of [...] eight-car trains of 1967 <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock</b> trains. In the early {{planning}} stages of the line an articulated type of rolling stock was considered, but the idea was dropped because of difficulties in transferring the stock to Acton Works for heavy overhauls. With the demise of Acton Works this no longer applies, and the new 2009 <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> has a wider profile and slightly longer carriages, which preclude it running on other deep-level tube lines. The 1967 stock were later supplemented {{by a number of}} cars of 1972 Mark I <b>Tube</b> <b>Stock,</b> transferred from the Northern line and converted to be compatible with the 1967 stock. Ultimately there were 43 trains, each made up of two four-car units.|$|E

50|$|During the {{development}} of the SA80, a bullpup conversion was made of an AR-18 and a Stoner 63 at Enfield due to the fact they could be used with stocks folded/without stocks which allowed the bullpup conversion and were later chambered in the experimental 4.85x49mm round. A bullpup conversion of the AR-15 was previously considered but the buffer <b>tube</b> in <b>stock</b> prevented the idea.|$|R
50|$|The Drifter’s design drew a {{positive}} response from reviewers who liked the Indian Chief’s deeply valanced classic fender skirts {{as opposed to the}} more traditional motorcycle fender style. Rear air shock absorbers, original swingarm arrangement, and progressive front suspension made it a comfortable cruiser capable of covering great distances comfortably. Tire <b>tubes</b> were <b>stock,</b> as Kawasaki followed Cobra’s lead and used chromed spoke wheels to complete the nostalgic look it was seeking to recreate.|$|R
2500|$|LUL {{has invited}} Alstom, Bombardier and Siemens {{to develop a}} new concept of lightweight, low-energy, semi-articulated train for the deep-level lines, {{provisionally}} called [...] "Evo" [...] (for 'evolution'). So far only Siemens has publicised an outline design, which would feature air-conditioning and would also have battery power enabling the train to run on to the next station if third and fourth rail power were lost. It would have a lower floor and 11% higher passenger capacity than the present <b>tube</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In the 1970s, {{the track}} and the rolling stock used on this line and the North London Line were changed to use a {{modified}} version of the BR standard third rail system, with the fourth rail (now bonded to the running rail used for returning traction current) left in place on the sections of line shared with LU Bakerloo line trains. North of Harrow & Wealdstone, now the limit of LU operation, the fourth rail has in most places been dropped onto the sleepers and remains bonded, thus leaving the resistance of the current return path unaltered. The fourth rail remains in the normal position from Queens Park to Kilburn High Road up platform, where a trailing crossover between those two stations is maintained in use to allow reversal of Bakerloo line trains unable to gain access to London Underground at Queens Park, due to planned work or other reasons. [...] The line is currently electrified (like all shared lines) using the standard compromise voltage of 660V. [...] This falls comfortably within the lower permanent voltage limit for the Capitalstar stock (500V) and the upper permanent voltage limit for the 1972 <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> (760V).|$|E
50|$|The KAC PDW uses a {{completely}} side-folding stock, unlike the M16 and M4 designs which have their main operating spring in a <b>tube</b> in the <b>stock,</b> {{and therefore can}} only partially telescope, and not fold sideways at all.|$|R

While with the added suppressor it is 3-6 inches longer than the MP5-SD, the weight is nearly identical unloaded.|$|R
2500|$|L10 - This Bo-Bo {{locomotive}} {{was built}} from two Hampstead Gate Stock driving motors. It was constructed at Acton Works in 1930 from cars 1 and 3, originally built in 1907 by the American Car and Foundry Company. The motor ends of both cars were joined back-to-back, and this design {{was the first}} of several similar vehicles constructed from old stock. The vehicle was fitted with adjustable couplers at each end, which could be raised or lowered to cope with <b>tube</b> <b>stock</b> or sub-surface stock. Because of the layout of Acton Works, only the couplings on the southern end, known as the [...] "Acton" [...] end (as opposed to the [...] "Ealing" [...] end), were used, and those at the Ealing end were gradually cannibalised for spares for the Acton end. It was subsequently rebuilt, with flat panels on the sides, rather than the louvred ones of the Hampstead stock, and lost its distinctive clerestory roof. The GE69 motors were replaced with the superior GE212 motors, which included interpoles and roller bearings. It survived until 1978, when it was cut up on site by Cashmores.|$|E
2500|$|Prism Rail was {{purchased}} by National Express in September 2000, and the franchise was rebranded as c2c once the Class 357/0 units were in service. The second batch of 28 Class 357/2 units were ordered {{at a cost of}} £92 million by c2c in 2000 primarily to replace the remaining Class 312 units. Construction started in 2001, and they were delivered between September 2001 and May 2002. They are owned by Angel Trains and leased by c2c, at an initial cost of £900 a day (including rental and maintenance). Due to the rebranding, they have a white livery with grey doors, and are internally branded to the c2c purple colour scheme with magenta handrails, magenta stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors with c2c branding: [...] "culture2club2commuters2culture2club2", and a light grey linoleum floor with white, dark grey and light purple flecks.

40|$|Fluorescence spectroscopy. Stock {{solutions}} of {{wild type}} and LUSHF 121 A were diluted into 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6. 5, and 2. 8 ml aliquots transferred into borosilicate glass <b>tubes.</b> <b>Stock</b> solutions of different concentrations of 11 -cis vaccenyl acetate (Nu-Chek Prep, Elysian, MN) were prepared in 100 % DMSO. 2 ml {{of each of}} these stock solutions was then added to an aliquot of the protein to give a final DMSO concentration in each sample of 0. 083 % (v/v). Samples were equilibrated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 3 hours prior to data collection. Fluorescence experiments were performed on a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog 3 spectrometer using a stirred quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm in a thermostatically regulated cell holder at 25 °C. Spectra were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and the emission was monitored over the range of 300 - 400 nm. Data were collected at 1 nm intervals with a 0. 5 second integration time. The band pass of both the emission and excitation monochromators was set to 4 nm. Data from three scans were averaged for each sample, and three independent experiments were performed for each complex. Data were corrected by subtraction of buffer containing VA, and were plotted as emission intensity at 340 nm vs [VA]. The resulting curves (9 for each complex) were fit simultaneously to the following equation to account for ligand depletion using Pris...|$|R
