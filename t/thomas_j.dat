5|$|The 1852 {{publication}} of Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe was the best-selling {{novel of the}} 19th century and the second best-selling book of that century, following the Bible. It is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. The writer of the adapted scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The director of the film was Barry O'Neil, whose real name was <b>Thomas</b> <b>J.</b> McCarthy. He would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{of the film is}} not known, but two possibles exist. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of <b>Thomas</b> <b>J.</b> McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company until moving to the Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. Q. David Bowers says that the attribution of these early directors often comes from a collection of contemporary publications or interviews.|$|E
