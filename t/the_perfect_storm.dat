5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Bob, {{which at the time}} was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After brushing the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Long Island in New York, the hurricane made landfall on Rhode Island. It caused $1.5billion in damage (1991USD), mostly in Massachusetts, and 17fatalities. The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette, which reached peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) near Bermuda. It passed near the island but did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Fabian was the only tropical storm to move over or near Cuba or Florida, producing heavy rainfall but no damage. Hurricane Grace, the final named storm of the season, provided the energy that {{led to the development of}} a powerful nor'easter known as <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm.</b> Originating from an extratropical storm, <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> intensified while moving westward toward New England, leaving $200million in damage and causing coastal damage from Puerto Rico to Florida and northward through Canada. It later transitioned into a hurricane over the Gulf Stream, finally dissipating over Nova Scotia on November2.|$|E
5|$|October 31, 1991– The 1991 Halloween Nor'easter, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm,</b> causes strong waves of up to 30feet (9m) in height. High tides along the shore were only surpassed by the 1944 hurricane, while {{significant}} bay flooding occurred. Strong waves and persistent intense winds cause extreme beach erosion, amounting to 13.5million cubic feet (383,000m3) of sand lost in one location. In all, damage amounts to $90million (1991USD, $142million 2008USD), though no deaths occur in the state.|$|E

5|$|Aside from tidal {{flooding}} along rivers, the storm's {{effects were}} primarily concentrated along the coast. A buoy {{off the coast}} of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of , the highest ever recorded in the province's offshore waters. In the middle of the storm, Andrea Gail sank, killing her crew of six and inspiring the book, and later movie, <b>The</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm.</b> Off the shore of New York's Long Island, an Air National Guard helicopter ran out of fuel and crashed; four members of its crew were rescued, and one was killed. Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island. High waves swept two people to their deaths, one in Rhode Island and one in Puerto Rico, and another person was blown off a bridge to his death. The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm's duration caused little impact, limited to power outages and slick roads; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> {{originated}} from a cold front that exited {{the east coast}} of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and the warmth and humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's passage, the Long Island Lighting Company used 165workers {{to restore}} the power outages on Long Island. In Connecticut, state {{officials}} deployed about 200trucks to remove debris on roads. The Massachusetts National Guard was activated to assist in relief efforts. In Rhode Island, a man was killed while repairing damage caused by Bob. Beaches in the state re-opened by {{five days after the}} storm. The hurricane mixed the waters in Long Island Sound and prevented the algae bloom that happened in previous summers. In the days after Bob, the Commonwealth Electric Company brought electricians from outside the company and put their own workers on 16‑hour shifts to restore power across Massachusetts. Most Massachusetts residents, excluding those living on Cape Cod, had their power restored within five days. The hurricane struck {{toward the end of the}} summer, which significantly impacted the tourism season already in the midst of a recession. The New England coast was affected by a powerful nor'easter known as <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> about two months after the hurricane struck the region. Some locations experienced worse damage from the October storm than from Bob.|$|E

25|$|Circular {{migration}} is also connected to health issues around the world.

Several factors seem to create <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>storm</b> for the spread of diseases such as HIV. Many times, migrants are young, isolated, lonely, and have cash, which may lead them to sex and drugs. Evidence supports the idea that circular migrants become ill while working in urban areas and return home to die with their families. In addition to their personal elevated risk of contracting and dying from STDs, they are also at risk of spreading the diseases to their home communities upon return. Circular migrants make up a substantial proportion of those dying from HIV/TB, and that number continues to increase dramatically.|$|E

The storm damaged the boardwalk in Ocean City, and other coastal towns had damage to bulkheads and sea walls. About 3,000people were left without power in Somers Point. The storm affected 4,000houses, of which 76 had severe damage. Overall damage in the state was estimated at $45million (1992USD), of which around 30% was public parks and buildings. However, damage was less than that from <b>the</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> in the previous October. About 80people evacuated to emergency shelters in South Jersey, and 95residents of a nursing home in Atlantic City evacuated inland. Due to the storm damage, then-governor Jim Florio declared a state of emergency in Cape May, Atlantic, Ocean, and Monmouth counties. Due to the successive impacts of nor'easters in October and January, the state government provided money to restore beaches.|$|E
500|$|The Halloween Storm of 1991 left {{significant}} damage {{along the east}} coast of the United States, primarily in Massachusetts and southern New Jersey. Across seven states, damage totaled over $200 million (1991 USD). Over a three-day period, the storm lashed the northeastern United States with high waves, causing damage to beachfront properties from North Carolina to Maine. The coastal flooding damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and businesses and closed roads and airports. In addition, high winds left about 38,000 people without power. The total without power was much less than for Hurricane Bob two months prior, and was fairly low due to little rainfall and the general lack of leaves on trees. Overall there were thirteen confirmed deaths, including six on board Andrea Gail, a swordfishing boat. The vessel departed Gloucester, Massachusetts, for the waters off Nova Scotia. After encountering high seas {{in the middle of the}} storm, the vessel made its last radio contact late on October 28 about [...] northeast of Sable Island. Andrea Gail sank while returning to Gloucester, her debris washing ashore over the subsequent weeks. The crew of six was presumed killed after a Coast Guard search was unable to find them. The storm and the boat's sinking became the center-piece for Sebastian Junger's best-selling non-fiction book <b>The</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> (1997), which was adapted to a major Hollywood film in 2000 as <b>The</b> <b>Perfect</b> <b>Storm</b> starring George Clooney.|$|E

Extensive coastal flooding occurred {{along the coast of}} the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., with effects as far north as Newfoundland and as far south as Jamaica. The nor'easter eventually transitioned into another hurricane that made landfall in Nova Scotia. A ship known as the Andrea Gail was lost, along with her six crew members, during the storm.
