5|$|On 25 May 1933, a {{passenger}} train was derailed at , London, {{coming to rest}} foul of an adjacent line. Locomotive No. 1618, hauling {{a passenger}} train, was in a side-long collision with it. Five {{people were killed and}} 35 were injured. The cause of the accident was the failure to implement a speed restriction on a section of <b>track</b> <b>that</b> was under maintenance.|$|E
50|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{gets its}} name from three major railroad tracks which form a rough triangle and define its boundaries. The northeastern side of the Iron Triangle is the Union Pacific Railroad/BART <b>tracks</b> <b>that</b> run beside Carlson Boulevard, Espee Avenue, Portola Avenue, and 13th Street. The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway <b>tracks</b> <b>that</b> parallel Richmond Parkway/Garrard Boulevard form the northwest side of the triangle. Normally, the southern side of the triangle {{is considered to be}} the now abandoned Santa Fe <b>tracks</b> <b>that</b> ran between Ohio and Chanslor Avenues and are currently being developed as the Richmond Greenway. Because those tracks have been removed, the southern boundary of the neighborhood is now occasionally considered to be the BNSF <b>tracks</b> <b>that</b> run just south of Interstate 580.|$|R

5|$|The Toy Train minigame {{involves}} {{laying a}} railroad track across a complex game board. The toy train must pass through every train station and reach a defined end point, and in harder levels, {{it must be}} timed to avoid cars and other trains.

5|$|Unlike many {{high-end}} California Thoroughbred trainers, {{who usually}} are headquartered at Santa Anita Park, the Shermans kept horses at Hollywood Park, {{but when it}} closed in December 2013, Los Alamitos Race Course picked {{up some of the}} Thoroughbred races and trainers who had stabled horses at Hollywood Park, including Sherman. The success of California Chrome, who was conditioned there over the <b>track</b> <b>that</b> had been recently expanded to accommodate longer races, created good publicity for Los Alamitos.|$|E

5|$|After Commonwealth {{disappointment}} on home turf, Chambers {{won gold}} medals in the 100m and 4×100m relay at the 2002 European Championships in Munich, setting a championship record of 9.96s. Chambers recorded a time of 9.94s at the Weltklasse Zürich meeting, again beating world record holder Greene. He finished the season by equalling Linford Christie's European record at the 2002 IAAF Grand Prix Final. His run of 9.87s with a maximum allowable wind of +2.0m/s left him second to Tim Montgomery, who set a world record of 9.78s. Chambers received the 2002 European Athlete of the Year Trophy for his achievements on the <b>track</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda <b>Track</b> <b>that</b> threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the <b>track</b> <b>that</b> dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E

5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one <b>track</b> <b>that</b> made it onto the final album—"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E
5|$|Further {{controversy}} ensued at the Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit. The circuit {{had been}} paved {{just days before}} the race, creating a <b>track</b> <b>that</b> many of the racers felt was unsafe due to diesel fuel seeping to the surface. Roberts and the new championship points leader, Virginio Ferrari, instigated a riders' revolt and refused to race. Once again, the FIM responded by suspending Roberts and Ferrari. The FIM later reduced this to another probation. The event highlighted the animosity between Roberts and the FIM concerning track safety. Roberts further irritated the FIM when he began talking to the press about forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM's monopoly.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's funeral train left Long Branch on {{the same}} special <b>track</b> <b>that</b> brought him there, {{traveling}} over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags. His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial. More than 70,000 citizens, some waiting over three hours, passed by Garfield's coffin as his body lay in state in Washington; later, on September 25, 1881, in Cleveland, more than 150,000—a number equal to {{the entire population of}} that city—likewise paid their respects. His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built.|$|E
