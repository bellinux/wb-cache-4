The properties to be analyzed are: the dispersion of the returns, i. e. the volatility of the stock prices, the degree of leptokurtosis in the returns, and finally, the serial correlation in returns. The comparison of a low turnover with a high <b>turnover</b> <b>period</b> <b>for</b> the Helsinki Stock Exchange reveals that <b>for</b> the high <b>turnover</b> <b>period</b> the leptokurtosis of the return distributions is lower, as expected. Contrary to expectations stock price volatility is higher.

The fair presentation is ensured through the compliance with the {{principle of}} prudence. This principle means that, at the balance sheet day the entity takes into account the expected risks and losses related to assets and liabilities; and that are known at the balance sheet date. The expected risks and losses are reflected in the accounting through provisions and adjusting entries. The adjusting entries are created when the transitional impairment of assets takes place.

40|$|Abstract Why solar {{companies}} preferred {{vertical integration}} of whole value chain? Major solar companies have built internally strong vertical integration of entire PV value chain. We raise a question whether such integration increases the corporate value and whether market situation affects the result. To test these questions, we conducted multi-variant analysis where characteristic factors mainly affect the corporate value {{measured in terms}} of Tobin’Q, based on the financial and non-financial data of PV companies listed in US stock market between 2005 and 2010. We hypothesize that since integration increases the overall efficiency but decreases the flexibility to adjust to various market situation, the combined effect of the efficiency gain and the flexibility loss ultimately determines the sign of integration effect on the corporate vale. We infer that the combined effect will be influenced heavily by business cycle, as in boom market (Seller's market) the efficiency gain may be larger than the flexibility loss and vice versa in bust market. We test whether the sign of combined effect changes after the year of 2009 and which factors influence most the sign. Year of 2009 is known as the year when market shifted from Seller’s to Buyer’s market. We show that 1) integration increases corporate value in general but after 2009 integration significantly decreases the value, 2) the ratios such as Production/Total Cost, Cash <b>turnover</b> <b>period</b> chosen <b>for</b> reversal of the flexibility measure are negatively affect Tobin's Q and especially stronger after 2009. This shows the flexibility improves corporate value and stronger in the recess period (Buyer's market). These results imply that solar company should set up integration strategy considering the tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility and the impact of the business cycle on both factors. Strategy only based on the price competitiveness determined in boom time can bring undesirable outcomes to the company. In addition, Strategic alliances in some value chains as a flexible bondage should be taken in account as complementary choice to the rigid integration...|$|R

40|$|We {{carried out}} a new and {{sensitive}} search for long-period variability in the prototype of the Mira class of long-period pulsating variables, o Ceti (Mira A), the closest and brightest Mira variable. We conducted this search using an unbroken light curve from 1902 to the present assembled from the visual data archives of five major variable star observing organizations from around the world. We applied several time-series analysis techniques to search for two specific kinds of variability: long secondary periods (LSPs) longer than the dominant pulsation period of ∼ 333 days, and long-term period variation in the dominant pulsation period itself. The data quality is sufficient to detect coherent periodic variations with photometric amplitudes of 0. 05 mag or less. We do not find evidence for coherent LSPs in o Ceti to a limit of 0. 1 mag, where the amplitude limit is set by intrinsic, stochastic, low-frequency variability of approximately 0. 1 mag. We marginally detect a slight modulation of the pulsation period similar in timescale as that observed in the Miras with meandering periods, but with a much lower period amplitude of ± 2 days. However, we do find clear evidence of a low-frequency power law component in the Fourier spectrum of o Ceti’s long-term light curve. The amplitude of this stochastic variability is approximately 0. 1 mag at a period of 1000 days, and it exhibits a <b>turnover</b> <b>for</b> <b>periods</b> longer than this.

In contrast, compensation schemes based only on realized cash flows can be optimal only under exceptional circumstances.
