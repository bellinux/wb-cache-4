Soon after his reign ended, Ottomans officials were appointed to govern. The Ridwan period is considered Gaza's last golden age during Ottoman rule and the city gradually dwindled after they were removed from office.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII chose many centrist cabinets, as {{he wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> the populace, much {{to the dismay of}} his brother, the ultra-royalist Count of Artois. Louis always dreaded the day he would die, believing that his brother, and heir, Artois, would abandon the centrist {{government}} for an ultra-royalist autocracy, which would not bring favourable results.|$|E

Their leader, Histadrut Labour Federation chairman Amir Peretz, has many similarities to Levy, {{with one of}} the few differences being that he had broken from Labour and not the Likud. One month later the rightist National Union-Israel Beiteinu quit the coalition, claiming that Sharon's restraint policy was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>appeasing</b> the PLO.|$|R

5|$|The new {{government}} sought <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> the protesters by reopening {{the border with}} Czechoslovakia. This, however, merely resulted in the resumption of the mass exodus through Hungary via Czechoslovakia. On 8November 1989, with huge demonstrations continuing across the country, the entire Politbüro resigned and a new, more moderate Politbüro was appointed under Krenz's continued leadership.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>appease</b> {{those who}} {{considered}} her sex {{to be the}} most serious obstacle, Maria Theresa assumed masculine titles. Thus, in nomenclature, Maria Theresa was archduke and king; normally, however, she was styled as queen.

5|$|Bud Carson was Tech's {{defensive}} coordinator in 1966. His job was <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> the massive Tech fan base Bobby Dodd had accumulated. Carson {{was not the}} charismatic leader like Dodd but rather a strategy man that enjoyed intense game planning. Carson's most notable achievements included recruiting Tech's first ever African American scholarship athlete and being the first Tech head coach to be fired.|$|E
5|$|Despite Nerva's {{measures}} to remain {{popular with the}} Senate and the Roman people, support for Domitian remained strong in the army, which had called for his deification immediately after the assassination.

5|$|In order <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> {{the people}} of Rome an {{estimated}} 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or congiaria, throughout Domitian's reign. The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which {{had been reduced to}} a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the Capitoline Games, a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays, chariot racing, and competitions for oratory, music and acting.|$|E
5000|$|When the English Parliament {{originally}} enacted blasphemy laws, it {{was with}} a view <b>to</b> <b>appeasing</b> an angry God who was irritated by despicable literature and who was causing plagues and fires to occur in London. That was the historical reason for the law. The Law Commission in England suggested that there were two types of situation where what had previously been characterised as blasphemous material might generate a public interest in its prohibition. The first is where there is incitement to hatred and the second is where there is simply an excessive offence to religious sensibilities. The term [...] "blasphemy" [...] does not relate to either of these. It is, therefore, a misdescription of a changed law.|$|R

40|$|In {{striving for}} sustainability, {{contemporary}} corporations {{are faced with}} a multitude of stakeholders, all vying for their piece of the corporate sustainability pie. In adhering to such diverse demands, the effective communication of corporate sustainability information becomes crucial. This paper reflects on key metaphysical principles in respect of aspects that can contribute, or perhaps detract, from effective corporate communication, and then especially within the context of contemporary corporate sustainability reporting. The paper concludes that the primary modal aspects as per the Dutch philosopher, Dooyeweerd, can play a very important role in effecting corporate sustainability reporting. As such, this will not only contribute <b>to</b> <b>appeasing</b> diverse stakeholder requirements, but will also indirectly support corporate sustainability initiatives.

5|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of players have been called in top-class matches — Test matches, One Day Internationals and {{domestic}} first-class matches — invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers.

5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.|$|E
5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his desperate attempt <b>to</b> <b>appease</b> the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, {{in combination with}} his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E

40|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{purported to}} play an important role in face processing, yet the specificity of its activation to face stimuli and the relative contribution of identity and expression to its activation are unknown. In the current study, neural activity in the amygdala was recorded as monkeys passively viewed images of monkey faces, human faces, and objects on a computer monitor. Comparable proportions of neurons responded selectively to images from each category. Neural responses to monkey faces were further examined to determine whether face identity or facial expression drove the face-selective responses. The majority of these neurons (64 %) responded both to identity and facial expression, suggesting that these parameters are processed jointly in the amygdala. Large fractions of neurons, however, showed pure identity-selective or expression-selective responses. Neurons were selective for a particular facial expression by either increasing or decreasing their firing rate compared with the firing rates elicited by the other expressions. Responses <b>to</b> <b>appeasing</b> faces were often marked by significant decreases of firing rates, whereas responses to threatening faces were strongly associated with increased firing rate. Thus global activation in the amygdala might be larger to threatening faces than <b>to</b> neutral or <b>appeasing</b> faces...|$|R
